22	How to Keep Your Posts from Getting Removed	You've posted something brilliant on the sub, and you can't wait for it to get comments. But after a few hours, your inbox is empty. You go back to the post and find that it's been REMOVED!!! Ye mods, WHY?!?\n\nHere's how to keep your posts from getting removed:\n\n* Make sure your point is clear. If you're asking a question or asking for advice, make sure your readers know what you're asking. \n* If it's a meme, you **always** have to explain why you're posting it. Even if it seems super obvious.\n* If you have to ask, "Does anyone else __?", they probably do. If you have to ask, "Is this an ENTP thing?", it's probably not. If you're asking for advice, just say what the problem is and ask how to solve it. If people can relate to your problem, then they'll comment. No need to ask if anyone relates.\n	\nIn general, the best posts encourage discussion and challenge us to think critically.\n\n…And when in doubt, read the rules. They're on the sidebar.
24	Explain a meme? Ew. What a good way to kill the fun of a meme.
15	This is really heavy-handed and completely tone-deaf for ENTPs who rebel against frivolous rules.  \n\n\nThe description of the group reads, *"Home of the ENTPs, as described by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)."*  It doesn't say anything about a specific purpose like advice-seeking.  Let the people post what they want as long as it's related.  Just my two cents.  
8	Wow, entp sub is quite strict. 
7	There's no way an entp would institute that many rules. 
7	Who actually wants these rules? Absolutely nobody, that's who. 
6	Y u do dis
3	God, I feel here like on r/istj 😅
7	Good luck! I think it’s great to have reminders of rules so quality content can improve! 
2	Can you create a flair that says 'memes'
2	  **she-NTJ more like it!!!!!** 
2	Your rules can be summarized as Ti = good, Ne = bad. Excluding the output of our dominant function is both illogical and toxic. ENTPs need to play as well as think.

16	INFJ with ENTP best friend, how can I support you?	Hey so i’m new to this subreddit but I really need your guys help. I’m an INFJ (F) and have recently (past month) become REALLY close with this ENTP (F). The more i’ve begun to talk to her and the more she begins to trust me, she has started opening up a lot more. \n\nI’ll keep it short but from what I can gather I believe she has (or had) depression and has cut herself in the past. I feel the main overarching problem is she feels misunderstood and she wants someone to care and understand her even when she may not understand why she feels the way she does. I think the people in her life have been shitty and have betrayed her so she’s reluctant to open up and talk to people. Lastly, she thinks she’s an awful person, that how she thinks and feels is “bad”, that everyone thinks she’s so mean (which isn’t the case). I CAN SEE she really cares about the people around her AND THAT SHE IS AN AMAZING PERSON but she can’t see herself that way. \n\nShe’s kind of lost all hope on trying to feel better because “nothing works”. No one listens to her. She keeps saying that “nothing changes” no matter who she opens up to. She’s rejected the idea of going to therapy because she doesn’t want to open up to a stranger and she feels stupid. \n\nIt really really hurts me to see her like this. All I want to know from you guys is how can I support her through all of this, how can I help her trust me and get her to know that I won’t betray her and lastly,what should I suggest to help her deal with her problems? \n\nI know that is kind of a lot but any advice would be appreciated, I just want to understand her more and care for her :) \n\n*Sorry if this is a bit of a mess I’m very tired and I typed this on my phone 
6	Wife is an INFJ, I am an ENTP. Whenever I got extremely down. She would see me down and get upset. She would start to tear up and tell me how it breaks her up knowing that I felt the way I did. That killed me. To know someone had that kind of internal conflict given my emotions. I'm pretty black and white. I think that individual emotions are that person's burden so my wife throwing the care bear stare at me was truly different. I feed off arguments and debates, so when she just sits there and tears up, I realize I am being completely rational, but that doesn't mean Im not being an asshole. Hope this helps! Good luck. Listen to her and show her how you feel about her, that genuine interaction should help. Also I would tell her to focus on the positive relationships and for me, I just always research. I know that knowledge will succeed where people fail, and that excites me to share that information with everybody.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Spelling.
1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X4qySqsYP8 \n\nThis should help with her depression. Good luck. 
1	First step, be awesome, I think you have that part covered, once we think you're awesome we will naturally seek your affection, step two, give said affection, but not so obviously where we have to obviously show affection back in order to accept this affection although that part does highly depend on how close you two are, we're not close with most people though, so you gotta play step two by ear, but yeah that's it, also we entp's are terrible with emotion advice even when it's about our own emotions... lol
1	Try to be practical in your advice, get her out of the house and into places where there’s people and good atmosphere. 
1	she is lucky having such a great friend like you. i wish i had the same :')
1	great to see that there are people who still care about other people!\n\nYour question essentially is (correct me if I'm wrong):\n\n>How can I help my depressed ENTP friend?\n\nhehe, tricky question, one of my best friends (ENTP) has been depressed for years and I can tell you one thing:\n\nDon't even try to come up with arguments on why my / whoevers life doesnt suck.\n\nIdk about other types, but it doesnt work like that on ENTPs. "Show, don't tell" is btw a really great quote that fits here, too. If you want to help, make the life better, which you already seem to do. But don't try argue, not because it makes him / her upset (ok cant speak for other people here tbh), but because ENTPs usually a somewhat talented at finding things that support their point of view. Devils advocate etc bla bla. That was the way I tried it for the friend I was talking about and yeah.. didnt help =D\n\nIt eventually went from posting suicide notes as a WhatsApp Status (too see who would care?) to being a partly functioning human being by itself.\n\nGive it time, right now I'm once again in a depressed state, but I'm aware of it and cope with it mostly by remembering that it will get better eventually.\n\nDoesn't help my "feelings", but atleast my head is shutting up. Yeah, it sucks that I'm not doing anything productive atm but I just have to sit it out. Having negative thoughts and telling myself that I suck wont help and having this mindset of "it will get better" really helps with not having that happen.\n\nWhat actions of other people have helped ME the most?\n\nI don't want to sound like an asshole here, but I mostly got through depression and similar things by myself I'd say. What has helped me is writing down my feelings (yeah, it's embarrassing but I sometimes have these) or talk about them with other people. But it's very hard finding the right people for that. \n\nListening to me / my problems / my bullshit (=D) is what really helped me, but I understand that not everybody is willing to do that. \n\nHmm, my whole answer resolved around what I did (which makes me want to delete the whole roman and start all over lol, but going to stick to it now, maybe it helps), not really what someone else can do. I'll try again:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, what exactly can YOU do RIGHT NOW?\n\n\- and this is exactly where I stopped writing and continued to watch The Expense.. I'm sorry, ENTPs are really not that helpful lmao. My best advice is to just continue doing what you're doing already, you seem like a very supportive friend, which is great. Maybe she doesnt know how to show it, but I'm sure she deep down really appreciates that.\n\n\- guess this is going to end up at - 10 votes because there's literally nothing helpful in it, maybe it atleast was a nice read (the hope dies last). Guess I'll fuck off now, have a great evening! =)
1	First of all: you can't fix her, and it's not your job to.\n\nI'm a "fixer" myself, so I know how it feels. You know how wonderful the person's life could be if they saw things the way you do. You try to show them how wonderful, how capable they are. But they don't see it.\n\n> have recently (past month) become REALLY close with this ENTP (F)\n\nIn my opinion, a month is not long enough to become close to someone in a healthy way. Trust takes time. \n\n> She’s kind of lost all hope on trying to feel better because “nothing works”. No one listens to her. She keeps saying that “nothing changes” no matter who she opens up to. She’s rejected the idea of going to therapy because she doesn’t want to open up to a stranger and she feels stupid.\n\nIf she's chronically negative, and your relationship consists of emotional support, that's not healthy. \n\nIf you guys do fun things together, and you only occasionally dig into the emotional problems, that's fine. But if you're her therapist, that's not fine.\n\n\nQuestion: Do you have a normal friendship, or are most of your conversations about her problems?

12	You can find the same completion for all the N-types. This isn't because these fears are unique to N-doms, it's because people who make these searches (which google bases its algorithm off of) never identify as STJs, which is why those completions turn up blank. It's why the STP and SFJ and SFP results also don't turn up many auto completions (and when they do, it's one of the four your image shows). Don't believe me? Try "ISTJ fear of" and see what pops up\n\nIn other words, this is just generic teenage searches, where the teenagers are almost exclusively identifying as N-doms. It also explains why, at the moment of this comment, this post has 17 pts (with an avg of 100% upvotes...) This actually gives me an idea: I wonder if Google's stats holds the keys to identifying mistypes.

3	Curious as to how some of y'all deal with a loved one, friend or lover who's being emotionally irrational.	Much like the title, how do you deal with someone close to you acting emotionally irrational, me personally I'll wait till they calm down and explain until they accept or understand. Been dealing with this a lot n lately from different friends and people in my life. Just curious how y'all deal with it. Or if it's even an issue to some of you folks. Initially I'm at a loss because 1 someone being so emotionally irrational over something I would never baffles me, 2 I don't want to add gas to the fire if it's someone I care about otherwise I'd be cold cut to the point.
3	I could have written this.  I'm going through this with one friend in particular.  In a way, it's not fair.  Why do I have to be the mature one who never gets upset?  Why do you get to pop off and I just have to wait for you to get over yourself?  I would never treat my friend the way she treats me when she gets easily offended and then treats me like an asshole for weeks.  Just tell me if something I did bothered you and then we can work it out.  \n\nI hope you find a way to deal with it better than I have.
1	I'm very blunt, but I try to be understanding.\n\n"It sounds like you feel this because that? If so I understand where you're coming from, and I think it's okay to feel the way you do. However, I think action xyz is irrational and likely contaminated by current emotion. I think consequences abc may arise, and my personal suggestions are to 123".\n\nBecause we're friends, I've never had an issue with this approach. It's pretty formulaic actually. Validate (I truly do understand why they feel the way they do, because I force them to explain the situation via questioning). Then I offer analysis (which they usually appreciate). I end with suggestions (and why i think xyz approach is preferred to abc approach). \n\nSometimes if they're still in distress I'll add a disclaimer that it's just my opinion, and I'll support them in whatever they do. Ive had situations like this where I've expressed disapproval over choices (which they respected), but I never thought less of them for these choices. so there must exist a baseline of mutual respect here. Gotta read the room before you give an "I told you so.." lol\n\nI've obtained a reputation for being extremely level headed, fair, and rational in helping friends under distress. Turns out I'm "socially dynamic" and a "good listener". 
1	It’s hard to answer this. It really depends on the circumstance 
1	My way of dealing with irrational overly emotional people is by ignoring them until they calm down. There's no point in arguing with people that are unwilling to consider that their perspective is wrong ("feelings are always right"), so why bother? \n\nUsually, the best you can do is trying to make them explain why they feel a certain way. Guide them to the solution to their problem so they think they fixed it themselves. Usually works well for me. \n\nIf being emotionally irrational is their default state, I just don't argue with them at all. I have some friends that are like that. We get along well but there's just one topic you really shouldn't touch because they can't think objectively about it if their life depends on it. \n\nMy solution? Nod and smile, point out their bullshit and make it clear that I'm not wasting my time any further. \n\n\n
2	What are ways to increase your general brainpower, IQ and fluid intelligence?	Used to be ‚gifted’ earlier in my life and have skipped a grade, still in the top 5% academically now. \nHaving an existential crisis because I feel like I can’t grasp concepts anymore the way I used to. I have also become less creative due to the fact that I do 0 work and just copy shit from the Internet. \nAlso I have recently done an IQ Test, showing that apparently I‘m not that intelligent.\nBTW i‘m shitty at natural sciences as well :)\n\nsoooooo how can I change this? I want my performance and mental aptitude back :/
5	Read. Also expose yourself to ideas that are a little beyond what you can understand. Repeated exposure to big ideas is what's required for eventual understanding. Podcasts are one way to do this. Choose subjects that are genuinely fascinating to you. Otherwise you won't be able to motivate yourself to finish the book/podcast. Also, since you're an ENTP, watch debates on YouTube. Legit debates, not two dum dum youtubers debating lame subjects. 
3	Try praying to God. I heard He answers all prayers. 
1	Might just be a problem of motivation. It's way easier to learn things you care about. Find something you care about, get really good at it, and hope that there is carryover from that area into a more general knowledge base. For example, you could learn different areas of mathematics or physics by studying a musical instrument, or a car engine, and getting into the details of how it works. This has the added benefit of possibly teaching you an instantly useful skill along the way, instead of just gathering a bunch of theoretical knowledge that sits in the back of your head collecting dust. 
1	Cause:\n\n> I do 0 work and just copy shit from the Internet\n\nEffect: \n\n> I can’t grasp concepts anymore the way I used to\n\n> I have also become less creative\n\nYour mind is a muscle. If you let it atrophy, don't be shocked when you can't run a marathon. \n\n-----------------------------\n\nedit: grammar and clarity
1	Discord for xntps? Other types wecome	Plz dont kill my post im lonely, too many infps in my life
1	My math teacher is probably brain dead.	So I have this math teacher supposedly a stereotypical ISTJ, but let's leave that aside since I hate judgeing people by some "type" that's more or LESS actually relevant. \n\nSo this guy probably around 65 years old is a complete moron that won't understand a thing I'm telling him. In math class I'm usually brainstorming for new ideas and methods of solving problems faster so of course I tell him about my "discoveries" - more of common sense things that I'm sure I'm not the first one to find them - to which he either seems unimpressed or tries to prove me wrong. I usually show him that I'm right and then he just simply acts like nothing happened and goes further. Once he was teaching a new way of solving problems ( a very inefficient one, not even in the official school curriculum not that it matters anyhow) and to prove / demonstrate how it works he calls me up to solve it at the board. I start solving it with a different - more efficient method, I also explained what I was doing but he sent me back to my bench. Apparently there's only one of solving problems now....\n\nToday we got into a pretty long discussion which he ended because he simply had no arguments left. He closed something along the lines of: "God I've had enough of these theoreticians!" Yeah, I admit most of my ideas are just theoretical, but isn't all mathematics theoretical? Like don't come to me and say that equations are so god damn practical. \n\nHe also emphasizes a lot on theories and formulas so that goes against of what he said. He expects us to memorize formulas without undestanding them first and when he asks me for formulas and I start deducing them from other formulas he starts telling to stop that because in the real life you won't have time to do that. WHY THE FUCK WOULDN'T I HAVE TIME TO DO A 20 SECONDS THING THAT SAVES ME FROM FRYING MY BRAIN CELLS BY MEMORIZING THINGS LIKE A ROBOT? \n\nOn top of that he emphasizes a lot on calculus. On a test in which I completely solved a problem he gave me absolutely no points for that because I messed up a little calculus at the end. Why? Because "In the real life the only things that matter are the results" well in the real life you can use calculators you dickhead. \n\nI feel like standing in his presence makes my brain cells die. A lot of my colleagues have the same opinion but I'm the only that's actively fighting against him. 
5	Differentiating hypothetical future scenarios from “objectively” inevitable scenarios.	This is proving difficult for me to put into words, so bare with me, lol.\n\nSometimes I’ll fantasize about all of these great things I want to succeed in, all of these crazy cool things I want to do, etc. Some of which are clearly fantasy and truly are “Lol, that would be cool” are really just for kicks and giggles (even if I don’t think so in the moment). However, when I think of what will *realistically* happen based on how I’ve evaluated my personality, tendencies, upbringing, etc. I often see the outcomes not just as things I believe will happen, but things I think will inevitably happen based what I’ve realistically evaluated about my state of being.\n\nI often get intensely interested in weird hobbies that I get lost in because of a hypothetical life that I could see myself gaining from it. It gets to the point that it’s not just something I’m fantasizing about, but it’s something I *truly* think I COULD do if I threw myself into it...so I dip my toes in. However, while I’m thinking/acting upon about these crazy scenarios, I’m still going through the motions of what my “realistic” self will inevitability succeed in based upon what I’ve evaluated to be the “most likely” outcome.\n\nPersonal example: Based upon what I know about myself, what my tendencies as a person are, etc. I think it is inevitable that I will work in the entertainment industry- most likely Film/TV. This is already an inevitability in the making and has been for three years. I also think it is inevitable that I will do things related to screenwriting because I know myself well enough to know that this is what I would be best at and find the most interest in- all based upon “innate” curiosities stemming from my personality and past experiences.\n\nSometimes Ne takes hold and I get so focused and engrossed in a hypothetical scenario and it’s possibilities (Like idk...music) that I forget the inevitable scenario because to me it’s...well...inevitable. My mind basically says “Hey, this is gonna happen anyway...so I’m sure it wouldn’t hurt for you to try some other stuff out”. To me I *know* I will pull through in the end and even if I get caught up by something new, I will go back to the “inevitable scenario” by default since that’s what I think will realistically happen.\n\nOftentimes I will fail, do poorly at, or downright suck at the thing I hypothetically think I’d be great at. And while it’s disappointing and sometimes fucks with me mentally, I still find that my “inevitable” scenario has progressed to some degree anyway, thus affirming to me that it’ll happen just like I “knew” it would. \n\nBasically what I’m saying is that it seems as though while I get obsessed with novel, crazy things...I still succeed in my “realistic” goal by default even when I’m not focusing on it because it’s the most logical thing to happen based upon what I know about myself- and since it’s the most realistic thing to happen, I go through the motions of it while obsessing over some shiny new interest at the same time......\n\n....redundant but whatever.\n\nTo me, being a complete failure is as realistic as me thinking I’d be a kick ass world class botanist or something. I’ll obsess over it, see it as this crazy hypothetical that’s completely possible, but then sit back and go “Lol, nah. That’s not really what will happen based upon this, this, and that. I’ll probably just end up in film or something”. And what do you know? A month later I have two film jobs lined up and I’m just like “Wait...how exactly did I get here again?”. I’m trying not to make this sound like the most egotistical and narcissistic on the planet, but I don’t know how to explain it any other way- I mean, I probably could, but I don’t really want to restart.\n\nI’ve just noticed that some people always wonder why ENTPs wing it and do things last minute, and I think I’ve solved this question: It’s because we are truly, truly sure we will find a way in the end even if we fail time and time again because that’s just “What I’m good at anyway. So why not wing it? I’m still bound by my realistic self who I have analyzed as someone who will succeed regardless of what happens.”
2	It’s funny how you post/comment some of the most retarded shit one moment, and then something well thought out the next moment.
1	Basically, you have faith in yourself, but then you worry about if you should.\n\nThe fact that you do both simultaneously **is** why you have such faith in yourself.\n\nI think it's generally better to have confidence than not. But the best kind of confidence to have is the kind of confidence which is kept in check by occasional doubt.\n\nNow, when it comes to results, confidence will help, but it's not the confidence that actually gets you results. \n\nConfidence is kind of like vitamins: you don't need to take them unless you have a deficiency, and they won't help if you take extra, they might even damage your health. The vitamins keep you in the game of life, but you still have to actually play it well to achieve something.\n\nSo what I'm saying is, congratulations, you aren't deficient in confidence. Now you need to actually do something without being hampered by lack of confidence. 
1	Ne is a funny little bitch. It will never stop. You know what's inevitable? Hypothetical cool scenarios coming in.\n\nWe want them. They're funnier to follow than the inevitable scenario. We already know the most likely scenario is going to happen, no fun in that. But wait! We actually can get lost in hypothetical future options, trying them out and losing time we could spend on ensuring the inevitable scenario to happen. The more we neglect the inevitable scenario, the more the inevitable scenario becomes an almost-inevitable. A hypothetical future. The fun scenario. Let's say it's inevitable to graduate from college, IT specialization. The most profitable scenario, and most likely to happen. Uh, no need to do anything, and it's so inevitable it's boring. But wait, there's a deadline tomorrow! We may fail! Our now-hypothetical future of graduation is fun again! Let's work a bit to push the already-not-so-inevitable scenario a bit closer to truly inevitable. Yay we succeeded! Well duh, again. Also, it's boring again. I am now certain to graduate and become a programmer. Let's now do other stuff. I mean, I could hypothetically be a professional League of Legends player now. Or a musician, or a supreme ruler of my own country where I give civil rights to dogs. The cycle repeats itself. We're having fun though.
1	Here a german saying, which I think fits here. „Everyone said: that doesn‘t work. Then somebody came who didn‘t know and just did it.“\n\nI think ENTPs are the types of people that „didn‘t know“ and just do it. For me I‘ve noticed many things I just winged because I didn‘t consider it a big deal, only after people telling me that I‘ve apparently accomplished sth big I realized what I did. Where I thought, why is it so weird for someone to be able to do this? Because the barriers most people create are just straight outta their imaginations. \n\nRealistically speaking why wouldn‘t you achieve your goals? I also beliebe i‘ll *just* achieve my goals, I just know it‘ll work out somehow, and if it doesn‘t, I always got a plan B, C, D, ... for my initial plan. One of them *will* work out. So I just focus on other stuff as you also said you do. What would keep me from doing both?
1	> I’ve just noticed that some people always wonder why ENTPs wing it and do things last minute, and I think I’ve solved this question: It’s because we are truly, truly sure we will find a way in the end even if we fail time and time again because that’s just “What I’m good at anyway.

To me I know I will pull through in the end and even if I get caught up by something new, I will go back to the “inevitable scenario” by default since that’s what I think will realistically happen.\n\nSee, this might not work for every ENTP. What if you get hyper-focused on the new shiny thing, and your "inevitable" path suffers as a result?\n\n> To me, being a complete failure is as realistic as me thinking I’d be a kick ass world class botanist or something.

Your inevitability is only inevitable because you worked hard to make it so.\n\nI think you should give yourself some credit. It's not like you've coasted to get where you are, unless I'm sorely mistaken.
1	My life is exactly like this, lol. \n\nThe clearest example of an experience in my life is when I decide I’m going to go back to trading commodities or currencies. I’m really good at feeling the market if I just focus on one market and simply stare at the numbers as they come, no charts, no history, no news, just the last trade price. Unfortunately, this is soooo boring and my mind starts to try to figure out ways to predict the market movements by looking at anything and everything, soon I’m coming up with elaborate equations that need even more and more details, that never seem to work as well, or at all, as just paying attention to the last trade price, period. Luckily, I’ve recently started to understand this cycle much better in myself and don’t put any money, or very little, into these tangents of elaborated ideas. (Emotional investment can easily replace money in the above example, ie be careful investing too much emotional expectations into these tangents)\n\nThis cycle, that you describe very well, is common for us ENTP’s. Our Fractal way of thinking makes us who we are; ever exploring from our main branch, never completely finishing those tangent explorations, then coming back to our base branch, and luckily always being better off understanding the world around us and our main branch because of those tangent explorations.\n\nSometimes, though, those tangent branches of ideas actually become base branches. So you never should give them up...\n\nAnd now, if you would excuse me, I’m going to google up “fractal” & “mind” because I’m sure I just came up with a noble award winning idea that will change the world!!\n\nAs a side note: If you ever feel lost it’s because you are near the end of one of those explorations.... \n\n..,now what was I going to google....? Oh yeah, how to be funny at the end of posts....I think...lol or should it be lmao....is there something else other than lol&lmao....maybe I could invent something new!!!....
1	ENTP mistyped as ENFP?	I've typed anywhere from INFP to INFJ to ENFP but I think I might be an ENTP...here's why:  \n\n\nI always seriously identified with ENFPs...I'm spontaneous...have 20 tabs open at the same time...mostly wikipedia usually. I fall for people in the course of 5 minutes...cry at movies...cry in general and all that jazz...I love helping people...I love memes and stuff like that...always been told I act like I'm on drugs (I'm not)...I'm fairly intense when it comes to personal relationships, both romantic and platonic...  \n\n\nBut my friend told me she thinks I'm more of an ENTP because of my quick wit, my love to just sort of be dominant and my love of arguing...and my ability to manipulate people if I want to. I was told when I was younger that I should be a lawyer.  \n\n\nI've always been good at manipulating people...which is a bad thing. I wouldn't say I'm a sociopath because I definitely have morals and I don't do immoral things just for the sake of personal gain or being immoral, but that doesn't stop the fact that I can manipulate people if I want to. Just because I can do something doesn't mean I like that about myself and doesn't mean I like doing it. I'm a good liar and a good actor.  \n\n\nThe other thing is that I love arguing. I can argue about literally anything simply for the purpose of arguing...I will also plow through peoples arguments with no regards to feelings if their argument has nothing to back it up. I will call out someone using appeals to emotions or basing arguments simply on emotion by presenting facts, even if it offends them and makes them hate me...I only feel bad after but during the time, I get so heated that I just don't give a flying puck.  \n\n\nI also think the world is pretty much doomed and everyone is shit until they prove otherwise and that most people are bad. I also am conservative which I was told isn't common for NFs. I do get along very well with INFJs though, which I was told isn't too uncommon for ENTPs OR ENFPs.  \n\n\nI'm also UBER competitive about almost everything, but I'm not a sore loser.  \n\n\nOpinion?
1	I think I agree with you. I’ve never known ENFPs to be manipulative, at least not intentionally. 
1	All of these things can be ENFP. 
1	Look at the functions, that solves everything 
1	>I've always been good at manipulating people...which is a bad thing.\n\n>The other thing is that I love arguing.\n\nIn my opinion and my logic might be faulty but manipulation is not and should be assigned moral connotations. I know how its defined but I think that definition is wrong. As humans we manipulate each other and most of the physical items we interact all the time (with manipulation being defined as an action or "series" of actions that control or influence people and things.) Okay I got sidetracked my point is that you seem to use emotional and morally charged language \n\n>I can argue about literally anything simply for the purpose of arguing.\n\nI think as a T type you'd realize that most arguements don't come to any useful conclusions people don't go into an argument ready to have their mind or opinion changed people that are arguing are basically smacking each other with their opinions. Debate and discussion is more of what I believe T types should naturally gravitate towards because you go into those types of conversations open yo changing your opinion but more so you those types of conversation promote arriving to the most factual points, truthful or useful solutions opinions based on context and give you an opportunity to learn.\n\n> I get so heated that I just don't give a flying puck. \n\nTypically ENTP's aren't so attached to a certain view point that they get emotional about it because opinions have the possibility of being wrong or being flawed meaning that you have to remain open to being wrong and or corrected which typically doesn't happen if you get emotional about your arguments. \n\nIf some if things I say don't make sense tell me about it let's talk. \n\n\n
1	You sound like an ESFP, not an ENFP or an ENTP.   At least I see more FiTe than TiFe.
6	Whats your guys' favorite drug, and how does it change your functions?	Weed:  Boosts my Ne and Ti to a ridiculous extent.  My boosted Ne gives me insane ideas and connections, then my Ti goes into overdrive hyper-analyzing each idea.  I think I actually get some Fi as well, as meaningful conversations/tv situations feel more 'touching,' I guess.  I'm actually high as I write this haha\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmphetamine:  I'm prescribed 30 mg addy, and unfortunately, over time the addy high pretty much loses all of the euphoria.  Shit used to be so intense.  For me, Adderall destroys my Ne and Fe.  It significantly ups my Te and Ti, as well as a mild increase in Si.  Thus, addy means I'll be much quieter, intensely logical and actually sort of give a fuck about pointless rules.  Basically I turn into a non-impulsive, very productive ISTP.  Funny, because the other result I tend to get is an ISTP.  Tho, I bet a lot of ENTPs come off as ISTP when they're rly deep in thought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlcohol:  Oh god, done some dumb ass shit with this one.  It destroys pretty much all of my introverted functions, aside from Fi.  It boosts my Ne *and* Se, significantly.  I can discuss dum ideas forever, but I'm just as likely to be found with the ESxPs dancing and playing pong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCaffeine: When highly caffeinated, boosts Se.  I get an intense urge to sprint at full speed.  Makes me play *way* better in soccer games.  Also, I notice an increase in Fe, as caffeine makes me quite sociable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	LSD too keep me from becoming an asshole
1	I have written about this before on here... MDMA, it really helps me deal with my Fe, and with other peoples feelings in general. I have always struggled with the Fe being really opposed to my other functions, but on MDMA it is like they all work together. I have become much better at this an a adult without drugs, but I still have some issues with hiding my feelings rather than having them.\n\nI am a nurse I see a lot of death and have to compartmentalize it as part of my job, and while I have developed a good system for processing this part of my day-to-day, the yearly or so MDMA trip really helps me to get my shit out on the table that I keep deep down. 
1	LSD is my favourite drug. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sure how it changes functions, still feeling the Ne + Ti when I'm tripping. I've had others say that they understand me more when they are tripping with me so maybe it amplifies the same in them. My Ti will always be analysing things, and looking for the logical conclusion for whatever I am experiencing whilst tripping. I don't really experience a connection to plants or anything like my Fi friends do, so I guess my type doesn't really change.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also like Amphetamine and use it on average once every 2 weeks. It definitely seems to draw my Si out, but not really my Te, I just feel like a more productive Ne dom that can now use Si lol, where generally my Si is dog shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCaffeine again just makes my Ne crazy, and makes my Si a bit better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlcohol is probably the only drug (that I have done) that seems to draw out what I would imagine Se to feel like. I do feel very in the moment and present, where most of the time I feel a bit scattered. I find alcohol is still more of an Ne + Fe combo when I am drunk, however.
1	Prescribed 30 mg XR adderall too, but I definitely think it makes me more INTJ or ENTJ. Ni is definitely pumpin
1	Cough medication, makes me really hyper aware of my surroundings but also sleepy, am an INTJ but become sorta ISFJ
11	I have way too many activities	Dear fellow ENTPs,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I have way too many activities.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am 23 y.o, I have a degree in french and anglo american law and I've recently started a sound engineering school (I agree that they don't make sense together but I truly love both).\n\nSince I was little, I found myself being over curious about \*too\* many things.\n\nI compose music and master my own songs on softwares like Ableton, Logic, and more recently Protools. I record videos on a camescope and then edit them, I like to take photos and then edit them.  \nI've learned by myself how to speak english, german, spanish, I've learned how to use freelines, how to rollerskate, how to snowboard, how to play the guitar, the bass, the drums, the piano, how to sing, how to dj... recently I learned how to sew with a sewing machine, and now I've been creating my own t shirts and pull overs for two weeks. I like going to clubs, I like dancing, I like seeing friends at bars but I also have a passion for writing and reading and just pass time by myself. Of course I love traveling, watching movies and series, going to art exhibitions and museums, concerts, and I practice sports twice a week at least. I like drawing, doing my own little sculptures with clay, painting with watercolors.\n\nAm I bragging ? I don't know, probably a bit, but I post this because the problem is that \*each one of these activities is very recurrent\* (fortunately I didn't cite all the other little obsessions I've had in my life so far) and I am at average level in almost all of them (except I'm a little bit better in music). I feel like I'll never become a professional of anything and I don't feel "legitimate" for any of these activities.\n\nSome older ENTP with the same problem please tell me how you deal/dealt with that. What do you do in your life ? The others who struggle with the same issue feel free to complain with me haha. I feel like there are so many great things to do and that life is too short for all that. *And I don't want to give up things I like to do. Of course society asks me to actually be a professional somewhere, somehow but it's not the main reason why I want to master things. I want to understand things fully, not just the surface.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Am I condamned to just being average ?**
4	Fellow aspiring polymath here, only 3 year your "senior". It hasn't gone away for me, although for a while I did struggle with it. Now I realise there's no problem to it all. The more knowledge you have in different fields, the more seemingly unrelated dots you can connect. Life's too short to not try everything at least once!
5	> Some older ENTP with the same problem please tell me how you deal/dealt with that. What do you do in your life ? The others who struggle with the same issue feel free to complain with me haha.\n\nChoose one that has sufficient depth to it, one which will allow you to easily get a job and make sufficient money as a career.   Then you do all the rest as a hobby until they throw dirt on you.   That is find the thing you can do well that *other people* find useful and will want to pay you to do.   When you don't have to worry about buying food or paying rent, then you'll have time for all your hobbies. \n\nAs for feeling legitimate?  Stop comparing yourself to others *except* as a way to learn more.  If all you take away from comparing yourself to someone else is a self-esteem beat-up then you're not doing it right.  You should be comparing your *work* and learning what you can do to improve it, not comparing *yourself*.\n\nI like to compose music, among other things, as well.  I know I will never be Beethoven and almost no one will ever care about my music other than me.  But you know what?  I do it because I enjoy doing it.  I don't have to pretend that it needs to be my 'life's work' or my 'passion' or other bullshit.   So I write music and paint and draw, and the more I do, the more I learn and the better I get.   That has given me some opportunities,  like getting the chance of having my music played in public and I've given people paintings that hang in their home.   Maybe eventually they'll toss it when they're cleaning house and want something that matches the new couch.  Maybe not?  In either case, it doesn't matter.  Someday,  perhaps in some distant future, no one will remember Beethoven or Shakespeare either. \n\n> Am I condamned to just being average ?\n\nAbsolutely.  Did you really think you were special and were going to change the world?
4	>Some older ENTP with the same problem please tell me how you deal/dealt with that. What do you do in your life ? \n\nI'm 27, so I'm not that seasoned. As for me, it just came down to trying many different things, the one I chose I had a knack for and it helped that experts commented on me both positively and negatively. I just keep on learning about it and doing it, sometimes forcing myself because I know that in the end mastery comes from repetition, learning, and correction. Talent is like a ferrari, doesn't really go anywhere if you never drive it. In the end, you need to want to be or want to know - both, more, something.\n\n>**Am I condamned to just being average ?** \n\nIf you keep on doing the same thing over and over, yup.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	If you enjoy all those things, what's wrong with being average?
3	yooooo ENTP audio engineers in the house! 
3	You know nothing Jon Snow. \n\nI am 38. I no longer struggle with that, I just love it :D \n\nIn early ages, I had the same dilemma but just because society confused me a lot at that time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI now clearly understand that I only struggled because I listened them. After ignoring the voice of my surrounding I started to feel happy with this "special talent". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will feel the same after spending enough time with this struggle. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Too many things" is awesome. Ignore people and have fun with "too many things." Use them to your advantage. I sleep only for 4 hours a day even for more things...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't listen people. They all are not ENTP. They cannot understand and relate. They only push you down. Resist !!! RISE NOW MY DEAR ENTP...RISEEE !!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S I just want to mention all my **active only** hobbies since my fellow ENTPs will respect the most : painting, drawing, sculpting, dark ambient / electronic music composing, scaled model building, game & application development, singing. I also have "absolute hearing." etc... \n\n&#x200B;
1	Relate a lot.\n\nThough I would remind you to keep the Dunning Kruger effect in mind while trying to be objective about your own skill sets.\n\nYou may be better at music than you give yourself credit for and worse at some of your more marginal hobbies than you think.\n\n$0.02
1	I'm 17 so I'm not the big guy with the fix you've been asking for but:\n\nI myself struggle with this but it's been getting better since I started kinda vacuum cleaning through my activities.\n\nI have always been a creator, ever since I first started playing with cubes, legos and colored crayons as a toddler I never ever stopped creating and exploring. I'd write a long list about my hobbies and interests but it would get too long, too quick and I'd probably forget some since they are so many.\n\nI don't think I'll ever stop having a lot of interests but I'll at least make sure that I'll dedicate my time to pursue those few things I see to be the most rewarding.\n\nI actually want to turn my polymath lifestyle into a business. Start a website and a youtube channel that is tailored for the creators. A channel of connecting dots from different areas of life, documenting the process of creating and giving people the tools and information required to create in a information packed, easy to digest format. I would also push my own creations by doing this. I want to show people that cool modular synth I want to build and my cool films as well. There are a couple of channels on youtube that do stuff like this but they are usually only tied to filmmaking only.\n\nI saw an article on Reddit about [Warren Buffett’s “2 List” Strategy](https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus) and at first, it freaked me the fuck out, how can I give up everything I liked and focus on only 5 things? 5 is a small number you know? And as I thought of it a little more, I decided that, no, fuck that, it's bullshit. So I ain't doing that, **BUT**, it made me reflect on my interests and it made me leave behind some of my hobbies in order to focus on the more important stuff I want to excel at.\n\nI also listened to the *"The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up"* by Marie Kondo‎ and that book changed my view on minimalism, which I previously thought is bullshit. I tried applying some minimalistic principles into my life and so far it's really nice and freeing. I'm not going too in depth about this since I'm at the begining of this and I still don't consider myself a minimalist, but at least, I'm making progress into decluttering my life.\n\nThese two helped me declutter my interests and I chose a broad area to invest my time in that offers so much stuff to learn and explore that I won't ever get bored. That area is filmmaking. it involves a shit ton of skills: video shooting and editing, graphic design, 3D VFX and CGI (Broad as fuck) marketing, web development, writing, audio engineering (broad as fuck as well), other stuff related to business and more. There's so much to explore in these areas and they go so well together in a business setting that It gets me super excited to learn and become good at all these. I would call all these hobbies "My career" and my "I want to take a break" hobbies would be the other stuff I decide to explore and spend my time on like: electronics, woodworking, longboarding etc.`\n\nAs a quick edit, there are a few hobbies that I shouldn't even consider them hobbies but a part of my life like: Eating healthy and taking care of my phisical and mental health.\n
1	I got no interest in anything, therefore I am interested in everything.\n\nI never met another polymath but I believe this is how we feel, gnawing at the known to see if there's more, much more.\n\nEverything is part of everything and how can we study just one side of it, where the left hand is not aware of what the right hand is doing? The days of sacrificing yourself for isolated breakthroughs are over, as there is only one breakthrough left lurking on the horizon, that of transcending ourselves onto a new plane of consciousness.\n\nStop giving a shit of what others think, because others don't really think as individuals, we're the many flagella of the repressed collective unconscious.\n\nThink of a big, loud, greasy engine without wheels or chassis, that's the self-important "humanity".
4	ENTP author and directors	Anyone know of any ENTP directors and authors?\n\nWhat does a ENTP director or writer look like, as in style, focus, etc?\n\n
6	Quentin Tarantino is supposedly an ENTP, I like that Pulp Fiction flick.
3	Me! I work in film as a director / assistant director. 🤠 very Ti oriented and stories rooted in speculstive fiction  Focus on detail and world building, unConcerned with onset power dynamics and crew members. uNbothered by aesthetics thats do not enhance the key themes og the film  \n\nHoward Hughes is just about as ENTP as you can get. 
3	Alfred Hitchcock and Frank Herbet (Dune) are apparently ENTP's. 
3	* Hunter S. Thompson\n* Quentin Tarantino\n* Guy Ritchie\n* John Beebe\n* Robert Greene\n* Ryan Holiday\n* Simone de Beauvoir\n* Slavoj žižek​\n* Blake Edwards
16	Are any of you moral absolutists? Why?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_absolutism
10	Not with the definition that wiki provides. Picking up a spoon off the table is morally irrelevant. Ergo, not all actions are right or wrong.
5	I guess I think rape is wrong in every context. Does that make me an absolutist because that's the only moral thing I can think I take an absolute stance on. 
3	I believe in a gradient. On either end of the spectrum exist absolutes (right/wrong in this context). Most real life scenarios are in between though, having like 75%/25% split for example. I also consider intentions and actions together, not just one or the other. Not everything can be inherently right or wrong. Black and white thinking leads to lots of problems. And most things in life are spectrum. But i think it's import to note that even the spectrum contains the absolutes.
11	What about absolute relativist ? There is no God. Everything is permitted by Nature. Do what you want, *pay* for the consequences! Death shows no mercy.
2	Absolutism is stupid.
2	There definitely need to be some absolutes, if only so that we can function. Because were everything relative, we could not make laws or define anything. I think a relativistic view of the world is great, although it can be limiting just like absolutes. A relativistic view would have to accept absolutes, which is a contradiction. And an absolute view would not have to accept relativism; we’d miss a lot of the subtleties if everything were black and white. So no, I’m not a moral absolutist, but I’m not a moral relativist either. 
2	I would say I’m not an absolutist, but I do think there is a science of morality or objective morality. There are peaks and valleys on the moral spectrum. I would compare it to nutritional science in that manner. A great read is “The Moral Landscape” by Sam Harris. He introduced me to a completely different perspective of objective morality
3	Yes. If morality isn't objective, it is meaningless.
1	I'm highly sensitive to to the logical extrapolation of moral relativism and absolutism from a given grand narrative, philosophical frame, or belief system. It irks me when someone claims a belief system like Atheism then pairs it with deep-seated moral absolutes like human value, dignity, special status, love, justice, etc. Those moral ideas are not commensurate with a strictly empiricist worldview.\n\nMore generally, I have a problem with hypocrisy and logical inconsistency. Eg, it can't be true that there is no difference between the sexes except the wage gap. You can't claim equality of the sexes without understanding how both sexes are oppressed in different ways. You can't say minorities are free while demanding they act, think, and vote monolithically. You can't ridicule the religious for their unscientific, religiously motivated pro-life positions then fail to understand the basic biological idea that a zygote is the first stage of human development--yes it's a life and a human one, let's look at it honestly. 
1	Descriptive relativist. Which I think largely plays into or (or perhaps off of) the Ne function, and to a lesser extent Ti. 
1	Not an absolutist but do believe in moral universalism. 
1	There is no action that is right or wrong only intent. 
1	Morals are relative.
1	Yes, look up Henry Sidgwick's proof of utilitarianism
1	I don’t know why an ENTP would care anything for morals. They’re literally just all labels. It’s your perspective that makes things good and bad but reality isn’t objectively anything.
1	Yeah I am an absolute moralist. Relativism isn't a logically standing principle, due to the fact that its only principle says there are no principles showing a logical contradiction. Also I believe in the theory of forms held by Plato which means ideas exsist before a human thinks of it. There's the story of the cave. This is to say no one can believe or even think of something unless it existed in the metaphysical realm. \n\nThis means the idea of morality is a complete idea out there, this idea (regardless of God's existence or not) is something to pursue and that all men should seek absolute goodness. \n\nIn this debate its also important to make the distinction between prescriptive and descriptive. Or relativist look at the world and say that everyone does different things so we have to accept that. But absolutist would say the world ought to be a certain way. 
7	Songs that critique modern society.	Happy sunday wherever you are in the world.

0	How to deal w/ ENTP sister?	Hey,  as the title says my sister is an ENTP... And guess what I am.... ISFP,,,,,, it's a wacky adventure to say the least- anyways can I get some thoughts from ppl who know ENTPs or ENTPs themselves that can help me figure out how to deal with their non-stop harassment of ideas and how to get to their thicc brains on how some ideas or argument points aren't valid? \n\nDisclaimer: :'l I think she is an unhealthy ENTP if you know any traits of unhealthy ENTPs that would help alot
9	I'm not helping you because you radiate qualities that annoy me and seem like they would annoy other ENTP's
5	>asks for help with ENTP sister\n\n>doesn't give a single detail about ENTP sister
3	Unhealthy ENTPs tend to act like ISxJs.  They fuck up and use Si improperly, by worrying about irrelevant shit they normally don't notice, become reluctant to try new things, and get quiet and generally anxious or irritable.
4	*with their non-stop harassment of ideas and how to get to their thicc brains on how some ideas or argument points aren't valid?*\n\nAh fuck off, if you yourself can't rebuke the arguments presented we can't help you with that, you've also seemingly judged her as unhealthy because you don't get along, despite not providing any context other than the above, which seems perfectly healthy from our point of view.\n\nAs for the actual advice you're looking for? Meet her ideas, present your case in a rational enough way that she sees your point, if you're unable to do so well you're shit out of luck.
2	Sounds like she's too much for you. I'll take her off your hands. Thanks!
1	> their non-stop harassment of ideas\n\nWhat do you mean by that?
3	3 years worth of school stuff in 12 months.	So i want some suggestions on how to get from 9th to 12th grade in 12 months. Ending 8th grade this year and gonna start 9th next year. Can i study through the 9th grade material in 3 months in summer and then focus on 10th and 11th grade material? So instead of learning about 9th grade material in class, i'd be able to study 10th grade material. What should be my study time each day? Would have a part time job in the summer. Thinking That i'd need only 1 hour of rest in a day. Sundays would be days off or i can study 1/4th of the day. What websites should i use that could increase the speed of learning? Can be paid websites. Just looking for suggestions. The idea just came into my mind a few mins ago and want to know if it can be possible to learn 3 years worth of school stuff in 12 months?
7	Why do you want to do this?
2	I think it can be done, and sites like Khan Academy are designed for this grade level. For retention, you should put in at least 1-2 hrs a day. But no more than 5-6 imo otherwise you reach burnout. So probably go through 1-2 classes a month, depending on how many classes your 9th grade has. It's actually enough if you gain a cursory understanding online in preparation, and the rest by paying attention in class. \n\nHowever, I think your time might be better spent learning programming. MIT and coursera has a few courses on these. You can find amazingly fun (and challenging!) problems on Project Euler. You can make an account and see how you measure up against others who solved these questions.\n\nAlso, if college is your short term goal, I think you'd be better off practicing for the SAT. There are prep courses for it online, and once you're in 10th/11th grade it'll pay off to take paid prep courses too. You do well on the SAT by practicing for the SAT. And you'll improve your vocabulary+ quantitative reasoning skills. \n\nAnother skill that I think might be more helpful is learning another language (which is also part of your curriculum, so two birds with one stone). You can use apps like duolingo or hellotalk to learn a language of your choice (perhaps Latin, or classical Greek, or German)
2	First of all, What are your long term goals and what do you want to obtain by doing this? Is it worth overworking yourself?\n\nI can give you as an example my case: \n\nI'm in 11th grade myself. I want to step foot into the creative field and make a living by building a personal brand using social media. My next goal is to start a creative business and make money for my other creative related goals.\nGiving my goals, I have no reason to study my ass off in maths and physics in order to get into a good university so I can become a 9-5 monkey. \nAt school, I do homework only if I'm really required to. I barely write anything in class. I don't really pay attention if the subject doesn't interest me. I don't waste too much time learning outside of school, and I'm average in class with absolute minimal effort. My final exams don't bother me that much knowing that It won't matter anyway. I'm going to film school for editing and my grades don't matter for shit.\n\nOn the other side, outside the school hours, I'm all in on creating and developing plans for the future and the steps to achieve them. I'm way ahead of the curve when it comes to life and marketable skills compared to my peers. \n\nIn 10th grade, I made a better effort of learning because I wasn't sure if I want to pursue the arts or the academics. I've always been a creative person but when I hit highschool I got involved in a lot of contests and projects involving game development and electronics and seeing that my efforts put into these projects paid in awards and opportunities my vision of my future career become blurry and conflicted with my artsy side. Long story short, I decided that the academics are too much effort for not being rewarding enough, and so I turned to fully committing to the creative world. This is a reason why I think you shouldn't go all in into learning all this. If you don't have a clear picture of what you want to do in the future then you might waste precious time that could be spent elsewhere.\n\nSo basically: Define your goals. Analyze if it's worth the effort. Reflect on the analysis. Get to work.\n\nNow if you know that you want to pursue the academics or you just want to do this just for the sake of it then yes, it's possible, and shouldn't be that hard either.\n\nI don't know how it works in the states but here in Romania, the hardest year of learning was 9th grade. This may be a lot different in the states though. In my case, I think it was a combination of bad teaching, new environment, and way harder subjects all of the sudden. \n\nIMO, 10th and 11th year maths and physics at least, can be learned in a single hard working summer.\n\nNow, we have a girl that flew to the states as an exchange student and academic subjects seem to be overall more diluted and practical compared to what is being taught in Romania. So it should be even easier to do this.\n\nYou are hella lucky to have so many online resources to learn from that are made for your educational system that a little bit of googling will get you on a really good path. Khan Academy is really well structured and there are a ton of other quality resources that can come in handy.\n\nIf you decide to go about doing this. Try avoiding burnout like the plague. I'm a brunt out/bored out creative myself and it's really hard to get out of a rut. I used to cope with this by taking care of my physique but now I can't exercise for about 2 months because of a stupid hernia. Keep in mind that you won't always have the energy to do this and it's okay, take a break. If you are like me and you have Seasonal Affective Disorder then winter is gonna be a bitch for your productivity and it will tell your plans to be productive to take a turn back around the moon and fuck off.\n\nHere are a few unproductive and pseudo productive things to avoid if you want to not waste a ton of time on meaningless bullshit that contribute to burning out. This is from personal experience: \n\n1. Quit gaming. Cold turkey. One of the best decisions I've ever made. I used to waste my days playing CSGO, WoW and Overwatch and I thought to myself "I'm enjoying this so it's not wasted time"\nTruth is that nobody cares that I hit Grandmaster in Overwatch on season 3 and the fact that you practice in game skills instead of practicing real life skills says it all.\n\n2. Stop feeding your brain with shit. I don't have a TV. I don't browse 9gag for memes. I'm mindful about the stuff I watch on youtube and my only sin is wasting too much time on reddit instead of working. But even there, I'm not subscribed to any unproductive subreddits, only pseudo productive and productive ones c: Check out /r/nosurf , Feeds are the hardest ever addiction to try to break out of, and I still haven't broken \n\n3. Eat healthy. No it doesn't taste like crap you cunt. I've been eating really healthy for a year and a half and now all candy is way too sweet, soft drinks taste like shit and honestly, broccoli is like my favorite motherfucking thing on earth when ate along side chicken breast.\n\n4. Limit self deprecating humor. It plays with your brain and image. Image is respect. Respect is the most valuable currency. Money **can buy** respect. Respect **makes** money. Check out /r/InfluenceAdvice .\n\n5. Don't be me, get out of the house. I love people and the outdoors but my indoors activities are interesting as hell as well. Sometimes this alone time goes unchecked on holidays and here I am, literally rolling on the floor, going insane because I haven't interacted to other human beings other than my family for 2 weeks. Get outdoor hobbies. I'm trying to make music creation an outdoor hobby, also, I love longboarding but these two can only be done if my dick doesn't turn into a popsicle once it steps outside. I'm also not a fan of wearing 5kgs of clothes only because some shiny ball in the sky decides to fuck off in the winter.\n\n6. Coffee. It's great, drink it. **Only when you need it**. Coffee is motherfucking great, but you are like me and you like to make mistakes and drink too strong and too many cups of coffee then you'll build a tolerance really quick. Tolerance resets after taking 2 weeks off. But you mind not be be able to go 2 weeks off without coffee, so it's good to avoid building a tolerance.\n\nI could talk for hours but these few should do for now.\n\nTL;DR: Read it.
2	You're gonna regret it, seriously.\n\nI took the acceleration program in high school, so all 3 years curriculum (9th to 12th grade) would be completed in 2 years. It's been around 6 years since I'm graduated, and now I'm regretting why I took the program instead of going in normal way. Then again, I took the test mainly for giggles but somehow I was qualified, so maybe it would be different from you.
1	What do you want to get out of graduating early? Do you hate school? Do you think it would look impressive? Do you want to leave home?\n\nAlso, were you taking advanced classes in middle school? Do you have gifted-level intelligence? You'd have to be super-smart to make this work. Like, extremely intelligent. I know I wouldn't have been able to do it, that's for sure.
1	Why? While it is possible, it's going to be very difficult. Unless you're used to the intense studying required of you, you'll find the workload damn near impossible. Are you mentally prepared to buckle down? If so, websites like Kahn Academy are going to help you *tons*. I recommended looking at the teacher websites of your local high school and purchasing the textbooks they use. Follow their curriculum but at an accelerated pace. You can probably get you GED and begin college when you finish all three years.
1	I'll have a little bit of a different perspective from some as a homeschooled entp who finished my highschool courses in two years and then got my associates from college technically before I graduated (it was half off tuition since I was still a hs student), transferred to a 4 year and graduated from college with my bachelor's at the age of 19. Most of this was while working part time and now I am 22 with a degree and almost continuous job experience. \n\nIf you are able, I would highly recommend doing something similar. \n\nOn the if you are able note: how are you currently being educated? People who are homeschooled are typically better prepared for accelerated means of learning because they are often largely self taught. If you are public or private schooled, this is a skill that is  less likely to be practiced. That being said, it can be learned and places like kahn academy are excellent to help build those skills. As a side note, learn how to teach yourself from a textbook ASAP. Just do it. No matter what you do in life (esp. college), it will be incredibly helpful. \n\nSecondary point: you will probably need more than an hour off per day to have this be a sustainable lifestyle. I would recommend having a hour of "farting around" time, and 1-2 hours of productive fun time. Do a hobby you like, study a subject that genuinely interests you, etc. \n\nLet me know if I wasn't clear on explaining anything. 
1	Some people...\n\nI became self-aware only at 30
20	As an ENTP, what was your worst and best interaction with other personality types?	So I'm not sure if someone has already made a post like this before, but I was just curious. Not trying to "discriminate" against other personality types or call one out for being "bad," but I was just curious as to which personality ENTPS have better or not so good experiences with and why. I know that a quick google search can tell you compatibility, but I do want to hear some stories.
8	I like how you're asking for stories but all you got so far is a couple of best/worst lists without any elaboration. \n\nAnyway, stories are pretty much worthless because the average person sucks at typing so you'll learn more about their personal biases rather than actual experiences imo.\n\nI think one thing you should observe is that NTs and SFs and NFs and STs have a harder time to get along because they're opposites in scope and primary judgment focus. Next should be T vs. F for the same reasons. \n\nI'd expect NTs and STs as well as NTs and NFs to get along well because they share T and N respectively. 
4	My worst interactions are with my ISTJ father. He can't talk about anything else than work. And even when it's not work related, he makes it seems like it is by analyzing every (not interesting) details of the topic, and explaining things about it that I already know (for 20min). Of course, I absolutely cannot interrupt him during his enlightening explanation without him becoming angry, even if I already perfectly know everything he's telling me, because he is the father, and I'm the daughter, so I have to listen.\n\nSometimes, he starts explaining things to me that I myself introduced to him a few days before, as if it was a brand new discovery he made by himself, and that I couldn't possibly know. Every time he can, he tries to make a "life lessons" of everything, even when it's supposed to be a fun time. And of course, I've already heard these "life lessons" a hundred times before, but he always present them as if I just discovered them.\n\nBasically, talking to him is like talking to someone who always assume you're ignorant (even when you just proved you're not), and he's only capable to discuss very down to earth things, always taking himself too seriously. Even when he laughs, it feels like he is trying to constrain it, to stay in control.\n\nI think that's a very sad relationship to have with your father.   \n\n\nMy best interactions were with an ENFP guy (used to be my first very close friend in high school), and my INFP best friend. When I met the ENFP, he was the most open-minded person I knew. We became friend very quickly. I  started spending all my time with him, and I loved every minute. We could talk and laugh about everything, try new crazy things together, write songs and poems, be sad and quiet together. He was also very, very charismatic. He could become friend with anyone, and everybody liked him. I was really impressed by his social skills, especially in high school, where I myself really wasn't socially developped.\n\nMy INFP friend shares a lot of the ENFP characteristics, especially open-mindedness and honesty. But it took a lot more time for him and I to become friends. For a good 6 months, we shared the same classes in university, but never really talked to each other. Until one night, when we went out with common friends, and ended up walking home together for a 40min walk. We talked about everything. Especially about life. And we shared the exact same views, the same feelings about it, which is really rare to find in real life. I think we both felt a lot less lonely after this night. What I love about him is how we can have meaningful conversations about everything, but also how stupid we can be together. He doesn't care too much about what other people think of him, and it's really refreshing. 
9	Best: any NT. Some of my closest friends are other ENTPs, INTP, ENTJ, and INTJ\n\nWorst: ISFJ. That's the only personality type I can think of that I just don't work well with
4	Worst are definitely Fi doms for me. I usually get along with everyone, but somehow the Fi doms always find a reason to be mad at me for things I do/say. Idk how I always end up fighting with them when usually I never really fight with anyone (about personal matters) but I cannot stand it when people always want things their way.\n\nBest would be... TPs and FJs I guess. Never really had any problems with them, since the Fe evens everything out. \n\nMy worst current experience was with an ISTJ... it was a nightmare. She explained me a task which could‘ve been explained in 15 minutes in fucking two hours, because she repeated every little detail 10 times and at the end it all felt like a big mess and I felt I was losing control over the big picture because she went so much into detail about everything. It was suffocating... a nightmare... horrible...
5	Best: ENTP, ISFP, ISTP, ESTJ, ESTP, INTP\n\nWorst: NFs lol
1	As a young up n coming entp, i find it much harder to get along with Dom/aux Fi users—as an aside, socionics  is 100% right about the entp fi-blindspot and if you think you're the exception to that or just deny socionics because as a model of personality it assumes that each individual participates in every function, I put this forward to you; if you agree that all human beings sense, feel, intuit, and think on some level and therefore share every function with each other in varying degrees, and you also agree that every instance of perception and judgement falls on the spectrum of being either introvertedly or extrovertedly-charged(if you disagree with this you disagree with Jung's model which is a strange thing to do) you must also agree with socionics' model and beebe's and all the relevant jungian analysts' when they include each and every one of Jung's psychological functions when typing, but what you must NOT and CANNOT say(if you agree with the first two points) is that because MBTI only gives out four functions per personality, "ENTP's can't have Fi because MBTI AKA Jung's personality types for dummies  says they can't," lol get out of here with that nonsense. \n\nSo yeah, don't get along very well with Fi-users, I tend to offend them without meaning to in the slightest. Isfjs can be very grating to me, they're nice and nurturing on the surface but idk you can just feel the expectations they have for you to behave according to how they think one 'ought to behave' when you're around them \n\nInfjs are either really cool or really weird\n\nInsecure teenage infps I actually can get along with really well \n\nEnfps are dope as well, especially the older dude one that I know \n\n
29	The concept of „Regret“	What are your thoughts on what regret is and what to do about it?\n\nGoing by the definition that regret is something you wish you‘d have done different, I think we have technically no reason to feel regret ever.\n\nAt the moment where you have made a decision, you were a „different“ person than you are at the moment. It would not be fair nor make sense to judge what your self at that time has done with the self that you are now. You‘re no longer in the same circumstances as back then, so it would be easy to „regret“ what you did back then from your comfort zone now. Since you‘re no longer in the same situation, it is easy to talk big about - like what you should have or should‘ve not done. But judging the actions of the „you“ back then is like judging a stranger, so you have no reason to feel regret ever. You‘re out of the situation, you cannot judge whether your decision was right or wrong. Thus have no reason to regret, but should respect the decision made by the you in the circumstances back then. You don‘t remember how it was for you, and whether you would make the same decision again if put into the same situation.\n\nThoughts?
13	I think this ignores that our actions have consequences. Regardless of whether we're a different person now than two months ago, we still have to live with what that person left us with. I think I only ever regretted something that impacted my life negatively when I could have known better at the time but chose differently. \n\nTrivial example: \n\nGetting drunk and saying some stuff you usually wouldn't say. Regret it now because it impacted your friendships negatively.\n\nNot so trivial example: \n\nChoose to ignore some tell-tale signs of a disease because you're more focused on advancing your career, just to get fucked over by your body a couple of years later. 
4	I think the reason you shouldn't embrace regret is the same for shouldn't embrace any negative emotion. It means resisting rather than accepting reality, and being stuck in an illusion of the past not being past. But like anything else regret is a natural response to when things didn't go right. If that feeling is there it means that there's something to resolve. It's not like you sat down and decided to be regretful, there is no rational process involved. It's not even irrational, no more than a physical pain would be. So it's less about how you shouldn't be regretful and more about how you should handle it - as you said, you should focus on learning and moving forward
3	>I think we have technically no reason to feel regret ever.\n\nThe idea that one will not regret anything is an ego trip and the inability to learn from the past likens one to a wild animal.\n\n>What are your thoughts on what regret is and what to do about it?\n\nLearn from regret, or don't and repeat your mistakes precisely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	I try to leave the past in the past. Could’ve, should’ve, would’ve I try not to think about. 
2	Regret only has a purpose before it happens. It is pointless after the fact!
2	Thank you for sharing your thoughts on that subject. I like your logic, it sounds like you're advocating unconditional love. I won't play the smartass on that one because I want to believe. Comments will be interesting... talking about regrets to inferior Si, blind Fi
2	Well.. your past shapes the present. It in someway becomes a part of you.. or doing a certain action in the past has shaped your present.. perhaps in a negative way. if it was in a negative way, you'd wish you weren't in this current situation of ours and so you "regret" or wish you hadn't made a particular choice in the past.\n\nRegret comes from wishing you hadn't done something in the past.. all because of how that choice has affected you in the present. 
2	What about regretting things you *didn't* do? And now can't do? That one gets me. In fact, anticipation of that one gets me. 
1	It is a useful evolutionary trait and helps us to become the different person that we are now. Usually regrets are associated with making an incorrect social decision. We are not born with the ability to socialize at the expected level that a normal human adult can. We have to make those neural connections. \n\nSocial success leads to better mate variety and selection, which improves chances of producing viable offspring. The first mammals to have the ability to regret making poor social decisions probably saw a marked increase in group cooperation which would translate to better survival rates as well.
1	Sorry I was an asshole.  Oh wait, not sorry.  That wasn't even me! The guy you want doesn't exist anymore.  Sorry.  Oh, wait!  Not sorry again!  
1	I agree with you, and I'd add that it reminds me of "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" by Kundera. If you haven't already, you should read it. I'm sure it'll speak to you. 
3	Where to take test?	Which free sites are the best for taking the personality test?\n\nI’ve used 16personalities and once got INTP, and latest test ~6 months ago got ENTP.\n\nWhile I understand that from day to day your answers may be different and the outcome may therefore be different, I think I read somewhere that 16personalities was not so extensive as others (can’t remember which ones)
3	When I may be honest:\nThis putting oneself into boxes just because of an model fitting is very stupid. I would have the same problem, but I don't call it 'problem'. I did the test 5 times, 5 times ENTP. A lot of things changed recently so I did it again. So I am INTP. \nWell, I feel absolutely comfortable with. Since I've seen that the difference is just one letter and when you're quite in the middle of both than the model gives you a different outcome. \nDon't stick to the declaration debater or logician too much. Try to find out more about these things. \nSurely, you can take different tests, but my oppinion is not to try test over test all the time. Go deeper into the discription, you will find out, what fits more or less. \n\nAnd here is a very good discription for that: \nhttps://junglove.net/type-vs-type-entp-or-intp/\n

3	I'm making Radical Choices, and i want opinions. Can you help me?	**I quit my job.**  I was bored, tired of the endless loop. I'm now unemployed, sitting at my computer, watching Youtube videos on how to find out what i want to do, and what i can do to get started . My passion, so to speak.   ^((These videos, i assume i am not getting side tracked on useless stuff, i assume.)) I'v been procrastinating for years, never investing the time into anything helpful.  I have either done work/school and then spent the rest of my time playing video games and eating food. It's helped me ignore the hate i had of working simple entry position jobs. No amount of "charm" or "competence" helped me get promoted and succeed in the workplace. There was always someone with the power... to prevent me from achieving my goals, *regardless* of what i did. Perhaps, it was because of the work ethic the people around me had, maybe i wasn't doing my best and didn't know it. I don't know for sure. At the end of the day, nothing i did was enough to move me forward. I tried doing college, ^((Computer Engineering, never got through introduction classes after getting fed up with how insane the prices was for almost no information))  but i was also working at the same time, and that work drained me of the **will** to continue. I lost the resolve to finish college and **wasted** ***2 years*** out of High School working entry level jobs. I found next to no success, even after changing what i did to see if something else would work. After finding myself in an endless loop, i decided i was done with playing games.\n\nNow that i have left my job, i'm trying to focus on the next steps. My procrastination hasn't show up since i quit my job. I'v been spending most of my entire day dedicated on learning from many different resources. Even now as i write this, i feel fantastic knowing i have nothing keeping me away from doing what i want. I now have the drive to do something, to avoid the horrible pain of being bored and never finding a way into a better position. I have a reason to stop being lazy and unproductive. If i don't do anything, i will keep being sad, mad, and start going crazy. To step down from this, i am now trying to focus on what is most important to me. I'm going to find another way, a better way.\n\nNow i have a goal. I need to pay *$200* rent to my parents, who i am still with, because i can't afford to live on my own. I need to pay this, and other fees i can't get rid of, like a phone service bill, and car insurance. The thing that matters most is the $200 rent fee.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm trying to focus on doing something that can pay *$200* a month and work on doing some sort of business i haven't figured out yet. I'm fortunate to have this, very fortunate. I'm now trying to make the  best of my time. I'm looking for ideas on what i could do. I'm trying to waste less time looking around on my own, and maybe hear it from someone else who has done something like this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you don't know what your talking about, then don't say anything. I want facts, not maybe or untested theory.  On the other hand, if you got some solid advice, i would really appreciate to hear from you and what things i could be doing better. What things i could be doing. Maybe questions i am not asking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!  :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I didn't ignore this post, [https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/asxlqz/guide\_on\_starting\_a\_business\_how\_to\_take\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/asxlqz/guide_on_starting_a_business_how_to_take_the/)  This advice is being considered, but i'm still thinking through it. 
3	What are you better than 90% of the population at? 
3	I would learn a [trade](https://www.trade-schools.net/articles/trade-school-jobs.asp) if I were you. \n\nIt doesn't really matter what it is, as long as you don't hate to do it and it pays okay. Then you can use this money invest in a business.
4	To summarize, you have bills you need to pay, are currently unemployed, and are seeking some ideal business to join/make? Reality check: beggars can't be choosers. In situations like yours, it's prudent to treat job seeking as a full time job (or even part time job). Allocate 20-40 hrs a week toward seeking a job, applying for jobs, interviewing for jobs, etc.\n\nHate your 9-5 job? Join most of humanity. Even the SJs often hate their day to day jobs. It's a human thing to feel constrained and subordinated. The only difference between the J's and the Ps (and the SJs and NPs in particular) is the Js recognize they need to suck it up (that's canonically SJ advice).\n\nYour head is currently in the clouds. So an alternative option for you is to set a time limit. Apply for unemployment, and give yourself 6 months to start something up. If you fail, give up this dream and go back into the workforce. \n\nAnother option is to sell your body to porn 
2	What industry are you planning to enter?
2	Try UpWork to get a sense of what skills people/employers are paying for. I thought myself social media marketing, expanded skillset to dabble in analyzing ice, and now I work full time at a startup. I don’t have a college degree and I worked full time as an Uber/Lyft driver before this. It can be done, you just need to know WHAT to look for/work towards to. \n\nGood luck! 
6	Why does my ENTP friend do this?	Hi, I'm not an ENTP but my friend is, and I've been having the same problem with him since we met and actually ghosted him for a while but I keep seeing the same pattern repeating itself. \n\nLet me know if I'm not explaining myself well but basically he starts to feel like he's sort of intrusive/possessive about my ideas/projects that have nothing to do with him. I'm a creative person and whenever I tell him I'm working on a project it's like he HAS to know all the details before anyone else so he can be "in the loop" and then go brag about everything he knows that other people don't. And he'll try to insert himself into my projects and take credit for them when he hasn't done anything. Like just yesterday I mentioned an idea I had that I'd just started working on and he goes "Oh you should do this..." and basically repeats what I'd said but reworded, just so he can say it was partially his idea later. And now he has it in his head that this is somehow a joint thing, meanwhile I'm the one working my butt off to make it happen and he's done nothing but tell me my own idea reworded. So now he thinks he can tell me how/where to first reveal it, and who to show it to, and he's saying I have to show it to him first before I show anyone else...\n\nSorry this is turning into a rant but we've had this issue before and I've explained it to him that I feel uncomfortable making him a part of work that's so personal to me and he has nothing to do with. I end up putting up a wall because it feels like he's invading a part of me.\n\nSo just wondering if any ENTPs would know why he does this, and how I can get through to him that it really just makes me want to put a huge barrier between us? I like having him as a friend and I don't want to end up so put off by him that I end up ghosting him again for months because I feel like I'm being violated.\n\n(Also sorry if I'm posting this in the wrong place, let me know if this isn't the right sub for this kind of thing!)\n\nThank you!
15	In my opinion? Just be honest with him and tell him how you feel. He probably doesn't realize he's taking credit, but is just excited to share what you guys are working on with other people.
14	My guess here is that he likes you, thinks your ideas are cool, and wants to be involved or have input because it excites him and he has no idea that feeling isn’t reciprocated. 
3	What do i think? Tell them what is on your mind. Don't sugar coat it. Don't let them take you off track and never get a resolution. Don't be rude about it. That is what i think. 
3	I don’t recognise it from ‘my’ ENTP’s. They get protective of me and like to feel included in a sense, so they will pick my brain if I have an idea or plan and I know that is their way of showing interest and wanting to help me. Regularly that does lead to repetition of what I had already figured out, I recognise that one :D. I take it more of a confirmation that I was indeed on the right track, and I am grateful they are supportive of me.\n\nBut taking credit for it? Hm no. I would just discuss it with him, I understand it can get really frustrating. One of the things I appreciate about them is that I can simply say I don’t like it when they do this or that, and why. As they usually have such good intentions, that can sting a bit but I’ve noticed they care about whether I am comfortable. So don’t wait till the point of blowing up or ignoring him again, try the more direct approach :). I hope you two can sort this out!
5	Sounds like your friend is an ENTJ? They tend to like to take control of things a bit more than an ENTP. I'm kind of in between, and I think if you tell him straight up how you're feeling  he'll back off. He's probably just not self-aware of the fact that he's making you uncomfortable.
2	Well, don't keep your thoughts to yourself, he can't read your mind! If you think he's being intrusive, or being repetitive/annoying by rewording your ideas, just tell him! He will appreciate the honesty:) 
29	How would you react if somebody found a proof that the meaning of life is eating and drinking?	By proof I mean an absolute and irrefutable proof. The kind of proof that leaves no doubt that eating and drinking is the one and only meaning of life, all else being just self deceipt.\n\nI was discussing this with a friend and I realised it would destroy me. A large part of my view on life revolves around not knowing the meaning of it and building my own. However, if someone proves to me there IS a meaning and it is exactly the one they are saying my whole worldview would crumble. I guess it's because of Ti and its inability to ignore facts, thus discarding everything that accepts the lack of a concrete meaning of life. I would feel betrayed by logic and reason, knowing that what has been my guide my whole life has turned into a tyrannical leash pulling me towards a destiny that lacks any personal meaning nor importance. 
21	This belies the idea of a meaning, really.  The way you view meaning is nonretractable.  Even if the *purpose* of your life were discovered to be that you eat and drink because you fertilize a farm for growing some galactic Titans produce, the meaning that you create for that is always the only meaning that will matter.   
6	In a similar vein, I recall a conversation I was having with some friends a while back. The topic was that we encounter an infinitely wise genie, and get to ask him one single question - anything we want (but no nonsense crap like "how do i get more questions" which get categorically rejected).\n\nAfter a bit of thought, I decided a good question to ask was "are we alone?" In other words: is life elsewhere in the universe? It was acknowledged as a good question amongst friends, but the followup was tougher to answer: "what would you do if the answer is that we're the only life in the universe?"\n\nI'd be mostly confused, and a bit pissed. What are the odds? (infinitesimally small.) I could only imagine the type of responses that religions would begin to espouse, and philosophically all we'd really be able to say is "well, just because it's a 0.000000000005% probability doesn't mean it couldn't have happened..." In other words, it'd give direct credence to religious arguments, I think. Not proof, mind you, but a significant supporting argument. It's be a massive prediction made by some religions (counter to scientific predictions) which is actually supported.\n\nSo I'm not sure I'd call it a "betrayal" of logic and reason that leads  to this despondence. But rather a *contradiction* of airtight logic. In that, we take something we're extremely confident about, like the reflexivity property of mathematics "x = x", and get shown that's actually logical nonsense. It just leads to a human 404 error.
3	Since meaning is arbitrary, I wouldn‘t be bothered by someone else‘s understanding of the meaning of life. There can be no „proof“ of meaning. It is not universally defined, even though many individuals attempt to make a universal truth out of it, it does and will always depend on the individual. — and that would be what I would define the universal truth of the meaning of life as.
2	Don’t forget sleeping and breathing 
2	First of all, I'm a Christian. To me, the meaning of life is to glorify my creator. \n\nSecond, I am also an ENTP. Duh. You see my flair. This means I am a slave to the truth no matter how uncomfortable it makes me. I assume we're all like that, I might be wrong. \n\nThird, I am a carnivore. Not by choice. I cannot eat any plant matter aside from trace amounts such as seasonings or I get sick all the time among other problems. \n\nThis would mean the meaning of life for me is to kill so that I may live. That's kind of dark. It would also mean my religion is wrong, or I've been interpreting it wrong. Perhaps the great heavenly feast after the end times is the end goal my God had in store for us. Maybe eating of his flesh and drinking of his blood(metaphorically, I'm not catholic) is really the core of Christendom. 
2	Its pretty similar to a scenario used by the stoics. They liken us to dogs chained to a cart and life/fate being the cart. You can either be dragged along or go along with it. \n\nSimilarly, if the meaning of life was proven to you, you can either accept it and go along or be dragged along by it. However, it doesnt change the fact that the choice is up to us to decide our attitude. Personally, I think our attitude we come up with in facing this ‘leash’ gives us personal meaning and importance.\n\nEven if you have solid proof, theres nothing stopping you from having your own defined meaning in life. Lets say humans, as animals are born into the word to reproduce and lead to the growth and survival of their race. This does not stop individual humans from coming up with their very own life purpose. Biologically all they are need is to have offsprings but still come up with their very own purpose in life anyways.
1	I mean... I’d be pretty stoked since eating and drinking is one of my favorite things (though I recently gave up drinking). 
1	That is my purpose of life already
1	I'd pour a tall one.
1	Considering that I take this statement seriously, if life has an irrefutable, absolute meaning, I would trust myself to have discovered it eventually through trial and error. It's like having a spoon, it has one function, two at best, but you're using it for other things. You \*can\* use it for other things, but it is better suited for something else, which you should eventually discover.\n\nAnd if I don't take it seriously, it wouldn't really affect my belief system all that much, since there isn't much of a belief system to begin with.
1	Here I am scrolling through Reddit minding my own business and this post pops up. \n\nThe things you ENTPs talk about... lol. \n\nIt's like getting a look inside my mother's mind, who spent my entire childhood hitting me over the head with Ne-Ti. When I learned what word salad was when I got a bit older? I told her she was speaking in it when her Ne went into overdrive. I wasn't wrong, but I got glared at and told that I was an arrogant contrarian insufferable demon of a teenager. Good times, I always enjoyed our banter and I still do. 
1	The meaning of life is to replicate/pass on genes. We are nothing more than complex vessels for DNA to facilitate replication through. At least, that's the "intention" of life (if you will permit a phrasing that implies planning in a process that's actually random and emergent)\n\nAlthough as a cognizant human I have the ability to act on my own drives instead of the biological imperative. As such, I'll probably never have biological children. Take that, billions of years of evolution!
1	Honestly, not a thing would change for me. Idgaf what the true meaning of life is.
1	Honestly, even if it was an irrefutable fact, I would probably just consider it for a couple of weeks and then decide that just drinking and eating wasn't going to satisfy me. I don't like the phrase "the meaning of life", because even if there were an universal one, I wouldn't feel much concerned about it. \n\nI honestly prefer doing whatever fulfills me, regardless of what "the meaning" behind it all is. I don't think it'll influence the only certain thing in the universe, which is death. I don't think we should search for meaning in life, it risks our enjoyment of our time alive, which is considerably short. 
1	Eating and drinking has a direct effect on that your well being. So, if someone eats too much, he gets sick or develops all kinds of diseases leading to an early death. Hence nature is designed to prevent people from living to their fullest or you could say that you cannot 'realise this meaning' beyond a certain point. You can surely end up not realising it significantly though, by simply being born somewhere in Somalia and dying of starvation or thirst.
1	I mean we all live to have humans continue thriving (people disagree on what this menas) anyway so I don’t see how this would be anyway.
1	Continue with my day, it’s all I do, after all.
1	The language, since the day it has evolved with cognition, was the day of joy and sorrow, as the consequences were the half-truths that came with it. This is now.\n\nWe must transcend all evidence as nothing can ever be completely evident. We "go" with the "evidence" for the lack of alternatives, but who decides what is true if not the organ that accepts all things at face value? What else does is believes in? God? Self? Physical reality? \n\n2+2=4 seems like an undeniable truth on paper and to the eye but is still an idea, an idea is a gross oversimplification of a phenomena, and since we cannot know how deep does the rabbit hole goes, nothing can ever be concluded, everything has to be accepted for what it is - one big everything.\n\nSo, when something leaves no doubt, it is still completely relies on your own cognitive devices, of genetic and cultural origin. Read above.
1	How certain are you that you're actually an ENTP?\n\nBeing crushed that the 'meaning of life' isn't what you had hoped it would be doesn't sound very ENTP at all. Just the fact that you can begin to imagine a reality where ANYTHING is absolute and irrefutable is CRAZY to me. Read the description for ENFJ and tell me if it sounds closer.\n\n'Meaning of life' is an inherently subjective phrase. What does that even mean? I can spin 'meaning of life' to mean any number of things if I talk enough.\n\nWith this in mind: Learning this "truth" to me it would have EXACTLY the same effect as if I had learned that the sole purpose of Kablorb was to Goosh and Flirp - It wouldn't change anything AT ALL. Might as well be gibberish.
1	As a Baha'i, today is the first day of our fast...refraining from food and drink from sunrise to sunset, so I find it pretty cool that I got a notification for this. Lol As if not eating (not drinking is much more difficult) was hard enough, only to be reminded of it. 😄\n\nI would be distressed, I'd imagine, if the purpose of life was so trivial as to eat and drink. I think there could be multiple purposes of life. The material purpose is to procreate.  I think the ultimate purpose is to grow spiritually. \n\n"I bear witness, O my God, that Thou hast created me to know Thee and to worship Thee. I testify, at this moment, to my powerlessness and to Thy might, to my poverty and to Thy wealth. There is none other God but Thee, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting." -- Baha'u'llah
1	Utilitarianism
1	What would you do if someone found an irrefutable proof that the meaning of life is NOT eating and drinking and transitioning the human species to sustaining on pure breath alone?\n\nA la, Professor Arnold Ehret's Mucusless Diet Healing System.
1	Life would be boring
1	What about reproducing?\n\nThat is pretty intrinsic to being an organism. 
1	Your life has whatever meaning you put into it. You will die for what you believe one way or the other. If you yearn for more I would imagine you would find life more meaningful. If you learned that there is more than embracing it makes sense. If you don’t believe in more and have no contact with Moore and no desire for more, I wouldn’t worry about it. Strengthening your will is usually about relieving yourself of doubts. If you don’t know your own mind and there are shadows there that you have not explored, then uncertainty will continue to plague you.
1	The bible says that there’s nothing better for a man to do, than to eat, drink, and enjoy his work, so there’s that. [Ecclesiastes 2:24]
1	I found it a liberating thought that there is no objective ‘meaning’ to life unless you consider survival and having children from a simple biological point of view. \n\nWhich doesn’t mean I don’t experience meaning in my life, I do. But I realise it’s subjective and my choice how I choose to implement and experience it.\n\nIf anything, the realisation has made me more joyful :). 
1	I am quite agnostic to the idea of a universal meaning for life. 
1	What if the proof of the proposition was only graspable by a few select very brilliant mathematicians in the world...but nevertheless it was completely true.   That is, you couldn't personally hope to understand it, but it is nevertheless true.   In other words you have to take their verification on faith. How would that affect your thinking?\n\nSecondly, suppose you could readily understand the proof and accept it as true.  Why would that matter?  What would it actually change about your life *except* to dispel any and all of those deceits?  How is that not liberating instead?  I mean I'm kinda used to Ti shattering things I think are true...which is what I prize most about it.  You would now know the purpose of life.  But that doesn't rule out that you can have other, personal ones. \n\nThe only things which go into my 'worldview' are things I have some probability associated with, like the non-existence of God.  I don't see any good argument for it, I see no absolute benefit or qualitative difference in the lives of his worshippers, and I understand that a logical proof is not possible as the question of his existence is logically absurd.   I don't have any 'grand scheme' of the universe ideas and I don't see how you could even get them from a purely Ti process. \n\nSo if there was suddenly some proof of God, and I mean physical proof because there can be no logical one, it still wouldn't destroy my worldview.  I would just say "whoops, really fucked that one up" and probably become a theologian who wanted to study him.   (Incidentally I'm having trouble thinking of what would constitute proof.  It can't merely be super science because you can otherwise never rule out aliens.)\n\n

8	How are we supposed to  know your weaknesses? You haven't really told us about yourself; just what you've scored on personality tests. ;)
1	For starters, you're not specific enough (is that the kind of weakness you're looking for? Idk) . What kind of description do you want that the tests you have done do not provide? Also, what kind of description? You've pretty much done that yourself already, what else would you like others to add? 
1	***Your are a potato, consumed by starving Irish hippies.*** 
1	Triple avoidant, want ease and can neglect things that should be dealt with, don't like being alone.
1	And what can I add to describe myself better xD
56	All ENTPs are all out being interesting on a Friday night, quick, what do you guys really think of these pricks?	I'll start: I wish I was out being interesting on a Friday night. 
72	Ah yes what are you fellow introverts, who are not ENTPs, doing tonight. As someone whose type is not ENTP, I do not feel ashamed to be using reddit tonight. I do hear ENTPs are great though. They're charming, funny, smart and they have huge penises
42	My ENTP husband is researching something really boring because my conversation about my inner feelings was too much for him. Haha
28	I've shamed myself and my community with my title. 
24	This is as interesting as it get, *are you ready for this*\n\npick a fight with people on reddit, argue, eat, go to bed at 10 pm. \n\nThat's what I do on my *crazy crazy* Friday nights
19	How dare you assume we're all interesting. I'm watching Live PD at home. 
13	Worked all day producing murder shows. Hosted my podcast, and now it’s time to drink red wine and smoke some weed! 
11	Enjoy the satisfaction that some of us will be hungover tomorrow as well. 
10	Welp I just finished playing dnd : / it was very fun and productive
8	I was going to argue with you since I’m usually never doing cool things on fridays but damn if I didn’t have an orchestra gig playing for Korea’s 100th anniversary of independence from Japan. 
4	I lost any FOMO I had years ago so I'm happy to be home watching Mr. Show and waiting for the juicy gossip about the ENTPs while they're out having fun.
4	Tensed as I am not tensed everyone's been freaking out and studying for our university internal examination while I think there is not much to study but seeing everyone study makes me feel I've not studied but then when I open my books I feel what is there to study. And finally I ended up arguing with myself weather I was being overconfident or everybody else was being stupid! 
3	Playing videos game and crushing drinks what else \n
3	I was doing physics for the competition the whole day, then I debated with my INTJ sister while eating chicken nuggets and went to sleep.
3	Why don't you go out and do something interesting? Do you lack friends? No excuse. Use meetup apps. Half your city is at your fingertips. Get a hobby and do something. Need help? Drop some ecstasy first. 
3	I'm at home being interesting. Who needs to leave?\n\nIt's 2am. Been working on Motion Graphics for my next youtube video   \n/ documentary thing since I woke up at 9. I should really get some sleep but it's so hard to drag myself away.
2	They are rlly energetic and fun lol, as a entj I just stayed home, rather be out too
2	Was working (service industry) aaaand now I'm drinking. 
2	I was in a latte pouring competition. Lost horribly, but made my INFJ friend join me. Got my car towed and already filed an appeal for the ticket. Seems like a regular ENTP night. 🙃 
2	Going to the gym, then drink good wine, then play old games with friends, then go out with friends and drink some more. Probably wont be in that order.
2	Woke up after a night of partying with the bros. Now I’ve got to go to work though. :sad face:
2	Drank a cup of coffee did some smelling salts and put up a bench press pr with my roommate
2	Hungover
1	Playing Far Cry 4 because last tike I got bored and didnt finish it
1	Well I almost planned a get together but because we only started planning it 15 hours beforehand it didn't work. Then I got my new computer parts and sold my old graphics cards. Then I played rainbow six with a  bunch of toxic people.
3	What’s the most fun topic to talk/debate about? What grinds your gears and gets you talking like a mad man?	Personally the idea of flat earth bugs me a lot and the idea that we’re the only beings in the entire universe does too.
11	I consider talking like a madman a sign that it's time to stop, lol.\n\nThe stuff that grinds my gears usually isn't worth talking about. It's either shit like flat earth theory, which really only deserves ridicule or it's something like an uninformed opinion on a matter I know more about than the person I'm talking too. Unless I'm getting paid it's not worth my time. But sometimes, I just can't resist when I should know better. \n\nLike I'm interested in conspiracy theories and why people believe them but I'm not really interested in engaging genuine conspiracy theorists because there's virtually no chance that I can convince them that they're wrong. It's like talking to an INFP.\n\nA good example of the latter is politics. Almost everyone has political opinions but most of them are complete garbage if you examine them critically (especially the ones you regularly encounter on platforms like Reddit). \n\nMy solution? I'm trying to spend less time on Reddit and more time reading. Why engage a 25 yo college dropout that unironically believes that the current US administration is the best thr country has ever seen when I could read the works of genuine experts?
4	For me usually the topics I enjoy the most are the ones that I have never thought about. Give me a new idea or a new perspective on an idea I know and I'm yours. Those are the discussions where I learn the most about myself and the world in general.\n\nWhat grinds my gears and gets me worked up is any discussion where a person supports an idea that makes absolutely no sense and is actually proven to be false, like for example what you said about flat earthers. However, usually instead of making me talk like a madman what it gives me is a desire to punch said person in the face, because chances are no talking is going to convince them and the punch will at least make me feel better.
5	You
5	Philosophy 
3	Probably over historical events, and people who are socialist just- I don’t get it. Cool question
3	Politics, specifically Economics 
2	Economics. Especially when people use anegdotes and biases as proofs for their claims...
2	I really enjoy space and future possible events and future possibilities, Fermi Paradox, string theory, Dyson spheres, terraforming and beginning life in new planets.\n\nUsually to get me fired up is when someone tries to come around with their ignorant, ridiculous dumbass opinions and impose them on others. Think the hobby lobby case, abortion, gun control, vaccinations, shit like that.
2	Lord of the Rings vs Harry Potter. Always good for a debate as long as you're on the winning side with the Hobbits. 
2	Anything that doesn‘t quite make sense or seems incomplete and/or not properly thought through.\n\nI generally love theories. I‘ll engage the most in those. And I cannot shut up when we‘re talking about philosophical topics such as existence. My mom knows all those times when I turned a breakfast into a 2/3 hour TED talk, but she‘s an INFJ, she‘ll/does understand.
2	What usually gets me going is seeing how ideas can be generalized, and how we can use already existing solutions to new problems/how we can improve already existing knowledge to create new things.
2	Flat Earthers, Anti-Vaxxers, Feminists... 
1	Anti-social justice discussions give me a headache and are usually just devil's advocate shit, but in the hindering way from the place of someone who's free to give their two bits and move on because they're unaffected anyway.\n\nCould go on for days about Japanese sociocultural climate and history to weebs

8	My friends keep comparing me to Barney and Chandler	I'm not complaining. I like Barney from HIMYM and Chandler from Friends. I personally think that they're best ones. Maybe I'm biased haha but being compared to these 2 characters constantly is pretty interesting. I think they're both ENTPs too so I guess it makes sense. \n\nBut yeah, what other characters are you constantly compared with? \n\n&#x200B;
6	Barney for me! I take it as a compliment, that man is a fucking legend
4	ENTP is pretty much the best characters in all the tv shows. \n\nTV likes to give ENTPs the thoughts and ideas of an INTP but also be an ENTP. 
2	But got time to comment on this, yeah you sound real busy pal
3	>being compared to these 2 characters constantly is pretty interesting\n\nHow is that even remotely interesting? I get occasionally compared to House because I'm a grumpy prick sometimes (or because they think I'm a genius, but I think it's the former). \n\nBottom line is, people will point out superficial resemblances all the time. It's part of making small talk. Personally, I think if you're constantly compared to a fictional character it means you lack any depth because most fictional characters are just regurgitations of cultural archetypes. 
1	Barney is a legend lol
1	I was compared to Monk once, other times to Sheldon Cooper.
1	>But yeah, what other characters are you constantly compared with?\n\nNone as an adult, but a few as a child - you'd have to guess!\n\n&#x200B;
0	>But yeah, what other characters are you constantly compared with? \n\nNone, because my friends are I are too busy discussing deep and complicated ideas rather than menial trite. 
2	Need Answers (Totally Unrelated to this sub)	With retail stores, banks, and even some service  sector companies ditching brick and mortar store fronts, commercial property use is starting to transition. (I'll send raw data, if your interested)\n\nTransition to what? \nThat's what I need want your opinion on. \n\nMy strange hobby of 2018 was collecting and organizing US commercial real estate data. I by no means have collected enough data for a full picture, but it seems a lot of old retail space is being converted to senior living. \n\nSenior Living might be the "best use" for the next ten years or so, but what afterwards? \n\nAs anyone run into any interesting ideas for how to utilize old retail space? [d6,h4]\n \n
3	In the area I live most out-moded retail spaces have become service and entertainment. Restaurants and bars, places where you can drink a coffee while playing board games, adventure dating attractions, and micro-brews, and specialty grocers. \n\nMost manufacturing, had become condos, and food markets.
3	>d6,h4\n\nPawn to e5
1	Landfill, solar array, regular housing, farm, wind farm, mine, warehouse, distribution \n  \nEach location has different needs and different optimal use cases
1	Any senior living is going to be good for much more than the next 10 years.  \n\nMaybe some of it can be converted back to natural space: parks, playgrounds, trees, etc. I mean things like strip malls, shopping malls, etc. Less so commercial space on city blocks, etc.
73	Self development books I think are good for ENTPs	Title. Feel free to add your own\n\n“Grit” by Angela Duckworth. This was is a cold shower because it forces you to realize that being the smart kid actually means very little in how successful you’ll be in life. We tend to be the smart ass who never follows through so there’s that. But the book also provides good, science-based advice on how to develop your grit and how to build a call (or mission) for your life. Worth checking out.\n\n“So good they can’t ignore you” by Cal Newport. Explains success and why some people “make it” and some not in a very logical and fact-based way. It was a breath of fresh air from the vague cookie cutter nonsense that a lot of self help books give you.\n\n“Deep work” by Cal Newport. Kind of a follow up to the previous one. Fact-based and deliciously rational. Also a cold shower because it basically yells at you “get focused you *fuck*”, but I never hear it enough.\n\n“40 ways to be miserable” by I don’t remember. Just some basic advice that a self-sabotaging idiot like me needed. CGP Grey made a video about it if you want a summary.
22	Does alcohol count as a self development book? 
31	The subtle art of not giving a fuck by mark manson is nice for some positive reaffimment that we are right
7	Every fucking ENTP needs to read or listen to "Can't hurt me" by David Goggins, that's it, no other book for so called self help.
17	Those kinds of books are just mental masturbation. I have never heard a story of success starting from a self help book that was not a pitch to sell the book. And this is coming from someone who has read dozens of them. It just never sticks. In the end it's just a lot of text meant to motivate you and nothing more. It's information you add from the outside. It can help with some things, but it won't affect your brain that much because it's not really connected to anything that can make it stick.\n\nI think the best way to change your way of handling life is by thinking and building your own ideas, not by passively absorbing someone else's. Also if you actually examine most of these books the information provided is quite obvious and chances are you were actually aware of it, so it's even less new information. If your idea bucket is empty and you want to actually find new ideas to think about try Nietzsche (if you can understand what the fuck he is trying to say most of the time) or any random philosopher that you have heard of at some point in your life. Usually what they say is not that obvious and requires reading the same thing a few times because it's so fucking complex your mind can't really comprehend the whole idea on the first try. Overall this means you will spend quite a bit of time analyzing their ideas to understand them by basically building up their idea in your own Ti-vision of the world, and once you understand what they mean the idea will stick with you for much longer, because even if someone else came up with it you spent a lot of time actively thinking about it and trying to understand it.\n\nActually now that I think about it, I would love to see an experiment where they try to teach some kids a concept giving a control group a full text and another group the same text except taking out a word from every second sentence, and see which group understands it better and remembers it longer. My bets would be on the kids who had the edited text.
6	I would 100 percent recommend stoicism, if you want a simple book read the daily stoic. in my experience stoicism is very compatible with our personality, it makes up for what we sometimes lack.
5	I have been reading like 8 pages of 'Grit' every couple months for the last 2 years.\n\nBasically sums up my relationship with books. Guess I'm just too zoomer unmedicated ADHD'd out to pay attention long enough. Works well for my job in ads though.
4	> by Cal Newport\n\n> by Cal Newport\n\nThe year I read Cal Newport's blog posts was the year I became truly organized and productive. I think his system works for me because it creates sooooo much free time. Like, he basically says, "Why study on a Friday night when you should be partying?" and I think that's a beautiful message. You can replace "partying" with "reading," "Wikipedia-bingeing," or "butterfly-collecting," but the point is your time belongs to YOU, not to your work.
3	The one by I don't remember looks interesting. Might give it a read
3	Two self-help books that actually give you the means to do something about yourself: "Getting Things Done" by David Allen and "The Tools" by Phil Stutz and Barry Michels. \n\nDavid Allen coaches CEOs and other influential people on how to be effective at being productive. Half of it explains the concepts the other half helps you set it up. Really good stuff because it allows you to be productive with minimal effort. Every ENTP should implement this book in their life!\n\nPhil Stuttgart and Barry Michels give you actual psychological "tools" that you can implement to improve yourself. Instead of being told by psychologists why you are the way you are, these tools help you improve yourself and fix problems: increase confidence, motivation, remove procrastination, do things you dislike. \n\nUsing the above books I moved up four positions in nine months. They work!
2	I’d like to recommend 48 laws of power, if not everyone here has read it already 
2	Cal Newport’s books are good, I second the recommendation. \n\n“Atomic Habits” by James Clear is the best book on habits that I’ve read and very practical. You can implement the stuff from this book right away. \n\n“Why We Sleep” by Matthew Walker is practically required reading for just about anyone because even if you acknowledge the importance of sleep, I can almost guarantee you still vastly underestimate it. Will make you borderline neurotic about getting the right amount of sleep because of the countless studies on the benefits of sleep and the countless detriments to just about every measure of health when you’re sleep deprived (just 5 hours is already mild deprivation). \n\n“Why Buddhism is True” by Robert Wright. Interesting book that shows the ways in which eastern spiritual principles and neuroscience overlap. It’s also a good primer when it comes to the illusory nature of free will (along with “Free Will” by Sam Harris) which is helpful to know. \n\n“Influence” and “Pre-suasion” both by Robert Cialdini are also must reads, IMO. Great intros to the basics of social psychology. As social creatures and as people living in a world where we’re marketed to left and right, it’s important to be aware of how we’re being influenced and persuaded.\n\n“The War of Art” by Steven Pressfield (not to be confused with Art of War). Probably the most giftable book there is because it’s short enough to be read in about an hour or two and each passage is only a short paragraph. It talks about the struggle against the force of “Resistance” (i.e. procrastination, fear, avoidance) and the many forms it takes and the many ways it can trick you into not doing what needs to be done. It’s written from Pressfield’s perspective as a writer dealing with writer’s block, but applies to just about everyone. It’s so easy and so quick of a read that you can’t go wrong with this.
2	No shade to you OP. This is an ENTP rant about this subject. \n\nAs an ENTP I don't give a shit about self improvement. I had success being exactly how I am. Self improvement is bullshit that is fed to us by all the J's in the world. ENTP'S succeed by being the most important person in the room regardless if people even know it. We are the visionaries, the idea machines. Success comes from others benefiting from our influence. \n\nThe term Success is vague, idealistic, subjective, oppressing, non creative garbage.\n\nThe subtle art of not giving a fuck was the only self improvement book I have started to read.
2	Switch by Cheap and Dan Heath\nUnflattening by Nick Sousanis\nLiminal Thinking by Dave Gray\n\nThese are all books which actually lean into our ENTP nature, which I think is a much better approach than trying to work against it or 'fix up' our weaknesses. \n\nBusiness Model Generation - to teach you how tertiary Fe can be used to your advantage as an inventor.
3	Also, I found Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for Life to be useful and not so abstract. 
1	All sound like solid leads. Thanks OP.
1	> science-based advice on how to develop your grit and how to build a call (or mission) for your life. \n\nEh, the overall message of the book I got, but her Grit Scale came off a little too *Dianetics* for my taste
1	Self development Books, one of the most useless things ever created. \n\nJust educate yourself about social and natural sciences. Read some novels and you ll already have developed yourself.\n
1	I would add to this list Power by Jeffrey Pfeffer
1	48 Laws of Power\n\n16 rules of success\n\nIntelligent Investor \n\nThe Prince- Machiavelli \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\^ If your trying to go places
1	"Self-envelopment" books are great because the ego loves to build around itself, while you follow like a donkey on a leash.\n\nTao Te Ching goes a different path, the one of return... you will have to read more than one translation to get a picture out of the word.
1	Stoicism (Seneca) + Nietzsche\n\nHave a nice day.\n\nEdit: Also "The school of life" youtube channel. "12 rules for life" may help as well though i personally haven't read it.
1	JP's political agenda is as a classical liberal is basically mind your own business, seek truth, and don't be an SJW.  And the book is basically a guide on discipline and wisdom--something fathers have gotten away from teaching their children. Think for yourselves fellow ENTPs. 
11	All of my friends are INFP’s, what are yours?	I’m an ENTP and after having a slight obsession with Meyers-Briggs, I decided to introduce it to many of my friends. I would say I have about 10 people I converse very well and frequently with, and all of them besides for 2 are INFP. Some other people who I have recently met, but also had very intelligent/philosophical debates or discussions with have also stated they are INFP’s. It’s a little scary to me, and I was wondering if anyone else finds them attracting a certain type to this extreme level as well- or if they too tend to have quality relationships with INFP’s?
9	(INFP)  Whenever I run across INFP appreciation threads like these in other MBTIs I'm always like "Aw shucks, you're not so bad yourself, internet strangers!"\n\n&#x200B;
5	i am enfp and weirdly, a lot of the people i am close with are also infp. there’s something weirdly wonderful about them, they stick to their convictions like no one else and they’re very trustworthy. they are not people pleasers which i struggle with a bit, so yeah, basically pretty awesome people
5	My wife, my best man, and two other close friends are INFPs.  I'm also close to at least three INFJs.  We all joke that I'm the INFx whisperer.
4	Yup! Or at least most of my favourite people are. My sister, who I'm very close to, one of my best friends, and my beyond amazing SO. \n\nI find them easy to get along with as, not only are the ones I know fun and smart and interesting to talk to, they're really good trustworthy people who are generally upfront and sincere, and you know what they think about things.
4	That's interesting I only have one INFP friend and that's one of my best friends. The other two are ENFP and ENFJ. 
4	ENFP's. The ones I've met are extremely intelligent but I just can't stand their Fi-fueled rants.
3	My girlfriend is INFP\nMy best friend is ISTP
2	INFP, ESFP, INFJ, ENFJ
2	I think that according to the 16 personality type tests, the "diplomats" (enfp, infp, enfj, infj) are really common and easy to get along with. Since we're all just people, and diplomats tend to be plentiful, we find that a lot of people surrounding us are Infps, enfps and so forth. It's tempting to say that wow, as an ENTP im "attracted" to INFPS! Is this true for all ENTPS? Even if every single person on this sub corroborated this claim, it's still truth that we're just people with different experiences to differentiate us. Even if we have "similar brain processes," it's still a stretch to think that we're just randomly attracted to a certain type. 
2	I’m an INFP and my boyfriend is an ENTP. His roommate (who he’s really good friends with) is an INFP, two of their friends are, and I’m sure there are more. I guess we get along well, lol. 
2	Most of my friends are nfs
2	My close friends?\n\n4 INTP\n2 ESTP\n1 INFJ\n
2	This isn't unusual.  They tend to gather in packs, seeking each other out.  So even though they're only about 5% of the population, they usually tend to gather in pools -- usually pools of tears -- where they mutually support each other.  \n\nSince ENTPs are naturally charismatic and INFP just intuitively understand people at a deep level at first glance, they likely just glom onto you, like moths to a lone flame on a moonless night. \n\nOr do you have tissues in your pockets?  They might sense those.\n\n
1	INFP, INTP and an INFJ\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do I tag my type next to my name? ;-; I'm an INFP
1	Mainly INFJ and INTJ. I know a lot of INFP (and ENTJ) but not really close with them. 
1	Friends are :\nINFP, INTP, ENTJ and ISTJs. 
1	2 ENFP \n\n1 ENTP\n\n1 ESTP\n\n1 INFJ \n\n1 INFP
1	Don't know what my friends are, but my wife is an INFJ. That gets... Interesting
1	I have a lot of pretty diverse friends, but my three closet friends are ENFP, ENTJ, and INTP
1	Friends: ENTP, ENTP, ISFP, ISTP, ISTP, ISTP, IXTP, IXTP, ESTJ, ESTP (I talk to these people a lot and I show them the real me, we help each other)\n\n"Friends": INFP, INFP, INFP, ENFJ, ENFP (I appease these people regularly and keep them around so they may serve a use in the future, they are unstable)
1	All of my closest friends are entjs
1	Oldest friends that I’ve never once had drama with: ENTJ and ESTJ. Sooo easy to get along with. \n\nBest friend: ENTP. Similar to me in most aspects but so argumentative that I have to purposely avoid setting her off about certain things we disagree about since she can’t seem to entertain the possibility that she could ever be wrong. \n\nMe and the ENTP’s mutual close friend is an ISFP and she gets her feelings hurt way too easily by our ENTP friend. Gets doubly offended when I laugh at the absurdity of it. \n\nWas friends with an INFP for a year recently due to circumstance and everything upset her too. Nice girl but I have no idea how she functions in life. Really sweet and conveying of warmth, which was refreshing every now and then given that the rest of my friends are colder than me. 
1	All INXX with one ISTP
1	I noticed that alot of my close friends have been infps as well. I love them and we usually get along great but sometimes when I’m not careful I run into the problem of offending them or hurting their feelings and I feel a bit bad then. It’s funny because in high school almost all of my friends we NT types so I didn’t have to worry about that as much but now they’re mostly NF types
1	ENTPs are attracted to people who are good at listening our crazy shit, which is a core trait of INFPs. ENFPs are also keen to make friends with anyone interesting, so guess NTPs are a good subject for that. Also, people are often attracted to their introverted sidekicks and vice versa, since they have the same structure, but are balancing each other's ego strengths. Hence, NFPs, SFPs, NFJs (rare) NTPs tend to flock together within their I/E counterparts. Other common couplings (friend or spouse) are NTPs to NFJs or SFJs, NFPs to NTJs and STJs, NTPs to NFPs and ISTJs to ESP, ISFJs to ESTJs, ISFJs to ESFPs. Ahh.. XOXX or XOOX (swap X, keep O) are kind of frequent in sensors, quite often SJs and SPs seek for their own temperaments as well. Not enough data to make more accurate correlations from.\n\nPersonally, I have a very wide group of friends and acquaintances (and a very narrow of very good ones), but out of all types, I get along with NTPs and NFPs and NFJs the best. NTJs are the only intuitives that I haven't befriended that strongly due to very low encounter rate. NFJs are rare too, but somehow they come to me like moths find a light source in the darkness. The ENTJs I know are too focused on their career and doing everything they can that it's hard to get a hold of them, and I find them a bit uninteresting & clashing in terms of thinking. That Ti vs Te don't mix well. They're basically ESTJs with longer term goals and generally more ambitious. Also I don't think I've actually ever met an INTJ in a peer group to make friends with. Other instances yes, but the encounters have been too short, yet interesting.
1	All my friends are ESxJs. It's a struggle. \n\nOn the bright side my best friend is an INTP
1	My sole and absolute best friend is an INFP. She's a little dumb (or maybe I am too smart xD) but we get along really well, not to mention that we've currently fought are not talking to each other but I know all of it is temporary because we'll end up resolving issues no matter what. 
1	All my exes are infps. And some of my closes friends are infps. 10 in total. It is also scary to me why i keep attracting these INFPs and im also mad at the same time. 
1	My two best fiends are INFP (the person I connect with the most, I really like his personality and way of thinking), and ISFP (We don't connect as much as with the INFP friend, but there is a lot of trust betwteen us, and I really like how accepting and open-minded she is).
1	Have three INFP friends (2 I'm pretty close with), best bud is INTP and myriad of other types I guess. 
1	Either other ENTPs or xNFJs (mainly INFJs), got a couple of ISTP/ENFP friends too. Not too keen on INFPs, they seem to take everything very personal and I feel like I am walking on eggshells around them. They are also incapable of being logical.
0	ESTJs. Loooove me some ESTJs.
8	Is it possible to be completely apolitical ENTP?	A question to my fellow entps, I've been into history ever since I was a little kid and as I grew older I became also interested in politics and I am now looking for a career in the said field\n\nNow my question is, regardless of which way you swing politically right or left. I'm not trying to start a shit storm of argument here (entp board, lol) the question is more about an idea as a whole\n\nIs it possible for ENTPs to not have any interest in history or politics and etc? Like I'm crazy into politics and can talk about this shit for hours. Am I the only one and when it comes to debating other folks can and will debate only about music and movies? 
7	I honesty don't know.\n\nEven though I keep saying "No, I dislike talking about politics because it will break your relationship when your believes crash," in the end I still talk about politics for hours.
4	Nice timing. Last night I noticed my knowledge of American history is poor. I can't remember half the presidents, let alone their political affiliations or actions. Mostly because I never stayed on top of it past secondary school. \n\nMy interaction with modern politics isn't out of interest, but out of duty. As a voter, I think it's important to stay up to date on recent events so I can make informed voting decisions. So it's mostly a job in my eyes, and jobs suck. \n\nTheoretically, I do find analyses of political structures interesting. For instance, it seems tax plans (conservative vs liberal) depend on where you place more weight on economic duty (who has the most money, or where most of the money is). \n\nPolitically I tend to lean centrist on most issues. Either out of ignorance (E.g. trade agreements) or ambivalence (E.g. social issues like marriage). For example: I'll say I "support" gay marriage, but that's only superficially due to the political climate. My real view is more inquisitorial: marriage is by and large a religious construct, in spite of its conferred federal benefits. In other words, religious ideology and governmental ideology are interwoven into the concept, which I think is constitutionally invalid. It makes more sense to just throw marriage away to the religious folk, and instate federally recognize unions which are divorced from canonical marriages. \n\nOr another example would be abortions. I unilaterally support them, but there's a peculiarity in them. Late stage abortions are often advocated if the mothers health is in danger. So, what about post birth if the mother's *well being* as an adult is in danger? Pre-natal late stage abortion isn't really different from neo-natal *euthanasia*, as far as I can see. The only discriminator is birth, the transition from fetus → infant. So my argument is that *if* an abortion is advocated in late stage cases, then neo-natal euthanasia should simultaneously be allowed. Since neo-natal euthanasia is typically barred, I think the logical thing is to unilaterally oppose late stage abortions. \n\nWhat I'm getting at here is that political positions often don't make sense when inspected closely. They're almost always contradictory as far as I can see and are ethically self defeating. So then why take the stance at all? \n\nHence ambivalence, centrist, and sarcastic positions like the Regressive Party. Against abortions but for killing babies. 
3	If you want to do this for a living, then go ahead. Don't let us hippies tell you not to do something you want to do for a living. Best of luck.
3	I have no interest in politics... to an extent.\n\nThere are many reasons for this, but the main ones are two.\n\nOne is I cannot vote in the country I reside in because I have no citizenship. I can vote in my home country, but I do not know enough about how the system there works and the country itself is extremely corrupt to the point of requiring something bigger than electing a different party to be fixed.\n\nThe second reason is I do not believe in democracy. I know it's the best system we have, but I do not believe it's the most effective nor efficient we could have. Also I do not think I can come up with a better one, and much less with a way to implement it, so I prefer to stay out of all of it.\n\nHowever, as much as I want to stay outside, lately political discussions have been pissing me off to the point of making me want to punch people left and right (hehe). On one side I see a bunch of modern lefties offended by everything, who try to attack and silence any opinion that does not 100% agree with theirs, and it even seems they can't agree between themselves most of the time. On the other side the right wing edgelords who shape their whole personalities around exposing how stupid the former group can get. Both groups keep playing a stupid game where each group fuels the other group's hate by finding the dumbest individuals in the other group and using their words and actions against the whole group in their own circlejerk forums, subreddits and other platforms. Then media comes and spills gasoline over the fire by publishing overly sensationalist articles that only create more problems for everyone by spreading biased or even false information.\n\nI can rant on this for hours, but this is my main view on politics right now. It might sound I do not care about the world I live in, but that's not the case. I choose to leave politics to people who want to bother with them while I bother with thing I can actually influence in a meaningful way. Luckily I have been born with a brain that is relatively good at finding patterns and using it to solve problems is something I enjoy, so my goal in life is to find a way to use it in a way that helps humanity, so I'm going into academia. I am aware chances are I will never really contribute in a meaningful way to humanity in the field I have chosen, and still I find it more realistic for me to solve a millenium problem than to fix any problem we currently have in our political system.
3	Seriously of course yes...\n\nIt's a personality type, being apolipitical has nothing to do with a personality trait.
3	Seriously of course yes...\n\nIt's a personality type, being apolipitical has nothing to do with a personality trait.
3	I am also into both of those things. I will say that I definitely get tired of the culture surrounding politics. I don't really know any other ENTPs (I do have suspicions) so I can only speak for myself. I would think that most would be very interested in politics, but I could also see a bunch hating it because it often turns into the exact kind of conversation we hate. Less debate, more opinion and feelings. At least as an American, that's how I see it. Its kinda hell sometimes, because literally half of the people I talk to deny reality and any source I site. 
2	I'm usually ambivalent about those topics, because I either don't care enough to spend time forging a certain political stance and/or I'm just simply not knowledgeable.
2	I find it to be fairly common, because it is easy to confuse even ourselves when we are arguing for a point that we may not necessarily agree with etc. Also ENTPs seem to be one of the quickest types to change views and lifestyles which means by the time one is done sliding across the political spectrum they probably end up just moving on from the idea altogether in search of greater horizons
2	I won't debate about politics because my views on most issues are pretty dynamic, and there is something to be taken into account within most ideologies (though there is one in particular that I absolutely will not budge on).  I will debate music all day, every day, maybe because those kinds of debates are relatively meaningless.\n\nIn answer to your question, I can't imagine why it wouldn't be possible.  I don't think it's particularly probable for any NT to not have even a passing interest, because it's prevalent and a general term umbrellaing several concepts, but there are always exceptions to rules.

1	I sure as hell am not one. I'm shitty to people that I perceive as being shitty to the undeserving. I guess my perspective on it is more like a comedian and I want to take the piss out of the powerful and the brutish while trying to uplift the oppressed and downtrodden. I like to make people who seem entitled feel a little (read: a lot) more undeserving.   There is generally a political position that this would align with. 
1	Personally, I am not apolitical. However, I hate to speak politics. In my own country, the government is controlled by narrow-minded people. So, you know, the intellectuals became minority, we tend to show harsh reactions to the intolerable events.  Just, it is. You can't change a narrow-minded person's mind. Besides, I don't need to change the ideas of the other ones. Why should I bore myself with those stuff? Though, I still try to alter the minds of the taxi drivers by asking questions in a Socratic manner when I am drunk. In the end, I piss them off and nothing more. In addition, my father has been involved in provincial/national for many years. What I've seen is, provincial and national happen through nasty human tricks and people are garbage. I hate politics in my own country as a definite result.\n\nThough, I find my political knowledge base insufficient. I need to read the essential philosophical books on politics (Republic, Politics etc.). I need to re-learn world history. I need to follow the recent news. That's how I will be able to discuss politics truly.
1	I’m mostly apolitical because I don’t really see myself as having much power to change anything. And I also see political arguments as a waste of time and energy for the most part because nobody deliberately chooses to believe in what’s “wrong”, so you’re unlikely to sway anyone with even the most rational arguments. \n\nI’m also contrarian af and don’t really have any strong allegiances so my stance changes a lot as I gain more info and experiences. I went from left, to center, to center right, to center, and now further left than originally. And I still don’t take it all too seriously. \n\nEven in terms of D&D alignments, I always score as “True Neutral”. I know being overly neutral/centrist is a meme now, partly because it’s seen as indecisive, but I really don’t see anything wrong with it. 
0	>**Is it possible to be completely apolitical ENTP?** \n\nYa.\n\n>Now my question is, regardless of which way you swing politically right or left. \n\nWhichever personally benefits me at the time.\n\n>Is it possible for ENTPs to not have any interest in history or politics and etc\n\nYa.\n\n>Like I'm crazy into politics\n\nTerribly unfortunate, now, imagine putting that energy into playing the guitar or something.\n\n&#x200B;
6	I made an intj hate me today.	I was being my generally annoying self then he didn't talk to me thereafter.... Looks like I need to distance myself again. So, what should I do? Do I leave or do I stay? Do I beg for forgiveness? I can never keep friends, I really struggle with this.\n\n\nUPDATE: WE MADE UP. actually, I said sorry and he said I worried uselessly so I should not have apologised. So like I never did anything bad and he was just tired or smthn. So huhu
10	Apologize and tell him for your part, your still his friend.
8	If you got the door slam you may be out of luck. They rarely ever open back up. \n\nI know the feeling of saying doing something then regretting it later. Over time, enough of these door slams should help you (and me) slam our mouth shut first. 
7	My sister is an INTJ so I'm pretty familiar with their typical MO. INTJs have zero problems with solitude, so they don't suffer fools, like ever. But just being annoying usually isn't enough to make them hate you or door slam you. You gave almost no information in your post as to what was actually said or done, but it's likely that this INTJ simply wasn't in the mood for your bullshit and has better things to do. If you did something specific or offensive, just own it. Probably a text would be fine. "Hey, I know when I said x I was out of line. Sorry if I crossed a line, no harm meant" sort of thing. And then in future, watch yourself, look for nonverbal cues that demonstrate that someone isn't vibing with you and stfu the next time you enter dangerous territory. Just don't push it. INTJs don't expect perfection in other people, but they are extremely aware of patterns. So if you regularly push beyond their boundaries and show no accountability or willingness to meet them halfway, they're out. If you have demonstrated that you don't care about their preferences, there's no benefit to interacting with you and therefore they won't. While INTJs love bantering and expounding on weird ideas more than most, at their core is iron willed pragmatism. If it doesn't benefit them, they don't do it. Period. They are almost immune to manipulation and don't especially care about social norms or niceties beyond the pragmatic benefit that people are more compliant to their will if they don't hate you. That's not to say they don't care or are heartless, it's that they specially care very much or not at all. So if you betrayed your INTJs trust or violated their ethics in any way, you're screwed and it's over. Otherwise, take ownership of your mistake and don't continue to do it and they'll likely give you another shot. But you will have to make the effort most likely. \n\nGood luck!

3	You made them hate you in “we had an argument about xyz” way or made them hate you by being a backstabbing asshole? The first is going to be fine tomorrow, the latter is probably the end.
3	You're fine the way you are, not everyone is going to like you and that's okay too. That being said fuck that guy lmao. I hate when people can't just sit down and talk like normal people. "Hey, thi thing you did bugged me because XYZ" \n\nDone. Simple. Lame ass.

3	Inferior Si struggles	Ok fellas, I know this has been talked about A LOT but I still wanna post about it and I just don't feel like searching the whole subreddit for a couple of posts. \n\nSo the struggle about inferior Si is OTHER PEOPLE, especially close relatives. They won't stop telling me to put my life together, and that someday I will regret not taking these years of my life seriously enough, and it's got to a point where it's emotionally harming to hear these things over and over again. \n\nIt's simple: I don't give a single one of the thousands of fucks I could give about having a stable life. As long as there's something new keeping me busy, as long as there's intense things to live (not necessarily good ones, that's the part they absolutely don't understand) and as long as I'm content with what I do and my actions don't directly harm others, I'm just where I want to be. \n\nThey say that I won't be happy in the future, that I won't be able to settle down and find a job for the rest of my life... And I don't know how to make them understand that I don't want those things, that I don't value them as much as they do. The thing that pisses me off the most is that whenever I try to explain this in a calm way, they just come at me with arguments that make zero sense or they try to make me feel bad about it saying "but we do care about your mental health/ well being". I mean... My mental health is fine, thanks, and what I just tried to explain to you is that my well being depends heavily on NOT settling down... \n\n\nIs there any way I can make them understand this or am I just being immature?
3	> Is there any way I can make them understand this\n\nIt sounds like you've been trying. As long as you're not dependent on them, and your lifestyle isn't a burden to them, do you owe them any explanations?
2	I think it's smart to consider the possibility of you changing your mind in the future and deciding you actually want a stable life. Choosing stability sounds boring and lame now, but believe me, it sounds amazing when you take a look at your bank account and realise you only have enough money to pay two weeks of rent, your next paycheck arrives in four, and you are alone 2000km away from home and anyone who could help you, living with your landlord who also needs the money and other 6 people you have met a month ago. It's not easy to decide if you are going to ask your parents for money when they also are struggling financially or if you are going to ask your boss, who hired you just a month ago after a two month long job search, to pay you half your salary earlier because you fucked up your numbers.

2	If Ti and Si are "whole" models, won't ENTP eventually reach them too?	I'm an INTP, and there are some thing my Ti has right. Some things not, but as I learn more my Ti models of the world will eventually be accurate. Te on the other hand is just data collection endlessly. Ti has the whole model and, if right, all Te data points collected in the future will line up with that model.\n\nA similar effect should happen for Si and Se, Ni and Ne, and Fi and Fe.\n\nIf this is true, then won't ENTP with inferior Si eventually also reach this "whole" model? It may take longer than any other type but they should reach it given Si isn't "expanding."\n\nNe on the other hand is just data collection. I.e. dom Ne will always have more data collected than aux/tert/inf Ne. There is no limit to data collection for specific contexts.\n\nIs this correct? Or is Si simply not able to be codified into the ENTP conscious because by using Ne all the time they intrinsically render the Si model temporarily useless?
4	> but as I learn more my Ti models of the world will eventually be accurate. \n\nI think Ti converges towards accuracy and abstraction, but not necessarily precision.  Whereas Te, ever collecting more empirical data, can build a nest of exceptions to handle any case with precision -- like a giant flow chart that handles all possible cases exactly.   So Ti tends to become more generalized and Te becomes more expert.\n\nI think Ti is essentially a distillation of Te.  That is, if Te represents the empirical rules we observe in the world, then Ti represents an internalized model of those rules.   All models, by their nature, are simplifications and abstractions.  Their goal isn't typically to be precise, but rather to explain some general principle with a mechanism that can be generally predictive.  (Hence why the Ti archetypes tend to be system builders and theorists, trying to internalize their Ne/Se Perceptions, and Te archetypes tend to be architects and engineers and 'masterminds', trying to externalize their Ni/Si vision.) \n\nIt's like Ti takes that giant Te flowchart and notices certain rules.  If a flowchart box is a hexagon, you always take choice D, and the *reason* for that is that a hexagon has 6 sides - 2 = 4th letter.  Then Ti posits that if the box is a triangle you should take choice A, etc.   Then it comes up with a formula that simplifies the whole mess down into an abstraction and does away with the flow chart entirely.  Until Te notices more exceptions that break the law.\n\nAnd so it goes back and forth....Te creating empirical laws and Ti reducing them to principles which predict laws that Te then tries to find exceptions to... a kind of experiment-theory loop. \n\nIn the same vein, you can view Fi as a set of principles pulled from how someone understands the social dynamics and rules around them (Fe).   You can see Si as a distillation of expectations, a learned bias,  about things experienced in the world (Se) (like the fact that stops signs are red.  It's not a fact you 'notice' every time you see a stop sign, because you've come to expect that is always the case.  But a blue stop sign would immediately be a conscious perception. ) And lastly for Ni but on the categorial level instead of the details level.  (If Si draws an internal road map of reality, Ni draws a schematic of themes.) \n\nSo these processes are really just two sides of the same function, and which side we expose to the light of consciousness, our predilection for being theory minded or empirically minded, is essentially what determines our personality type as a kind of average value of those preferences.  The other side of the coin goes onto the back burned of the subconscious as we Perceive and Judge automatically without giving it any though (the biases of expectations for Pi and the biases of assumptions for Ji) \n\n> Is this correct? Or is Si simply not able to be codified into the ENTP conscious because by using Ne all the time they intrinsically render the Si model temporarily useless?\n\nI think it's best to see Ne and Si  as complements of each other, due to the dichotomy of N and S.   If we think of Ne as being Perception gathering at the conceptual level, and it being a process that dominates the consciousness, then what are we ignoring (but yet still Perceiving unconsciously?).   Well, if Ne is about being interested in novel, conceptual ways of seeing things, then what we should ignore in favor of that is the old, already known, well-understood ways of putting 2 and 2 together.   Likewise, if you tend to favor and trust the tried and true status quo (Si dom), then new, untested, untried, spontaneous, dynamic (etc) solutions are met with suspicion.   It's like describing the same glass of water as half-full or half-empty.  And just as that attitude towards  the glass says you're an Optimist or Pessimist, your attitude towards Perception determines if you're NeSi or SiNe favoring. \n\nSo it's not that Si is useless.  In fact, it's necessary.  Because, how can you possibly get excited about what is new and fresh and exciting, if you simultaneously can't tell what things you've *already* experienced enough to know that they're not doing anything new.\n\nSo, ultimately Si is just a redundant complimentary description of Ne (or vice-versa) but there is a utility in maintaining the distinction, because we can use that to build qualitatively different description of Ne-doms and Si-doms. \nISFJs get annoyed if you don't bother writing their description and just refer to them as ENTP^(complement).\n\nSomething to ponder -- since in the same manner every type that has Ti also has Fe (and never Fi),  following the above reasoning, in what way can Fe a termed a redundant description of Ti?  (This was something that was very insightful for me to think through, so I won't just spit it out.)\n\n
1	Yeah, I think so. I’ve found that even though my Ne will be constantly firing on all cylinders at any given time, many of these thoughts aren’t actually materialized as things I hold to be “true” usually because of what my Ti instincts tell me. If it’s something that I need Si to ground me on then it’s harder to build the “model” because it’s so underdeveloped, but I’ve found as I get older I’ve been able to better read my Si. 
1	Ne and Si work well together. The more you read the more Ne you get. I can't say the same for others. \n\nTi deals with What, Te with How. One deals with the heart, the other with the flesh.\n\nTe: We need to do something!\n\nTi: Is action necessary ? Is it the right action ? \n\n&#x200B;
3	Type Change Via Pharmaceuticals	I want to know more how Pharmaceuticals (drugs in general) can affect a person regarding their functions (and mind), even if anecdotal, so yes, especially other XXTPs, specifically on retaining the TP bit. As it goes for a self-report, on Ritalin (strong dose, brief usage, the recognition of the change was striking), I tested as an ISTP (I was not myself as I knew it and decided to test on the drug) and it was so interesting, yet horrifying. I truly didn't give a fuck, I was essentially forced out of my own mind. No more obsessing about ideas, little room for theory or creativity, just 2 + 2 = 4 and a focus on the present. I also wonder, if these kinds of medications can induce a permanent change after a long enough period of exposure. I don't think that this phenomena is particularly abnormal and I find it interesting how drugs can affect how a person acts.
5	I once took the test tripping on 3 hits of acid. Ended up getting INFP, convincing myself I was a "broken" INFP that forced himself to behave like an ENTP to the point of becoming one at the age of 14, then I realized my whole personality is just a combination of genetics and external factors that shaped me into who I am, and that the actual me didn't exist as a thing. That realization combined with the fact that I hadn't even reached the peak of the trip convinced me I was going to forget who I was because of the high dose of psychedelics and probably become an INFP because I had been thinking about being an INFP. That scared the shit out of me because who wants to be an INFP and I decided the only way to save myself was to call a friend who knew me well to stay with me during the peak. Called an ENFP friend, got him out of class (he still gives me shit for that years later) and convinced him to come. He found me literally crying in fetal position in the corner of my room (maybe the transition to INFP had started).\n\nWorst trip of my life, worse than fighting two flying cockroaches with a broom after watching black mirror pre-peak.
2	I just become a focused ENTP when I take Adderall idk wtf ur taking
2	I'm assuming you do actually have ADHD? I can't help but think ADHD somewhat forces us own the EN\*P route. Whether it's causation or simply correlation, I'm not sure.\n\nI started taking vyvanse around 2-3 months ago and I've noticed something similar. It's not so much that it detracts from my ENTP-ness, but it yanks up our Si by the reigns and makes a become a much more dominant function. Certainly the wild thoughts that attributed to my thirst for creativity have been somewhat quelled, but when I do apply myself to something creative I can do so in a much more organised fashion, and with better end results.\n\nFrom what I understand the only lasting effect is generally positive: the balancing of dopamine (where ADHD has a deficit of sorts) allows for your neurons to form connections it struggled to otherwise, which can help offset to a small degree some of the deficits of ADHD. Of course, once you stop taking the medication and these neurons cease to be used fully and they'll eventually die off. Other than that, the meds have no lasting direct effect on your personality (except remembering how shit I am at some stuff without them).
2	With some adhd drugs, i become quite Entj/intj extremmely focused, unpacient, i get mad at people because they take too much time to formulate thougs and i start planning way more, and truly get a harder Ni perspective on things, i just dislike that state,because is boring, if i focus on people is really easy to predict everything theyre thinking and going to say and ill rather be more chilled out, spaced out as im normally am, than some planning psycho.
2	Stimulants bring out Te and Se. Psychedelics bring out Ne and Ni together.  Depressants fuck with Fi.\n\n

17	An Ego Check from r/ISFP	
13	I think it’s really almost typical for SFs not to get along with NTs except superficially.   We’re opposite quads — different contexts (N/S) and different ways of processing it (T/F).  It’s the most likely chance about not seeing the same situation with any degree of overlap.  \n\nOf course, I’m sure there’s theoretically mature SFPs out there, someplace.
2	There's so many entps posting in that thread it's like a raid this is pretty funny
2	They clearly haven’t met any lady ENTPs yet. \n\nBut I agree that I’ve never understood the whole charming thing. Eccentric, yes. But that’s not everyone’s cup of tea.
1	How do you expect this to ego check anybody
53	ENTP, Devil's advocate or...?	I've realised that when we ENTPs play the devil's advocate it's because we see a sort of rationality or truth in the opposite case, which we don't want to be ignored for the "good", no matter how "bad" the opposite case is.\n\nIt seems to me that we (and others) apply the term "devil's advocate" to us because:\n\n1. The Function **Fe**, getting along etc.\n\n2. Strategically it's just a better decision, you don't want people to hate you, neither do they, so you don't admit to seeing some truth in the opposite or straight up deny it, or reassure people (even if falsely at times) that you don't believe in it, but say that you can't accept the generally accepted opinion without disproving the opposite.(connected to point one)\n\n3. Others may not want to see the truth in the other side, hence it's seen as just for the sake of the argument. They may not want to accept that the ENTP sees the opposition as the truth (and the ENTP knows that and strategically goes along with it, at least for the argument to continue and also for reasons mentioned above)\n\nBut i know deep down we think there is some truth (or justification) to the other side (depending on the situation it could be the whole truth or part of it). Or it may be none, but that would be a really bored ENTP if you ask me...\n\nAt the end, this could just be me.\n\nSo What does everyone else think?\n\n\nEdit: i answered this to someone, I'll quote it here for an example and a clarification:\n\n"i think in a lot of cases we have actually established  in our head that "the devil may be right, at least to an extent" but we think " if i directly say what i think people may hate me, that could be trouble" so instead you hide it under the title "Devil's advocate" and try to debate your point. In other words a bit of deception, even if it's done unconsciously. Remember that entps are very good at reading or predicting what people will think or feel, so we do this either consciously or unconsciously."
33	I think I could use some ice cream
8	I think there are layers to everything, especially in reasoning. There maybe some truth or motivations revealed in another position which are important to consider. \n\nMostly you will find the motivations of popular opinions are those of the sheep - societal rules. I think Fe allows us to put our NeTi ideas into situations without too much fear.\n
14	Truth is worth loss of shallow friendships, if someone is afraid of a challenge to their views to a degree of you not being able to counter them, what fun is that? it leads them and the conversation at a dead end.\n\nJust be you, entps are very fun :)
3	Yep. I even defend people I dislike if they're being accused of something they didn't do. "Yeah, he murdered that person, but he didn't rob their house." \n\nPeople get real angry about it, but... I don't think there's any reason to make things up about a clearly reprehensible person; let their REAL actions damn them. Being committed to truth isn't same as "advocating for the devil", so to speak... it's actually advocating for, ya know, the truth.
3	I totally get what you mean. It's just when you'll argue for something that isn't socially acceptable, even if you don't fully agree with it,or if you don't support it but still see the other points of view, then people automatically will assume that you're 100% for it even if it's not true and that can do a lot of damage to your public image.\n\n\nI remember having debate even on reddit on 2 subreddits (ENTP one and ENFP one) about people's opinion on age of consent - if there should be universal and what it should be (and why). On ENTP sub there was really nice and long discussion and I've got to hear a lot of stances on this case but on ENFP sub I've felt like they'd look at me like I was Hitler. Needles to say that there was no discussion and the mods were quick to act and 'investigate it' even if there was nothing to it - it's somehow taboo subject but why? 
2	I think our emotional detachment from the impact of the other side is alien to some. Maybe that's just me? \n\nI've had to learn to adjust my behavior, lines of thinking and questioning to keep people from thinking I was weird and creepy. It sucks sometimes but it's nice being more accepted.
2	Usually if you are to love something or someone, you need to identify with it. That's the essence of rapport. What the Devil's Advocate does, is they straight up go against it in the desire of heightening accuracy and preventing catastrophes. \n\nSo the best thing to do is to build up rapport with them, through the lie of ignorance. This lying is not as dishonest as it is wise, because at the end of the day, it helps more than it hurts. (The essence of politeness)\n\nAdditionally, people aren't that dumb, it's just they're afraid to be independent thinkers and stick their necks out for their thoughts(except for NTs), and as such they can have rapport with the ENTP, if they say something they've wanted to say, but hadn't had the guts to do so. (Why people either love or hate xxTP's, but this especially applies to ENTPs)\n\nEDIT: My brain has gone numb. Kill me
2	Good vs evil is for children. If I want to argue that if Hitler embraced the Jews instead of what he did, Germany would have conquered the world, I will.\n\nI'm also a part time nihilist and believe most theoretical concepts are for children. Carry on.
2	This is a perfect example of a rebuttal arguing why we may seem shallow to others, but in reality there's an abyss of depth to it.
2	[deleted]
2	I'm a huge deviles advocate. \n\nOr amn't I...
2	I think you just made me realize why it is that no one really hates me.\n\nI always bring up opposing points with the pre-frame that it’s to acknowledge the legitimacy of the other end.\n\nI’d think that it kind of makes it so that both sides can’t help but feel that I’m only there to see that the potentials of both sides are maximized.\n\nInteresting observation, OP.
1	You know the term's origin, right?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_advocate
1	Nah, it's just fun. Also, I have the creativity and ability to find an argument supporting just about any idea/position, and be a good enough orator to make it sound very logical and correct. Also, I love getting normies and sensors out of their comfort zones and actually making them think for themselves.
1	I love playing DA because it's fun, taking the comple opposite view and trying to spark conversation.
1	It’s also just fun to play devils advocate 
1	100% dis.
1	I think it comes down to Ti. ENTPs  use Ti pretty heavily, and a lot of their views are a sort original take on things. This makes them very critical of other people’s views. 
1	\> so instead you hide it under the title "Devil's advocate" and try to debate your point. \n\nI think you ASSUME that everybody else disclaims their arguments in the same way you do. I don't do this. I let the other party believe that these are my firm beliefs.\n\nAll my liberal friends think I'm a conservative because I defend trump. All my conservative friends think I'm liberal because I bash him. My gay friends think I'm an asshole because I argue with them about 'pride' parades being pointless. My straight friends think I'm an LGBTQ champion because I defend those same parades.\n\nI don't EVER disclose that I'm playing devils advocate... because that's now how I see what I'm doing. I truly and honestly believe that seemingly conflicting arguments can simultaneously both be correct. 
1	I play devil’s advocate mostly when i am not %100 sure what the peoples true intentions are.\n\nNot directly to solve the cases but to understand the true nature of people.\n\nHigher the ego is quicker the anger comes. 
1	To me, it's not as much being liked. I readily admit that others with opposing views are making valid arguments. People with views that are 100 % the same as mine \[on the subject we are debating\] I will *still* play Devil's advocate because I want them to *understand* why others disagree with their \[our\] stance. \n\nA good example of a subject I will *never* discuss because of this, is the pro-life/pro-choice. I am definitely one of those, I have a very clear view on it and I could readily discuss and defend my view. I choose not to, whether it be with those that agree or disagree, because I can see and understand and find truth in arguments presented by both sides - and the issue is so emotionally charged that whether I agree or disagree, people are bound to get upset. \n\nIt's not because I don't want to hurt anyone, because I'll happily discuss this with those close to me, those I know won't be driven by emotional responses *in the discussion (*I know I have discussed this with a person I *know* has a strong feeling towards it, but she also remains calm in her arguments). \n\nThe reason is, if someone is definitely pro-choice, I will argue with pro-life arguments, because I *would like to bring people closer.* Same goes for pro-life: I will argue with pro-choice arguments. I do *not \[usually\]* *aim to convince, or to please, I aim to unite people.* \n\nI believe this works best if you can detach yourself from the subject at hand, have little emotional response to it \[as well as the person you are debating with\] and are willing to defend the opposing view. \n\nIn a work setting, I will agree I want to keep equilibrium. These are people you need to work with and I prefer to pick my battles wisely, rather than to offend and annoy. But outside of work, I couldn't care less. I'll argue that the sky is green if I have to, as long as the other can understand why some people believe some insane things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: In my case, devil's advocacy is done to unite people of opposing views by explaining why someone else has a different opinion and/or that the world isn't black or white.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Funny thing is I often forget to say devil's advocate until we get to a point where I realise they think that I believe in my argument so a clarify it and then they're like "oh".\n\nIf it helps I normally say it when the parties involved are quite invested in the debate and it has become somewhat heated
9	Please explain why I feel this way	 \n\n## \n\nI \[M\] became online friends with a girl my age on snapchat after she popped up and we started to talk (some nights until 1 or 2am) for 5 to 6 months and then we stopped talking. After about a week of not talking to her, I came to the conclusion she was hot and I could see myself asking her out. I popped up again and I carried on a conversation about her failed relationships and asked her what her current situation was. She said she found 'someone special' and she was going to hopefully go for him. I wished her good luck and we continued to talk again for about a week where that someone special didnt turn out to be that special and a whole load of fuckeries in her life. During this week, my feelings of physical attraction died down on her and I became neutral towards her. After about a week or so, I started finding her hot again and I am scared to go in a loop in this.\n\ntl;dr: Whenever I stop speaking to a certain girl, her physical attraction rises for me. When I start to talk to her again, my attractiveness decreases.\n\nCan anyone explain this? 
29	Seems like you think she's hot, but you don't actually like her.
14	You like the chase.  Stop building her up because you're bored as fuck.
10	When you stop talking to her, I'm guessing that you romanticize the good times that you had together and she becomes more desirable because you're only thinking of the good. Once you "have" her, you realize how boring it is and get used to her company, therefore making her less attractive. Could be wrong, just my 2 cents
1	Your post has been removed for breaking the Ti rule:\n\n> Use logic. Posts must be able to be logically analyzed. **No DAE posts** or posts with vague general statements about ENTPs. Meme posts should include a comment from OP relating the post to ENTPs in a logical way.\n\nThis is the part of your post that broke the rule:\n\n> Anyone have any similar feelings?\n\nIf you want, you can edit your post to remove the last sentence. Reply to this post if you choose to do that, and your post will be reinstated.
1	You may not like her behaviour at times, which you remember when you talk to her, but forget that when you don't so there's only good in your head, i personally find something off about saying "someone special" idk, personally i think it's a little bit off putting, probably becaue that phrase gives me some idea on what kind she may be and how she may talk, I'd say you probably find annoyances with her that you forget when you stop talking. But that's just what i think.\n\nMy advice, avoid. It will get worse the more time goes, as you start to notice good behaviours less and annoying ones more, at times depending on your situation it could get to be way too much and you may start to dislike her if she annoys you at the wrong situation, or repeatedly in a short amount of time (say if you're stressed out for one or two weeks, it could become unbearable). Hot is fine, but not relationship material, hot is sex material, that doesn't mean settle for someone who you don't find attractive physically but do personality wise, find someone that ticks is overall good for you. Both sides of a relationship are equally important.
1	> Can anyone explain this? \n\nYou want what you can't have, once you get it, you'll be bored again.\n\n&#x200B;
5	Work, preference... which do you prefer?	Between a mean boss give you A LOT of work, way TOO much work that tires you day to days. But he knows what he is doing, but like I said overwork you senselessly.\n\nOr a nicer boss who have NO clue what the hell he is doing. Stupid AF, doesn't intentionally give you a lot of work like the mean boss, work is normally easy, but due to his incompetence he wastes your time on STUPID shit that you are against, intellectually speaking.\n\nIF you have to choose, not quitting either, which one of these 2 will you choose?
7	Definitely the stupid boss.  Stupid boss = doing whatever you know is the correct thing, at whatever pace you feel like.  You can basically set your own agenda, or just float to whatever task suits your fancy.  This will probably result in you taking stupid boss' job.  \n\nTaskmaster boss sounds like a nightmare.  Fuck that shit.  
3	Obviously depends on the job and how invested I am. If it's something I care about and is meaningful to me, then the first. If my job is arbitrary and I'm just doing it for money, then second. Naturally it depends on context. 
3	How much am I getting paid?
1	I goes with the nicer boss because the reason he waste my time simply because he doesn't know what the hell he is doing. I'll try propose a project and negotiate my work flow, If he is really nice and you prove what you propose he is certainly will give you what you want to improve your work.
1	I've dealt with both and I have a strong preference for the "mean boss" based on the provided descriptions. I find that in a work setting, if my days are not occupied with vastly more tasks (that I am able to recognize the value of) than I can complete, I become bored and as a result, unproductive. When I have more to do than is actually possible to achieve, the added element of time management and prioritization adds enough interesting complexity to keep me engaged.
1	The first one. I can't quit, but I can refuse to work and get fired. EZ Peasy
1	Mean boss will help you grow (I've had one who wasn't unfriendly but you knew your role) and I've learned much more along the way. You might as well work for the government if you want a stupid boss  
1	That’s a hard one my dude. I’d go with the nice boss though. Incompetence is very frustrating, but I’d hate to be spent all the time just from work :P
1	Mean boss. I have workaholic tendencies, so he'd basically be an enabler, which is great. I also want to spend my life doing useful things, not dumb fluff work.
10	Just imagine...	I am the worst procrastinator and leave all my important shit until the last moment, but people still think my work is really good and I get a ton of praise.\n\nJust imagine how much better it could be if I actually worked as long as people think I do... From performing in the top 10% I could be top 1%.\n\nI think about this all the time. But I just can't be fucked to fix it. 
6	Exactly the same here. If people knew the shit I forget...
5	I do jack shit at work 80% of the time but I still get praised for the little effort i put into this job. \n\nIt’s a blessing and a curse to me, because I know i can do better, but at the same time, people think I do good work so they leave me  alone. 
3	It can't be fixed. I mean, we are too smart to reach the top.\n\nYou might ask, how does that even make sense? It fucking does.\n\nImagine what would we do if we got to the top working to our maximum. Probably get some more money, also some social status (which we don't give a shit about), but money is worth only as much as it helps us establish slightly higher living standards (which we don't need) and helps us pursue our stupid weird interests more freely. BUT WAIT. Why would we even try, if we can ACTUALLY PURSUE THEM FREELY RIGHT NOW, instead of working almost at all? We don't need to become responsible fucking tryhards to live a dream. Responsibility coming with being super good is overwhelming too. Stay mediocre for the win. Stay free, my friend. Work only as much as you need.\n\nWow, now I believe I should become a motivational speaker or some shit.
0	In high school, I pulled someone's half ripped project out of the trash and presented it as my own. I forgot we had something due but I watched other people and did the entire presentation off the cuff. Teacher admired my audacity and gave me a C. Would have taken me 45 minutes at home to get an a, but then I wouldn't have this story 😄
15	Need to be validated	I have a fair mindset where I always validate and acknowledge other's ideas, so I expect the same from them.   It irritates me when my ideas are not appropriately validated, or when I've already thought of an idea and someone else says it first, I'm compelled to say something like "I already thought of that" or, "that was my exact idea as well."\n\nIt feels petty to always need to validate ideas/myself like this.\n\nHow do ENTPs deal with this?
5	Hmm.  I'd have to be around you to assess this one.  Because I'm not sure I've got it correct based on your description.\n\nPersonally, if I see a person is going out of their way to be impressive or is needy for accolades, I become determined not to give it to them.  If someone verbalizes something you were thinking, "That's a great point, I was thinking something similar" is way better than rolling your eyes and saying "I was going to say that."  It's not about caring what people think, it's about not being a cringe-y person to be around.\n\nThere's something about quiet confidence that is really appealing to people.  It makes you comfortable to be around.  I'd argue people are more likely to listen to what you have to say.
4	I validate myself haha. And sometimes other people help
3	Like many here, I joke about nearly everything. And I think and speak faster than most everyone in my life 😢. I usually know what someone is going to say before they finish. When someone presents a problem, I've already seen to the end. Then I'll rattle off 2 or 3 joke solutions that are absurd, usually illegal, and meant for laughs. Then 1 or more good idea to actually solve it. \n\nThey're usually laughed off like they're all rediculous, but the good idea will stay in their mind and they'll bring it up later like it's their own. This used to anger me visibly. Now, I brush it off unless it really gets to me, which is very rare.\n\nThen I'll take measures to covertly sabatoge the idea I put forward. Like saying "if i can't get the credit, nobody can have this." Immature, yes, but it's never severe. I'm not looking to seriously hinder people's growth. But I have no patience for people complaining and not doing anything to remedy the situation. They'll eventually find their way, but I was giving them a shortcut to save time and usually money.\n\nUsually all I have to do is ignore the issue or the person entirely until enough time has passed. I'll abruptly leave the room if this scenario presents itself. My therapist told me to be more open with my feelings, but I feel this gets my point across.\n\nExample- my mom complained about money, but didn't care to hear how to save $50 a month on her cable bill. If money is brought up as a gripe, "thanks for the coffee, but I've got to go return some videotapes."\n\nTypical half related post by an ENTP 😂
5	>How do ENTPs deal with this?\n\nThey deal with it by being thinkers. It's not even a factor in their decision making tree (and is why they eternally piss off feelers)
1	This is your Fe (Extraverted "Feeling" AKA Ethics regarded to people) at play, the desire to be accepted. Just get to know different people so you can talk to them about things on different levels, otherwise you will probably never be adequately fulfilled.\n\n&#x200B;
1	If we are talking about ideas for company / organizational to growth i'm going with :\n\n1. Best way to approach the company / org goals.\n\n2. The idea benefits me or at least doesn't bring more problems to me (extra paperworks)\n\nIf people says an idea that i've thought i just says "That's a good idea / great point." instead of try to owning it or maybe add extra layers to cover weakspots or make it more convincing if the person who says the idea couldn't sell / present it well enough.
1	If you validate others, are you yourself not validated? 🤔
31	War of the 16	Imagine If there was ever a personalitist pride amongst the 16 types that leads to an all out war.  \n\nWho would be the strongest, who is weakest, alliances that would work, who's the fire nation here the arch Duke Ferdinand?  And most importantly who would come out on top and why?\n\nAlmost forgot: how do the ENTP types do in this battle royale?
44	On a tactical level I bet us entp's would the ones who end up as arms dealers making a bunch of money by selling to all sides remaining neutral being double agents......just to be plunged into the war by something completely stupid like one of the other types nation having facts wrong about the amount of weapons stockpiled by the enemy and the Entp prime minister butts  in saying "well its actually 50,553 planes to be exact" and all our allies look at us like ummm how do you know?
21	Cold hard logic would win for sure. \n\nAn alliance between the ENTJ's and INTJ's would win easily because strategy comes easy to them. If the INTP's formed an alliance with the ENTJ's or the INTJ's, the victory would be even more crushing because the INTP's would come up with plenty of ideas for shortcuts to a victory as devastating as possible. Shortcuts because they'd be too lazy to use longer routes,.and this same lethargy would require the victory to be devastating because they wouldn't want to deal with the problem resurfacing. \n\nENTP's would be hard to trust in any alliance because of their manipulative tendencies so if they did win somehow, they'd probably betray the alliance right after and be the last ones standing.
17	First I'd make an alliance with the ISFJs. They would be responsible for constructing our fortresses, in addition to acquiring and maintaining munitions. They'd also be in charge of medical.\n\nThe ISFPs have no idea what's going on, and they just want everyone to be happy. Once the ISFJs have finished constructing our bunkers, we offer the ISFPs shelter in exchange for free labor. Most of them accept. Some of them try to talk to the xSTJs but get mowed down by their machine guns. \n\nThe INTPs don't really want to be bothered, but we lure them to our base with some cookies the ISFPs baked. They're in charge of cyberwarfare.\n\nI would not form an alliance with the ENTJs. Instead, I would recruit disgruntled ENTJs from within their ranks, and put them in charge of the INTPs.\n\nThe NFs initially try to settle things peacefully. But when the xSTJs kill all their ambassadors, they shift to guerrilla tactics. We recruit some of them but not all. We mostly recruit traumatized, vengeance-obsessed INFJs with no sense of self-preservation left. They form kamikaze squads.\n\nThe INTJs come up with ingenious plans, but never actually implement them. Their forces dwindle due to attacks from NF guerrilla fighters. \n\nThe ISTPs think all of this is stupid. But since they can't *not* be involved, they join forces with the INTJs. The ISTPs are able to put the INTJs' master plan into quick, efficient action, and the NF's numbers steadily decrease as a result. \n\nThe ISTJs and ESTJs join forces. They quickly assemble and train their military. Stray Feelers who wander onto their base are quickly annihilated.\n\nThe ENTJs recruit a lot of Sensors, but their group quickly splinters. Each ENTJ is equally convinced his/her plan is the best. They can't come to a compromise, so they split off into small groups that the ISTPs/INTJs and xSTJs quickly pick off.\n\nThree months into the war, we get a call from the ESTPs. "Hey bruh your hear about this war??" they ask. "Yeah bruh!" we reply. "Everyone is super uptight about it," they continue, "but you seem pretty chill. Wanna team up? We could wreak some maaaaad havoc. It'd be LIT." So, we ally with the ESTPs. We come up with crazy plans, which they're crazy enough to carry out. We mostly rely on hit-and-run tactics. Our goal is not to win, but to survive and get the upper hand whenever possible. \n\nSo as it stands, these are the factions:\n\n* ENTP, ISFJ, ISFP, INTP, ESTP, a few ENTJs and INFJs\n* Guerrilla NFs\n* INTJ, ISTP\n* ISTJ, ESTJ\n* ENTJ, various Sensors (many factions, probably warring with each other)\n\nWhat do you think about this scenario? Who did I leave out, and what would they be up to?\n\n

12	Since I’m from the future, I’ll tell you what happened in the MBTI wars of 2037 once the dariometer was invented that could correctly type people and tell them how to behave.   \n\nMBTI forums quickly became the de facto social clubs and power bases, evolving into political parties which soon grew across international lines uniting people like no religion ever did.  As nations crumbled, these new tribes started to revert to the extremes of type specific behaviors bringing on the Great Apocalypse. \n\nThe SP  immediately went on a drug-fueled-mega-sex-orgy-dance-a-thon involving blood sport fights to the death.\n\nToo late they would realize that it was the TJ who secretly manipulated them into fighting for their pleasure by building rave venues with surprisingly few, easily closed off exits,  bizarre medieval torture chamber “decorations”, and drugs that were apparently not the same ol’ same ol.\n\nThe FJs  mounted million man marches, wearing pink hats in the shape of Figinas in support of their SP sisters getting brutally and inhumanely exposed to as much sex and drugs and dancing as they wanted to hedonistically consume.  Secretly they were glad to get rid of them.  But they felt sorry about it. But they were also mad they didn’t get invited.  So they weren’t sorry.  All at the same time.\n\nBut the TPs realized all the fighting was stupid and about something called pride which even their best INTP minds couldn’t figure out. So they all retreated to uToPia once the TJs started to nuke each other’s SP dungeons.  Most of the FJs died protesting the intolerable wait it took to get protest permits under the new TJ despotic rule. \n\nBy 2044 the Earth was devastated and *Homo sapiens inferioris* was extinct....well, we had to finish the job, but they were pretty much gone.   It took us almost 3 months to cleanup the mess — 2.5 months to procrastinate and half a month to invent the nuclear waste powered cleaning nanobots. \n\nAfter we invented time travel (we got a lot accomplished once the SJs weren’t on our ass all the time...who knew? 🤷🏼‍♂️) we decided to travel back and remove all TPs from history and bring them to uToPia, because no *H. sapiens perfectus* deserves to have to put up with all the bullshit. \n\n
8	ENTJs. They're absolutely brilliant, excellent strategists, and could rally others to fight with them.
4	Intp. Im just gonna go over here and take a nap while all tou people figure it out. Hopefully ill wake up to a ceasefire
5	ENFPs try to abstain from fighting and seek peace but then our group gets offended and try’s to carry out ruthless tactics for the greater good on the surface but  self preservation at heart 
3	ENTJ would win and we would be allies 
2	ENTJs would win if they ever could decide on a leader. I think we would fall victim to arguing too much over the best approach. I then see us betraying our own kind, especially if we established a hierarchy
2	OH GOD, I was thinking about this earlier today (it's 7 p.m where I live) and I thought about it for a long time. This is what I came up with:\nThe first to have a steady plan would be ENTJs. I think they would probably try to recruit INTPs, which would require taking them out of their undreground nuclear shelters they already had, anticipating situations like this. \n\nSo the ENTJ-INTP alliance would quickly gain power, and try to recruit the most "useful" types to end the war quickly. ISFJs would be a great pick, since they're very good at caretaking and they could build the shelters, bases and take care of everyone, in general. They'd be really uplifting people. If they refused to join, however, I would see them joining either the NFs or the XSTJs. \n\nMeanwhile, the INTJs would have had time to analyze the situation and they'd have begun building their master plan. No one would've noticed yet. \n\nISTJs and ESTJs, powerful in numbers and discipline would probably be allied by now, and quickly planning to take over the weakest factions. \n\nThe NFs would have gone WILD, especially INFPs and ENFPs. I think they'd consider themselves kind of "rebels" and would basically live out in the wild. They'd eventually make good soldiers (they're good at adapting) but if the STJs caught them offguard it would be the end of them. I kind of se XNFJs joining the files of ENTJs, or at least a good chunk of them, just to avoid getting killed by the recurrent STJ attacks. \n\nBy now, the two greatest forces would be XSTJs, as the great offensive force and the ENTJ-INTP alliance, who would be trying to protect themselves while the ENTJs make up a plan and the INTPs try to take over using hacking, trying to obtain valuable information, coming up with new ideas... etc. The NFJs who joined their side would be assisting them in those tasks while trying to figure out the exact intentions of the enemy.  \n\nI actually have two theories as to what would happen with XSTPs. They could form an alliance and be the ABSOLUTE berserkers or they could each go on their own. If this happened, ESTPs would probably join the XSTJs as soldiers and ISTPs (along with some of the leftover ESTPs) would be the cool badasses that don't give a damn and just go shooting everything coming on their way. They'd have a good chance of surviving, since I don't think the ENTJs would try to kill them (only if they attacked first) and they'd just have to hide from most of the XSTJs. \n\nI also can see ISTPs siding with ENTPs. ENTPs would bullshit their way out of most situations and ISTPs would do the actual surviving things. We'd just go around spreading anarchy and it would be beautiful. Maybe we'd come across some of the wild NFs and side for a while, then leave. \n\nThere's some other possible scenarios for ENTPs. I can see some of them joining the ENTJs, either because they knew they'd have a great chance of coming out unharmed of the situation or because their INTP brothers convinced them to.\n\nWhat would be most likely, though, would be us siding with the ISTPs as we evaluate the situation and then ally with the most convenient side of the war (not necessarily the one that's actually winning, but the one we'd get most benefits from). Of course, we'd make sure to have a way out of that side as soon as things get nasty for us there. I can also imagine a lot of us would play double-agents so we  could be on the winning side no matter what.\n\nOk, so now we're half a year into the war and the XSTJs are recruiting some rogue sensors ESFPs and ISFPs, mostly) that came across them, offering them safety and a seat on the winning side of the war. \n\nA quick note, I think ISFPs would join whoever they shared opinion with, so they'd be quite scattered. \n\nThe side of ENTJs would've been progressing with their plans a lot and they'd have taken over strategic places or/and websites. (Or ENTJs would've killed each other over WHOMST THE FUCK IS IN CHARGE, and INTPs would have returned to their shelters, each one taking an ISFJ as a baby-sitter). \n\nINTJs... Well, they would either have joined a side or they'd be absolutely sure, whatever the battling sides did, they'd be the ones taking over in the end, because yeah, they're INTJS. OR they would all be dead because they were at home, writing town their MASTER PLAN when a fucking bomb fell on it.\n\nBy now NFPs would be either all dead or perfecting their combat techniques and hiding from the evil, boring ISTJs\n\nI don't know what would happen from now on, but let's make a resume:\n\n- ENTJs, INTPs, ISFJs, some INFJs and ENFJs as the side who wants to end the war as quick as possible\n\n- ISTJs, ESTJs (maybe ISFJs or ESFJs) ESFPs as the grand conquerors\n\n- ISTPs and ENTPs as BERSERK HELL YEA\n\n- ISFPs as scattered mess\n\n- INFPs and ENFPs as misunderstood rebels\n\n- ENTPs and (possibly) ISTPs as "spread anarchy, man"\n\n- The OTHER personality (yes we have many) of ENTPs as asshole double-agents who end up having a traumatic past \n\n
2	We could infiltrate all the Other types, pretending to be their type and get millitary infomation. We would probably lay low watching everyone else kill eachother and join the war for real in the endgame when there are 2-3 teams left.\n\nAlso we would act to be weaker and more Innocent than we are in the whole process so the Others wont see us as a threat big enought to prioritize, while we build up our strength under camoueflage.\n
3	ESFJs would win because they are the largest group. \n\nThey could probably easily be convinced to form an alliance, which could be a number of different types. \n\nI'm guessing ENTPs (INTP) would end up dead because the alternate is hanging out with the winners which most likely would be a bunch of sheep and uninteresting folk. \n\nOr maybe ENTP would jump at the opportunity to be able to manipulate these people and get basically whatever they want. They could find each other in order to itch that scratch of needing debate and a good conversation. \n\nBonus: INTPs definitely end up dead.\n\nEdit: I realize the first paragraph is the INTP.\n\n
1	My Army in a World War MTBI scenario to take over the world.  Ah yes...I can already see it happening.\n\n1. ENTJ - Commander and Strategist\n2. ENTP - Lieutenant in Command\n3.

1	Nice try, but I'm not telling you my tactics. 
7	MBTI related identity chrisis	TL;DR: Teenager trying to get his MBTI identity toghether.\n\nThis is not the first time I'm coming here asking about this specific issue. But i have a problem, which may seem pretty irrelevant to some but really bugs me out, and i can't possibly figure it out on my own. Feel free to just scroll past if you've had enough with people asking about this.\n\nEver since i took my first test on 16personalities i've scored ENTP on 95% of my tests, including cognitive functions tests and other more "popularized" MBTI tests. The problem is i don't have an idea if this actually is correct, which is for a couple of reasons.\n\n1. I'm afraid of bias. I don't have any insurance at all that my ENTPness preceeded the actual taking of the test, and those traits that i now "have" might just be projections of the descriptions of the ENTP from various websites.  \nThere is definitely a possibility i've just "learned" my fake MBTI role and unconsciously just guessed what an ENTP would pick in that specific area.\n\n2. I don't have any meta-cognition. Perhaps because of my age at 17 my self evaluation is pretty bad, i can't decide wether i'm actually thinking for myself or i am just absorbing other Ti-thinking from people around me (i spend alot of time with educational podcasts and yt-videos), i have no idea wether my Ne is just Se dominant that mistakes Se+Ni for Ne. You get the picture.\n\n3. I have some behavioral and emotional signs that might prove to be Fi. I have trouble being mean to people, i love validation, i more often than not root for the underdog, spend alot of time gaming and playing music. I don't cry and often have trouble acting morally, but i can't deny my empathy, i often feel guilty toward people and i love mysticism and abstract art. This might be contradicted by the fact that i never take action on gut feeling. Idk.\n\nI'm obviously leaving some things out here, but i'm no joke in desperate help because i can't seem to fit myself in any category, which fucks me up because i can't really use the MBTI for personal growth at all. I spend so much time trying to figure out where I am so i just can be fucking  with it and move on with my life but i'm stuck on step 1 and just waste way too much of my energy on this.\n\nAll I'm asking is for somebody to either give me tips on how to actually type myself, or tell me someone who can do it properly. I don't wanna bother people with this stupid question anymore. 
8	>All I'm asking is for somebody to either give me tips on how to actually type myself,\n\nYeah, wait a few years. You're a teenager - your personality isn't even crystallized yet. All diving into MBTI as a teenager is going to do is either stress you out, or give you an arbitrary, meaningless label to latch on to. \n\nYou're 17. Focus more on learning about which colleges you want to go to, discovering which career you want to focus on in college, and building solid habits for when you become an adult (learn to cook, apply for a job, acquire hobbies, hitting the gym, focusing on friendships etc.)\n\nThis isn't to say you currently lack these, but it's where your attention is better devoted toward "personal growth". Your future you will thank yourself for this.\n\nFor what it's worth, I remember being 19 and seeing some youtubers talking about learning their MBTI type. I looked into it a bit, but I didn't really dive too deep in, and forgot everything I read about it (I don't even remember what I originally typed as).\n\nYour mind is still highly, highly moldable at this age, and is why I think it's so important you focus on learning things that actually matter. Completely discard MBTI for now. Return to it near the end of college, if you're so inclined and even remember.
1	I agree to some extent with the poster who said your personality might be developing.\n\nI found this book on types to be useful:\n\nhttps://personalityjunkie.com/my-true-type-book/\n\n
1	You're a teenager, you're still figuring out who you are. MBTI is an interesting tool but you don't need to make it a blueprint for your life or worry about fitting into a pre-existing category. \n\nAlso, now I've got to use "Would you like to see my ENTPness?" with the next girl I match with on Tinder who has their MBTI in their bio. 
1	Ne equals trans contextual thinking. Both Se and Ne explore the world with their senses, but Ne then links the gathered info using all the different parts of the brain, instead of utilizing the contextually appropriate part of the brain. This is where the tangental thinking comes from, which is often mistaken by other for randomness. 
1	I'd say read what people of this type say - and what say people of the other types. You'll get the vibe. Observe their motivations (line of thinking) and compare it to your own. \n\nDon't be afraid to not fall in with stereotypes. For example, there's stereotype of ENTPs not crying often - but I'm ENTP and I do in fact cry very often. Many times in a week. I don't feel weak because of it, it's just a way I channel my emotions outside - sadness, joy, guilt, awe - I can cry about pretty much anything. I feel better after; more stable. \n\n\nI think one of the most helpful things I've learned from MBTI is that even if this system will be shown to be invalid, it still helps to actually acknowledge that they're different types of people; that not everyone is going to be the same, notice the same things or follow similar line of thinking. It seems to be obvious but many people have troubles really realizing this, not able to understand how someone can be different that them in particular field.
13	How do I help this ENTP	Hi ENTPs, \n\nHow do I help an ENTP recover from a bad breakup where he was betrayed by an INFJ? I don't think he was in love with her but I do think he is hurt by the disloyalty and emotional manipulation and seems to be slipping back into a depression again. \n\nI am resisting the urge to do the whole I told you this would happen thing. I know it's not helpful even though I did predict this would happen before they got together I said she was no good. Why you guys dont listen to us and think we have some hidden agenda is beyond my comprehension. Maybe it's a socionics thing. We seem like we are scheming against you when it's usually the other way around? Haha \n\nWhat are some healthy coping methods to recover from a heartbreak? \n\nThanks, INTJ\n\n
12	Just listen to him. I'm an ENTP woman, I was manipulated and betrayed several times by my INFJ ex. \n\nListen to him and try to convince him that he's not the only one to blame (my INFJ had "master level degree" in gaslighting, at the time of our break up I felt like a monster). \n\nENTPs are independent, I had a hard time learning to take others' advices.\n\nDon't tell him "I told you so". It's pretty hard for an ENTP to talk about his feelings, if you talk down on him, he won't tell you anything in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for mistakes, that's not my native language.
7	> What are some healthy coping methods to recover from a heartbreak? \n\nCount backwards from 4821 and subtract using increments of 12 any time the love object appears in your mind, this causes the brain to stop producing chemicals associated with love and forces it to shift its thinking into a purely logical mode going backwards. You essentially use math to fall out of love this way, you're welcome.\n\n&#x200B;
6	I mean.. maybe others will disagree but when I go through a break up I usually wanna get wasted and go out and be hit on by new people so I can remember how awesome I am without someone. Distractions work best for me. 
7	I have an empty INFJ cage available.  I just had to put one down for making too many unwarranted assumptions.  It’s very cathartic to lock them away so they can never hurt someone else again.  
2	I think the healthiest way to get through this would be by dealing with the issue. Why did she betray him and how can he avoid this in the future? I have found that once you learn a lesson from the experience, it becomes less painful and also more valuable.\n\nOn the unhealthy side, you've got alcohol, drugs and meaningless sex.
5	I can speak from my own ENTP experience. I have an INTJ brother who has been of some help after two of my more tragic breakups.\n\nAfter the breakup, the first thing to cure me was to get to know why it didn't work out. We need your INTJ ass to let us have a conversation with you guys about what really happened, so we can see and pinpoint some parts in our behaviour to improve on. Don't point out these things, we don't learn by hearing it from others. We don't need the "I told you so" line either - we kinda knew for some time we're going nowhere with the girl, but we trusted ourselves to somehow make it work despite the odds.\n\nOffer him a discussion over different possibilities. Hear him out, he should have a lot to talk about if he's still figuring it out. Perhaps help him understand why the girl wasn't a good match in the end. But also, very importantly - don't judge his decisions. He will need alcohol and sex during this period. He will act reckless. He will find some stupid rebounds. We have a lot, a lot of different methods to solve ourselves after breakups, that other types will find stupid. All this time he will pretend he's doing well emotionally, and this may be quite annoying to handle. Don't let him cross any lines with you, so if he acts like a bitch to you, stand your ground. But otherwise shut up, he's on his weird, reckless way to sort himself out.\n\nTime should heal him. If you can, join him for some parties, let him find the joy in being single back. Us, ENTPs, are very, very good at being single. He will figure it out rather sooner than later.
4	ENTP needs do something new and exciting, that is challenging, intellectual or socially groundbreaking. He needs to surprise himself and exceed his own personal expectations. \n\n"Success is the best revenge you can ever have" has helped me get through the initial post-INFJ come-down. \n\n100% it would be appreciated. Getting wasted and sharing the experience with trusted friends that is.. and perhaps new ones too. Eventually sobering to the pedestrian reality of being an independent man in the modern age.
3	I also had a bad bad relationship with an INFJ and what i found to most helpful was just to keep living.\n\nI dated her for two years until i realized how bad it was because i thought i could like improve the relationship in short as well as manipulation on her part. When we broke up I was really hurt. 1st do not let him go back to her and try to get him to keep moving forward. Ask him questions (when he is willing and comfortable) to get the shit out and let him tell all he wants to. But yeah distract him with good things and make sure he hangs out with lots of friends and keeps going pit and LIVING!!! Thats what helped me the most. Also learning to let go of the negative emotions you may have from this breakup is hard bc of how logical an ENTP can be but we need to learn to forgive, forget and move on and not be bothered by silly ppl who want to hurt us. 
2	Nothing works quite as well as a good rebound. \n\nCurious to know if other ENTP's will agree with this. 
2	You seem like a really nice friend to be asking about this.  Yea don't do the "I told you so" thing.  And when you said he shouldn't date her, it probably made him want to do it more.  We're rebellious and curious ("What happens if I do X?  Well let's go ahead and find out.")\n\nI agree with the others that listening is huge.  Also, don't coddle him.  We hate that.  And you might not think it's healthy, but we're pragmatic, and knowing we can't do anything about the sad thing, we like to compartmentalize it and turn our attention to something better or to something we can be productive toward.  Ask him about a project he's working on, a hobby he's involved it, take him to an intellectually stimulating movie, bowling, karaoke, whatever he likes that might be fun and stimulating.\n\nI like to process things in my own head for a while before I talk to my close friends about them.  So if he doesn't want to talk about it at first, leave it for now and focus on the other stuff I mentioned.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Go out and get laid. Thats the best/fastest way
2	I had a bad relationship with an INFJ once upon a time.  I cut him out of my life and haven't looked back.  If I were you I'd let him talk about it whenever he needs to talk about it, and reassure him that he's not crazy.  Then video games, shopping, movies, and whatever other nonsense stuff will help take his mind off it.  That's my only suggestion because time is the best healer for heartbreak.  The best you can do until time works it's magic is distract him from the pain.
2	I'm really messed up from my ex-wife. To the point that I don't attempt to associate with women at all. It's been over a year since she walked out... I still have no idea how to become healthy. I've been letting time heap me but if like to be able to be open to a new relationship again but I honestly just focus on my life now and I view others as potential interrupts not additions to my path. 
1	How do you imagine the heaven? look at that movie as if wigi1 so tap dancing in a white shirt with suspenders ..	check that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI9S2W66IYU\n\nwhat do you think about this picture? Do you have any other ideas?
3	Me destroying with my bare hands wigi1's face.
4	Why are (some of) you guys cocky and overconfident?	I used to (and still do) admire the ENTP type in general, but have now gotten sick of the cockiness and huge ego. Any specific reasons why some types naturally have higher egos than others, theoretically or not (personal stories are fine, too). Idk, it's off-putting. It's not your fault and probably more likely the effect of a cause, so I'd like to hear your opinions.
11	I think we are prone to narcissism and overachievement.
11	More often than not, the cocky persona is just a joke. To me it's obvious that I'm not the Coolest Shit Ever ™ but I guess some people take it seriously if they don't know me well enough. \n\nOther than that, I've put effort into being the kind of person that I want to be, so why shouldn't I be proud of the results of that? 
7	Because we often get our confidence from within. We don’t care what (most) other people think, and that’s an attractive trait to others. So they confirm our theory that we’re awesome, which gives us more confidence... Rinse. Repeat. \n\nIt does have the unfortunate effect of inflating our egos to ridiculousness at times, which is when one of the few people whose opinion we *do* care about has to tell us we’re obnoxious. Then we come back to a reasonable level of confidence after much overthinking.
18	Because why not.\n\nIf you have low ego, you must have a reason to not like yourself much. But if you don't like something about you, why not just change? So we change. We become who we want to be. We end up being super cool and it apparently ruins everyone else's lives. We are deeply apologetic about this fact.
5	Basically what everyone one else has said but also. I think we see how others react when people go "You're so good at this" and someone replies "No I'm not" as annoying. I think we embrace that yes we are better than others at some things and others are better at other things. And it's important to acknowledge that. So when that encounter comes about, we don't want to seem like the annoying humble idiot because it's agitating. So we act the complete opposite and embrace what we know to be true to avoid being that kind of person. Running the risk of sounding pompous because the "No I'm not" response is much more widely accepted in society
12	Sometimes because it's funny. Usually because I know i'm the smartest person in the room and can basically get away with whatever i want.
3	Because I love myself that way and most of my friends love me because of/despite that. I don't think we are overconfident btw., I think ENTPs just love laughing and teasing and that could be seen as we don't give a f.uck about other people's opinion (we do). But I love being known for being "naughty". I had a "friend" (we weren't close friends) who I think was an ENTP either. There were times when one of us started teasing someone and the other one jumped right in too. We teased each other a lot and debated either. I love the types who can deal with that - because just that's the way I am. People whom I had deep conversations with know that I have my fears and issues either, but when I'm having fun, I want to have fun on full gas.\n\nEnglish isn't my native language, sry for mistakes.
3	Life is short.  Why spend it doubting yourself?  That's not fun.  Might as well move through life focusing on your strengths.
3	Oh I was...long ago and it was wonderful. 
3	Because I don't need the approval of others to validate my actions.
7	It’s really just all projecting.  Inside most entps are pretty emotionally fragile and only bluff and bluster so they don’t have to deal with all that negative emotion and self-doubt eating them up inside.\n\nIs that what you wanted to hear to make yourself feel better?
2	It's like a natural state to be honest. We unlearn it eventually with age, to a point that it's not off-putting. But not completely.
2	It could be a problem with you.\n\nPeople have been brain washed into believing humility and humbleness are divine virtues by people who seek to control them.\n\nReligions, governments, etc, etc.\n\nPeople rarely think about how their values have been shaped via the desire for power and control via history.
2	It cracks me up in a good way. I love that side in ENTP’s because it’s so playful and impish. And when I think about it, I realise ‘Why the f not?” is a far better response than my eternal self questioning and doubt. Why does it bother you?\n
2	I can be sometimes really confident (which is often seen as overlyconfident) for various reasons :\n\n1. I know what I'm capable of. For years, I had better grades than most of my classmates without working at all. I now wish that it hadn't been the case, because I never really learnt to work, but even today, most of the time I'm fine without having to put as much effort into things as most people do. And I don't hide the fact that I know it.\n2. Sometimes I can be seen as really cocky when talking to someone because I already know what they are about to say, and don't always hide the impatience that comes with it. It's just sometimes really hard to have someone explain something to you for 5 minutes while you already figured out a long time ago.\n3. I see more possibilities than most people do. So it can make me look like I'm overlyconfident, thinking I could be able to achieve so many things, but really to me it's people in general that are taught they should be humble, and that often leads them to not be confident enough. \n4. I think being really positive and confident about yourself is way more attractive than being too negative, or too humble. I prefer honesty over being what society expects from me. So yeah, if I like who I am, I'm not going to try to hide it or be apologetic about it.
2	We just really really enjoy being ourselves.
2	For me, it's 1/3rd self confidence, 1/3rd self-doubt that I want to hide, and 1/3rd a joke. I like attention, I like to be liked and kind of looked up to, I guess? I'm definitely overconfident to the point where it's a personality flaw but if in not confident in myself then who else is gonna be confident in me? 
1	I think it also depends largely on the 5th trait - neuroticism which is in the big 5 but not in mbti. 
1	Not trying to be rude, but why do you care or even matter ? If someone’s ego is bothering you, the problem is coming from you. I mean, if someone’s ego is getting in the way of conversation for example (such as not willing to listen to you cause you’re inferior or whatever the reason they might have in their head), then yeah but that would be sad for us or anyone who acts that way since it has a potential to limit our growth (and you can also decide to just leave them or not talk to them). \n\nHowever, if someone’s is being cocky or arrogant or has an inflated ego without having an concrete external impact on you, then why does it matter. If you don’t like it, then the problem isn’t really the entp or anyone for that matter but more coming from you (aka projection). This is an honest answer; of course, in real life I tend to make the conscious effort of not letting my behaviour at times get over people’s head when it is necessary(Fe). Also, cocky and arrogance are loosely defined in this context. Is it speaking with confidence that’s cocky. Is it saying what’s on your mind bluntly that’s arrogant or not agreeing with your arguments despite your best efforts to formulate them ? And so on...  \nAnyways, you’ll understand when you  reach perfection. 
1	Personally, I'm usually smart enough in most situations to avoid ruffling any feathers. Though, if I stop caring about my image, I can let loose. It depends on if I think you can take it or not, or if I want you to take it or not - one of those.
1	I'll lay the arrogance on thick when it applies. Usually as a stress test for potential new friends or mates. If they get it and play along, we're golden.\n\nWomen respond well to confidence, and just showing the ability to appear confident goes a long way. If the entp can't back anything up with palpable qualities, it's all for naught. These are the ones you're experiencing and the most common by far. I was this way when I was younger. Years of reading, working out, and talking to everyone has helped immensely. 
1	Because we are different people. 
1	I don't have an ego; people just know how amazingly perfect I am. 
7	What was the type of the person that you’ve had the best chemistry with?	Whether it be romantically or friendship wise, who can you name in your life that you’ve had the best chemistry with? What was their type?
5	Well, I thought that I had been dating an INTJ...but the more time we spend together the more I’m starting to suspect he is actually an ISTJ. I’ve never had this good of chemistry with any other individual I’ve dated. Ever. Granted I’ve only ever dated feelers in the past so maybe it’s just because I’m finally with a thinker, ha...or it could be because my dad’s an ISTJ and I have daddy issues. FUCK.\n\nFriendships wise? My three ENTJ, ENTP, and INTP friends. Being friends with an ENTP girl is interesting because it’s like seeing the female version of you go through life, haha. She’s super cool though and we are always on the same page.  If I ever want to make sure I’m not crazy I’ll message her and say “Okay, do you ever feel this and this way?” and she’ll respond with “All the fucking time.” and I’ll just say something like “Thank God”. We can also talk shit to each other and be totally fine with it, sort of like like this: https://imgur.com/a/Wtq6DL7 . We were talking about whether or not I’m a picky eater, lol. I don’t think I am. Haha, every ENTP needs another ENTP friend to confide in.\n\nAlso, yes the food in Sri Lanka was shit. No one will ever convince me otherwise.
4	It’s always ENFP for me!
3	I somehow get surrounded by INTJ male friends. Excellent knowledgeable people that you can learn from while monkeying around them, pushing their buttons, making fun of how they react to obscenity and how emotionally oblivious they can be. They don't mind. They won't leave either. They understand private space when needed, too. I also have this ENTP friend, so we can team up and get even more fun from trolling INTJs together.\n\nI also get along super well with INTP/INFP girls. They're super lovable and we understand each other very well. Wouldn't call it "chemistry" exactly, more like someone I understand and could fully trust, especially INTPs.\n\nMy current girlfriend is ENFP however. We come from two different sets of values and process data differently, but she's ultimately fun. We disagree a lot, but we share almost all interests and never get bored. Ultimate match for exploring life together, and we can surprisingly often come up with great solutions to live together on a day-to-day basis.
3	INFP 
2	It's always been other ENTPs or INTPs, maybe an ENFJ but that's all. (Tbh I would marry an ENFJ)
2	Infj as in absurd connection and share stubborness and never giving up on each other regardless of all that theres a big problem with their emotionallity and ways of coping later on but is by far the biggest connection i have ever had with anyone.\n\nInfp on giving each other diferent perspectives, and long conversations and in general being very chill around each other.\n\nIntjs on flirtyng and sexual scalating we speak an extremmely similar lenguage, is just something is mising with them so i kinda not that invested on the type so the connection is not that strong as with an Infj but is definitevely strong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the best type regards chemistry is Infj the connection is in everything not just sexual or mental,but everything.
2	Men: INTJ, ENFJ  \nBest friends: INFJ (almost across the board)  \n\n\nINFJ men seem rare or maybe they're hard to identify.  It's rough out there for ENTP gals.
2	My best friend is an INTJ. Super smart and has way more patience than me, but we can always hangout, talk shit and be mean to people when we need that. Calls me out on my shitty behavior sometimes which I appreciate and I call her out on her tendency to overthink and over plan. Plus with her being an introvert, we don't have to talk for a week and it's all good.   \n\n\nTLDR: INTJ because literally nothing I do can hurt her feelings and its awesome.
2	INTJs
2	ISTP. My best friend. Lucky to have found him in middle school, gave me someone I could be my real self with and someone to spar with mentally. 
1	Huh I've met not long ago a friend, his type is ENTP and even tho it's online buddy, I think the chemistry (friend wise) is there. But we'll see after time if it really has a potential to be long term friendship. \n\nAlso, I've dated a girl that supposedly is INFP but after time has passed I don't think we were that compatible.
1	INFJ, ENFP, ESFP, ESTP, INFP. Probably in decreasing order.
1	Smart people.
1	Friendship wise I get along super well with my long time best friend who’s ENTP also because we just understand each other so easily. I also am very good friends with an INFP even though we’re quite different :)
1	INTP
14	ENTPs seem to have a reputation for talking their way out of trouble, got any good stories?	
10	Yeah, maybe this was just me getting lucky but I think it had a hell lot to do with my confidence about the matter. \n\nI had a 4000 word essay due, and had to submit it on a Monday. Tuesday and Wednesday were holidays. So I’m sitting there, in English class with my essay incomplete. The thing with this essay was that it was supposed to be monitored outside of my English class. But it was an English essay. \nI get to class, I’m there with my incomplete essay. Before the class began, I had seen my teacher in the hallway, specifically asked if I could show her my essay. She was open to it and said yes, she’d like to see it that day. Before the class got over, I reminded her about the essay again. And I asked her if she had any free classes, she said that she did. She told me when, but then I was like “oh no I have my economics class”. And then I asked her if I could stay back specifically to show my essay to her. (Btw she’s the kind of teacher who would love to stay back and help her students out and if I’m not wrong, she really likes me) but instead she said, “oh no don’t worry about it, just show it to me on Thursday”. And there, I saved myself by risking a shit ton lol. Pretty proud of it tbh \n\nYou got any good ones? 
8	Not really talking per se, but here is an old story from HS.\n\nI missed a biology test because of illness, and when I went back to school after a week the teacher told me I should take it right now. I didn't really expect that so naturally I hadn't study. I told her I would prefer to write the test next week but of course she wouldn't care.\n\nSince she forgot to bring the printed test sheets, she simply told me to write down a couple of questions related to the subject. I started the test, but not surprisingly, I had no clue for the most part.\n\nThen I had an idea. I knew from my classmates that in the original test there was a short essay about blood types and blood transfusions. I happened to know a lot about this topic because it was an interest of mine, so I phrased the question myself and write it down after the others. I knew she wouldn't remember the exact questions she told me ad hoc, and that it wouldn't be suspicious because a similar one was included in the test which the rest of class took.\n\nThis boosted my score quite a bit, so I ended up getting an okay grade despite being clueless at the beginning. Classmates were pretty impressed. \n
7	My teacher once caught me cutting class. I somehow managed to convince her i wasn't in her class xD
3	Got out on pure bullshit regarding a busfare ticket once (The fee for riding without a ticket would be about 150-200$)\n\nInspector asks if I have a ticket, I say yes. Inspector asks to see it, I decline.\n\nWhy? Well you see dear inspector it's on my phone, which is personal property and I don't feel safe bringing it out at this moment. \n\n"Well without a ticket you cannot ride" moves to grab a hold of me.\n\nDid you observe me step on this bus without paying the fare? (No) great then if you'd unhand me I'd appreciate it, as you haven't observed me do anything unlawful you don't hold the right to detain me, and this is my stop.\n\nInspector stood dumbfounded and I strolled off, I know fuckall about the legal proceedings of these things.
11	MTBI and Promotion at Work: ENTPs fastest to get promoted to manager	[https://file.scirp.org/pdf/PSYCH\_2015092115235677.pdf](https://file.scirp.org/pdf/PSYCH_2015092115235677.pdf)
7	They often say that ENTPs are natural leaders and managers, but we often don't realise it ourselves (probably due to weak Fi). 
3	Very interesting read, thank you for sharing (and inflating my ego, heh). 
3	Hm, interesting, especially if you happen to be ENTP yourself ha. Though the differences weren't too far away from each other. As the study said, other factors might play a more significant role regarding promotion speed.
4	>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator has been the focus \nof extensive research and substantial evidence has accumulated suggesting the inventory has satisfactory con-\ncurrent and predictive validity and reliability\n\nThen cites one single paper... from 1993... From the same author as the main author. Lol. All in all, I'm neutral on the paper. It has some interesting points, but I think should ultimately be rejected. A few important take aways though:\n\nThe result of ENTP being fastest to promote seems to be from correlations effects — there's no raw time scales given. From what I see, they noticed that ENTP all as independent dimensions had a weak, negative correlation with time to become manager. Their conclusion then is ENTP is type quickest to become manager, but this time could be as small as 3 months. I really don't see how it's a meaningful result. \n\nFurthermore, it assumes all the dimensions are independent, which I think is untrue (which is by no means a pathology unique to MBTI—even in Big5 all the dimensions are statistically correlated). \n\n>Overall it should be noted that the personality variables accounted for only a small percentage of the variance. \nInevitably age, supposedly associated with experience and knowledge was the best predictor of promotion.\n\nThis part is important, in that it's experience that indicates whether you're promoted. Even if ENTP is the quickest to promote (which I'm skeptical of), the difference seems to be minuscule, and imo, negligible. \n\nLastly, and what I think is one of the redeeming qualities of the paper:\n\n>The first regression showed that the only type related to \npromotion was Feeling: those with high scores were slow in being promoted. This was probably because the \nFeeling dimension was correlated both with Neuroticism and Agreeableness, both traits linked to lack of mana-\ngerial success \n\nThis I think is true. It could partially explain why their sample was skewed more toward males. Women tend to be feelers (60;40) more than men (who tend to be thinkers in 60:40). \n\nThat is to say, as the paper suggests, promotions of these caliber often require low agreeableness and low neuroticism, which are traits not only correlated with Thinking, but with being a male. \n\nEdit: typos
2	This is clearly a biased, bigoted paper attempting to justify why women (majority of whom are Feelers) unfairly suffer from a pay gap.  \n\nAlternatively it explains why women don’t get promoted as frequently as men and hence get paid less.  \n\nAlternatively it’s a psychology paper about MBTI and therefore has twice zero credibility.  \n\nBut I’ll accept it as true because it blows smoke up my ass. 
32	How do you keep yourself accountable?	From what I have been reading and in my own experience, under achieving seems to be a typical weakness among ENTPs. I feel like my inability (or unwillingness) to follow through with tasks out of sheer boredom has been a continual stumbling block for me. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
28	How old are you?\n\nI'm going to guess high-school or college.... because this is a problem that takes care of itself when you leave that environment.\n\nSimply put: Being bored is a better fate than being hungry. If you don't achieve, you don't make money. If you don't make money, you don't eat.
14	You just do it, force yourself to do it, don't allow yourself to make excuses.  "I'm too tired, I've got time tomorrow, I need help, etc etc etc."\n\nIf you deny yourself the ability to make excuses you'll start to resent the fact that you are tired.  In time you'll re-calibrate your decision making processes.  You'll choose to go to bed earlier and get more sleep because you have work to do tomorrow and being too tired is unacceptable (because you made it so) and you don't want to be tired when doing it.\n\nStart developing good habbits.  Here's an easy one.  Make your bed EVERY DAY.  Yes I know it's not logical.  I know you're just going to get it messy again later, but do it anyways.  Make your bed every single morning as part of your morning routine, every day, no exceptions!.\n\nWhen you make your bed every day, you go to bed to a clean bed that's ready to lie in.  Everytime you look at your bed you'll think "I made that, I did something today".  Everytime you're tired and want to lay down in bed, you'll think, no, I don't want to mess up my made bed and I'll have to make it again since bedtime isn't later.\n\nGet yourself on a schedule.  Go to bed at the same time every night, and get up at the same time every day.  Doesn't matter if it's a weekend.  Don't drink caffeine 5 hours before bedtime, so say bed time is at 11 pm, don't drink caffeine after 6 pm.  Let it run out of your system so you feel more tired at 11 pm.\n\nEat 3 meals a day, even if breakfast is a gronola bar, eat something when you get up.  Eat lunch and eat dinner, on as close a schedule as possible.\n\nExercise for at least 10 minutes every day (sex counts).\n\nSelf Discipline!\n\nIs shit boring, yes.  Make yourself do it as requirement for rewards.  Do you like to play video games and binge netflix! We all do.  But have the self discipline to say NO, not until you've completed XYZ.\n\nOnce you get in the habbit of doing this and using the things you like to do as rewards for doing the things you don't like to do, you'll start to feel happier and better about it.  You won't have to feel quilt when binging netflix because you accomplished everything you needed to doi.  And you won't be full of anxiety and stress because you haven't done anything and all you've done is game and binge netflix.\n\nDelayed Satisfaction.  I'm not telling you to quit gaming. I'm not telling you to quit binging shows.  I'm not telling you to stop watching porn or w/e your vices are.\n\nI'm telling you to deny yourself these things when you have responsibilities.  Tackle and master those responsibilities and finish those tasks and use your vices as rewards for doing so.\n\nWhat you'll find is you enjoy things MUCH more when you feel like you've earned them.  This will create long term sources of dopamine that have a bigger impact than instant gratification sources.  Over time you'll retrain your brain to prefer delayed gratification over instant gratification.  You'll find yourself not wanting to get on netflix because you have work to do, so you'll do the work.  Then you'll feel better and can watch netflix later and be guilt free about it.\n\nThe thing is, it's hard to start, because you don't want to.  You're addicted to instant gratification sources and want everything NOW, like a lot of people and many depressed people.\n\nSo you have to make yourself do it, that's the only way out.  There's no magic wand, no cure all, you have to force yourself to make these changes.\n\nBut when you do, you'll feel better after about a month and it will become normal to you.\n\nI met an INFJ that allowed me to realize these things and it got me into counseling, it took 6+ months, but I'm a different person today than I was 2 years ago, night and day difference.  \n\n\nI'm still improving, but I'm much more ambitious and much more disciplined than I was in the past and I feel better about myself and am getting more done in my life and enjoying the fruits of my labor.
16	Force yourself to do it you fucker.
3	I hate myself into achieving. Not ideal but works 
2	Timers do wonders.
2	I don’t, I learnt to make my friends do that, for business anyway. I’ve been where you are and I know what it’s like. I’d even say I’m only starting to get shit done. What do you study? you might be in the wrong degree or it might be not engaging 🤷🏽‍♂️ your goals in life are also a big thing. I think you need a huge goal something that sounds impossible to make possible 
1	I'm going to separate myself from the rest of the commenters - I'm 30 and I struggle with this, too. It's a constant battle, for me, to compel myself to finish even the smallest tasks. Dishes? Menial work tasks? Texting back even my friends? Yep, it's all a struggle. I don't see myself simply "growing out of it" and it sounds like you may not, either. Listen, that's totally okay! We just have to work a little harder than others and in different ways. I've found that creating daily lists, on actual pads of paper, helps me. I start with a small list of must-dos and I make them super specific. Umbrella items, like "call/text back friends" don't work for me. I need to list out each friend. Then, when I complete a task, I cross it off. It sounds so hilariously stupid, but the gratification of being able to cross things off, line by line, encourages me to keep going and gives me just the tiniest sigh of relief, like, "Okay, great! One less thing to do!" At the end of the day, I feel super validated to know I crossed off so many things. I add to the list as I go, too, if I find I have enough time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also like to separate my day in 2 hour blocks, if possible. My attention span is bonk, let's be real. So, I tell myself that I can push through for a 2 hour interval and then give myself a mental break, once I've earned it. Remember that list? Yep, gotta stay plugging away for 2 hours before I can zone out, come up with my next brilliant idea, swipe on Tinder.... you get the picture. BUT, the key is to also limit your "you" time, too. Give yourself 10-15 minutes and then hit your next block of devotion to your agenda. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake magnesium. Listen, I'm not a doctor or ever super health savvy, but I can tell you from personal experience that magnesium totally helps with "brain fog." I'm a realtor and since January 1st, after having started magnesium supplements, I have sold half of the amount of homes I sold in ALL of last year. It's been a wild ride, but I'm really pleased with myself! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, be your biggest champion! This sounds like every elementary school poster, but it is so important for people like us. When you do the things you set out to do or have any other work, school, or personal victory, praise yourself to others. I'm not talking about being nauseatingly arrogant or braggy, but it's important to have a team of supporters. I'm fortunate that I work with great friends of mine, who know about my struggles with goal-setting and follow-through, and my mom is also one of my greatest champions. When I have a success, I share my pride with them! It encourages me to keep going. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact is, the things that most of these comments have suggested to you absolutely do not work for me. If they don't work for you, either, don't fret. Life is a journey and we are all on our own unique path of evolution. Just know that as long as you don't quit trying, you will most assuredly continue to learn what works and what doesn't for your own journey. We are all here to support you, as you grow! 
1	Clarify what is it exactly that you feel like under achieving. Because being in college you surely work hard already so it's understandable that you cut yourself some slack in your free time.\n\nAnyhow ENTP is a seeker and analyst. It's fun to start getting critical and investigating your own behaviors and motivations. There's a lot of ressource for that noble task that can be found within the "self growth" or "self improvement" fields. Books, audiobooks, lectures... I love Jim Rohn. Also buddhist teachers tend to be really neutral and matter-of-fact so they can be of great help in clarifying stuff.\n\nWhat *worked* for me was the most practical, down to earth things. Spreadsheets, LISTS, timetables, JOURNAL, keeping track of everything: thoughts, rants, hopes, plans. Setting up big goals - cutting them into smaller tasks. I assembled all my writings into a personal yearbook so I can feel the undeniable weight of my mental activity and uncessant research.\n\nProductivity App's such as "Loot habit tracker" are a godsent. Also, physical matters... good food, get sun, vitamins, get comfy, sweat, laugh, go out in nature, clean your surroundings. And lastly ditch situations and people that are too demanding. You're not here to meet anyone's expectation.\n\nMess with all those tools, see what clicks. With time you'll become intuitively aware of what needs to be adjusted and new habits will come to you naturally. \n\nFor me the worst part is to resist the urge of throwing it all at the wall to see what stick aka shooting myself in the foot for pure entertainment.
1	Find a job you enjoy. If you love what you do, it's easy to wake up and go do it! If you don't like what you're doing, why are you doing it?\n\n(Disclaimer: I understand the need to do boring tasks like self-maintainence, etc, but if you have issues following through with little stuff, go to a therapist. Reddit won't help much.)

0	Micro dosing on weed helped me personally for a few months to get out of this problem. You have to monitor your intake though or you can get too stoned . For me the 1-4 hits work best from a vaporizer set at around 350C. You'll have to experiment with it though, try to find out that zone in which you just go with the flow of doing the task and not seem to think ahead of yourself, just be in the moment. 
91	The sub is getting better :)	In the past weeks/months, many people were complaining about the posts being just poeple trying to fit into the entp archetype, but it seems that lately, very insightful and interesting posts have surfaced. GG peeps, just wanted to point out that we became relevant again. \n\n\nEDIT: replaced boys by peeps, for the sake of gender neutrality
67	Subs in general are getting better.  While I think Subway had a good foundation and really shifted paradigms with the whole assembly line sandwich, there are so many better sub spots now.  Subway failed to adapt on two points: 1. They didnt up the quality of their ingredients, and 2. They failed to change as times changed., I.e. Subway looks the same as it did 10-15 years ago. \n
16	I liked when that ENTJ came by the other day to fuck around. 
8	I wish the same for the shithole called ENTP in FB Groups.
8	What about the girls?
5	There is still very little insight to be gained if you are beyond the infancy steps of adulthood. So much ridiculous anecdotal evidence for things with no or hardly any relationship to the underlying functions and people strongly limiting their potential to develop because of it. 
5	>In the past weeks/months, many people were complaining about the posts being just poeple trying to fit into the entp archetype\n\nThose were the same people that prefer to read DAE threads over a multi-paragraph comment.\n\n>but it seems that lately, very insightful and interesting posts have surfaced\n\nLol no. Out of all the posts on the front page the only insightful one comes from a dude that gets regularly downvoted for pointing out mistypes. The rest is the usual low quality meme-tier content.\n\n
2	This was a public announcement, brought to your by TheDildosaur.
2	Boys?😅
2	It's the ebb and flow 
2	Maybe INTPs have migrated here. Our sub is being flooded with tons of different types pushing tons of different agendas lately. Maybe it's calmer here.
5	It's not getting better. It's extremely telling how a mistype is making this post. Better doesn't mean longer posts. Recently the /r/math subreddit has gone through a similar flux of poor content. Math is one of the most TP fields you can find, possibly only less TP than philosophy. \n\nFor instance, they recently made an [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/av5rnt/meta_update_on_policies_and_new_moderator/) updating their rules. Notice any interesting parallel? \n\n>Image posts will now require an explanation of relevance: if you upload an image, you should post a comment under your post describing why the post is relevant to mathematics and prompts interesting discussion.\n\nTo give you an example of the type of content they're complaining about, browse the top posts from the past month on the sub. The top post is a [quote by Hilbert](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/aqjhcj/what_are_your_opinions_on_david_hilberts_quote/), a mathematician, and is asking for interpretations of the quote.\n\nWhile the top comment is long, insightful, and likely factual, it doesn't reflect the purpose of the math sub... Which is to discuss math, not cultures or interpretations of mathematician's political remarks. \n\nAnd so it goes with /r/ENTP. By some metrics, the posts are getting longer, but that doesn't mean they reflect the ENTP mindset, nor does it reflect the NT mindset in general. \n\n>just wanted to point out that we became relevant again.\n\nWho's "we"? The mistypes after sleeping for 8 hours?

1	Motivational speaker DESTROYS motivation
14	Why do INTPs often seem to dislike ENTPs?	I’ve noticed that when there are discussions about how ENTPs think, who they are, etc. INTPs will often chime in and give a more negative response to ENTPs than other types will. Why do you think this is?
16	INTPs only offer hard truths to those we love. Think of it as an INTP hug. It you don't think what we say is true, refute it... and we'll know you love us too.\n\n&#x200B;
7	Because we see the big picture without explaining every bit and they get annoyed, in my experience.
6	I have never experienced this once.  Of all the INTP's I've met we ALWAYS get on fantastically.  
12	It’s the smallest differences that elicit the most rivalry. You do everything like us but slightly differently.\n\nBut also, ENTP is an additive, process-building type of thinker and INTP is subtractive, results-reducing type of thinker. INTP has a negative tone to their thinking where they’re trying to get rid of extra information, get to the point, whereas ENTP is trying to add onto a structure of knowledge, so INTP comes off as the more ‘critical’ type.\n\nThere’s more differences than just one is the extroverted/introverted version of the other. \n\nAlso, to make up for your intellectual positivity, y’all have a very negative type of feeling-sensing that comes off as needy or bitchy compared to INTP, who’s sensing-feeling is positive, or undemanding. So, while I’ll be critically sharp here, in a social vibe, ENTP are in turn the more negative type.
10	Maybe they think ENTPs are too impulsive. \n\n>INTPs will often chime in and give a more negative response to ENTPs than other types will\n\nProbably because they know that ENTPs are not really offended? I really don't see a lot of hate between the xNTPs tbh\n\n&#x200B;
5	INTPs are harsh. I consider myself pretty brutally honest... but them? Even more so. My best friend since birth is an INTP. We fight... *a lot*. But I wouldn't say we dislike each other. I've just gotten used to how blunt she is. INTPs, (in my experience, at least), sugarcoat absolutely nothing. I'm normally the only one confident/close enough to tell my INTP friend how rude she's being. Then she checks herself and apologizes... eventually, lol. I think perhaps the same could be said for other INTPs... maybe ENTPs call them out and INTPs dislike being singled out for their potentially socially unacceptable/negative behavior?
12	If you can’t get along with INTPs....somebody is mistyped. 
3	My best friend=intp. Communication is strange, when using words/language. \n\nEverything else is perfect. Humor, goals, politics, hobbys... \nDamn i do not like his GF, but we get along so well. \nHe challenges me a ton. In a nasty way. Love it. \n\nThey do not dislike us. They get triggerded a lot by ENTPs. Which is good.
3	As someone who procrastinates and gets lost in fog sometimes, I feel like I'm at my best when I'm around types that are more self-motivated.  I get annoyed with INTPs when they can't get it together and get going.  Which is often.  Each type has their downfall and that's theirs.  And we resent in others what we dislike about ourselves right?  I think we have that procrastination thing in common.  They probably get annoyed with our enthusiasm though and we get annoyed with their lethargy.
2	Classic banter, big champ.
2	100% I get triggered by my ENTP friend.  Nobody else even makes me bat an eye. I'm not sure he's much of a friend lately but I'm in a waiting pattern
2	One of my best friends is an ENTP. \n\nAs long as an INTP and an ENTP have a mutual respect and connect on something besides playing devil's advocate, they're a great match.
2	My wife is INTP I'm ENTP and it works great. We both have very different strengths and excel in different situations and compliment eachother well despite our similarities and differences
2	In my experience,  I wouldn't say they were negative.  I would describe them more as a polar opposite or a counter argument.  I am only 1% E, so I am pretty even keeled. 
1	I don't think it's a "negative response." I think it's them using their Ti to pick things apart.
1	* I wish I had an ENTP friend.\n* One of the most amazing people I've ever met is an ENTP. I cried multiple times uncontrollably because he was getting married and quitting our group.\n* I'm only negative to ENTPs online because a lot of you are trolls and I know most of you can take it well when called out. It's not a sign of animosity at all.\n* The only main thing that bothers me about ENTPs (aged 20-30) is that they often seem to have a complete lack of self-awareness in some respect. For example, the desire to think aloud to the extent that you're completely disrupting everyone else (this isn't unique to ENTP), or being so curious that it feels like you're doing a quick-fire interrogation of someone and not allowing them to breath or ask questions back.

1	Because INTPs are hyper critical of everything including themselves, with entps its to balance your over confident, happy go lucky attitude. We are cautious and like to verify things which you tend to find boring. Also ENTPs are awesome irl so not sure what you mean. 
13	ENTP book recommendations.	Hello comrades,\n\n I'm looking for more books to read and wanted some suggestions from fellow ENTPs, if any of you are willing, could you post your top 3 books of all time and maybe a brief description of what you like about them, mine are as follows:\n\n1. Lights Out In Wonderland - DPC Pierre (surrealist debauchary from the persepetive of a very dysfunctional man). \n2. Steppenwolf - Herman Hesse (Life from the perspective of a clusterfuck hermit) \n3. Iron John - Robert Bly (A book about manhood, or lack thereof in Western society).
6	1- The Way of Kings, Brandon Sanderson. Wild that I think it's the best book of all time, but man, its epic, philosophical and inspiring, I couldn't recommend anything more.\n\n2- 1984- Nothing else needs to be said, ridiculously great.\n\n3- The Art of War, Sun Tzu. Throwing a curve ball here, but this was the philosophy book that taught me most about life. \n\nAlso in consideration. Catch 22. To Kill a Mockingbird. The Da Vinci Code. and anything from Seneca.
4	The Three-Body Problem series by Cixin Liu.   \n
4	Everything by chuck palahniuk
3	Ubik - Philip K Dick \[Really hard to explain but worth the read. \]\n\nDune - Frank Herbet \[Great political complexities within epic worldbuilding.\]\n\nThe Monk - Matthew Lewis \[from 1798: A devout Monk succumbs to his wicked side.\]
3	I second anything Herman Hesse. Demian was my favorite book in college.
3	house of leaves- so good, its like a puzzles and a book had a child, must have\n\na clockwork orange\n\ngravity's rainbow
3	1. 'Paradise Lost' by John Milton: I'm not religious, but this is an absolute classic, and for such a classic, actually flows in its read very well. If you can get one with Gustave Dore, even better. Great writing, great story that a lot of pop culture movie / show Lucifer / Satan stories are based on (think Devil's Advocate, Supernatural, etc).\n\n2. 'The Golden Age' Trilogy by John C. Wright: If you are at all open to 'hard' scifi, this is the best contemporary scifi book(s) I've read. There's more scifi on one page of this book than in many entire scifi books. And the story is pretty interesting, with some interesting characters. (For alternative scifi recommendations, slightly lighter on the scifi ideas themselves but have amazing stories and characters, I'd recommend, instead, Moon is a Harsh Mistress by Robert Heinlein, and Altered Carbon by Richard Morgan)\n\n3. 'Blood Related' by William Cook: If you want something very dark, serial-killer related, absolutely twisted. Give this one a try. If you want something more popular in this genre, very little out there can beat ole 'American Psycho' by Bret Easton Ellis, though. That one is up there for me as being truly twisted, and the movie didn't do it justice. The movie was child's play compared to the book. Maybe skip past the bit where he goes on and on about Whitney Houston, tho.
3	American Kingpin about the founding of the dark web marketplace the Silkroad is the most ENTP book I have ever read. \n\nThe whole basis of the book is questioning the status quo. Why should we accept things the way they are? Why do governments have the power to decide what is okay? And how can we use technology to build the world that we want?\n\nI would call the book a cross between the Facebook movie and Catch Me If You Can.\n\nEssentially Ross built one of the worlds largest and most profitable e-commerce websites while on the run from national and international government agencies across the globe\n\nAnd they actually use Ross's journal and details from the law enforcement officers tracking him to put together the timeline\n\n\n\n
2	The Secret History by Donna Tartt \nSpecial Topics in Calamity Physics by Marisha Pessl\nAlice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll
2	I found Noah Yuval Harari to be an excellent, well thought out(an understatement), writer.\n\nHis books are -Sapiens -Homo Deus -21lessons for the 21st century\n\nThe last one is pretty skippable. My Favourite is the second one.\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is one of my favourites.\n\nZero to One by Peter Thiel is also a great book.
2	*Siddhartha* by Hesse is one of my top 1000 favorite books.  \nAlso *The Magic Mountain* and *Death in Venice* by Thomas Mann while I’m thinking about Germans.   
2	Tropic of Cancer-- Henry Miller.  A fascinatingly written portrait of an American's time in Paris during the Great Depression.\n\nThe Catcher in the Rye-- J.D. Salinger.  A potent recounting of a major turn of events in the life of a teenager who I suspect is not unlike many of us.  As an aside, I'm always interested in whether or not the ending surprises anyone.\n\nAtlas Shrugged-- Ayn Rand.  Whether or not you buy into the philosophy, it's a hell of an impactful read (and the author's history should absolutely be taken into account when processing this).
2	Brave new world is top tier stuff since its not only about a fictional dystopian future,but also about philosophy in general\nThat and steppenwolf is some good stuff\nAnd , just for fun , the moon stone 
2	Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson\n\nHitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (books 1-2) by Douglas Adams \n\nMeditations by Marcus Aurelius \n 
2	All these books seem too serious. For fascinating light-hearted reading that stimulates thought I'd go with :\n\nOff to be the wizard - Scott Meyer\nA hilarious look at the nature of reality. Like the matrix but funny. \n\n\nWe Are Legion: We are Bob - Dennis Taylor\nCryogenics gone bonkers, and a guy learns how to create more of himself digitally. \n\n\nOld Man's War - John Scalzi\nThis one isn't he most serious of my recommendations, but i still find it light reading. Old minds put into young strong bodies in return for military service. \n\n\n\n\n
1	HOUSE OF LEAVES
1	So since most of the ones that sprugn to mind have been posted already i'll go with Malazan book of the fallen, the way its written I've understood can be quite annoying to readers, but personally I love how twisting and turning it is
22	Some recent epiphanies on friendship as an ENTP	So in the past years I’ve realized that my[24M] issues with making friends and maintaining those relationships is something I have actual power to influence. In high school and prior I yearned to be invited out by friends and acquaintances, but wishing don’t make it so. I decided to stop waiting for people to have an event and invite me, rather I start inviting them. \n\nHosting potlucks have been my go to for the past year and a half because they allow for so much possibility. \nFor a relaxed atmosphere all one needs is some food, friends and something good to drink. I’ve hosted a Japanese tea ceremony potluck, a regular potluck themed potluck and others.  Everyone has fun and it’s a great way to get friend groups to commingle and broaden your friend base by inviting as many people as you can. I find that this not being a house party puts people in a different mindset and leaves them to approach the event free spiritedly. Often people bring instruments and have jam sessions just to spice things up. \n\nThe second epiphany happened today; there’s a reason it’s called “making friends.”  Because friendships don’t just happen, they’re created. If you like spending time with someone then make it happen. REPEATEDLY. \nIf you’re not active in your pursuit of outward relationships then there should be little hope in them flourishing on their own. \nThe forging of friendships is like taking up the mantle for your own life, you can passively let things happen and hope it works out for you OR you can try to impose your wishes and aspirations on your environment to make it better. \n\nAnyway I hope this helps someone, I know I could have used this info years ago. 
4	Yeah as you start working life you need a reason to spend time together even if it's just eating and talking if you can keep each other talking about meaningful interesting things then there ya go\n\nSomething can be same hobby or interest or whatever 
3	Forgot to include the part where if you piss them off bad enough, friendship ain't nothin' and you'll be left behind like a piece of shit. Image ends up being almost virtually everything with friends (acquaintances). Actual friends are often just like you. The need to differentiate is the most pivotal when it comes to being with people.
4	Waiting for your third ephiphany when you realise this is false
4	ITT : op discovers networking. 
2	On the other hand, I feel like these people are more friendly acquaintence than friends. Depends on how you define what a friend is.\n\nPersonally, I lean more towards how seneca defined friendship. \nhttps://www.brainpickings.org/2017/05/19/seneca-friendship/\n\nSure, being friendly towards people around you and building a social network requires you to be proactive most of the time but what normally happens is a superficial connection to people. Therefore, I find being friendly easy but true friendship hard to find. \n\nThat being said, good job on being proactive in forming connections. 
2	Same. I started hosting dinner parties because as much as I'm good at glad-handing and making a courtesy appearance at parties where there are a million strangers and you basically only learn where people are from/what they do for work, I don't enjoy it that much. It's cool to bring together a smaller group (especially when invitees don't all know each other) and connect to discuss more intellectually interesting topics. This type of environment makes it much more viable to have engaging conversations about ideas rather than the typical people/things oriented discussions, I find.
1	Any relationship is about mutual involvement, mutual sharing, mutual give and receive. This took me too long to realize as well.\n\nWith friendship, the first issue is finding the people you want to do this with. It takes a commitment, something we're probably less fond of. This is the hardest part for me personally. It is so hard to find people that you can really connect with and converse anything about. One aspect of this is having contact points of similar interest. The vast majority of people are trivial, or direct experience focused. Philosophical discussions are like gold in the seawater. You really need to work to get it out of there.\n\nSecond is to actually keep up the relationship. With modern mingling and networking and superficial relationships, it is very rare to forge long term friendships. I say forge, because that's what it really needs. It takes spending a lot of quality time together. This is why most friendships are formed in schools and workplaces. Even then, they rarely last very long. Just have to put down the work, but it really shouldn't be work. You should have common interests and a good flow of conversations.\n\nI find that us ENTPs have a hard time estimating the level of intimacy between people. We also rarely long for anyone. Can't speak for everyone but for me, I've never missed anyone aside from my significant others. Individual people are less frequent in my thinking process in general, unless they're the SO. Maybe that's why it is hard to keep up with contacting people. I just don't focus on individual people in general. People come up when I'm linking them to something, my theories or activities or ideas I want to establish, or when I see something inspiring and I figure someone could benefit from this. Does anyone experience this?\n\nI've tried to develop habits and reminders to call people and ask people out maybe at least twice a month. I get other forms of socializing, but for the long term friends this is my aim. With my spouse, the quality time comes automatically, thankfully. :)
1	Why is this not in the Social Skills part of Reddit?
1	Hey I do the same thing with BBQs. I moved to a different state a few years ago to be with my wife. I had trouble making friends because I worked most of the day and didn't like going out and spending a lot of money. \n\nI invited some of my co workers and my wife's co workers to come over and i would smoke some meat. Most people came once, but 2-3 come every few weeks or every month and we have a great time.
1	I find I play this role in my friend group as well—The One Who Gets Everyone Together (TM). :)\n\nGreat epiphany.
1	I’m still at the point in my life where this sounds like too much work and would rather nap but still crave friends.
15	How do you feel about having kids?	Do you have any? Would you want to have some? Why/why not? Also, please specify gender.\n\n\n\nENTP female here and I'm quite ambivalent about it. I don't think I want a kid, but then I see a young, intelligent, curious child and I'm like ; that could be interesting. You know, getting to see how this person will form through years. What ideas they're gonna have. \n\n\nThe thing is, I don't think it's good enough reason to have a child - cause it also takes a lot of work and basically takes freedom away. And even thinking about it makes my shudder. \n\n\nAlso, I think I'm lacking some kind of mother gene. Almost every female around me wants to have kids, or is cooing about how sweet and fluffy they are. And I'm confused expecially of this is really small kid, because what's so sweet about it? He can't even talk, what are you supposed to do with them?  \n\n\nAnd now the most funny thing - I'm expected to be the mom, and moms usually take more responsibilities tied to kids. But I'd be much more conformable taking the dad role in raising a kid. How am I supposed to find someone who would want to take on the typical mom role?
16	I always say I would have kids if I could be a cool dad. Unfortunately, I'm female in both mind and organs.
10	Entp female here. I feel ya, whenever I see babies or something I can GET why they're cute but it really doesn't set off anything hormonal in me. (But if they're bunnies, then I'll fuckin squeal) but babies...No....\n\nHOWEVER I do want to be the mother. But I wanna skip pass the supposed baby phases and jump right into the parts where they start developing personalities and formulating interesting thoughts. Like i really find the idea of being able to raise someone who looks like me, into a better version of me with all the things I know now. And of course they'll be their own person and have their own interests and all. \nThat's the part I look forward to.
8	My ENTP (m) SO is past 30, never wanted kids and most likely won’t ever change his mind. Good for me because I don’t want kids either. From what I’ve observed, he just doesn’t like kids. They poop, cry and scream and are the ultimate embodiment of settling down. The irony is that we would probably make good parents since we’re both educated free-thinkers with plenty of love to give.
7	I've sensed I'm probably one of the older people on this sub but I noticed that no one who commented so far has kids.  So I feel compelled to offer some insight.  How old are you, OP?  Because I think that comes into play for some people.  They want to focus on themselves and setting up their career, relationships, whatever, and they can't foresee being in a place where they would want to focus on kids.  Then they get there a little later in life, late 30s or so.  \n\n\nThen I have friends well into their 40s who just decided they didn't want children.  Period.  And I think that's great.  My parents generation, it was assumed that there was something deficient about you if you didn't have kids.  So a lot of people who weren't suited to parenthood had children they didn't really want and it was a lose/lose for both kids and parents.  \n\n\nI always knew I wanted kids.  I don't have an easy time forming close relationships with people and the idea of an immediate and unbreakable bond between mother and child was really appealing to me.  I felt confident in my ability to do a good job of it too.  My kids are currently 3 (preschool) and 6 (kindergarten).  It's a LOT.  Currently they're on a vacation from school so they're both home ALL WEEK and I'll tell you it's a struggle but I still wouldn't trade it for anything.    \n\n\nIt's a personal thing.  And I would say if you don't feel the pull to do it, then don't do it.  It's so so so ok to go against the grain of society.  I think we should challenge norms any chance we get as long as we feel we're being true to ourselves.
4	I want like two kids.
5	Not currently and not in the forseeable future, granted i'm 25 so there's a fair ways to go still.\n\nlike others have said children are a chore. I also absolutely can't stand the wailing, fuck you nature for making that the primary tool of communication of a young childs needs.\n\nBeyond that a kid is a bloody anchor. I wouldn't be able to just up and move to a cottage on the mongolians steppes if I felt like it, or go trecking through the amazonas for a month or a myriad of other things because there's the bloody kid in the picture. Having worked as a sub in primary school a child would start becoming genuinely interesting at the age of say 10-12, that's a decade of my life before we get to the payoff, and I don't even consider it that much of a prize!\n\nI reckon having kids is sacrificing your own life in favour of someone else's, and i'm nowhere near selfless enough to do that.
4	I'm over 30 never wanted children myself. I have no regrets about it so far, and I think that expiration date is soon. \n\nThere are more way to pass on your knowledge and interests, and having children is not a garuntee of that anyway.\n\nI teach classes, I often  work with children and teens, and I have friends and family with kids.\n\nThere is way more to being a women than having children. Don't let people make you feel like that has to be your end game. \n\nYou can also be a foster parent, there are so many young people who need a home for a while. No pregnancy, no babies, not an 18 years to life commitment.
3	Entp F here.  You pretty much summed my perspective completely and perfectly. Add the amount of randomness with how kids turn out and it just feels too much like a risk. What if you never get that interesting, intelligent, inquisitive little kid? I'm in my 3Os and still have no interest. Everyone told me to just wait, once I'm older the need will kick in. Nope, doing just fine. 
3	Cis female, 30s.  I think I've always felt like having kids comes at the expense of your own discovery.  Parenting has never looked the least bit interesting to me.  I've known this since I was a teenager, but no one's ever believed me.  I don't think they do even now.
3	Could have gone either way until I met my boyfriend, he would make an awesome dad so now I want to have his babies. Actually, scratch that, I don't actually want to HAVE his babies, I just want kids with him. Pregnancy and birth look like they will ruin my body. I like my virgin to childbirth body. Oh god he wants 2.
3	Gay man here. Not ready to adopt. Unless some medical technique appears and enables me to have a kid with my future SO, I won't have any.
3	I have one son now, I would like to have at least 2 more, I need to have a daughter at some point. I want to raise her to be a good logical thinker that isn't run by emotions, but also can enjoy being Daddy's Little girl. I have the best times with my son he's a lot like me, that makes me happy because he has the potential that I did but with a fully grown and well developed ENTP to help guide him to achieve better sooner.
3	36 female ENTP here. I don't want kids and I've known that since I was 18.\n\nI also don't get the appeal. Yeah, babies can be cute, but I don't have that maternal urge to make one. I can appreciate that something is cute without wanting the responsibility of that thing.\n\nPersonal reasons I don't want kids:\n\n* loss of independence - which includes lack of sleep, inability to go out or go where I want/when I want, inability to pursue whatever new opportunity presents itself because I have to be sure I bring home a steady paycheck, loss of spontaneity... hell, kids even make eating a certain way difficult if not impossible... less time for working out... the list GOES ON\n* compromised bodily autonomy and functionality throughout life (BIG one) - hate the idea of breast feeding, hate the idea that I might not even be able to laugh without pissing myself (happened to my mom... and though it's not guaranteed to happen to me, the only way to find out is to have a kid and then, oops, no turning back... risk vs reward favors NOT taking the risk)\n* vanity... or, you know, my RIGHT to WANT to look a certain way; the idea that I'm supposed to give up on the idea of looking good is repugnant to me... don't tell me I'm selfish or self-centered because I don't want to sacrifice my appearance... it's, unfortunately, what women's worth in society heavily depends on\n* not interested in ANYTHING relating to kids: PTA meetings, kids shows/music, toys around my living space, talking about kids\n* I am NOT cool with unsolicited advice, expectations, or commentary on how I choose to live... which would include society imposing its values on me through teachers, the kids' friends, other parents, grandparents...\n* always being tethered to the father should something between him and I go wrong... I want the ability to cut and run if necessary, and the fact I'd have to keep in contact with him "for the kids' sake" would be torture\n* kids are shitty and ungrateful until they're, like, 25\n* moms always end up with the lion's share of responsibility of child rearing\n* I want a career and I do think, if you choose to be a parent, you should BE THERE through their formative years... I won't half-ass parenthood if I did it (which I won't)\n* I don't want to be that emotionally invested in ANYTHING; I don't want to love something as much as people who have kids say they love them... that sounds terrifying and awful\n* they're HELLA expensive\n* probably more reasons\n\nOther reasons:\n\n* the planet is overpopulated\n* if I change my mind, I'll adopt because there are hundreds of thousands of already-existing kids who need a home and I don't need a little clone of myself to feel my life has meaning\n* the planet is dying and might be a really shitty place to live in a couple decades\n\nI'll stop there. If having kids makes others happy, more power to them. I don't understand the appeal, but I'm in the minority. All my friends have or want kids. To be fair, they have never wanted my bohemian, nomadic lifestyle. I've rebelled against societal expectations most of my life. I'm comfortable with being sort of on "the outside" at this point... we all want different things, but I don't feel remotely guilty or compelled to conform in this area.\n\nYou should follow r/childree if you're interested though; super validating for me.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Entp male here, I feel yah. I hate the sound of screaming kids, and I don't know if I could do it.  \n\nAnytime it is ever brought up by either family or past girlfriends I always say not until I'm 30, have a house, car paired off, married, and stable in life. (None of those are in particular order)
2	My ENTP fiancé is excited about having kids! He can’t wait to teach them how to swear, build killer robots, how to code in Python etc.\n\nJust the other day he downloaded a bunch of old Soviet math textbooks so they’ll be forced to learn math the way he was taught (minus the Communist Party propaganda bits of course 😂)\n\nI know he’ll be a great dad because he has so much child like enthusiasm for everything he obsesses over. I just hope they don’t follow in his footsteps and get suspended from school for lighting stuff on fire in class...
2	Entp F here! I've never liked kids much, even as a kid myself. Wasnt interested in baby dolls, barbies (besides dressing them and doing some interior decorating), or playing house. I do tend to like well behaved and inquisitive children. But they're a huge turnoff overall. Especially after dealing with them screaming in my workplace that requires immense concentration. Luckily my bf already has a daughter so I dont worry about him trying to breed me! You should check out the antinatalism thread. 
2	You must have children. No other type is open minded and has the social skills of an ENTP. You should be running the world, so have a bunch of kids and raise them to run it right.
2	If you've never procreated, you've basically failed at being a successful human being in terms of basic biological functions, so, yup. You know, usually telling someone not to breed is an insult, wouldn't wear it as a badge of honor that you don't want kids. My ENTP pal who's 70 severely regrets her life choices when it comes to this subject.
2	In you want a kid for any reason that's a variation of children are cute then I think you don't deserve a womb. On the other hand if you've thought about it carefully and feel like you can provide a good life and great space for a SEPARATE human being. To grow and thrive under your guidance perhaps then it might be a slightly less bad idea. A lot of people talk anit having kids and wanting kids because their friends have kids and or kids are cute or that's just what you do. \n\nI disagree with the idea because a lot of the time people want "clones" of themself. Sort of like a real life restart button. A lot of people don't treat their kids like separate humans which is bad I'm trying to think of reasons as to why and I'll get back to it later. \n\nIf you can't tell by now I'm anti having kids. Having kids Is something that I personally FEEL you shouldn't do lightly. 
2	No, they're obnoxious and make the whole divorce process even slower and more complicated.
1	I would rather cut off my balls, cook them, eat them, shit them out and eat them again before having kids.
1	Maybe if I was really rich and could give it a good life + could adopt the kid instead of having to make it myself then I'd consider. Though the time to do it would be now so it looks unlikely. 
1	I’m not interested, and I think by the time I am interested my SO will be past the age of childbearing. We’ve spoken about adoption though. 
1	>How am I supposed to find someone who would want to take on the typical mom role?\n\nFind an ISFJ. They love being traditional. Be prepared for arguments. A lot of arguments. Right, /u/utopic2?\n\nPersonally, I don't want kids. I can't think of a single reason why I should have kids, whereas I have many reasons to support my anti-natal position. 
1	I have children and they’re great except that they act like children, cost lots of money, and limit your options even more than marriage does (unless you have a lot of money already).  Over all though I’m happy with my choice and I expect I’ll get happier with it over time relative to my friends who decided not to have children or were incels or whatever.
1	Well, I don't really want kids at this point of my life. Maybe sometime in the future. I think kids are fun (way cooler than boring adults). The constant curiosity is refreshing and its quite exciting to see how a fresh brain processes information. My gender is classified. I must also add that I am not human.
1	ENTP female here, I totally understand you. I don't want children, maybe in the future, but not in the next 8-10 years (I'm 26). I had "feelings" about having child in my early twenties, but I adopted a dog and they disappeared. :D Giving birth just to bow to my instincts? Nooooo :) 
1	i totally agree, i hate children, the idea of the responsibilities and all of their needs. but at the same time i love teaching, and having a child would not only be the best experience in teaching, but in experience as well. i've thought of maybe adopting someone a bit older, but that would take a way the ability to mold them. so yeah \n\n(im a dude btw)\n\n(this is the most ENTP females i have ever seen in my life time)\n\n(i dont think i phrased the last part correctly, but however i change it, it still doesnt sound right)
1	I'm a female and have disliked the thought of mothering and having children my entire life. I can be extremely maternal too (like with animals), but the thought of having children depresses me instantly. It almost feels like a death sentence - like my life is over and I'm finished as an individual.\n\nI somewhat enjoy the thought of being able to teach and raise a kid mentally, but solely fixating on that is naive when there's so much more to it. I don't think I could handle that. I need to move and travel often to satiate my sanity and a kid would remove all impulsivity from my life.
1	I wouldnt have any kids no point in having someone born and then they just suffer.
1	Cis woman\n\nI want children, when I am financially and personally stable.\n\nMy SO isn't set on it, but we've discussed how we would/wouldn't parent. We both grew up in abusive homes (I'm affected more because my family still has its claws in me), but we are actively try to break these patterns in our relationship, and we talk about how we would raise our children, and bring them up in a better home than we had.\n\nA couple I knew adopted , due to health issues. I see how they love their son, and how he's changed their life, and it kinda sparked something in me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can always raise a child with friends. It's underrated, and children need a village .
1	Am I an ENFP or an ENTP ?	Hi guys, I'm new to the MBTI test, I just took it and I'm 51% Thinking and 48% Feeling. What does it mean ? 🤔
14	It means the test was inconclusive, which it basically always is.
12	It means look up cognitive functions 
5	The difference is going to be between your judging stack: Ti/Fe or Fi/Te. They are very different.\n\nBasic behavioral stereotypes:\nENTPs like to argue. A lot. About anything and everything.\nENTPs tend to believe in nothing consistent ethically.\nENTPs tend to find ways to abuse and/or improve the system.\nENTPs are better at reading a social situation and adapting accordingly.\n\nENFPs tend to be very moralistic, and make judgements based on those views.\nENFPs tend to believe in group consequentialism and individual deontology.\nENFPs tend to be drawn to "righteous" causes and seek change.\nENFPs are better at treating people well because they're people.\n\nAlso, chances are you are lying to yourself about some of your answers.
2	I hate when people say if ur asking that question, you're not an entp bc there are entps with depression and anxiety or who just happen to be women who tend to score high on feeling in these sorts of tests (bc of social pressure/upbringing)\n\n Anyway, that statement aside, u can usually tell with temperament. Check out functions ti vs fi tends to be the big tipper, but I've known a lot of te heavy enfps. They tend to be confrontational about morals and values whereas entps tend to question morals and values and have it come across as confrontation. Typically, an enfp will come out more flustered than entps. Entps tend to riff off of others values, but are still pretty individualistic bc emotional values just aren't a priority to them as opposed to logical values (eg. This is wrong bc it makes people feel bad vs this is wrong bc it makes no sense). From my experience, I've noticed enfps are more studious than entps. My brother is an enfp and he studied for hours on end in order to do well in school. I... Don't lmao. I just tend to try to use my logic to fake my way through things. Humor tends to be different too. Enfps are generally goofy or biting (bc of te). Entps tend to be more sarcastic.
1	http://prntscr.com/mr28cj\nFor the résults :
1	do you use Ti?\n\nthe single most differentiating thing that is easy to diagnose for yourself is Ti.\n\n\nIf you're iffy, you're an Fi user and that's not an insult. It's either Ti or Fi. I just happened to hit it right on the money with my word choices there; Ti.\n\n\nApart from Ne (duh) the most noticeable thing about an ENTP is their use of Ti.\n\n\nEDIT: it's not an insult
1	Like other people said, function stack. Do you think before or after?
1	I have a similar score, and all it means is that you have aspects of both. I am 53%E and 47%I as well. So really I am closer to an ANTP ( A is for ambivert) than anything.

6	Confused as sh*t	I've been browsing through google chrome for the past damn hours to figure out my personality type and I still got nothing, no information that are accurately correct. I've been digging up my grave since in school, doing research doing test/quizes and sh*t. Now I get a headache 2 AM in the morning. I am suprised my Mom didn't kill me yet. After searching up for hours, a website said that none is accurate including Myer-briggs, people get 4 letters based on what they want to be and not what they are. Unless you got tested by a perfessional. \n-\nI got results like: Entj, Entp, and Estj but first of all, I do like being sociable sometimes with other people. I can be humorous and loud, hype with in with people like me and like but I moved from Brooklyn to Pennsylvania months ago but I still haven't accept most of it. I just feel myself kinda change here. (ENTP) \nAnd, I do not pick decisions just because I have to.\n--\nSecond of all, Idk what is Estj\n--\nThird of all, I think I am a Entj (Edit: or ENTP ) and I keep getting different results. I want it to be sincere with the results. but I am the kind to be disorganized but I don't think that got anything to do with it. I personally is not as organized but likes to be organized type in between. I like to choose my decisions with facts and information to proceed. I don't get offended easily nor I am emotional but emotionless. I do not like inrelevent people proving me wrong dumb facts. (Actually made another instagram account to prove my friend that her fact is invalid and I dont care about how she feels about it, facts are facts)\nI usually don't like to be in charge or notice but naturally unconsciously I do order people sometimes or help people with work like do half half so he or she won't get tired or overdo herself with all the work. I have logical explanation to things, I like things my way. Sometimes I like to independent by myself, other times I like to be social with other people. I respect people but not ones who are wrong with facts and try to persuade people into believeing their nonsenseness. I only do things if I feel like to, I do not like to be forced or rushed. And honestly, I feel better and superior than other people, I do not know why but I always think I am better than dumbness around (Not trying to be rude lol) . Also, I have high level of confident  and couldn't care about what other people thinks. That's all. \nEdit: I am desperate that I am a Entj-a,,,, I legit searched up things like "How to know your a ENTJ or not" and other stuffs. I can kinda relate to it. \n*Edit #2: I don't know but I also somehow feel kinda connected to ENTP. It's just so confusing. Is it me or what I want to be?*\n*Edit #3 Finale: Yup, I'm a ENTJ.*
4	Learn about the cognitive functions, learn about all of the personalities, and find out what you are the long way if the tests don’t do it for ya 
3	> I am suprised my Mom didn't kill me yet. \n\nLOL\n\n&#x200B;
2	 Get excited and deep dive (you're at that point), Establish a baseline, collect data, get bored by it and move onto the next fun thing. That would be a true entp ;)\n\nThe Myers brings test has really good repeatability, yet humans do not. We can change with the seasons, situations, or even the time of day. But out of most test the Myers brings has the most weight behind it, as far as truth.\n If you get different results you may be on the border, as each letter is like a scale and there is a tipping point (a numerical value) and you could have been in a certain mind set. \n\nIf you really want to know who or what you are, just pay for the test to be done.\n\n But if you are poor and dont wa ant to do that; when it all comes down to it, you are you. Not one person other than your self knows you in such an intimate way. These tests are gauges and ways to measure yourself against current data sets. Doing multiple tests won't  gain you insight into your psyche, maybe do the same test at different times, emotions, and stages. 
1	Your grammar is fucking horrendous
1	I think 16Personalities got it right	Here's why: they've actually thought about how/why MBTI results are lacking in reliability and validity and instead base their results on the Big 5 (calling them sensing/intuiting, feeling/thinking, etc. instead) which *does* have test-retest validity and the traits are stable over a person's life. \n\nAlso: the functions, as described by Jung, don't actually exist and we don't have an epistemological way to prove that they do.\n\nFight me.\n\nLinks:\n\nhttps://www.16personalities.com/articles/our-theory\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Types\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits\n
7	The test retake validity really has to do with the nature of the test, not the nature of the theories.  \n\nMBTI prescribes dichotomies because there are 16 types, so all the tests are trying to find the difference between N vs S, T vs F, etc.\n\nIf you answer the questions in a 50:50 ratio, then the discrimination is unstable.   One question to the right or left puts you into a different category.  If someone answered roughly 50:50 in all the questions, just one or two questions difference could push them into **any** type whatsoever.  \n\n50:50 on those tests means inconclusive.  \n\nBut Big5 doesn’t measure dichotomies, it measures the degree with which you exhibit the 5 factors.   There is no dichotomy “opposite” of Openness.  There is only a number on a scale.  \n\nThis makes **the test** far more stable.   If someone answers 51, 45, 56% Open on various occasions, it doesn’t effect the outcome of their type, because Big5 doesn’t measure types.   It just reports numbers.   So people’s results will form a distribution over time and the mean of that distribution can then be said to be their factors. \n\nBig5 draws the “boxes” **after** they have the results from the test, using statistics to find significant correlations.  But this means that any one Big5 test is pretty much *useless* to an individual. The results have to be understood within the pool of test takers.   For instance, if they find that high Neuroticism correlates with high Openness in a population of prisoners, then it doesn’t imply **jack shit**  about that correlation in the general public, which might have different degrees of correlation, if they have it at all. \n\nThis isn’t a problem for psychologists, since psychologists write papers about particular traits in particular groups, and Big5 is a useful tool for these types of studies because it doesn’t prescribe categorical types.  It simply lets the “types” fall out of the data statistically.\n\nSo, one way you could go about this is to look for 16 statistical clusters in Big5 data that correlate to the 16 types.  Then you could use the mathematically stable Big5 test to predict the MB type.   But as far as I’m aware, this hasn’t been done.  Clusters in the Big5 data don’t pan out as distinctive types along MB lines (there was a paper last year that found 4 “types”).\n\nOne reason for this is likely that the Big5 factors are multifactorial compared to MBTI.   That is to say that a trait like Openness actually comprises bits and pieces of Ne, Se, Te and Fe.   T and F in particular are “smeared” over all the Big5 traits.  So a MB type may not form very distinct distributions under Big5.  That is some ENTPs may score high in one category while others score low — so while they are all ENTPs, Big5 is measuring a difference which blurs that distinction.  \n\nOf course if there was a data set which contained accurate Big5 and MBTI results, it wouldn’t be a problem to find even a complex correlation.  But if we could get accurate MBTI self-test data, then none of this would be an issue in the first place.  \n\n
3	Traits, not types.  Not going to fight.  16p got me right, several times, but I just had had so much function theory kool aid that I completely dismissed it (plus I was the victim of a massive mistype, and that kind of shit can and will skew a person's whole take on a theory).
2	Can't even fight you, lol. People on here talk so much shit about 16p, but it works for me.
2	This is pretty neat actually.
2	Their reliability and validity results (https://www.16personalities.com/articles/reliability-and-validity) do look good, but the fact that there is currently no reliable/valid test based on Jung’s work, doesn’t mean that there can’t be one. The only functions test that I know of is by keys2cognition, and it may just be that they didn’t set up their questions in a way that would have a high Cronbach’s alpha or reliability coefficient.\n\nIt may also be the case that the first few drafts of the 16p test did not have such nice results, and they had to refine it in several iterations to produce what we currently see. But yeah, as it stands, it does look good.\n\nThe thing about Jung is that he has this thing called the ‘unconscious functions’. I’m not sure if he uses the word ‘unconscious’ in the way that we do presently. But if some functions are unconscious, then we can’t expect a self-report to capture them accurately. And if an accurate self-report is not possible in theory, then how much value should we even place in self-reports?
1	Personally, I like 16Personalities.  I like the way the questions are worded and that you can answer on a spectrum instead of 1-5 or yes/no.\*  I like that the descriptions are accessible and not too jargony, which makes it easier for me to share the basic ideas with my friends.  And I like the "strenghs and weaknesses" section of each result for a boiled-down description.  It comes in handy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n^(\*I just looked and they don't have the answer as a scrolling scale anymore but a 1-7 number scale now.)     
1	I bet my ass that you never read any book written by Jung. Just because things "seems to be right" doesn't make them right. Do a proper research then I will fight you.
49	Fe is an average of many Fi's	There are a few assumptions that will go into this post. Firstly, the introverted functions are distillations of the extroverted functions. The extroverted functions are the "as is", "existent" functions. For the purposes of this post, I'll only speak about judging functions. The extroverted functions are statistical averagings of events. For example, Te is the laws of the Universe and Fe is the rules of society.\n\nNeglecting the fact that people exist, the universe exists and has laws in place. If you drop a rock on Earth, it falls. Always. It doesn't spontaneously rise up into the atmosphere being dropped. This creates the Te-law of gravity. It exists, whether it's modeled or not. In this way, Te is the most objective of all functions.\n\nNext, enter humans. Humans have an existent consciousness, and an air of subjectivity. Humans notice the rock falls each time you drop it, and attempts to explain *why* this occurs. The human has to, for himself, understand and explain this phenomenon, despite the Te-rule already existing. So Ti arises and invents Newton's Law of Gravity. It distills this rule of attraction into a gravitational force equation: F = G m M / r^(2). \n\nBut this distillation comes at a price. Because gravity is being *modeled* so that the human can understand it, the model inherently has flaws. It doesn't describe, for instance, the precession of Mercury's orbit (despite the fact this precession undoubtedly exists via Te-law). So Ti updates the model to include General Relativity, which explains why the rock falls and why Mercury's orbit precesses. But then this also has bugs insofar that black holes aren't explained.\n\nIn other words, Ti attempted to recapitulate Te via modeling, and Te recapitulates Ti by following Ti's model (this is just another way to say Ti is a distilled version of Te). Ti is buggy, but can make predictions (it has to, that's how it recovers Te). Whereas Te gets distilled down to Ti's model.\n\n****\n\nNext let's move on to Feeling. In analogy to where Te is the statistical rules for the universe, Fe is the statistical rules to society. But notice something: Te's fundamental laws of the universe are manifestly existent, via tautology that the Universe exists. But humanity and society is more complex, these societal rules come from somewhere. \n\nBecause Ti and Te must achieve each other (Te distills to Ti, and Ti recovers Fe), a similar logic ought to hold for Feeling. Fe must distill to Fi, and Fi must recover Fe. Fe can be identified as the ethical rules of society. Which means Fi is distilled ethical rules. \n\nBut Feeling has subjective human flavors to it (unlike a rock always falling, murder is not always bad), which means this distillation process doesn't yield unique introverted manifestations (in contrast to Te, whereby Ti distillations must agree with each other). In other words, Fi user A isn't guaranteed to have the same distillation of Fe as Fi user B. Furthermore, Fe region X isn't guaranteed to be identical to Fe region Y (put another way: Saudi Arabia has very different ethical rules than does France).\n\nWhat this means is the ethical landscape (Fe) itself is fuzzy, and I propose this fuzziness arises from the subjectivity of Fi. Take a sample of 1,000 prehistoric Fi-users, each with some fundamental distillation of biological, ethical imperatives. Fi-A is colored red; Fi-B is colored blue; Fi-C is colored green, and so on. They all have unique distillations of Fe. The reason why is because the Fe landscape looks something [like this](https://ih0.redbubble.net/image.170680081.2482/mp,550x550,matte,ffffff,t.3u3.jpg). If you zoom in (distill) at random locations (getting Fi), you'll get many different instances of it.\n\nIn contrast, take all these Fi patterns, and exert a statistical *averaging* of them, and you get Fe. I.e. because there are thousands/millions of Fi users each with individually colored ethical distillations, Fe has a complicated landscape by averaging them together.\n\nIn contrast, objects have a well defined structure to them physically. The Te landscape may look something [like this](http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emat6680/parsons/mvp6690/essay1/Images/image34.gif). If you take a distilled, zoomed in version, you see... [this](http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emat6680/parsons/mvp6690/essay1/Images/image35.gif). \n\nThis is why thinkers (even the subjective TPs) must agree with each other. a rock falls, always. But your model for why it falls must predict why it falls (Newton), much like my model for why it falls must predict why it falls (Einstein). Where we disagree (precession of Mercury's orbit), one of us is *wrong*.\n\nBut with the Fe ethical landscape, you may have a distillation mostly colored green. I may have a distillation mostly colored red. However, we're both right. Because maybe we simply distilled different areas of the Pollock Painting of Fe.\n\nWhile Ti attempted to distill *universal rules* into a model, Fi attempts to distill *complicated ethical rules* into a model. Ti types must agree, and Fi types aren't guaranteed to agree (and rarely do). It's only when you take the average of the Fi's, and compactify it into Fe, do you get a modicum of consistency (even if that Fe-consistency is complicated as fuck).
15	I think I get it.  Play Zelda and Pollack paintings make sense.\n\n#Cultured
9	This is really interesting to think about and pretty much what Jung wrote about in terms of the extraverted and introverted functions. \n\nExtraverted functions are based on what is there, or objective conditions. While introvert functions are based on the internal conclusions of the individual, or subjective conditions. \n\nAnd here I don’t mean “objective” as in what is right. I just mean what is existing and universal. \n\nNeither objectivity nor subjectivity is superior over the other.\n\nIt’s so fascinating to me that mbti can reduce E and I into such commonplace and watered down interpretations when the original Jung writings on the functions were so complex. 
8	Now this is the content I subscribed for. 
7	There are some parts of your analogy that I don't get:\n\n* The Te you describe is objective and ideal, but that means it doesn't exist in humans? I mean if you're not referring to functions as they can be found in actual people, then in some sense the whole analogy is meaningless; you're just describing objective truth vs our attempts to model it and sticking Te and Ti labels on it for fun.\n* If you average a lot of colors, you get a single color. If Fe is a statistical average of Fi patterns, then Fe is ultimately as individual and "distilled" as any of its component Fi's. Personally I would think Fe is the landscape itself, and you can still see multiple Fi's within it, so it is a collection and *not* an average.
6	Yh I don't really buy this Ti is distilled Te, Fi is distilled Fe. For a start, it's not clear what the relationship between Ti and Te has to do with a distillation process. Likewise for Fi and Fe.\n\nTo me it looks like you're saying: "I think x, y, z describes the relationship between Ti and Te, and it's distilling!" followed by "look it's distilling because it's distilling". I don't see any distilling going on personally. \n\nIf we are to generalise the relationship between extroverted and introverted judging functions, I would say that extroverted anchors to external, introverted to internal. But that doesn't mean much until we actually start talking about T and F specifically. \n\nFor me T has to do with how information is arranged in the mind.\n\nTe reconciles data with observable external reality, and Ti reconciles data with other data stored internally. I think Te results in highly directional, tree like structure of association, since it cares about "what things are". Te data is fast access, but slower to change. Ti results in a less directional web of data, which is slower to access, but adding and changing data is easier. Ti cares more about "what things are made of". \n\nI think F is to do with where values come from. \n\nFi gets its values from within, and hence is always paired with Te, since Te has strong roots in the structuring of information. Just follow the tree of information to the root to find the Fi principles of Te. On the other hand Fe is a consequence of the poor directionality and structure of information in the Ti mind. It leads to being able to see things from different perspectives as there is no strong root in the structure of information in the mind. 
3	> But humanity and society is more complex, these societal rules come from somewhere.\n\nI think this is an interesting point. We've always known that we are subjective by nature, but in the context of Je/Ji you can point out *where* exactly that subjectivity is coming from (in general, of course not all T-doms are going to agree upon everything). \n\nSo, the thinking functions aim for consistency (even if it is via subjective reasoning) in the object-oriented world, but that same methodology fails when it comes to societal rules/norms.\n\n> This creates the Te-law of gravity. It exists, whether it's modelled or not. In this way, Te is the most objective of all functions.\n\nIf the logical thread is, *observation* > **law** > *modelling of law* > *predict observation*, then Te (observation) was always present. But, what about Fe? Were Fe values always present? And, if not, what is the origin of the very first "Fe" set of values, and why?\n\n
2	I love the analogy. Would something like superstring theory be Ti? Or is that too broad for Ti?
2	I love this.
2	DAMN DUDE, NOW I CAN WALK ON THE ROOF.
4	TL;DR?\n\nThis sounds like a lot of bullshit?  Do you have a source for this, or are you just making it all up?
1	By your logic, Te is the average of many Ti. Which is true and well know Jung described this. \n\nYou also use Jung's meaning of objective and subjective wrong. Jung's objective = average of what is seen. Exactly what you said in the post.
1	this is insanely interesting, thank you for applying your Ti to this concept.
1	I might be wrong, but it seems like this interpretation favors moral subjectivism. If Fe is a local "statistical average" of Fi patterns, then it could be any number of conclusions. But it's pretty obvious that popular opinion isn't always the correct thought -- even the average of popular opinions (flat Earth was the dominant theory for awhile). I mean not only are we dealing with averages over geography, but averages over time as well. \n\nCan you elaborate on the implications of this framework in regards to moral subjectivism vs objectivism?
1	Most important point is Fe global consistency requires the use of Ti, and Te direct approach is kept focused by a singular Fi will that goes directly for the current Fi instinct. Fi and Ti exist on the same spectrum as Fe and Te respectively. One could say that Fi and Ti have a narrower focus, but that’s an inaccurate statement that only assesses concrete observations of Fi and Ti in action. The difference between Fi and Fe and Ti and Te lies in how easily, quickly, and deeply the brain accesses memories for T and F, in relation to how much reward/punishment it feels in the process. Ti and Fi access memories deeper than they do fast due to high reward/punishment/reaction for delving deep, so processing all memories takes longer and results in Fi and Ti processing. This leads to outward immediate behavior that seems subjective and is only partially in tune with social/physical environment. Fi and Ti are too slow to be applied appropriately at any given time in any given situation with proper training. Given enough time, Ti and Fi processing can boil down to fully appropriate behavior. Fe and Te access memories faster than they do deep due to low reward/punishment/reaction to accessing those memories, and so this leads to outward behavior based on what is most immediately objective, or on whatever memory is accessed first. Fe and Te behavior is thus very quick to judge and react on what is objectively perceived.\n\nFe and Te are fast and shallow.\n\nFi and Ti are slow and deep.\n\nAll are used to judge what is perceived because all four functions lie on the same two judging T and F spectrums.
1	I took this to mean that society (or the individual) summates somewhat arbitrary but homogenous ethical positions to create rules of society. Which is probably true. I think TP types work within and manipulate the existing laws of society towards their own ends.
1	A simple average or weighted average? (The Fi of many people or the Fi of the few?) Was thinking of the inordinate amount of influence that institutions such as the church, a monarchy or a dictatorship may have on what is considered socially acceptable/the social norm. (We can add celebrities to that list too.) \n\nWhat happens in a society of 60% Fe-doms and 40% Fi-doms? 
6	Has your mbti ever changed?	I used to consistently get ENTP as my mbti on online tests\n\nBut recently, I've scored ENFP on one test and another test said that my thinking is 6% over feeling\n\nI used to score 80% thinking and 20% feeling\n\nI think what's changed is that I am more impulsive these days based on my feelings, and I've gone through a bad time which required me to be receptive of the people close to me's feelings\n\nThough usually, emotional stuff for me is quite self-centred\n\nThis feels... yucky though. God, there it is! "THIS FEELS"\n\nI guess ENTP and ENFP is very similar anyway. So the issue doesn't lie there, but in the fact that my actions and thoughts are nowadays all over the place *emotionally*
5	I really just don’t understand how thinking types mistype as feelers, ha. The questions that dictate whether or not you’re a feeler are always ones that I can’t imagine a thinker answering positively enough to the point that they would type as one. \n\nEvery thinker friend who I have had take the test always get a T type, while there’s about a 65% chance or so that a feeler friend will actually type as an F type. However this is just my experience I guess.
3	I typed originally as INTP when I was depressed but now that I’m not depressed I’ve only had ENTP
2	> I guess ENTP and ENFP is very similar anyway.\n\nNope! They're not! :) They actually have completely different function stacks. It's more likely that the test was wrong.
2	Fluctuates between INTP and ENTP usuallu
2	yes, and that’s one of mbti’s fallabilities. most tests are poorly written and your answers will change depending on what headspace you’re in. and the descriptors for types are usually v general. \n\nlearn about cognitive functions and how they stack tbh it’s. how you process information and make decisions is more in depth than the false duality of an e/i or f/t sliding scale. \n\nalso to answer your question, yes - between entp and intp but again, a lot of that depends on headspace and what/how the questions are asked. cognitive functions-wise i am v entp. 
1	Yes my has changed regularly though I default to ENTP. My constants are  NT with my E/I and J/P flip flopping. As a result, I have scored as an ENTP, intj, entj and intp. (In order of frequency). What I find interesting is that of all 16 types, they group them into 4's. To me this makes sense as each type I have had as a result has put me in a group referred to as "analysts" - I think, and according to the 16 personalities breakdown. \n\nI've read the descriptions of that group as a whole and find that more accurate than any one type. 
1	I lied on my first MTBI during my training program so that leadership would leave me alone haha.  
1	INTP/INTJ to ENTP
1	INTJ to consistently ENTP
1	There are some MBTI tests that categorizes empathy along side F, so maybe the test you just took is off.\n\nAs for the question in your thread's title, yep. When I was a kid until late into highschool, I'm pretty sure I was INFP. Grew up a little and developed into ENFP. Matured some more and did a lot of reflections when I graduated in college. Now i'm ENTP. 
1	When I was in the military I took the MBTI in a leadership seminar and it came out ENTJ.\n\n\nA couple of years after getting out, I took it again for work - again a leadership seminar - and it came back ENTP.\n\n\nHas this happened to anyone else? 
1	The tests suck. Type by cognitive functions instead.
1	I'm ENFP, my man is ENTP, the only thing we have in common is that we're both obnoxious. He takes his ideas on a totally different route than I do, and he externalizes it much more than me. But when we find something equally fascinating you probably couldn't tell the difference. If you have to question it I think you're probably an ENFP, just because real ENTP's don't have much doubts or concerns regarding their identity. 
1	I get mistyped as extroverted lots. \n\nI just drink a lot and it comes off as extroverted.
1	After traumatic experiences, but personality changes according to that and other forms of mental illness, are just that. In a less extreme hypothetical, If you're getting ENFP you're either understanding social norms more, trying real hard to fit in, or you actually are a feeler type.
1	Yup, I still don’t know whether or not I’m ESTP or ENTP 
0	Youre not welcome here anymore
16	Having an ENTP Professor/Supervisor	Hi, ENTP here! (This is my first post)\nStarting my PHD.. (natural Sciences)\nMy Professor is also an ENTP! (Yep! Purely smiling, lots of ideas, disorganised, 10k Projects, 4 Letter Emails. Very witty, sanguine.)\nAny Advice? Will this work out? \nCheers and thanks.\n
12	Yeah we’re made to be profs. If we can stay disciplined
8	Yeah,  find an ENTJ supervisor unless you want a 10 year PhD.  
2	Well, he probably won't help you stay organized. Haha. Is he your advisor? 
1	Take the nearest NTJ hostage and make them plan your projects 
1	Prof here. Diligence before creativity. \n\nMake sure you have done your homework and thought things through so your bases are covered. From there, share your thought process, ask how you can fix/improve things that bug/worry you. As long as you don't come off as an undergrad (diligence!), it'll be welcome and fruitful for both.
3	Is it possible to be an ENTP and have very good Si?	I would definitely consider myself an ENTP but I can't agree with Si being my inferior function. Because my memory is very sharp. I remember things in a lot of detail and I am really good at remembering stuff (like lyrics) and learning patterns (like playing the guitar). Does this work?
11	Si isn't memory for one thing.  The Ne-Si axis means you ignore (don't notice/get bored of) the routine and are attracted to the novel in a conceptual (N) space of ideas.  \n\nNe-Si means you're attracted to new ideas and new ways of thinking about things. \n\nAre you always trying to figure out new things on the guitar?  Like a better way to practice, a better way to think about scales, a better way to memorize positions?\n\nAre you more excited about discovering a new technique than in actually practicing and perfecting it?  \n\nThat's basically the Ne-Si axis. 
4	Memory associated with music is VERY DIFFERENT\n\n \-Introverted sensing is a perceiving (information-gathering) function. It focuses on the subjective, internal world of personal experience and compares and contrasts new experiences to past experiences and memories. Si-users tend to notice patterns repeating themselves and are quick to spot changes or inconsistencies in their environment. - \n\n[https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2017/10/30/10-signs-might-introverted-sensor/](https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2017/10/30/10-signs-might-introverted-sensor/)\n\nSi isn't about random fact recall. Random fact recall is pretty "objective"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSi is about mentally recreating past events and comparing them to the current, without great effort. 
9	>I can't agree with Si being my inferior function.\n\nThen you're not an ENTP, per definition.\n\n>Because my memory is very sharp.\n\nAlternatively, this isn't an accurate description of Si. 
6	> Because my memory is very sharp. I remember things in a lot of detail and I am really good at remembering stuff (like lyrics) and learning patterns (like playing the guitar). \n\nI don't think this is Si.
7	Belief in progress	Since progress seems to be a theme lately. These articles frame the discussion in a broader context.\n\n“Hype for the Best: Why does Steven Pinker insist that human life is on the up?” (https://newrepublic.com/article/147391/hype-best)\n\n>Belief in human progress has always depended on a kind of provisional faith. Philosophers of the Enlightenment imagined that it was possible to break the chains of oppression and bring about the emancipation of all people. After the Scientific Revolution, priestcraft and superstition lost credibility, and after American independence, the French Revolution established hopes that liberty and equality for all were on the way, putting an end to material penury and social hierarchy. Yet things went south in the rise of empire and the victory of reaction, the explosion of a dehumanizing brand of capitalism, and two world wars, capped by Auschwitz and Hiroshima. \[…\]  \n\n\n“Enlightenment and Progress, or why Steven Pinker is wrong” (https://www.theosthinktank.co.uk/comment/2018/02/20/enlightenment-and-progress-or-why-steven-pinker-is-wrong)\n\n>Somewhere in the depths of a psychology journal there is a scientifically–calibrated scale that charts people’s attitude to progress. It’s call the Gray–Pinker scale, and it ranges from one end, in which believing in any form of progress is seen as a sign of mental illness, to the other, in which not believing in progress is seen as a sign of mental illness. \[…\]\n\n&#x200B;
5	Telling that this post is sitting at four upvotes and zero comments while the stupid ENFJ thread is /top material. \n\nWithout having read Pinker's book (though I'm familiar with his overall views), I assume he's saying 'human life is on the up' because the general trend from the Reformation to today is one of increasing liberty and equality (political and social progress) and decreasing poverty (economic progress). \n\nJohn Gray, on the other hand, according to his Wikipedia article contents that \n\n>in opposition to this view, that history is not progressive, but cyclical.\n\nWhere Pinker sees history moving from A to B, where A is an unjust and unfree society (through the eyes of a Western Enlightenment thinker I assume), Gray offers a historical model that works similar to economic cycles. He's essentially saying that any notion of progress will be destroyed in the future and we're destined to return to the same unjust and unfree society we started from, but instead of muskets we now have nuclear bombs. \n\nI don't think those models are incompatible. On a macro-level, we're certainly seeing progress socially and economically in the way Pinker contents -- compare the 2010s to the 1540s in terms of civil rights and poverty rates. On a microlevel, every socially progressive agenda will  give birth to a regressive, reactionary counterpart that will challenge it. I think we're seeing it right now with the alt-right being essentially the reaction to globalist neoliberalism, which has been the dominant paradigm of the post-war West. \n\nFurthermore, most Western societies are a constant back and forth between progressive, conservative and regressive forces (the progressive and even revolutionary 1960s gave way to the conservative 1970s, etc). \nIn MBTI terms it's probably a constant battle between Fi challenging the status quo (that is movements wanting society to bend to them instead of them bending to society, to use Baron's terms), succeeding and Fe codifying the Fi rebellion into the new status quo until the next Fi movement forms. \n\nSo yeah, it's probably less straightforward than some Enlightenment philosophers want it to be, but that's understandable. I always considered the Enlightenment notion of progress as an ideal to strive for rather than a metaphysical fact. \n\n
2	roommate troubles with male INFP	hey friends, last time i posted here it had nice reception so i’m going to give it another try:\n\nrecently got a new roommate at the start of this semester after my old one moved into his GFs place. of course, first thing was figuring out his mbti type, and then trying to build the relationship from there, but here’s the thing:\n\nTHE GUY IS THE LAZIEST, LEAST MOTIVATED, LEAST INSPIRED PERSON EVER. \n\nthis isn’t to shit on him or INFPs - in fact, when i found out he wasn’t an -S-J, i was really happy - but i can’t get through to him. i tell him to start doing his dishes instead of leaving them out; he gets mad at me behind my back to his gf. i tell him to stop leaving the weed jar open; same thing. \n\ni like the guy, and i know he means well, but fuck me he is becoming cancer to live with and i really don’t want it to happen this way. i buy everything, organize everything, put everything away, do dishes, etc, and he just doesn’t. as a P, this is all too exhausting and it would be really nice if he could start to care about things. \n\ni am not fully in touch with how functions work, and i think that’s why i can’t get to him. we love to discuss, and even debate, but he gets so emotionally flustered and overwhelmed by me and i don’t know to stop. i tell him he needs to tell me when i go to far because i literally suck at understanding emotions, most of which are tucked very deep behind a concrete shell. instead, he fucks off and builds up tension when i want to talk it out and find a solution. if i try to bring anything up, he just doesn’t have it. \n\nwhy is he like this? why are INFPs so lazy and unmotivated? how do i make him care about anything besides his gf and eu4 (specifically - how to make him care about the house we live in). \n\ni wrote this all in one take and didn’t proof read anything - sorry in advance if i said some dumb shit :p\n\nedit: i’m 20m, he is 22m
3	Sounds more like.. \nA lazy pothead, Who does not get his shit together.\nFrustrating, i have also been there a couple of years ago. Doing someone elses dishes. Ugh. \nNo no no.\nTalk to him, about your frustration with him, and if it would be better to end this for good.\nOtherwise this passive aggressive style might go on forever, and this is not worth your time.\nAlso consult other friends on this.\nGood Luck.
2	>he is becoming cancer to live\n\nHow would you usually deal with cancer?
1	Sounds like my INFP brother. Good luck. He stopped talking to me. I tried to mend things; he shut me out.
23	What is your latest seasonal entp addiction?	Like, I was wondering if this happens to all of us. It's like this: I get bored a lot then I find something not boring. Then I binge and devote a lot of time into it, time I should not devote, and I end up in this vicious cycle of boredom and binging. So, I was wondering if this happens to just me or is this indicative of basic entp characteristics?\n\nAnyway my latest addiction is RIVER MONSTERS WITH JEREMY WADE. I've binged most seasons and I kind of love fishes viciously. 
10	I had a test today. Spent all of last night learning about ENTJs instead. The test was fun
8	All the time. "Boredom and Binging" would be the name of my autobiography... Right now it is trying to understand wtf is up with Christianity. I have read half the bible since Christmas, among other things.
8	In the past ninety days: Painting, then video games, then some lovely seasonal depression (yeehaw!), then the Good Place, then tattoos, a new friend I made, and now fitness. I have noticed that if I allow too much time to elapse between obsessions I slip into an insecure mindset and start being a listless, unmotivated bummer. I feel healthiest (read: not wanting to die from boredom) and most stimulated when my addictions last for roughly a two week period, allowing for 3-4 days at the beginning and end to transition from one obsession to the next. I do cycle through most of these and return at a later date though. \n\nSo yeah, don’t worry. It’s not just you. I always feel happiest when I’m binging but as a result forfeit other things. Like I keep forgetting to update my resume, or pay my insurance, or feed myself bc as soon as I get home from my crappy job I do ™️My Cool Thing That Helps Me Forget My Problems™️

3	I don't do breaks between hobbies. There's always 2-3 things I'm excited about at the same time, and new interests arise only to tell one of my ongoing interests to fuck the hell off and take its place.  \nTo sum up my month, there's been a return to music production before my first gig ever played live, then once I got a few new songs to soundcloud I dropped it, started digging up stuff on mbti again, then returned to Neverwinter Nights roleplay servers, going simultaneously with my Vainglory (moba game) grind mode and a quest to refresh my contacts with multiple people I felt like losing touch with as well as fucking up my dressing style yet again. Just recently, I am browsing more through synthwave music subgenres, finding new juicy songs to influence my music style. Shit, now I think about this, I may make some music tonight again.
3	A few months ago it was Myers Briggs typing lol. Now it’s movie reviews 
3	Embracing the cold/wintery mood, rewatching GoT in preps for the last season, replaying BotW, and learning new soup and stew recipes.  
2	Two months ago: My new D&D character for our new campaign (I wrote a whole background story for her, studied all of the spells of her class, etc.). Then I fell for a guy, so I was constantly daydreaming about our fantastic future, but in real life I found him boring, so I dropped the idea. Now I'm rewatching Friends and teaching a whole bunch of new tricks to my dog (and practicing the old ones I taught her once and never practiced again). Plus I quitted smoking so I'm crazy about living a healthy life (I know everything about metabolism, etc.), but I have a really hard time to actually do some exercise. Aaand I didn't read in the past two weeks, but I have a pretty long reading list, I feel that this will be the next.\n
2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFoBbNHvOME  \n\n\nThis basically. I can't stop!
2	In the last 2ish months I watched all of naruto. It's sad but the story was great. Before that I started making musical instrument for no reason.
2	Sopranos. WATCH IT
2	Finding a full time job and finding freelancing work
2	The past two months have been a blast. Hacking, SQL programming, and learning about the 2008 financial crisis + the corruption behind it. Crazy stuff, I’ve also been forcing myself to read more books which is challenging but we’re getting there :P
2	Learning HTML and CSS. Web development has always been something I've been interested in but decided to give it a real go when a free online college course popped up. When that was done I signed up for a more advanced one. I had already asked someone if they wanted me to build them a website when I started the more advanced course and realised I may be out of my league. 
2	Concatenative programming languages and fretless bass guitar are my current obsessions.
2	r/memeeconomy and street dance classes
2	Music, music, and more music! :D\n\nI've been listening to almost every genre, and I find it totally fascinating! As soon as I'm bored of one artist's discography/story, I move onto another!
2	hahahahah river monsters. I’ve been really into crosswords lately.. also Peppa Pig... does that count?
2	Ahaha yeah. Wasn’t even the first one honestly. My sister gave me a knock off Peppa Pig Gucci sweatshirt for Christmas 🐷💸
1	DnD.\n\nI play in 3 and run 1 campaign weekly.\n\nSend help.
26	Problems with ENFPs?	I feel like no one ever has any criticisms of ENFPs.
28	Pretentious and attention seeking. In my experience with two ENFPs they tend to want to click with you so badly that they start pretending to be like you, and sure they may succeed, but eventually they will break and realize they're really not up for it. I almost got with an ENFP once, but they soon noticed "undesirable" characteristics (too argumentative) of mine and decided to cut ties. Soon after, they found someone else. Concluded through this that they're really in need of company at most times...
7	I’ve dated 3. They are super fun during the honeymoon phase. Then you realize that’s how lovey they are all the time and it gets old quick. ENFP girls are definitely fun to be around, but the guys are annoying as fuck to me. They live their lives as a 12 year old would
6	They are INFPs on Coke...
11	I hate almost every ENFP I've met. They're attention seeking, self centered, fake, kiss ups, insincere, overemotional, illogical, and jump to conclusions before you can even finish a sentence.
4	Not following through on projects as strong as we start them\n\nIndecisive \n\nUnfocused\n\nsomethings I deal with / and have seen related to being this type generally. 
3	Feelings should always be a gauge on a dashboard that you make a logical decision considering, they shouldn't be the decider. I love Feelers but I'd never want to be one.\n\nAt least FJs have convictions that control their actions based on their feelings. FPs are just way too unpredictable to me. I'm spontaneous and wild but always with a calculated method to my madness. FPs are just mad.
3	Immature Enfp's don't know who we are. When you reference our reflective, chameleon nature; this is the negative side to that character trait. It means that we are excellent at fitting in, no matter what social group we find ourselves in. I've noticed that I will mimic peoples speech patterns and body language without any conscious thought or deliberation. This also means that contrary to popular opinion, we are one of the very best types when it comes to hiding our inner selves.\n\nI'm sure that some of the ENFP's you met were actually quite vapid and empty; but I'm equally sure that some of them only appeared that way because it was safer to them than to have to show you who they really were. \n\nImmature ENFPs don't understand why they feel things so intensely. We lie to ourselves, trying to force ourselves into the box that other people want to put us into. Let me expound on that slightly; take some of the criticism found here; the ENTPs here have made the arguments that we're too sensitive and overfeeling, and that we cut and run if we find out that we can't handle you.  An ENFP in that situation knows that you find us too emotional, that's our talent, to be able to read a room. An unhealthy ENFP knows that we're too emotional *for you*, so they try to shut down their emotions or they crank them up to 11. They do this to either make you happy or challenge you for trying to control them (yes, that is how being annoyed at us for feeling will make us feel.)  \n\nA healthy ENFP will assess their feelings, realize that they're offended and try to factor that into their actions. To pull another example, in this situation right now, much of what you guys said hit really close to home and raised my hackles. Any time something raises my hackles I know there must be some truth I don't like involved, so I reread the things you guys wrote several times to try to understand it from a thinkers perspective.\n\nRegarding the attention seeking: yes that's true. Point blank. We like to have attention... but to leave it there is to defy nuance. Needing to have all of the attention of the whole room on you is an unhealthy Extrovert thing, it's not exclusively an ENFP thing. I would argue that it is Less of an ENFP thing than some other extroverts, because desiring the entirety of a groups attention is not fair, it deprives others and it leads to conflict; all of which are things that are *typically* avoided by the ENFP.\n\nI'm beginning to lose my steam here, and I'm sure I'm not as coherent as I felt when I started out; but the tldr of this is just a reminder that myers briggs is a tool, not a god level divining rod, and sometimes people are just people. Not all enfp's are "attention seeking, self centered, fake, kiss ups, insincere, overemotional, illogical, and jump to conclusions before you can even finish a sentence" but all of us have the opportunity to develop those weaknesses.\n\nP.S. I absolutely loath ISFJs and INFJs because of things that have happened with partners who fit those types. It's led me to react with defensive aggression to J's in general, something I'm trying to work on, so I'm not standing on some high horse or anything, I get why people develop a distaste for different types of people. \n\nJust don't let that be it lords and ladies, look into your emotions (gah, who wants to deal with those, I know) and figure out which ones are causing you to hate. Then fix it.
3	One of my best friends is ENFP - but I have to admit, if we did not grew up together, we wouldn't be friends. I really really love teasing people but around ENFPs you have to walk on eggshells.\n\nI know an ENFP guy and sometimes I could punch him in the face. He's an attention seeking, whiny, spoiled brat. Loves to see himself as a "bad guy", but if you tease him a little bit, his whole world will collapse. \n\nMaybe I can be a jerk, but most of the time I am not. For the first time that guy was pretty funny, we had witty conversations, little flirty - but then I realized he has no depth and becomes offended so easily... I can find the optimal amount of teasing fun with every other type (even INFPs and INFJs), but ENFPs are too sensitive for me, although I work pretty hard on my Fe.
3	That's untrue. We get criticized all the time. 
10	It’s because they’re not worth talking about, even to complain.
2	They'll agree with you until the sun dies out or you hurt their fee fees.
2	Probably because they're the closest thing to what dogs would be if they were people?\n\nJokes aside, I find them to be very emotionally draining if they are poorly developed or immature, because they seem to mistake that NeFi combo for empathy and project like crazy onto you.  Then they'll get offended if you don't respond positively to it.
2	I think the stereotype of ENFPs being bubbly leads to every second bubbly person being mistyped as an ENFP and that is dumb. Their picture is made up of the few (mostly female) ENFPs that live up to those stereotypes, or by ESFPs, ESFJs, or whatever.
2	Best friend for +20 years was ENFP. Took the habit of venting hysterically to me about relationship issue version 02.18.02 unpatched. I was pretty introverted back then, I never got to do the talk. I got angry once and said with all my tactfulness "please stop telling me about the same problem over and over, I can't stand hearing testimonials of your own stupidity, hurting yourself and not taking up any of my advices. It's hurting me too so I'm done listening to your bullshit."\n\nWhat a slap! 5 years later I still got scolded for saying that. I apologized many times but to no avail. I felt like walking on fucking eggshells everytime we were in the same room. Unbarable,  we ended up losing contact.\n\nBest friends until NF's pride get hurt and NT's observations get depreciated. Fi/Ti conflict
3	Its the post ive waited for so long.\n\nYou know, all the ENTPs here say ENFPs are great \nBut\n\nThey are attention seeking. They dont have their own opinions, like, they are too easily influenced, they always do what the majority does. You know, they don't think deeply. They act like theyre so empathetic omg but all they care about is themselves. \n\nYou know, I have this enfp friend, and all he does is talking about himself. Talking to him feels like I'm playing a dating sim because I exactly know what he wants me to say and how he will react it. \n\nSo selfish they are. I dont even know why entps like them.\n\n
2	Nah mang.
2	Fi. 
2	emotions are gross. I really cannot stand them. When you get emotional, you become vulnerable and it's real easy for people to exploit that. Why do you give people that power over you?
1	Pretty good friends with one, but I seem to make others angry. 
1	As an ENFP, caring too much what others think, impulsive, and unfocused 
1	I don't disagree with the consensus, but here's an example of some solid [ENFP/ENTP interaction](https://youtu.be/RRn1f4q__oQ). 
1	Well they’re even more confused ENTPs which is enough already lol.
1	I am enfp. The thing I hate about myself is that get bored really easily, it really affects my relationships and sticking to things I want to achieve. It sucks, but no personality type is perfect. I am aware of flaws and how frustrating I can sometimes be! 
0	Very anecdotal but I fell in love with my roommate who's ENFP about two years ago. she reciprocates, then goes away for just under a year, comes back and she's all past it while I'm not. Things get awkward and I move out, I get a text after I've gotten my stuff saying "Hey why'd you take back the guitar you gave me to practice on?"\n\nLovely to hear you care more about the guitar that was specifically given to bring us closer together through playing rather than our deteriorating relation and the past years we spent together. \n\nConclusion: So long as you give them the emotional state that they crave they're golden, once you don't you end up in the discarded pile, and people say we're cold.
9	Parenting an ENTP	ENTJ here... What do you wish your parents understood about ENTPs as you came through your teen years? \n\nI am really trying to curb my need to plan/control so I'm not stifling him, but I do want to set realistic boundaries and help him pave a path he can find joy and success in. I know he's too young to actually have a path yet, but I hope I can at least help him develop traits that will serve him well on any path. \n\n(Our household is Mom - ENTJ, Dad - INTJ, older brother - INTP, and he's the youngest, if that helps anyone or raises flags I might want to think about)
18	[deleted]
8	1.Never use the "Because I said so!"argument , talk it out make them see your point of view  - comunication should always be a two way street .\n\n2.Guide them towards doing the thing that they consistently like(they might have many passions come and go but there will be 1 or 2 that they wont give up on - probably).
8	My parents were unbelievably hands off so it fit well with my personality.\n\n\nBasically raised myself and did a TON for the other three people in the house. 
6	My dad is an ENTJ. I'm an ENTP. For years, he wanted me to follow his prescribed path. It nearly killed me. Our relationship suffered to a point where he kicked me out of the house (15 years later, we're super close!). \n\nLet your ENTP explore his interests. Don't stifle the creativity, don't quell the sense of humour. Let him be social. \n\nAs an ENTP, I was a sassy kid, always replying with what I thought were clever comebacks. This is part of our nature and we often can't restrain our need to verbally spar. \n\nUse logic. Never use the 'because I said so' reply. That won't jive and will cause a loss of respect. \n\nFinally: have fun with him! ENTPs are great!
5	Give him lots of challenges and goals, aside from normal parenting which applies to all children regardless of type.\n\nIt's also a good way of interacting with us in general. Give us the problem and tell us the parameters, then let us figure it out, instead of dictating what to do step by step. This way, you encourage him to develop his mental dexterity and resourcefulness (what is an ENTP without these things, after all?)\n\nAlso, a bit biased here because I love music and musical instruments, but I would suggest introducing him to some sort of musical instrument (not sure exactly how old he is. In any case, keep it in mind for when he gets to elementary or around that age).\n\nOverall, your ability to judge things well is your friend here (i.e. common sense). Remember, just because he's an ENTP doesn't mean he doesn't share the needs of any child— sensible parenting.\n\nI wish you the best. 
3	Help it to set routines and discipline. Emphasize growth mindset. Never lie, “I don’t know let’s find out” is far better than bs. If it expresses interest in anything, expresses a dream or a goal or a passion, do not knock it down. Don’t tell them they should focus on other things like school or whatever. School is BS! Especially before post secondary. School is for learning social skills, basic math, and writing, beyond that it really doesn’t matter. You want them to believe in their ideas and know that they can make them happen, that all they need is discipline and good social skills to make their visions real. \n\n
3	Moms tend to worry too much... but I understand your desire to help him find his path. \n\nHonestly, being yourself is probably your best course of action. Tell him the truth (with love) and then support his decisions (unless they’re illegal!). Set your rules and boundaries & don’t feel guilty about sticking to them. Despite outward appearances, teens still need parents to be the parent. Keep the lines of communication open, and just wait it out.\n\nAlso, LISTEN. Many times an ENTP will come up with a crazy idea, and once it’s out of their brain, the excitement tends to fizzle. (Maybe not right away, but once all the pieces are out, they can manipulate them better and find flaws.) \n\nResist the urge to make life plans for him or tell him why his ideas are stupid. Instead ask questions - we are pretty good at being logical and will tear our own ideas apart if you let us. But if you tell us what to do... we will resist, even when we know you’re right! (I suspect we aren’t the only ones.)\n\nYou SHOULD offer ideas and advice, and let us know you support us and believe in us. This will help with open communication. Just make sure it comes across as an option, not a requirement. \n\nMy parents were supportive and available to discuss ideas, and they told me the truth. Sometimes it wasn’t what I wanted to hear, and I didn’t always follow their advice, but I respected them for it. \n\nIndirectly, you can encourage them to have good relationships with other wise adults; sometimes hearing the same advice from someone who isn’t mom and dad sinks in better. \n\nLooking back, I wish I had more self discipline and finished my education earlier, but I had to figure these things out on my own. My parents tried, but... ENTPness. \n\nThis post shows you’re aware of your different approaches to life and trying to be the best parent you can. You sound like a great mom. Best of luck surviving the teen years with an ENTP! And don’t worry too much. We generally turn out ok in the end. :)\n\nEdit: spelling. Also, sorry it’s so long, blame it on my personality. 
3	Well what ENTPs tend to do is explore a wide variety of different things until they find things that really hold their attention. So, in my opinion, complete and unabashed freedom is probably what's best for an ENTP. It wouldn't hurt to make sure they can identify dangerous objects by showing them how dangerous they are (only telling them will make them want to mess with it more). Maybe when he's a little older, ask him "everyone is going to die one day. Imagine your death, what do you want to do before you die?" That should jolt him enough to strive to find success and joy.
2	Don’t be afraid to let them get hurt and fail at something miserably when they think they’re right. Although this is going to be a nightmare for a parent, sometimes it is the only way that we will learn. Give them the right core values and they will come good in the end. 
2	We understand things in pictures, if we can visualize we understand immediately. And at least I was really bad at homework. Also love the advice my INTJ dad gave me when I was older which was, “you don’t have to wanna, but you’re gonna.”
2	My folks wouldn't know MBTI if Jung came over for dinner, but they did ok by me. Loads of enrichment opportunities, which requires the luxuries of time and (moreso these days) money. \n\nThey figured out early on that, "Because I said so," wasn't gonna work, and explained why. So much less conflict that way. \n\nI wasn't forbidden computer games etc., but it was discouraged in favor of always being up to take me to the library, movies, plays, etc. I think they spotted early on that when allowed isolated activity, I'd get too hermit-y. But they also let me have my own headspace.\n\nReally encouraged and facilitated sports, even though I sucked at most of them. Physical activity and stimuli (or teamwork :) aren't a priority for ENTPs so that kind of forced an exercise habit on me early on, thank goodness. \n\nAnd sleeeeep. They could have been better at letting me sleep. I think ENTPs need it more than other types because it compensates for our poor ability to gauge our physical wellbeing and tendency to burn the candle at both ends. It also lets our brains collate all the fantastic connections we made that day. \n\nIn the end, that you care and are interested in nurturing your kid this way is pretty awesome. 
2	Listen to them. \n\nNever say "because I said so." They will instantly hate you.\n\nThese people need reasons. Rules must have reason. \n\nKeep logic in your parenting decisions and you should be fine.
2	Be there for your kid but beware of smothering. When they do that thing where they say something or start a conversation just to be confrontational learn to recognize it. I used to do this to my mother whenever she was cooking. Appreciate an intuitive nature and don’t tell them that there’s something wrong with them. Punish them yes but avoid alienation, my parents and peers did this it took a lot of years to fix.
5	The only flag I see is that’s it statistically unlikely you have 4 NTs in the same family, roughly 0.01% by random chance. 
2	Never try to control him, we are rebels at heart and question every decision and order that doesn't make sense to us. Over time, controlling behavior accumulates into resentment that isn't healthy to either of you or your relationship with him.\n\nOffer non-demanding, yet poking emotional support, we build a wall around our unconscious emotional life pretty easily, but open up once we get to talk these things out, reflecting them. Point out his emotional states or guess them out, he might not realize them himself.\n\nThis is The most important part IMO. Let him find his own path. Suggest, ideate and converse, don't enforce, this might even deter from something he is actually interested in. Let them come up with their own ideas and reason their decisions themselves. Never try to manipulate them to thinking something is good for them if they don't think it themselves. Ask questions, suggest, support their decisions. Personally, I've gone through so many phases of reinvention that I've lost count. If he is contemplating his future for a couple of months even, sitting on his ass, it doesn't necessarily mean he has given up on life. Just open up conversation in their terms. If you probe intrusively/aggressively or shut down their ideas, they shut down towards you. I know there is probably a lot of frustration going on with you if he seems line he is not going anywhere, but as I always say, trust the process. He will find his way eventually. Help him find his key interests so he can focus on something while continuing to explore the world. Don't expect them to focus on a single path for the rest of their lives. I have never seen this happen for an ENTP. I am an expert generalist (having several areas of expertise and a lot of knowledge from around them) myself. \n\nHelp them build healthy habits. Building habits can be really difficult for us and if we learn them at home, it builds into an easier life in the future. Cleaning the house, exercising, eating well, all the normal stuff.\n\nI am writing a book on ENTPs and if you want to discuss parenting an ENTP, I'm more than happy to help and at the same time receive substance for my book. Hope this helps. All the best in raising an ENTP. :)
1	if you want “because i said so” to work then it can’t be your default weapon. use it judiciously. 
1	My parents were incredibly strict, and honestly i think it only added to my ENTP-ness? One thing I REALLY always wished was that when I asked "why" they said no to something, that they'd actually explain to me exactly why. I had "because i said so" parents. Being dealt "because i said so"s, I'd make it my mission to find out why regardless of whether my parents would be upset or not. I got myself into a lot of secret trouble that way lol. My best advice would be to talk to him like he's an adult when he asks questions, give him space to make decisions, express the consequences of certain actions without forcing the idea of parental punishment as the consequence. I would've made much better decisions if my parents spoke to me in such a way lol. If your child trusts you to give logical explanations (if he really is an ENTP) he'll come to you instead of doing things behind your back (like i did with my parents lol.) I do think discipline is important, and I understand that it's hard to let children make decisions on their own, but if you establish a sense of trust with your ENTP child they'll likely take your advice if you prove logical reason for them to do so. \n\n\nedit: also, try not to emotionally react when disciplining your kid. my parents would get angry and try to scare me into submission. it didn't work and it only fucked me up emotionally in the long run lol. i think the most important thing here would just to establish good communication between the both of you. best of luck.
0	You know MBTI type can't be defined at those ages right?
3	Trying to figure out if I’m actually ENTP or if it’s just ADHD	
5	Having ADHD is an imbalance with the speed at with different psrts of your brain function. ENTP is a fundamental description of how we receive information, process said information, make decisions, and how we project.\n\nADHD has a tendency to amplify emotional responses but it does not inherently make someone's fundamental engine of sorts any different.\n\nTreatment for ADHD merely allows your mind to get out of the sort of drunken daze it is in to allow you to behave more normally.\n\nAs someone who is dyed-in-the-wool ADHD, being medicated does not change my personality away from being ENTP. The one side effect especially when younger and less mature, was the tendency to have a shorter fuse (getting irritable, frustrated, mad, etc.) but that is an emotion, not a fundamental component of a personality. 
3	Can you post a TLDR version?
2	>The N vs S is the hardest one. \n\nYeah, this should actually be the easiest one. I vote ESTP that thinks it's an ENTP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	I Recently posted in this sub asking how many ENTP were diagnosed with ADHD and quite a few of them are, actually almost all. Made me realize that medicating myself might not be much help for me to be happy or myself. That my ADHD was just apart of my personality and I am 100 percent an ENTP there is no doubt. \n\nOff topic kind of....A few months ago I thought it would be fun/entertaining to get a Human Design Chart Reading by a “professional” (another one of my ADHD/ENTP rabbit holes when I discovered this new age astrology and thought it would be cool to learn about)..... anyway this professional who studied with the man who originated this theory told me from my birth chart ....\n\n“You are designed to be this way, to feel stuck, and to move in bursts. You are a natural investigator and leader, people look to you for answers. You will always feel this way in life as that’s how you were designed to be. You will always have the frustrations you feel as it’s apart of you.” It was exactly accurate and now that I’m learning about how ENTP/ADHD overlap, and how much those overlap with my personality and birth charts. All coming full circle for me on my path to acceptance and awareness: \n\nTo answer your question : they most likely come hand in hand, but we have a specific kind of ADHD which fuels our ENTP tendencies. 
47	Encountering the terrifying power of an intelligent ENFJ	Hello again my community.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThroughout my college experience I've always felt like I was the one to see through others. Who they are, how they think, act, walk through the world, their potential and limitations, I reference people's ability to see the bigger picture. Be it understanding ones own bias, the flaws in our character and others, our self development, socializing with a specific intent in mind, wielding persona so as to be portrayed in the light we aim to be perceived in etc...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently I met this girl ENFJ and her ability to see through me, others, their potential and limitations is astounding and almost terrifying. It's intimidating to talk to someone who can say things about others and myself that completely opens up a new chapter of thought. I recently brought her to a pretty high profile party, with some business leaders and influential figures. I told her to dress nice, not be overly amazed about the house or the people in it and talk about some of her strengths like her knowledge on artists (The house had a million+dollars of art in it from around the world, many well known pieces) and also her business profile/outlook, connections potential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, what I'm kind of getting at is that she's able to see people on a new level that I have never touched. She wasn't overwhelmed by the new atmosphere she was thrown into, the age difference, the reputation people held, she kept her cool. And most importantly she was able to come off in a way to those at the party as an important player who could play the game. She made connections and laid a good foundation for herself at the next party which she was invited to. She was impressive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI cannot see into her like other people and she sees me.
88	All I see is a confident ENFJ woman and an ENTP in love.
25	They are fascinating people. I always find myself connecting with them. I flirt with them, independent of gender because it’s an enjoyable experience. They really help me develop my Ne-Fe combo. 
18	I married a confident ENFJ. My biggest challenge was letting her be my coach. She loves to and I'm headstrong... but it works. We just had our anniversary. :)
16	Really? I think most of the ENFJs I know as "fluffers" - people intended to keep your erection strong no matter who you are. They can be kind of obvious about the ego stroking and forging  "close" connections with you inappropriately soon, but I also don't mind it because it feels good. I assume most is shallow affectation since they do it immediately and they do it to everyone.\n\nHowever, I like them much better than ESFJs because they don't do the exclusionary thing when you don't fit their idea worthwhile or acceptable. Instead they spend the time finding out what makes you worthwhile so they can benefit from it later. ;) \n\nI get along really well with the ENFJs I know, but they're used car salesmen.
9	My guess is you're not out of college yet.
6	Why do we talk about personalities like like super powers? Honestly many posts I’ve seen sound like their coming from r/bossfightuniverse or something
4	I have talked to an ENFJ before but do not know any that are directly in my life which I am aware of. From what I understand about them, they're generally well put together and do have a decent sense of inspection into other people and motivations. \n\nIn my opinion ENTP are still vastly superior in breaking things down in a practical sense. We do much better with an autonomous sense of thinking (This thing happens because of X) rather than INFJ & ENFJ which inherently posses a much-much better sense of emotional intelligence which gives them a separate skill set should they choose to "investigate" like we do. \n\nxNFx will naturally make allies/friends/relationships with people easier than xNTP. This gives them a fundamental secondary advantage of being exposed to more social situations than we may experience as ENTP. \n\nENTP are always going to be better with conflict management, crisis management, logistical decision making, and separating noise from a situation (investigating.) ... I can't speak for all ENTP here, but personally I have the ability to completely turn off any sense of emotional investment in something to make the hard decisions that most could not make. \n\nA partnership between an ENTP & ENFJ can quite frankly be a deadly combination provided both remain on the same page and both respect each others roles. 
4	> . It's intimidating to talk to someone who can say things about others and myself that completely opens up a new chapter of thought. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan u give us an example or examples of this? \n\nPeople often say things like this, and what theyre actually talking about is usually much more tonned down that what i can imagine so it would help if u give me examples that can help me understand what was on her mind.
7	> She wasn't overwhelmed by the new atmosphere she was thrown into, the age difference, the reputation people held, she kept her cool. And most importantly she was able to come off in a way to those at the party as an important player who could play the game.\n\nThis is basically true of all extroverts.
2	Also Joseph on http://www.thisjungianlife.com/category/podcast/\nPodcast – This Jungian Life\nis a wonderful example of an attuned enfj
2	If she tries hard enough, she can be a future cult leader.
5	stop being a fucking pussy
2	Sounds like an INFJ? 
1	Yikes
20	Cant stop, extremism?	So this might be a very general issue but I want to understand if my upbringing had any effect on this or is it my personality? If I become comfortable with something, I get obsessed with it. Like working, will keep working till someone stops, binge watching a fucking series because its going well, drinking till I fall to doing drugs I can't stop. If I like fucking someone, I'll keep doing it till it falls of me. Do we not know how to draw the balance line?
9	Same as me, REALLY. When I’m into something, I think about it all the time, maybe too much. I had a period where I liked Kubrick a lot, and I was talking about it all the time, and saw 1000times his movies, people was just tired of me. Idk if it’s a ENTP thing, I think it’s more an autistic characteristic (I’m autistic)
7	Can't stop, extremism  \nhold on to that feeeeelin'  \n  \nStreetlights, people  \n   \n&nbsp;\n\n*oh sorry what?*
3	I do this, but within healthy limits.  I don't do any drugs and I don't drink and I plan to keep it that way.\n\nBut I got into offroading on a cheap quad... Next thing I know I've got a $30k truck in the driveway and I've upgraded to a Polaris RZR... Next thing I know it's got a new motor, clutch, and so on.  I have a good career so I get reckless with $.  I buy stuff I have fun with, I take everything to the max.\n\nI suck the fun out of everything until it's not fun anymore.  I master something, tap it out, then I get bored and look for something else to do.\n\nDepression comes when I've tapped everything out and can't find something new to suck the fun out of fast enough.\n\nHappens at work too.  I'll get real interested in a project and I'll be super productive, bashing out tons of code, then I start to bore of it and I struggle.\n\nReally I just HATE being bored.  I want to be having fun all the time.\n\nAdrenaline and Endorphins and Dopamine are my drugs.\n\nI learn quick too.  I didn't know anything about quads (four wheelers) when I bought mine.  Within 6 months I was adjusting valve clearances, cleaning carbs, rejetting, upgrading exhausts, tuning it, working on it and fixing it etc.  I learned all the terminology in a really short time.  Same thing with my RZR.\n\nWhen I find things to learn that I have fun with, I master things quickly and then I start to bore, no challenge anymore.\n\nI have an insatiable appetite for new things and I'm 34 and running out of new things.....  I have huge swath of tech related skills to the point that nothing in technology challenges me anymore except the mundane boring parts of the world (like deployment automation, docker configs, data analysis etc).\n\nI'm good at everything I care about, real good, and people think I'm full of shit, but I'm not.  If I care at all about something, I'll learn it, and I'll get really good at it.  The result is I have a lot of skills.  I can operate with competency on anything between carpentry, mechanics, programming, car audio and on and on and on.\n\nDepression is frequent, because I get bored.  I'm to the point where nothing much impresses me outside of battery break throughs, or portal guns, or anti gravity cannons, etc.\n\nI'm 30+ now and it doesn't really stop.  Luckily my major focus right now is my GF and starting a family.  I want to settle down and dedicate myself to one person and I really like her and I have a lot of my world to show her.  Taking her offroading in April for the first time!!!  \n\n\nI kind of want to get into day trading, bought some books.... But reading bores me until I get into it and I just can't seem to make myself start.  \n\n\nBut with my software development skills I feel like if I could learn day trading I could make some tools to predict stocks on social media content (reddit + facebook + twitter, etc etc) and maybe come up with a successful system for making profit off day trades easily.
2	That's youth. You get older, you learn to balance more. That was me in my college days except without the drugs.\n\nMy partner has helped me balance a lot too. :)
1	I do this, but it's because I have ADHD- Pi. In fact I notice a lot of comments posted here that could be found on r/ADHD. what's the connection?
1	I'm an xNexP & I get extreme like that especially with God, & music, . I think any/most types can get that way. It's an endless advnture with things that aren't things, things that last forever. 
1	Just try and get obsessed about things that are worth it.
2	How to develope more Fe?	So, I want to develop my Fe, and to make you guys an idea I want to reach the Fe levels/abiloties of an ENFJ.\n\nDon't misunderstand me, I just want to be as charismatic as an ENFJ, or extremely charismatic.\n\n\n\n Im M and 16 y/old.\n\n
9	Just learn to lie and manipulate...all the benefits of charisma, with none of the emotional downsides!  Start by torturing defenseless animals until you don’t feel anything, then move onto defenseless types like INFJs.  When you’re ready, try to face off against the FPs and their power to get triggered by random air currents.  If you can survive their emotional onslaught, your well on your way.  Just remember — always smile 😊 
5	I really want to find patterns in human relationships. So, every time there's is a logical inconsistent human behavior, I question it. Learning human relationships has the same mechanics with Machine Learning: You need to see lots of lots of examples. So, you can understand the real motivation behind those behaviors. So, just get more social: analyze more and experiment more.
7	[deleted]
2	> I want to reach the Fe levels/abiloties of an ENFJ.\n\nThat's not going to happen, sorry. I have pretty developed Fe and I'm nowhere **near** ENFJs. However, I find that sometimes I show more empathy than my ENFJ friends do. Why? Because Ti is second in my stack instead of fourth, which makes it easier for me to analyze another person's point of view.
2	Go into novel situations without preparation. Learn to improvise with confidence. Use every moment as an opportunity to fail and learn.\n\nTry telling a stranger that they are ugly, and see how they respond. Then get to them smile before the conversation is over. Small experiments will teach you where the lines really exist when you cross them. Don't spend time conjuring up the perfect thing to say in a given situation, learn from experience how to get away with saying anything at any time.
2	I'll basically repeat what I said before somewhere, if you want developed Fe live with a horribly abusive parent and if you don't have access to one, surround yourself with oversensitive and narcissistic types. You'll pretty much learn what to say and what not to say real quick to maintain group harmony, if you want something out of them, or if you genuinely want to keep the ball rolling.
1	Developing Fe just makes you more vulnerable to other people. People can't hurt you if you have no feelings to hurt
1	You can adopt a persona, but you can’t really change your personality.
1	Fe might make it easier for you to get along with people, but would also make you more beholden (read: not just aware) to "objective" societal standards of what is "good", more herd-like, and more subjected to the emotions of people. Are you sure you want that?
1	Life experience! My ability to empathize and put myself in other peoples shoes is whether or not I’ve been in that situation. \n\nIt sounds harsh, but if someone is going through something that I think their over reacting about, I usually just nod my head and die in silent agony. 
19	Ti users - not taking credentials as seriously as Te users	Is this relatable or something xNTPs are prone to doing?\n\nMy family is mostly composed of Te users and from what I observed they put a lot of faith into people like doctors, anyone with a title, and/or educational background/degrees.  \n\nIt’s like whatever their doctor says is complete truth!  While I question the doctor and often doubt their diagnoses or bring up alternative points of views. \n\nI think with Ti users you will take someone seriously if they are knowledgeable in something and it does not matter whether they have credentials while Te users will not take you seriously unless you have the credentials.  
16	Here's a different perspective: Without knowing anything else about a person, who do you think is more qualified to give a medical opinion? A doctor or a plumber? \n\n
17	Ti types need an explanation.  Whether that comes from the doctor or the plumber is irrelevant, because the Ti type has to understand the logic himself.  This is also true of Fi and is the “subjective” nature of Ji).  However, as /u/lightfive points out, the Doctor is far more likely to have a *educated* opinion about medicine than the plumber.  \n\nMany types inherently trust authority like SJs, which are about 50% of the population.   That’s usually a pretty good default option to follow.   I would say that NPs are most skeptical, exactly because they need to see the explanation.  \n\nTPs (and FJs) rarely use authority in arguments in my observations, instead relying their own explanations.  \n\nFPs (and TJs) seem to readily either attack a person’s credentials (ad hominem being a kind of attack against your authority) or post a lot of quotes and links to support their argument, which is relying on external reasoning to support what they feel is true.\n\nSo I would say that TPs types find *degrees* to be irrelevant, because only the argument matters, and FP types to find the status they imply to be highly relevant to either support their argument or undermine another’s.\n\nWhenever someone tries to use status as an argument (an ad hominem) I immediately suspect I’m dealing with an FP.   TJs also respect status, but for them, the logic must prevail.  So an idiot doctor is still an idiot.  And likewise, a self-professed ‘expert’ who can never explain or even actually do what they claim isn’t going to get too many chances from a (competent) TP.
6	It does matter if they have credentials, but the quality of credentials matters too. Like, you would trust the medical opinion of a doctor with over a decade of experience much more than one with less experience. Having a smidge of doubt is a good thing, but not to the point that you outright disregard someone inspite of their credentials. They do mean something, becoming a doctor is no joke. It takes a lot of time, and patience, among other things
6	Te user here. I don’t take credentials very seriously (even when I probably should), I’ve met way too many educated idiots in my life so I’m jaded. Heh. 
4	Agreed. I don't really give a fuck about degrees. Not even my own. lol
3	If you don’t trust your doctor get a second opinion by all means but definitely don’t trust your own quacky theories however much they make sense to you.
2	ENFP here. So tertiary (3rd) Te. Maybe Fi counteracts this, but not only my Fi tells me - they suck as humans, my Te also checks what they do and at what level, and I see how they see too. But my Ne tells me "well, if I was a doctor, maybe I would only use 50 year old treatments to avoid prosecution in a court of law for trying something new?"
1	My ESFJ father does this also. I always thought the Si function was guilty
1	I think it's dangerous to trust people only because of their credentials. They don't let just anybody become a surgeon and I've still seen x-rays of tools and surgical dressing left inside patients. Revision surgeries are also a thing where a surgeon fucks up an implant installation. These people have gone through medical school and *still* fuck up. \n\nAs far as social interactions go, I generally ignore any title you bring wear on your shoulder and treat you like a human being. Titles mean nothing to me. 
1	It's not so much as "I only trust my own theories" as so much as "I will judge a claim given by an individual independent from their background."  I don't factor in the fact that a doctor is right about a diagnosis because he's a doctor, but because his diagnosis seems to be accurate on its own.
1	Depends on the field. If it's art, degree doesn't mean shit - show me your portfolio.
1	Credentials don't mean much to me.  They tend to suffice for most things I'm lazy about.  Like, I'm probably not going to scour the internet for the best primary care physician, and I definitely expect my doctor to be credentialed.  But, if the doctor seems like an idiot, or like he doesn't really care about his job, then I'm going to look elsewhere for serious medical advice, regardless of whatever diploma is hanging on the wall.\n\nFor less serious things, I really don't give much of a fuck about your educational background, or how many Six Sigma certifications you have.  If you're going to claim those credentials, and you're wrong about something, it does make me more inclined to correct you on the spot.  Conversely, if you're a homeless dude on the street, and you have some really good advice for me, I'm going to take it.  \n\nLike you said OP, it's all about how knowledgeable someone is.  Now, is a doctor who has been in practice for 20 years going to know more about surgery than a homeless guy?  Almost certainly.  Is someone fresh out of college going to know more about how to improve processes within a company than the average worker who has been doing the job for a year or so?  Probably not.  \n\nThe problem I see here, and perhaps the disconnect, is that I care about ideas irrespective of who is presenting them.  I try to evaluate everything in that vacuum, and weighting my thought process to skew towards those with more credentials is completely at odds with that approach.  When I type or say something, I expect my words themselves to do the heavy lifting.  Yes, sometimes I will point out that I am worthy of such an opinion because of X experience, but that is for the benefit of other people.  \n\nSomething is either true, or it isn't.  It doesn't matter who the messenger is.
8	The Greatest Minds of History are all ENTP's: Benjamin Franklin, Mark Twain, Leonardo Da Vinci, Oscar Wilde, Voltaire...I mean why would you want to have any other type?	H.L. Menken, Teddy Roosevelt, Walter Raleigh, John Adams, and of course the inimitable Cosmo Kramer.\n\nBasically if you are smart and funny you are ENTP
8	Tbh with the way society is currently set up, I think I would rather be xSTJ and live an easier life. But it could just be my own bitterness talking because I'm tired of feeling like none of my strengths are actually valued.
5	The problem with that is you first have to be smart and funny.  😏
4	ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh
4	Leonardo was an INTP. Most inventors are according to some researchers even though ENTPs get branded “The Inventor”.
3	Very funny...
3	>H.L. Menken\n\nHe's spelled Mencken. \n\n"[Isaac Newton] was a mathematician, which is mostly hogwash, too. Imagine measuring infinity! That's a laugh" -- H.L. Mencken
2	Wasn't Nikola Tesla  also ENTP? He had an huge impact on the world! Why doesn't anyone ever seem to mention him? \n\nTake a look, https://www.teslasautobiography.com
1	Yeah.... three fourths of those people are alcoholics.
10	ENTP & Flirting Advice	Good day my fellow ENTP, I'm writing this post because, I find it difficult to flirt.\n\nWhat I mean difficult to flirt, When I talk to girls ( especially introverts ) I usually talk about the first thing that pop up my mind (politics, life, people, news, popular memes..etc) and I feel like I run my mouth so much that I feel like I dont give enough love and attention. If anything I feel like they give me lots of love and attention but I don't know how to give it back. \n\nI feel like if I get a flirting momentum I can keep flow but, I don't know how to start it to flirt. \n\nI writing this post to have an idea on how to make, catch and secure a flirting momentum and also see how other ENTP handle flirting.\n\nPS I'm kinda afraid what I say when I flirt cause of the "age of Snowflakes" especially in NYC. I've seen people take information and radically twist it around. So I be little scared on first couple dates to do anything spectacular because I do sometimes fear the unknown. 
20	Be confident (fake it till you make it). Take a genuine interest in them. Most importantly, do not need them. Being needy is the worst thing on the planet for dating, so whether you’re doing well or doing terribly, no big deal. 
11	An ENTP who has difficulties with flirting? I thought it was natural for you guys...
3	From what I hear, you just need to find a way to invite a girl into an active conversation. Why don't just ask question about her, be genuinely interested in getting to know her? If she's introverted, you can easily invite her still. Let me give you an example, say you're on a date at a cafe:  \n"Hey, sorry for being late! Damn you can't even rely on taxi drivers to get you to a place on time. But hey, look at you, drinking your white coffee, you probably never get annoyed over such small stuff. Do you ever get angry, Suzy? And why the fuck do you even drink that shit with milk?"  \n\n\nIt can be anything dude. My example is very shallow, but you probably already have a lot of clues about your girl to work around. Just don't ask about trivial, sensory stuff or turn this into an interrogation. Just find your witty ways to invite her to conversation anytime it feels one-sided. And don't be bothered by whether you don't give enough love back to her, just bring out the most stunning version of you. Either she loves it or she doesn't and you don't waste your time on her.
3	Literally just assume they already want to fuck you, speak slowly, assertively and with confidence, use your eyes, hold their gaze, don't be the first to look away. And remember the fudemental economic rule of supply and demand, reduce the supply of your attention, demand for it goes up, happy hunting 😉
2	How about ask questions about them. Like.. what was the last book you read, what kind of music do you like. Stay away from politics and religion. Small talk sucks, but having genuine interest in the other person is a good thing. 
1	Ask them questions, ask them follow-up questions, find a way to connect and build rapport, make them laugh... fend off surplus pussy with your favourite katana.
1	Read this book and etch every word into your mind : "The mystery method".\n\nFlirting is an intellectual exercise and you can learn how to become an expert.
1	Just ask questions and make jokes. It works when you don't need it to 
1	Just talk to them, and then confidently ask them out after a while.  
2	How do you identify mbti types?	I see many posts and comments talking about someone else that is a certain type, how do you figuire?\n\nI can not for the life of me identify the mbti profiles of even my parents, let alone somebody else. I know my girlfriend is ISFJ, she took the test.\n\nI'd love to be able to identify peoples types to understand them better!
9	Just assume everyone is an esfp until they say something reasonably intelligent. 
3	For starters, find the proper *basis*. For instance, use the officially recognized MBTI dichotomies of E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P. Then, if you're so inclined, you can compactify these dimensions into *functions* but it is absolutely imperative that these functions respect and obey the dichotomies. \n\nYou can find dichotomy descriptions on the MBTI foundation site, and function descriptions on Wikipedia under Jungian cognitive functions.
1	Just read type descriptions and you should be able to get a feel for where your friends / family sit. Of course that is broadly speaking you will find some try hards, attempting to convince you that they are the all knowing spawn of Freud's left nutsack. I say leave them to it.
1	If you want to get as accurate as possible, the process can be quite extensive AND you must know how functions work.\n\nFirst i'll just take any random pair of functions like si/se or fi/fe (i find these two the easiest to start with) and try to figure out if they're the introverted or extroverted. Once you have that settled, try to refine how they use their function to know if it's dominant, auxilary, etc.. AS WELL AS if its complimentary function fits (say you figure out their fe function is more developed than fi, try to test them out on ti and see if they fit the fe-ti pairing) Using these methods, you refine the types and mentally (or on paper if it helps) move around all the functions into different spots to see what combination corresponds best. With this method, i've been able to accurately type people on my first try within 5 minutes but bare in mind, it takes practice. If anyone has any tips to make my process easier please share haha 
1	Too much touching? Then it is Extroverted Sensation.\n\nToo much order and efficiency? Then it is Extroverted Thinking.\n\nToo much random stuff? Then it is Extroverted Intuition.\n\nToo much logical analysis? Then it is Introverted Thinking.\n\nToo much personal values? Then it is Introverted Feeling.\n\nToo much caring and/or needy? Then it is definitely xSFJ.\n\nThis is my personal cheat sheet so far. I think functions matter much more than MBTI dichotomies. 
1	I ask interesting people if they know their type.\n\nThose I'm very close with is easy to type without asking. It's tough to explain why and how, but if you know someone well enough like a parent or a sibling, you can somewhat predict how the would answer mbti questions, or just think what their functions are.
1	Look at their habits and how they talk. I = Thinks about their place in the world, E = Thinks about chain reactions involving other people, S = Observant, N = In their head, F = Easily offended, T = Laughs at dead baby jokes, P = Looking for new opportunities, J = Follows the plan almost no matter what\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeen able to see and confirm: INTJ, INFP, ENTP, XSTP and two ISTPs using my own mental methods. Just gotta develop your own system.

9	How developed do you consider your own Fe to be?	Do you think that you are pretty well developed at this point with Fe? How old are you? When did things start to change and go in the right direction?
6	I developed my Ti instead.  When I was in high school I was pretty dumb.  I failed a lot of tests and got sick and tired of always being the dumb one in the class. So I focused on developing my Ti, and now, after a lot of hard work I’m a certified genius triple 9er.   I highly recommend developing your Ti instead because it’s much more beneficial.  And the easy part is that you develop it exactly like you develop Fe.
4	20 years old (male), in the past I thought my Fe was totally developed... but more realistically, it’s like an unreliable tool. Basically, no one can compare to my conversational skills in certain (somewhat random) moments/situations; however, it’s clearly underdeveloped still. For example, I still have Fe “freak outs” at people for not respecting the environment/culture we are in to the optimal level. I also seem to get lost in my thoughts sometimes and feel it’s hard to communicate with the same clarity I have in my mind.
2	I’m 42. Fe makes me refrain from saying various things since I have a notion of the impact of those things. When it doesn’t make me refrain it makes me feel guilty for causing others to feel bad, although that seems to be on a time delay.
2	I‘m 20 and tbh i always thought i had lots of Fe, to the point where i considered whether i might be an enfj. But i think my self evaluation was just plain wrong because i‘m notorious for my direct and often times unwillingly disrespectful speaking manners. I never knew i was direct though, i always thought i‘m a nice person\n\nI‘m pretty strict about social morals too. If possible i‘d like everyone to be considerate, respectful and nice to the max, and i get kinda misanthropic when i see people treating each other bad
1	Rationality and pragmatism restrict me from developing my Fe past the point it is now. Yeah sure I can be way more empathetic than I am now but having dealt with people for 20+ years I can say that people don’t always repay kindness with goodwill. Therefore I pick the moments I allow my Fe to shine very carefully. 
1	as developed as your brain, I'm infp btw.
1	I'm 28 and I would say it is very developed. Dominant even. I use it to understand my wife better since she is an INFJ. I don't necessarily use it to make the group around me happier, or something dumb like that. I use it to flow the situation in a way I like lol
1	Pretty developed since i feel the Way my friend group and other relations have worked has forced me too. Also i feel myself turning a bit more soft now that im “older” (21) or maybe im just a bit more empathetic than i used to.
1	36 father/husband. You bet your ass my Fe is developed, for an ENTP. I’ve been bullied into respecting people’s feelings by real life. 
1	Worked in sales before and during college. It's enough to get by, most days. Ti/Te is more interesting :P it goes into the why's and how's; Fe is relatively static and formulaic (not to say that Fe-related abilities are not useful, just not as fun imo)
1	I would say that I am pretty well developed at this point with Fe, but sometimes I just lost focus and become an asshole again for about one or two days, but later guilt kills me. There's room for improvement, I think. I'm 26.
1	Yep. 27. When I stopped trying to force Fe to work a different way, and instead just started to do what I want to do with the ability to understand what others want from me and how delicate the social situation is to change. Understanding the big picture and how events will unfold and trigger chain reactions and different scenarios based just on words alone, navigating that, escaping the trap, changing the situation by examining many perspectives and probable outcomes. Developed Fe may make you less of a social retard, but you essentially still are in that you don't really care what happens to other people unless they're some big part of your life, and even then you may not. In the end, I use Fe as a means to restrain myself and keep healthy relations stable, network, make friends, etc. However, Fe (to me, Extraverted Ethics, social expectations, this is not feelings or empathy) is a double-edged sword and you can quickly find yourself trying to fit in and stifling your own personality to look good or normal enough - and once your face cracks, it's all over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell developed Fe is basically just knowing how to be polite.
2	Could be any connection between auxiliary / tertiary functions and sense of humor?	So I am an ENTP and I have strange aaaaaaand pretty dark sense of humor. One of my friend's boyfriend is ENTP either, he finds the dark memes as hilarious as me. In the group of my friends there are only two guys who have the same sense of humor - two ESTPs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have the same auxiliary and tertiary functions, so what do you think? Could be any connection? Or am I just an MBTI geek? :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSry for mistakes, english is not my native language.
2	I have a strange and dark sense of humor too. Guess it's time to change my flair.\n\nI suggest you see a doctor [instead](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/offbeat/dark-sense-of-humour-could-be-early-sign-of-dementia-study-1.2425508?mode=amp).
2	I don't have a dark sense of humor, that's reversely racist. I have a light sense of humor, thank you very much. 
9	Idea: BLACK SUNSCREEN	Are you tired of your pasty white skin blinding lifeguards at the swimming pool? Are you tired of people asking you if you’re sick?? Have you ever wondered what it’s like to be black and have lots of friends?....as in TYRONE black? Well, I’ve come up with a cool solution that’ll keep you cancer free my friends.\n\nBLACK SUNSCREEN. We’ve all worn white sunscreen, but why isn’t there a BLACK sunscreen? The sunscreen that makes you wanna break dance and HOLLA with a DOLLA. The sunscreen that makes you wanna rap and booty tap. YOU get the picture. And you know what else you get? You get to block out the rays of the sun, but instead of showing off your horrific white skin, you get the perks of being a cool, well liked, black person with with a CRAZzZzY sassy attitude.\n\nSomeone calls you racist? “Naw brah dis be sunscreen boi”. A police officer tries to shoot you? “No sir, this right here is black sunscreen.” People accuse you of a hate crime? “Whatchu talkin’ about?”\n\nI honestly cannot see *any* repercussions to this product. Genius??? Trailblazer??? RACIAL PEACE? WHAT COULD BE BETTER?\n
12	No. Black object absorb all kind of wavelengths in white light and reflects none. Thus, as the light is absorbed, it gets converted to other forms of energy, usually heat. Why do you want to get heatstroke that fast?  
3	Ill invest
4	Here's a little tweak to your proposal. You know how sun shades work on cars? Make that in sunscreen form and whalla, shielding from UV light and heat. Bonus for looking like the silversurfer.
4	>put blackface on and be protected from the sun
2	I'd be down with different colors. Don't they already make a purple color so kids can see to apply it completely? and it changes to white or clear?
1	Black sunscreen is a horrible idea, like a jacket with Vantablack. You're going to overheat and maybe get first-degree burns. The entire point of sunscreen is to reflect solar EM, not absorb it.
1	Worth it cause the way you sold it really made me laugh 
1	I'll take 10

10	How do you guys deal with trauma?	New or recurring trauma from relationships, sexual assault, male and female answers welcome! 
8	Therapy! A thousand times, THERAPY!\n\nThere are lots of different kinds. Dialectal Behavior Therapy and Sensorimotor Psychotherapy are just a couple. (I've had good experience with both.) I've heard from trauma survivors that EMDR is effective, but intense. When looking for a therapist, seek one who specializes in trauma. Not all of them do.\n\nIt isn't a magic pill. You have to put work in for it to be effective. But if you **are** willing to put in the work, therapy will improve your life.
5	Ignored it and suppressed it. Been so long now
4	ENTP brains are, in part, self-correcting. We have a tendency through how our brain naturally functions to evaluate past traumatic events, go over the details, identify clues, and reassess the situation. I have had therapy, but have found that I have greater results on my own.  \n\n\nI had PTSD for 7 years as a result of domestic violence. During that time, many articles stated PTSD is permanent. It is not, but the anxiety it is built upon is a lot tougher to crack. For PTSD, I found that being around people who knew me before I had outlawed the use of previous decision-making landmarks was very helpful. I realized how far I had strayed from being myself. I liked myself. I'd had a few years of therapy at this point and found very few results - I always needed therapy to deal with the crisis of the moment. I realized that my panic attacks or rage moments were in connection to an event that reminded me of my trauma in some way. I would stop what I was doing and have a hard look at what past trauma was bothering me. I imagined that the events that occurred were like rooms in my mind that connected to other rooms. Decisions I had made, some even in childhood, that were used to get my life to the traumatic events, were off limits, lined with crime scene tape, if you will. I began to evaluate each 'crime scene' independently of the circumstances. Once I removed the nuance, I evaluated whether my decision or judgment had been to blame for the terrible things that happened. They were not. I would exonerate that choice from any culpability and felt a little more 'myself' each time. The triggers began diminishing in number and frequency of being triggered. I was still having some rage moments and needed a little more work when I had another traumatic life event that I was not able to control. Acceptance that I could not control everything and had to allow events to take their course set me straight. There's some neuroscience behind this that a new trauma is required which is successfully navigated through to 'reset' the brain after PTSD. I felt like I was high, so unencumbered did I feel. I worried that it was temporary, that I'd be back to suffering any moment. I did a little digging and found a neuroscientist who studies neuroplasticity. I called and had a short over-the-phone consultation with his staff. The overall consensus was that if I felt better, I was actually better. That was over 2 years ago. I still have anxiety and am working to address those issues, which are seated in early childhood experiences, as they are for many who experience anxiety on a regular basis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I said earlier, that's a tougher nut to crack. It requires some really in-depth examination of your life as a child, much of which I'd rather not remember. It takes a lot more work to dig up those memories and leaves me a lot more raw than I felt when dealing with my PTSD nonsense. I have since come to realize that PTSD is essentially anxiety dialed to 11 coupled with the arrogance to believe that you should have or even could have done anything differently with what you knew at the time and that PTSD happens after a person is exposed to trauma and fails to resolve it - essentially ignoring it and continuing with life like nothing happened.  \n\n\nI don't know if I answered your question as directly as you'd have preferred, but it was a very in-depth process that took a number of years to get this far. :)
3	Therapy is the #1 choice, but it can be REALLY hard to find a therapist who works for you and understands you.  I know that personally I need someone who works well with my personality, and knows how to be direct. \n\n2nd way is coming out about the traumatic event to your friends/loved ones.  Obviously you don't have to tell the whole story at once (and sometimes trauma takes a while to set in), but telling your story a little at a time to the right people can do you some good. (Just make sure it's the right people!)
1	CBT, is the way I go. I worked with MSF and on reservations for a few years, saw some stuff that really fucked me up. CBT was the best thing while I was decompressing. 
1	It depends to some extent on how it’s affecting you ... nightmares, anxiety, guilt etc that would determine the treatment modality. Can be as simple as counselling. and support groups. Trauma shouldn’t be a regular occurrence so def get help esp. if it’s a recurring or ongoing theme. May need psychodynamic in that case.\n\nThere is also such a thing as trauma focussed CBT.
1	Depends on the trauma. Rape? Ignore it and pretend it doesn’t happen. Death? Block out memories of the person. Breakup? D R U G S (just kidding. Kinda.) Fight? I usually don’t care. If I do care I’ll stop caring in about a week. Someone say something hurtful? Laugh at them and remember that words mean nothing. Being blackmailed? Deal with paralyzing anxiety but pretend like everything is going good 😎
1	Therapy. My ex put me though hell. She went to rehab several times and I woke up one morning to her suicide note after I'd been working myself to death to try to help her get help.\n\nTherapy, meditation and time is the only answer that worked for me.
1	See the pattern leading up to it before it happens and leave. The worst thing you can do is gimp yourself and take away your own ability to think logically because of personal attachments. Thinking someone is going to change for you, who is essentially a flaming trainwreck of a human being, is an ego trip - you're not cool enough to make that happen; regardless of how alluring the possibility may be. However, you can stick around and fuck with them for a bit, maybe even get some free stuff.
-2	Suicide helps. jk suicide isn't a joke but this post definitely is.
3	just wondering how ENTPs would respond to this	[u/throwaway3n1p](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway3n1p) and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in different MBTI types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count judgments of *moral obligation* out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded.
16	You know how people say, "Don't get hung up on semantics?"  Well I'm hung up on semantics.  I find your choice of words really interesting and I'm wondering if you chose them deliberately.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n99.9% of the time, when people ask this question, they ask **"When is murder morally acceptable?"**  Is that what you meant?  Because I find the notion of trying to *logically* justify murder really difficult but also intriguing.  When is murder logical?  You can argue that it's never logical because as a species, it's illogical to kill our own kind.  Most species of animal do not do this.  It is counter-productive to propagating the species.  Then again, animals aren't logical themselves so who cares what they do?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't think of a way to justify murder any other way than morally because it's a moral issue.  Even those guys who plotted to kill Hitler (unsuccessfully - they were discovered and killed); they had a pragmatic/utilitarian reason for doing it, but still had to get past the moral dilemma of killing their own leader.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere can be logical reasons for killing someone but, you still can't say it's "fine" until you resolve the moral piece.  Take a woman married to an abusive man.  He doesn't allow her to work so she is stuck.  It is logical for her to kill him and collect his life insurance policy (provided she isn't caught).  But it isn't morally the right thing to do so should she do it?  No.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd the word "fine" isn't sufficient here.  What does that mean?  I'm assuming you mean "acceptable."  When you feel the benefit received is significant enough to accept the cost.  So I guess in the end, I would need you to elaborate on the original question.  Because what you've provided isn't sufficient for me to provide a good answer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS- You might want to take "retarded" out of your vocabulary.  Intelligent people don't say that anymore.
3	Morality is competently subjective.\n\nAsking when murder is fine / wrong is like asking when it's fine / wrong to put pineapple on pizza.  \nIt depends who you're asking, there is no right answer. 
3	Logical is a strange choice of terms... I’m not sure logic is the right term to assess right and wrong. A better question would maybe be, “When is murder logical”, and “When is murder illogical”.\n\nAnyway, I guess It may be logical when it:\n\n1) Is the best possible solution to a problem. You’ve thought of all the other options, and this is really the best route to take.\n\n2) Is feasible and efficient. As in, it can actually be accomplished and without an inordinate investment of time and effort. \n\n3) The consequences for committing the murder would either be minimal, or the benefits of committing the murder would outweigh any consequences. As in, you know, if you kill a person you may go to jail but you’ll save humanity from certain annihilation, or whatever. It’s here that you take into account the larger moral and legal principles of the society in which you live and ask whether murder is acceptable as a solution within that larger framework, and what the penalties may be for this choice of action.\n\n4) Is rational. As in not based on strong emotions and passions. A revenge killing is not rational in my book. A killing for the sake of killing is not rational. To be rational it must be done to further some aim that cannot be met otherwise. Self defense in my mind counts as rational even though emotions might be high as it is the most rational choice to save your own life in the moment. Point is emotions may be involved, but they should not be the overriding decision-maker.  \n\nFor it to be logically wrong I guess it would be the opposite of what I listed above.\n\nI kinda feel really silly that I even entertained this question, but there you go. \n
3	Question 2: It's not wrong.\n\nQuestion 1: Humans are simultaneously a predator and prey species i.e, Humans prey on other humans. Assassination is one of the oldest power moves.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Murder cannot be „logically“ fine. It can be fine according to your own morals. According to mine, a murder that benefits the greater good is fine, like killing a mass murderer or a child rapist\n\nYou could justify a murder, but that doesn‘t make it fine. Or first, define „fine“
2	Murder is a man-made legal construct - hence, the question is wrong because in order to figure out right and wrong one must understand the facts surrounding the murder.\n\n\nQuestion should be about killing, which is primal, basic. 
2	murder is logically fine if you have a just enough reason to, based on situation. it also decreases the population which is currently growing too fast.\n\nmurder is wrong because it makes people related to the person feel bad. however if its someone alone with no family and nobody that cares. murder isnt all that wrong.\n\n(ofc this is putting all my moral standards aside)\n
3	You can do that in three words. \n\n1) Hitler \n\n2) Not Hitler\n\nReasoning is redundant cuz it's obvious.\n\nOn a more serious note, 2 is probably easier to do than 1. Leaving aside any arguments from individual rights, whether they're natural (they're not) or socially constructed, any society that is permitting murder is setting itself up for massive damage, both in manpower and psychologically. Banning it outright and punishing it severely while permitting tightly regulated exceptions makes sense. \n\nThat leads us to 1. Murder isn't wrong in certain specific cases. If a government is overly tyrannical (think a Hitler or Stalin type thing, not Obama raising your taxes or pushing for universal healthcare) it is morally permissible and politically inevitable to get rid of the tyrant. \n\nSince life isn't Victoria II though, an event to kill your leader won't just pop up after 1/4 of your population had starved to death so the conditions for when it's okay need to be worked out first. Overall, they need to be laid out in such a way that we don't have to deal with question 2 type problems, i.e. "murder is wrong in all cases except X, where X is narrowly defined.
2	Murder is circularly defined. Most definitions look something like\n\n>the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another.\n\nOr\n\n>Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, especially the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought\n\nOkay, but why is it unlawful? It's unlawful because it's seen as wrong (otherwise why wouldn't it be legal?)\n\nSo it's wrong because it's unlawful, but it's unlawful because it's wrong. Morality is intrinsically linked to its definition, so you can't really decouple moral obligation from murder. \n\nThis is by no means a pathology to murder or law itself — all of language has circular definitions. It's actually the job of lexicographers to map, in as much detail as they can, specific lexemes via dictionary definitions. But this comes at the price of circularity.\n\n
1	Logically Valid:\n\n-When (# of people killed = less than # of people saved) if age is assumed similar.\n-If contribution to society can be accurately measured, then all people under a certain score can be killed\n-if genetics are bad, and could weaken humanity\n\nLogically Invalid:\n\n-Anything involving emotional response to an event; for example, wife cheated on me, so I killed her. Although, one could argue the logic for this too.\n-For amusement, but again it would appear logical to that person: I find this funny/fun, so I will continue to kill people to stimulate these enjoyable mind-states\n
1	Morality tends to be a shortcut toward behaviors that society has found preferable by a process resembling natural selection, so it should generally line up with constraining individual behaviors to prevent the collapse of a community (and generally it does).\n\nFor the purposes of this comment I will be defining murder as "the willful and deliberate killing of a person who is not posing a clear and immediate danger of death or grave injury to you or a third party."\n\nAs an example, if Alice is charging Bob with a knife and Bob shoots her, not murder. Alice see the gun and runs away and Bob shoots her as she flees, it's murder. Alice is charging Charlie with a knife and Bob shoots her, probably not murder (defense of others gets complicated).\n\nSo then\n\n1) murder would not be logically fine. In order for a rule to be logical it must be consistent. If murder is okay for David then it would also be okay for everyone. A hypothetical society where murder is permitted would not encourage conflicting parties to deescalate and would have a shocking death rate. If such society did not collapse and die out then it would fall behind its neighbors whose (all else being equal) longer average lifespan would allow for a higher amount of skilled labor and technical advancement.\n\n2) this is the inverse of 1) and the reasoning follows the same pattern. A hypothetical society with no murder (either because it's populated by moral paragons or because every attempted murder results in the survival of the victim and the perpetrator(s) being killed defensively or etc) would be inventivized to deescalate conflicts and negotiate solutions that leave both conflicting parties alive and able to contribute to the further advancement of the society. Such a society would naturally have an advantage in human capital relative to a neighbor with a high murder rate (all else being equal) and would be expected to flourish, perhaps eventually absorbing its less-advanced neighbors.
1	1. Because humans are animals and to animals it's natural and normal to kill eachother, even when they are the same race. \n\n2. Because humans can usually survive without killing other people and the society we live in teaches us to think that every life is important. (And yes I do think every life is important but I just think that if the society we live in wouldn't have told us everyday that it's wrong to hurt others, then we would probably think it's okay to kill others) \n\nand sorry for my bad english
1	1) It's not, for it to be fine would be illogical. It would most likely lead to an increase in murders overall, especially by those for whom the prohibition prevents from taking action.\n\n2) People as a group behave largely based on what the group agrees is right and wrong. When things are prohibited it doesn't ever truly stop it from happening but gives society a way to handle those that break the rules and prevents a large amount of people from breaking them.\n\nI'd say the perspective might be different individually rather than societally, but since we live in groups it makes the most sense to consider it this way. If you were to ask me for my perspective as if I were constructing a society ala China's brand of quasi fascism, my answer would be completely different.\n\nThus I believe this answer depends on the person and the code of laws they live under/grew up under.
1	I’m saying if the word is technically correct, use it. If you’re using it as a hyperbole for a different word, don’t use it.
1	1: Yes and No\n\n2: No and Yes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's completely situational to me.
16	Any other ENTPs out there with shittier handwriting than mine? Kinda looks like these notes belongs to a really smart 3 year old	
13	Neater writing comes from practice and *slowing down*. It's not a race
7	I mean I can read that, which isn't always true of my own handwriting.\n\n\>.>
4	I would drop a course if these were the notes I had to borrow to copy when I missed.  \n\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you? why would you never fix this? why would you show it to us? touch type and hide that shit and practice the fuck out of your signature or become a doctor, damn.\n\n&#x200B;
2	That looks almost identical to mine...🤨🧐😲🤯
2	Ugh, that gives me anxiety. I truly don’t understand how people write that way, ha. 
4	Mine used to be that bad but people always said I was dumb or incompetent because they judged me on my printing (which is kind of stupid but whatever). Just work on writing neatly by doing like a nightly journal or some thing and try and be as neat as possible. It's not that bad though at least you can read it. 
1	My handwriting is not that bad but whenever people comment on it I like to remind them how bad every doctors handwriting is... it’s a sign of intelligence! 
1	I've got a doctor's handwriting on speed.
1	I have much worse hand writing.  But I've been programming since I was 8 years old and have spent most of my life on a keyboard.\n\nThe trade off, I type over 100 words a minute.  The keyboard is like an extension of my hand.  I type without even really thinking about it and I know where ever key is without looking at it.
1	I swear handwriting can get better with age theres so much practice that goes into it at school. Are you like 12? 
1	I can read it and it’s not for public consumption, so the only problem I can infer is that it looks like you (probably) write slowly.\n\nI relearned cursive in law school to effectively take notes. It was very useful and I still use it now.
1	No. No, there are not. If I were to read this out loud, it would have the sound of someone reading a book while *almost* vomiting every other word.\n\nYou need to practice, because if anyone sees you write like this, they will immediately wonder if you have rabies or are a giant child or something. \n\nAlso, taking notes is for suckers. Put the writin' stick down and listen and think. \n\nOn the positive side, handwriting is 100% a trainable skill! Get to work and report back in two months time. You can do it, ya derpy bastard. 😁👍\n\nPS: i before e except after c. Perceived, not percieved. 
1	My youngest brother just finished elementary school. He wrote better than this as a first grader. Go back to elementary school, you need it more than my brother did.
1	I've just resorted to writing in all caps. Both faster to write and easier to read.
1	Man handwriting is great, this is a ‘you’ problem 
5	Tell me how to help a fellow Entp	I’m male, and and I have a cousin that is female, and is an Entp...\n\nLately I been improving my dopamine system and started trying to create my own happiness, The results are great and I’m getting maturer in the process.\n\nThe thing is that I started to notice that my cousin is a very immature Entp (Narcissistic, low self esteem, extremely unorganized, tends to isolate herself, hates when people are slow to the point of despising the person itself, etc...) and she is older than me.\n\nI know that you can’t help someone that doesn’t  want it (and she reeeeally doesn’t apply any advice she gets) but i really want her to thrive, and win the respect of her relatives, because they don’t trust her at all and this is destroying step by step their relationship.\n\nWhat can I do ma dudes?\n\n(Soz for bad english, not my first lenguage, correct me if you want to ;:3)
6	I would say that you should simply lead by example and, perhaps, if she seems interested or after you've exhibited those skills, say something about how you've been learning these things recently and it's really helped you out. Don't suggest that it might help her, but be specific about in what ways it helped you and maybe how you would have behaved before?  \n\n\nWhen dealing with people who don't like advice, it's best not to give it. Talk about yourself, not them. Also, consider that it may not only be a case of immaturity. She may be a 'softer' ENTP than you and more prone to emotional responses, as an example. I do hope you're able to get through to her, but at the end of the day, you can only lead the horse to water. You can't make it drink. You can't make your cousin change, only let her know that she doesn't have to be the way she is now.
2	Take her out for coffee (beverages) at a semi busy cafe weekly. Let her absorb all the things via osmosis. \n\nIs she having problems at home? As in abusive or controlling parents or partner? If she's isolating, she may be in a trauma cycle.\n
1	Itll probably get better over time, but you could try to encourage her I guess. Not quite sure tho.
1	Western philosophy got me to start giving a shit about things... Kant stop, won't stop.

9	Reddit and goddamned comparisons	I enjoy arguing on reddit, but one of the most annoying things I've encountered too many times on here is the complete warping and misunderstanding of comparisons. For a lazy example, if someone said:\n\n>Yeah, Tom abused his children, but I think that him being an artist redeems him a little bit.\n\nAnd I reply:\n\n>That's a pretty bad reason to redeem someone. Hitler™ was a painter, but that shouldn't give him more brownie points when compared to a Hitler who *didn't* paint.\n\n99 out of 100 times the person will respond with something like:\n\n>Excuse me? Are you seriously comparing Tom to Hitler? You're insane. I'm done.\n\nLike, what is this?\n\nIt's so annoying and I don't know how to counter it at all. I try to spell it out for them and they still don't get it.\n\nIt happens every fucking time, and each time it happens a piece of my brain dies in disappointment lmao\n\n.\n\nMy question is, are these people being deliberately obtuse to sneak their way into some hodgepodged, underserved "win", genuinely too dumb to understand the comparison, or so clouded by frustration that they can't think clearly?
6	When you mention Hitler people's brains turn off.
3	People are stupid. Are you new?
2	I think a lot of people just see a situation as it is. And they don’t get the essence of the comparison, because to their mind it’s a different situation. I’ve noticed it myself, that to my brain there are patterns, and comparisons are one of the ways to grasp the essence and put it in different perspectives. While for others that just makes it confusing because you’re throwing all these different situations at them and they go: wtf? \n\nI can’t explain it well but yeah. I know what you mean :D.

1	Who stopped reading after the 2nd bullet point?
10	What personally type would you rather be than entp?	I'm sort of glad I'm an ENTP but not really.\n\nI'd rather be an ISTP. They just don't give a phuck. I mean we (entphaggots) can easily pretend like we don't but deep down we actually kind of do. Plus they (istp) can just see things for what they are instead of trying to think of all these random "possibilities." \n\nOn the other hand, I would never want to be anything with a J at the end of it. Just way too intense, it's like they can't relax. Seriously who cares if they get paid more and actually do stuff. 
8	I dont care what others think of me because the shit Ive been through. \n\nIts fun to be an ENTP who doesnt give a fuck though.\n\nId rather be a ENTJ so I could actually get shit done.
6	I’m pretty stoked to be an ENTP to be honest. I think we’re pretty awesome. When I’m in a good place and my ENTPness is allowed to flow forth, I’m an unstoppable geyser of creativity and, let’s face it, eccentric zaniness. \n\nOf course it has its downsides. Someone please come over and implement all my visionary ideas, please! I tire of starting and not finishing things, which is my major qualm. By let’s face it, every type has their pitfalls, faults, and weaknesses, and every type can learn to be better... And so can we! Of course, it’s a lot more fun to hang out with my pie-in-the-sky thoughts most of the time. Ah, the irresistible lure of the daydream. \n\nI guess if I had to choose... ENTJ probably. 
6	ENTJ/INTJ. I try to become them with stimulants
5	An ENTJ is the only other type I would really want to be.
3	Please take my P away; it's cool and all, but I literally get nothing done just like the rest of yous. What good is a nice brain if you can't bring yourself to do anything with it?\n\nBut if I had to choose a type, I'd pick ENTP lmao
3	Right there with the ENTJ/INTJ.  I just wanna get shit done, man. (But yes, I still have my ENTP pride!)
3	I do love the fact that Most ENTP in this post want  to keep there T but, the rest is optional 😅
4	Any Sensor type would probably do because it's easier to be a square SJ than a weirdo intuitive.
2	ENTJ, then ESTP.\n\nAs a Enneagram Type 8, these types feel like home and I have had a few users on this subreddit claim I'm one of those types.\n\nIt's amazing to be someone who gets shit done.
3	I'd rather be any of the xSTx types. 
1	I'm pretty happy as an ENTP most of the time. I like ENFPs and ESTPs too, so I would be happy to change into one of them.
1	Estp, entj, istj, istp 
1	Used to test as an INFP! I now test as an ENTP (haven’t tested in maybe 2-3 years before tonight). \n\nI’d rather be an ENFJ because I feel like they a) get on less nerves and b) have an easier time influencing people. That said, I think I like myself better as an extroverted INFP 
1	I wouldn't switch, I love being an ENTP.
1	ESTP to be Johnny Bravo
1	Honestly I could work around being any ST/NT type 
1	ISTP would be nice. Then I could at least fit in with the family.
1	ENTJ... like an INTJ but cooler. 
8	Why do people feel the need to belong somewhere?	I didn’t know where else to post this because I don’t follow mant subreddits.\n\nI recently joined and I’m not very active, but jesus christ... every fucking sub needs to have its own inside jokes, things ”new people don’t get” and so on.\n\nI followed r/ADHD just out of sheer curiosity, because people have asked me if I’m diagnosed in the past, and every other post is people bleeding for a pat on their shoulder.\n\nEven in this sub I see people with a need to belong somewhere. Shouldn’t ENTP’s be the exact opposite?\n\nI just want a place that is interesting and where people have productive disussions that leads somewhere. Like, change my mind, don’t make me dislike you... \n\nThis applys to real life too, but my friends don’t like to listen to my rants. So... thanks for letting me ”ramble on” :)
9	Because it’s human nature, the result of being a tribal species who has evolved and progressed by relying on the idea of the “tight knit family”. It’s a survival instinct...\n\n...and everyone does this. No matter who you are, what you do, or how you do it you will always be part of a hive mind of drones who cater to your “unique” thought process. People think this self perceived uniqueness makes them their own individual when really they’re just doing exactly what their ancestors have been programmed to do since the dawn of evolution and their successors will continue to do until the end of the human race.\n\nDeep shit amirite 
4	> **Why do people feel the need to belong somewhere?** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n...because some of us have friends that do not listen to our ramblings....
3	Well I think a lot of the time people join a subreddit to belong somewhere, to find likeminded people. But I am with you on this. I think sometimes the inside jokes go much too far.
1	We all want to ‘belong’ and be understood to some extent and this fits in with our concept of identity, value and utility. We get ‘ego strokes’ in groups.\n\n The quote ‘ I don't care to belong to any club that will have me as a member’  taken to its extreme, is more a sign of psychopathology and self loathing.
1	Kurzgesagt actually did a pretty neat video on Loneliness that answers this question. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Xv_g3g-mA
1	Seems like you want to belong.

27	ENTP and Meditation	Took practice in meditation a while ago, wasn't able to stay consistent though. However, I would like to get into meditation back again. Got some questions that I've been asking myself quite some time now. Would appreciate replies.\n\nDoes the ENTP type benefit the most out of all types, when it comes to meditation?\n\nWhich type of meditation is generally the best for the ENTP type?\n\nAny book recommendations? Should I read multiple books on meditation to gain better insight? Or is one sufficient enough?\n\nAlso, what are your guys take on meditation, to begin with? Is it even worth the time and effort?
14	Meditation is amazing for your general wellbeing and happiness, and also very efficient for dealing with entp weaknesses.\n\nRead The Mind Illuminated (written by a neurologist) for good meditation instructions and some background on how it works.
4	Yes. I too suffered from *too much thinking*.   After spending three hours staring at a wall, I poisoned enough neurons with boredom juice that I no longer have that problem.  Now I’m content with Fortnite and memes.
5	Meditation is something you have to figure out on your own. It involves calming your mind down and relaxing. Allow the mental images in your mind to just happen. Don't try to influence it with consensus thought. You don't need drugs to achieve this sort of mental state. \n\nThe type of meditation I do is simply laying down and closing my eyes. I allow my awareness to drift away from my point of view. I then drift into another mental state to spend time in another mental reality. It's like VR without the equipment. It's like a dream without sleeping. \nBenefits of this can include, being able to disengage with reality to think about something without being bothered, being able to enjoy the vast experience of the mind, reduced stress, as well as increased awareness of things you might have not considered without deep meditation....\nIt's not easy to explain overall, but the idea is to allow yourself to become more aware of reality and take your mind to another level altogether. \nBest of luck, and and questions if you wish.
3	Keep it simple. Sit comfortably with good posture and repeat "this". Pace your exhalations and repetitions.\n\nThis.\n\nThis.\n\nKeep yourself grounded in the here-and-now reality, repeating to yourself that This is what it is to exist. Simplest, most effective grounding technique I've found.\n\nThere are many ways to go about meditating: breath work (by focusing on the feeling or by tempo (in-2-3-4 hold-2-3-4 out-2-3-4 hold-2-3-4)), body scans, alternating attention focus between 2-3 points (useful for driving: field of view, hands' feeling on the wheel, FoV, etc.), just observing your thoughts drift and letting them go ... During vacations, I tend to go hard. 4 sessions a day with an alarm to remind me of each. During those times, a little variety beats "the best" method. \n\nWhatever works! The mind rest and clarity is worth it.
6	I’ve tried different stuff and it never works. Drugs, pressure, and adrenaline are my ways of clearing my mind.
3	Mindfulness meditation helps me get out of my head and into the physical world.
2	Id say entp has the best chance at getting enlightened. Meditation evidence wise seems unrelated to triggering enlightenment thus far. 
2	Reading through your post I see language and ideas dealing with perfectionism, something I certainly struggle with. \nMeditation is outstanding. It’s a tool amongst many at your disposal. The perfectionist mindset wants meditation to be THE tool to solve all problems. The ENTP mindset wants to be a master at it quickly and then after 3 months, get bored and lose interest again 😂\nThe key is to not look to it for problem solving, but incorporate it into your identity. 
2	Meditation might not apply to what I’m proposing but it attempts to get at the same benefits. \n\nWhat I suspect is you more than likely already have practices that deepen your understanding of yourself. What you might be interested in doing is consciously pondering these habits and pinpointing more or less why they help you understand yourself better. \n\nSo instead of a meditation practice, you find and follow, you develop a sort of  personal-science that allows you to deepen the understanding of your being. \n\nThis is what I do and it has been difficult but I can attest to the benefits of such an endeavor. 
1	Meditation in its many forms is by far the best practice and tool ever invented for self-improvement. Any properly conducted effort you put into meditation will pay back dividends like no other thing you do. Meditation is the best spent time in your life. It helps you excel in every area of life. Many of the benefits are derivative of the general brain enhancing process. Benefits of meditation include:  \n\n\n* Increased quality of life in general by working magic on your brain and thinking\n* Ultimately learn to calm yourself in any situation and treat life in a more relaxed way\n* Think better by increasing overall control and interconnectedness of your brain areas\n* Become more focused and increase flow experiences\n* Increased productivity\n* Become less biased\n* Increase your emotional intelligence\n* Reduce fears, increase courage\n* Reduce OCD tendencies (not usually an ENTP issue unless heavily stressed)\n* Reduced stress levels\n* Increased longevity in general and makes your brain age slower, on top of increasing gray matter\n* Better sleep\n* Come up with more and better ideas through increased creativity and clarity\n* Knowing yourself better and finding your true self\n* Ultimately, enlightenment\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is something that I could recommend to anyone. I'm not sure about ENTPs benefitting *the most* but they're really close to the top*.* For increasing your natural cognitive power, and the troubles ENTPs commonly have, it is a blast. If you can call breathing with your eyes closed for 20 minutes a day a blast.  \n\n\nHere is a comment I wrote (and now extended) for a fellow ENTP who wanted to process emotional baggage:  \nIf you want to practice emotional processing: explore, acknowledge, assess, let go. Be a perceiver, don't hang onto the feeling. If the feeling gets too heavy, rest. It is important to realize that nothing bad can happen to you by feeling things within yourself and with time this is the realization that will make you very strong and able to face any adversity in life.  \n\n\nThe goal of this non-goal that the act of meditating is, is to de-construct your ego so that eventually you can let all the thoughts be like clouds in the sky. And of course ultimately, enlightenment and transcendence of yourself. Good sleep is the basis for all human functions. If you don't sleep, your brain clogs up, literally. When we sleep, waste flushes out from the brain.  \n\n\n**Now that we know the basics, it's time to learn how to meditate!**  \n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Do not engage in meditation if you have psychotic tendencies or are in a psychotic state. Proceed at your own risk.\n\n  \nMeditation can be a lot of things. But in my book, there are primarily two types of meditation: Grasping, and letting go. Focus is basically grasping an item with your mind (telekinesis!), and observing is gently letting go of the thoughts in your mind. Both of these develop your attention muscle, but the former is a dedicated effort of maintaining deep focus on an item of thought or an external object, and not that suitable for extended periods of time. The feeling processing meditation described above was one type of grasping meditation. The latter one is more of a *relaxed attention returning practice*. It is the most known and basic form of meditation that will help you reap the overall benefits of long term practice.\n\n  \nThe meditation practice itself is very simple. You can start with clearing out any distractions and darkening the room you're in. Get into a comfortable sitting position on a chair or on the floor, legs crossed, hands in your lap, back straight, neck relaxed. Close your eyes and start to focus on your breathing. Just breathe naturally. Don't overdo it. Focus your senses on any aspect of the effects of the air as it flows back and forth. The sound, the feeling on your nose or your chest. Just observe and BE. Remember, meditation is effectively about learning a state of simply being, without any thoughts. When you notice your mind has wandered (and it will), come back to your breath. Simple as that!\n\n  \nStart with little, meditation is not a one time thing you can do for once on a Sunday for an hour and then forget it. For cumulative effects, you need to do cumulative work, and the more spread out it is, the better. Like with all learning practices, it is better to do it frequently and preferably spreading it out rather than doing a lot at once. Spreading out your 60 minutes throughout the week is a lot better than doing that 60 minutes on a sunday. Practicing will induce a surge of learning that will keep up the changing process up for a certain amount of time. The more frequently you practice, the more time there is for the change to happen. Pouring a large amount of water in the sand will still dry up pretty quickly, but if keep pouring tinier amounts of water it will stay wet for as long as you want. When sand is wet, you can build castles out of it. You want your sand to stay wet.\n\n  \nFurthermore, compound interest within the context of habit building is a thing. If you get a minute of mediation per day in the beginning to get started with the habit, that's awesome! It really adds up. I recommend not even going for more. If it feels difficult, don't exert yourself too much. This is not a race to the finish line.\n\n  \nTo reap the full benefits, you want to do 20 minutes of meditation or longer per day. It takes that much time to get to a proper meditative state. With practice, even less. But that takes years of meditating. Build your one minute habit little by little to up to 20 minutes each morning. If you can't do it in the morning, do it in the evening. Some people recommend 20 minutes morning and evening, but I think that's a bit excessive. Personally, I try to meditate every day for at least that 20 minutes (sometimes up to an hour or even more), but I have off days. Sometimes more than on days. For initiation to this practice, I did 20 minutes day and night for an entire year. Where did I found that kind of dedication, I have no idea. :D\n\n  \nAs always, I hope it helps, and all the best in your meditation journey. I'm looking forward for your feedback and experiences.  
1	The last person I knew who took meditation seriously was an INTP who wanted to become a cult leader.
0	What should i do	Hi entp .. going straight to the point..i there is this  guy which fine and cute ..so i know that he gana confess for me tomorrow...and im not sure how to deal with feeling...and this Valentine he had that hot amoky girlfriend don't know what happen and im really regular looking to be honest 😓 ....i hate feeling but he is cute
3	Is he ENTP? Or are you ENTP?
31	How long does it take for entp's to mature enough to not be the stereotypical ''narcissistic hyperactive jerks'' ?	I'm 18, in college and although I'm working on it (especially the narcissistic part), I'm still what you could call the stereotypical turbulent ENTP. Is it a personality thing or does it disappear with age for us?\n\n
42	I'm 23 and when I was your age I was for certain a textbook immature ENTP. It took me years to get to where I am now. I still believe its a work in progress. However do not be discouraged younger ENTP, we are naturally adept to self improve ourselves better than any type as far as I am concerned because we can look inward to ourselves introspectively and identify where our weak points are to fix them. Many other types take a lot longer to develop. However its my belief that ENTP are among the most under developed starting out and benefit the greatest from self improvement. 
14	I'm obsessed with self improvement, as are all ENTPs.\n\nThe trick is figuring out how to see being humble / sensitive / calm / stoic as a skill you can improve in.
24	I'm 40 this year, and I'm going to guess its dependent on a few things, but don't quote me on it.\n\n* Gender, women and men hit adult milestones at different ages\n\n* Life experience, some people get "schooled" sooner or later, having kids changes things, university etc.\n\n* Quality of friends and peers... good/healthy friends and peers are more apt to guide you in a gentle way through the hiccups of maturation\n
10	Narcisstic might never change, but for hyperactivity just wait for your twenty-something crisis or random depressions to kick in. Enjoy m8
5	I'm 33 and am just now becoming one. I'm just tired of the facade these days.
4	Never been a narcissistic jerk, and neither are most entps I know, so can't help you with that personal struggle. As for the hyperactive   part, it's a great strength, what my grandma used to call "people with nerve" and can be very advantageous.
4	I'm 52 in June and still working on it. I learned to use the sense of humor to curtail it, but it's always there.
4	Depends on the person. I'm in my late twenties and I'm starting to mellow down on said jerkiness. I still enjoy trolling friends though for my own amusement. Lol
8	Date an ENFJ like I do, and they won’t put up with that crap. They’ll whip you into shape. \n\nAlso, the higher your ambitions, the quicker you’ll learn that you’re nothing special, and there are much more capable people than you. You haven’t been anointed by God. You are not the chosen one. You’re not going to reach any amount of success in anything overnight. You can achieve a lot less than you think you can on your own. You are going to fail at something monumentally one day, and that will be a necessary lesson for you to learn to rely on others, and gain a healthy sense of self doubt. 
3	21 here. This is gonna be a little weird to say but from my experience, what really helped was watching drama tv series. Specifically Grey's anatomy. I noticed a very significant increase in my empathy & emotional intelligence after watching 8 or 9 seasons. I've never really been a narcissist, or maybe I was but my original sense of humour managed to hide that. But I'm pretty sure after watching that series + a lot of life experience I became very empathetic, tolerant and open-minded.
5	I know an exceptionally kind ENTP who is 30 and has his shit together like none else I know. I know another ENTP who is 28, still lives with his parents and blames everyone for his problems and is generally narcissistic jerk. Not sure when or how the maturing happens for ENTPs but it seems that some may never grow up. Just like person of any other type.
2	From your top 3 negative traits I suggest trying to be more perceiving when it comes to things instead being intolerant. Understand why things are, why people do the things they do, but don’t let that upset you. It’s hard because I’ve finally come out (for the most part) of my narcissistic shell but now I’m finding that with my overall increased happiness comes larger pitfalls when I do feel down. It’s about balance. **As all things should be
2	im 19, i used to be narcissistic, but am no longer, i definitely am still hyperactive but thats partly due to ADHD, and i dont think im much of a jerk
2	As horrible as it might seem.....I quit doing everything except Working, Food, Videogames. I quit doing everything else. Because of that, I broke almost all my bad habits...and good habits. While that might seem like a horrible idea and a huge risk, it worked out since now I'm starting to build back good beneficial habbits. While I still suffer from working a horrible job and waste time gaming, I wake up happy to have broke the horrible habits I originally had from my retarded experience with High School ;_; \n\nYou are going to have to work REALLY hard on self improvement if you truly do care about your future and potential in life. You can sit there and read these words and either take them and run or ignore me and everyone else and continue with your current lifestyle. \nBest of luck hippie!!! :D
2	Im 17 and I would consider myself 'healthy' or 'mature'. Whatever
2	A lot of factors play a key role in this. Being southeast asian, there's a sibling hierarchy in my family and being the first born, I have to mature earlier than my siblings. As the first born, it is demanded of you to be responsible and sensible. Also, I was born to a lower middle class family in a 3rd world country so life isn't exactly fine and dandy. Once you are marked as a threat, you can be killed as easily by criminals and policemen alike. 
2	I've become jaded in my middle age after years of turbulence. I think I purposefully cultivated incredibly intense experiences growing up, in order to dull myself. It has worked for the most part, but I am still prone to fits of indignant rage or general fuckery every now and then. Maybe by the time I'm 50 I'll make better progress! I'd say, focus on not hurting others and the rest will fall in line eventually. 
2	It might never disappear at all.\n\nIf you're aware of it, you can work to improve it. Self improvement isn't free. The good thing is, it's very rewarding.\n\nHalf of the battle is recognizing your negative traits. Now you have to put in the work to incrementally improve them.\n\nCan you tell me your top three negative traits? 
2	I don’t think I was ever this exactly. Though there was a time I was a self-destructive, rebellious, hedonistic, ne’er-do-well provocateur with an intense contempt for authority who systematically burned any bridge I had. That was fun for me and all involved! I guess that could be likened to being a jerk - but a narcissist I was not. Nor am I now. \n\nI’d say, I “matured” once I realized my way of being was holding me back from the things I wanted, both in terms of relationships, and in succeeding at life. There’s only so long you can point the finger at the rest of the world for not getting you before you realize maybe the problem is actually yourself.

1	When you fall in love.\n\nFe takes over and you start focusing a lot on that person .\n\nThen you do the same with your closest friends. (Later on)\n\n
1	I’m 19, and i’ve improoved a lot. I’m on a gap year, partially for this reason, and I think it’s helped a lot. At this age, i think it’s more about effort put in than time. You would probably (maybe) still mature over time, even if you put bo effort in, but making a concious effort definetly helps and accelerates the process
1	30 for me. I mellowed out hardcore. I just don't care what people think, but not in an asshole way. I'm very stoic and calm nowadays. I just turn it up when everyone else sucks and can't get shit done. 
1	Just become an insecure hyperactive weirdo. It worked for me!
1	I'm 35 this year. :)
1	I'm 24. Starting to mature around this age but not quite there yet.\n\nSo I would say anywhere between age 25-30, to stop being the stereotypical narcissistic hyperactive jerk.
1	Late twenties I think. I'm 26 and less of a narcissistic hyperactive jerk than a year ago, yet sometimes I can be pretty harsh. :/ So I think ENTPs mature later, maybe at late twenties / around 30.
1	I wasn't ever really that... I'm consistently a strong ENTP, so we can come in many shapes 
1	When i was 18 i was living at the gym, taking steroids, doing drugs at rave parties, cocky attitude. Now im 23y old and is nothing like that at all. I would say after 21y the maturity starts to esculate for real. Did for me atleast.\n\n:)

1	Never, it's always there and I turn it on as a defense mechanism when needed. I can't handle alot of social juggling like ENFP, at times I get overwhelmed and too popular, being mature is predictable, predictable is lack of autonomy and has a tactical disadvantage, especially when it's easier to allow people to think you're a narcissistic jerk and enviously glare from a distance while they exalt..ahem I mean exile you, then try bait you back into running with the cool kids \*cough\*  My pride is reserved for brothers and those I see as adversarial friendlies, and when I decide someone isn't worth my time or is knowingly betraying our understanding, I can be brutal about it refusing to cater my image or behavior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf a best friend whom I considers family starts to rally against this jerk I am, or encourages others too... I will stubbornly dialect the notions away then enact a disappearance whilst I continue my own business/life with them not included.. I detach/fade away, but they hear n see thing things I do.\n\nTHEY ALWAYS COME BACK APOLOGIZING and/or forgiving and wishing me back into their life, as most trusted evil adviser.

14	What's a mature ENTP like from your perspective?	We are aware of the stereotypical ENTP behavior and a big chunk of them are unhealthy and underdeveloped. The older I get, the more I find myself being able to fix or control those unhealthy traits. So, what is a well put together and evolved ENTP to you?
20	[deleted]
7	Not me. 
12	> We are aware of the stereotypical ENTP behavior and a big chunk of them are unhealthy and underdeveloped.\n\nPet peeve time.\n\nThe stereotype of ENTP behavior is fixed by what the theory says it should be. It’s *by definition* mature because the theory isn’t a model of adolescent personality or behavior.  **There are no healthy nor unhealthy traits**.  There are just traits.  But there are individuals who may use any given train in an immature or mature way — but they are not the exemplar of “the ENTP”.   The ENTP is a Platonic ideal, a fiction of the theory, and any individual may or may not match it closely at any given time.  It’s your long term pattern of behavior that types you, \n\nIf people fail to match the stereotypical description of an ENTP, as Intuitional Thinkers, then they are either *not-typable* in the context of the theory (because of youth or mental illness like ADHD)  or they are mistypes. \n\nNo, you’re not an ENTP with “high Fe”, you’re a Feeler.     \nNo, you’re not an ENTP who isn’t into “theory crap”, you’re a Sensor.     \nNo, you’re not an ENTP who can’t manage to read more than 200 words, you’re a Millennial.   \nNo, you’re not an ENTP who can’t manage to accomplish anything, or follow through, or focus, or pay attention — you have ADHD.   \nNo, you’re not an ENTP who’s really a lot more sociable and loves to be around people and feels the need to get out and seize the day — you’re an ESFP.   \n\nIf you’re a weirdo-nerd who’d  sit around for hours talking about the theological implications if cats were dogs and dogs were cats, then you might be an ENTP.\n\nIf you just think you might like to do that, you’re probably an ESFP.\n\nIf you *actually started* to think about that, you might be an ENTP.\n
6	I dated a 45 year old ENTP last year. He’s mostly responsible, very intelligent, smiley, encouraging, helpful, warm, a great Dad, funnnn af, has his shit mostly together, and is always 2 steps ahead of almost every one else. He’s a manager at a super successful construction company in SoCal, makes a ton of money and enjoys working at different locations and sites around the LA area. He’s not argumentative but he definitely gets annoyed about feelings and emotions. I rely heavily on my Ne and Te rather than my Fi and we got along great, but as two Ne users, we kinda got bored of each other quickly. 
2	The biggest factor for me was the development AND appreciation for empathy. I was always a capable manipulator but didn't realize how to utilize that to help people instead of just get my way all the time at others expense. Once I started practicing empathy, the rest came behind it pretty neatly. That's not to say I feel like I have a good handle on everything in life, but I have a lot of meaningful personal connections and I think that's a valuable measure of success in maturity.
2	A fictional example I can think of is jake the dog from adventure time.

1	Perfectly balanced 
1	From my perspective probably boring. 
1	Why ask? I was going to type something about functions, but it doesn't seem like what you're looking for... I'm not even sure what unhealthy or underdeveloped traits you are referring to... (The fact that you are able to fix or control them isn't exactly a great hint...)
1	> So, what is a well put together and evolved ENTP to you? \n\nChoosing your battles.\n\n&#x200B;
6	Survey on personality and Flirting	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
3	Don’t bother doing this if you are not an American
1	I just took it.  You asked my sexuality (gay) but then had questions about my attraction to the opposite sex.  I think you meant to say the sex that I’m attracted to or something along those lines so I answered as if that was what you had asked
11	I get both ENTP and ENFP	As title says, I’ve gotten both.\n\nUsed to be primarily ENFP, but after my depression knocked me down and I started meds, I came up as ENTP.\n\nJust took the similarminds test and got ENFP again.\n\nIs it possible to just be fairly borderline between the two?\n\nEdit: Something someone said made me re-read my statement about depression.\n\nTo clarify, I had depression for quite a long time due to abuse throughout my childhood/teenage years, and got ENFP consistently during that time.\n\nHowever, once the depression had reached an incredible low and I caved and finally got medication and therapy, I started to test as an ENTP.
9	> Is it possible to just be fairly borderline between the two?\n\nNo, they have different function stacks. \n\nENTPs use Extraverted Intuition, **Introverted Thinking, Extraverted Feeling,** and Introverted Sensing.\n\nENFPs use Extraverted Intuition, **Introverted Feeling, Extraverted Thinking,** and Introverted Sensing.\n\nYou can't spontaneously switch from using Fi and Te to using Ti and Fe. :) They work very differently.
7	A super easy way to differentiate the two types is the tertiary function as its inverse is a tad bit underused. Let me explain:\n\nENFP 3rd function is Te with an inverse of Ti in the 7th function\n\nENTP 3rd function is Fe with an inverse of Fi in the 7th function\n\nThe 7th function goes by many names but ultimately it's the weakest of all the functions, one might not even be aware they have it.\n\nNow, one needs to know that without an introverted and extroverted function, per Jung's descriptions, a very noticeable imbalance occurs. The ENFP will throw everything on Te while the ENTP the Fe.\n\nHow this manifests:\n\nENFP Te: Te is responsible for using the best known methods, it's trusting noteworthy other's methods, facts, ideas, over one's own; it's focused on what does work instead of coming to truth by means of knowing what does not work(Ti). It's relies on evidence, solid evidence, found in the outside world due to its extroverted nature. A very particular trait occurs given this lack of trusting in the self(Ti) in regards to thinking: an ENFP will often times believe they are stupid. By definition, they are using the best methods, the most noteworthy techniques, trusting the facts, so when failure inevitably shows up they have only themselves to blame; if it worked for others, if everyone else understands, than "I guess I'm the problem- I'm the dumb one." An ENTP might doubt themselves at times, but they would not have this characteristic.\n\nENTP Fe: Fe is of a similar accord, it's understanding what other people like, it's using the best known methods in order to achieve results, like Te, but in regards to people. It's reading through comments on various topics, threads, and videos to get people's thoughts on whatever matter; ultimately it builds up an understanding of what people like or don't like about various things; it works in a similar way that Te does, it's trusting in what others are saying instead of the self- but in regards to feeling, likes/dislikes, the abstract(Thinking is the concrete, and feeling falls under anything that cannot be defined.) Now, a particular trait that every ENTP shares is their belief that arguably anything they say is interesting and will be well received by others, but are then confused to find that people turn away from them. If one accounted for others in the things that they do, the best methods in regards to others, just like Te, than how did one fail? It can lead to an ENTP being the person everyone likes, but the person they like is not them since their self, their Fi, was never in the equation to begin with. I don't have as many concrete descriptions of this phenomena as I have an ENFP sister so I'm more familiar with them.\n\nIf you fall into one of these two categories, think back on your life and wonder if that has ever changed; if not than let that be a determinant that these functions are concrete and cannot be prone to borderline characteristics.\n\n**Don't bother reading the rest if you already have an answer.**\n\nOne more example though would be how both types oversimplify things since they would lack the function that complicates things(Introversion), they see only the superfluous, a truth based on locality:\n\nENTP Fe: believes MBTI is bullshit as their understanding of others is based on locality, always finding something new, can't readily believe that the abstraction of people can be concrete.\n\nENFP Te: believes anything is possible in regards to how the world works, infinite possibilities since there is nothing from the self that is telling them that how things work is not extroverted. They can commonly believe themselves to be among the most objective of people in regards to facts and evidence(but then of course the whole failure thing shows up again)\n\n&#x200B;
3	I don’t think MBTI takes into account mental illness so you won’t get accurate results if you’re suffering, you’re probably just an ENFP
2	I'm in the same boat as you, buddy.
1	Maybe but usually entps dont use one of the main region that Fi types use lots.   \n  \nDo you find you pay attention to the specific words that someone uses to them to figure out what they mean?  \n  \nSo you tend to have a good sense of what peoples values are?  \n
1	You’re most likely an enfp then.   It’s far more typical for a Feeler to only see their rational side (and mistype as thinker) than for a Thinker to imagine themselves as people centric (as that’s what the tests usually measure).
1	You answered your own question. You are an ENFP, but your "depression" has made you try and be different to protect yourself.
7	Interested in the discussion on consciousness?	
1	Im down to talk about it. I would skim this video if you want me to but im tired of hearing dudes have verbose ideas that dont encompass the issue.  \n  \nIf i have to hear 'species specific' one more time...
2	This is fucking awesome xD	I figured fellow ENTPs will enjoy [this...](https://youtu.be/gX_TxKa0dCY)\n\nwell i did anyways...\n\n
0	Wanna join our discord
58	Re-did the Myers Briggs after not really properly redoing it since high school, maybe 17-18 years old. I’m now 21. Before, I was as INFP, low assert. I had social anxiety and undiagnosed clinical depression. When I was 20 I was put on antidepressants. Maybe it’s a combo of meds + life experience...	
54	That website is kinda janky imo. Tests you on letter preferences and not functions. \n\nGo try the jungian functions test on similarminds.com then go to cognitiveprocesses.com and familiarize yourself with the functions. You'll be able to tell if its right or not.
11	That’s funny. I was an ENTP in high school, then was diagnosed with depression in college along with anxiety. Retook the test and I’m now an INFP. If you don’t mind me asking, what kind of antidepressants did they put you on and did they help much?
7	You just have to keep taking the test until you get a good one!
19	I'm personally of the belief that you are born with your type and you don't switch off feelings and end up more logical but rather u get healthier and it shows in your cognitive functions. \n\nI think you should read up on the cognitive functions and determine which ones suit you the best. 
5	I would read up on the functions. Try https://sakinorva.net/functions or any other test that measures the functions (NeNiSeSiFeFiTeTi) rather than the preferences (EINSFTPJ). It's also possible you've gained self awareness.
5	This subreddit is becoming a cringe circle jerk at this point. I get typing as an ENTP, but fuck me. 
9	Also I’m high, so ignore the weird English. 
4	That test is weird and inaccurate.   \n\nFunction wise, I am an ENTP. \n\nI type as INFP all the time on that test though.  
2	Some background, I was ENFP in high-school, got tired of being manipulated all the time, made efforts to shut down my feeling side and process everything mentally so as to not be manipulable anymore, and I think that's why I'm an ENTP now. The feelings got to be too much, so to speak.\n\nThat said, my "E" was not actually an E, it was right in the middle, and my teacher said to just pick one. xD So maybe I could have been considered an I, if i hadn't been so hateful of my home that school was an exciting refuge that allowed me to make friends who didn't slam me into walls and call me a little asshole. So maybe we have the same progression. I don't know.\n\nSomething I've learned recently is that ENTP's inferior function is the ability to handle their feels. When it gets overwhelming, they shut down, lock-out, and become (so to speak) introverted, like they behave as such.\n\nHope this bit helps you find your answers. Any questions about me, my life, I don't mind answering, maybe you'll help me learn something about myself. \n\n24, was 16-17 for the first test. 
2	I was last year INTP since I just started then in a new class with new classmates, I was shy as hell first but now I can be easily the most talkative person in our class.
2	Congrats went from crazy guy with feelings to crazy guy who doesn't care about life and is only here to seek the truth behind it.
2	Maybe mbti doesn’t really mean anything 
2	Jesus, I barely understood what you just wrote. \n\nListen man, instead of talking about your MTBI testing, let’s talk about shit that’s actually engaging and thought provoking. This subreddit has be nothing but people talking or asking whether their typologies are in fact correct or “Hey I retested and I’m an ENTP now yay!!!!” \n\nLife is but a dream full of misery. Everyone is depressed and has social anxiety in some form. I believe you keep re taking this test to in someway strengthen or justify the way you are. It’s not the way you should look at MTBI. 
2	Don't look too much into the tests. They're not the end-all-be-all of MBTI. Two people can take the test in different moods and type differently. Read the descriptions. If one of them screams "WOW, THAT'S TOTALLY ME" go with that one.\n\nIt's also important that the MBTI is about what is most effortless for you to do. They don't CARE if you CAN remember an extensive list when going shopping. They want to know if it's effortless for you to do so. They don't want to know if you ONCE OR TWICE have deduced the plot twist before it happened, they want to know if it's effortless to do so.\n\nMBTI is about how your brain is wired. what's the shortest neural path?
2	Or maybe its because the myers brigs is an outdated with little scientific background that can change depending on your mood that day among other related things. 
1	I found the MBTI in my mid 20s.  Was married, but the relationship was not healthy.  I routinely tested INFP.  After getting a diagnosis for a mental health issue and proper meds, and getting out of the marriage, I've tested ENTP...which is what I resembled a lot before my marriage.  
1	I worked at an amazing video game company for nearly ten years in management and they had us regularly take classes to improve ourselves to become better leaders. My Meyers Briggs and DISC profiles changed over the years but the tests we took were far more involved than these online tests, because people will literally lie about themselves to get a result they wish they were. I remember taking one course for nearly an entire semester at a nearby college and after answering hundreds of questions they were able to ascertain our baseline behavior at home and how we acted at work. Everyone should have some "flex" where maybe they're not that high of a D (in the DISC profile) at home but they're higher at work because they have to manage people. There were two guys who flexed far too hard into the D and I portions and everyone could tell because they were nearly bipolar and incredibly stressed. \n\nPoint I'm trying to make, these online tests are mostly bullshit and you're only ever going to get an accurate-ish result if you're 100% honest with yourself and your weaknesses. 
1	I took every test mentioned in this post/comments and got ENTP every time.  My results were consistent and I'm curious how others get different results or are willing to state that one of these tests is better than another.
1	I took the test in college 30 years ago - entp. So much has changed since then and I feel like a completely different person. Took the test a couple years ago - entp. 
1	4 years ago I used to be a INTJ. Now I'm a ENTP. My personal belief is that an ENTP is just an extroverted INTJ and vice versa.
1	Agree that this website is inferior to similar minds\n\nBut I definitely believe an INTP can be mixed up with ENTP and vise versa. Their **functions** line up yet are rearranged.\n\n There are interesting differences-\n\nI jokingly said an ENTP spends less time on the details and takes a line of coke for external energy before jumping into the frying pan. \n\nThere is also less of a sense of consistency in ENTPs and while intps can act flimsy when they should be bold or can be socially inept, they are much less prone to the frequent, silly hiccups. \n\nCongrats. 
4	Debate help	Hello fellow ENTP'S, \n\nI am in need of your assistance. The previous day I entered a debate chat room to see if I could debate but I was banned before I could really make any counter arguements (total of 12 hours in chat). Simply because I made statements  that were quick-wit pessimistic responses to absurd claims (total: 3 sentence text). Because I was not In agreement to their claims the admins found it neccessary to ban me from the chat room. On the grounds that they can "never play defense when posing an argument in direct bad faith". They linked this youtube link https://youtu.be/wmVkJvieaOA\nAnd said this is why we banned you. I myself looked at the link and seen it was absurd illegitimate response to not engage in debate/dialogue. To suggest quick short statement responses with counterpoints in dissagreement claims are only taking a offensive play and not defensive. I was under the impression debate naturally had offensive and defensive exchanges either way. So in essence this was nothing more than a excuse to not engage in debate/dialogue. \n\nSo I am only making the proposition if you wish to help to watch the YouTube link above and give me points and/or counterpoints to the arguement. I am only looking improve in debate/dialectic abilities to make more better sound arguements. With your help I can refine it to increase my validation. 
3	They didn't ban you because you disagreed. They banned you because you suck at debating and making your points. So if you want to, as you say, improve your debate/dialectic abilities, stop twisting opposing arguments. It's easy to knock down a strawman. But it requires actual knowledge to tear down a steelman argument. \n\nI'm not going to go through that YouTube video and do the mental lifting for you.

4	Human capacity	So I‘ve had a weird chain of thought the other day - which resulted in a weird conclusion. If this was already disproven by science, please tell me so. If not, discuss.\n\nHuman eye: If we look up for a while, the eye feels strained. If someone who doesn‘t do much sports lifts their arm and holds it in that position for a while, the muscles will get strained.\n\nSo imagine, if the human eye‘s default position would be looking down. For a person who permanently looks down, looking straight would be straining to the eye. That means what we do most often gets comfortable to us. Which then again means, what we didn‘t do yet is difficult - precisely because we didn‘t do it yet.\n\nSo my question/thought is, does the human body have the capacity to do more, and we‘re only utilizing it to a certain extent for now? Meaning would we evolve in a thousand years by learning how to make better use of our body?\n\nIf our capacity would be 100%, and we would only be using 80%, then by training would we evolve more and fully utilize all functions our body enables us to do?\n\nLet‘s say, if the human eye has 20 muscles. But we‘re most of the time using only 10 for looking straight. 15 would be looking up. And for the remaining 5, let‘s say the eyes would have muscles that *theoretically* enable us to move our eyes by 360 degrees horizontally and vertically. Do we have any muscles that would enable us to do crazy things theoretically, but in practice we don‘t know/ cannot use them (yet)?\n\nMeaning that once we learn how to use our body 100%, we might be able to do crazy things with it.\n\nFeel free to ask me questions. It was hard to express my thoughts. What are your opinions? Is there anything about such a phenomena in science already?
7	There’s a similar phenomenon in MBTI where Fi users strain to use Ti.

1	Interesting sidenote is that the composition of the atmosphere and air we breathe directly impact our brain capacity and function.\n\nWith the amount of extra co2 in the air we have decreased the thinking power of thr entire human species by a significant %\n\nYouTuber Tom Scott has a good video on this but I'm on mobile and lazy
3	not sure what type i am now	so I've always scored ENTP on myers briggs but because of a suggestion i tried the Jungian functions test. it said my type was unclear what do these results mean in relation to myers briggs? I see I have introverted everything except intuition but I've always thought of myself as a extrovert. anyway any explanation is appreciated. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/8jsw7yym3ai21.png
5	The test was fine, I've seen that test a few times and it seems to work really well.  \n\nYou probably got inconclusive because your Fi and Ti are on par with each other, which should not really be the case.  You should try to sort that out.  It's also strange that you have such a high Ni percentage.  \n\nFrom the tests I've seen, ENTPs score incredibly low on Fi. But your test results are too scattered to glean much from.  Perhaps someone else with better knowledge can help you.
4	It means you didn’t answer the questions aligned with the expectations of the test makers.   \n\nThere’s really nothing to interpret.\n\nTry a different test, or answer the questions with more thought.
0	I would reccomend taking the test on a more reputable website. The numbers don't tally to 100%, so I have my suspicions.\nRegardless, mbti is only a vague description of personal tendencies and the human psyche is too complex to be described as a simple test result, so don't worry too much about it :)
3	Opinions about traveling, sightseeing etc	I don't enjoy what I see.\n\nYou know, I'm too separate from my physical surroundings. I really don't enjoy it when I'm at a beautiful seaside at spring, or when I'm listening street musicians, or when I go to bookshops and JUST looking at old books -you know, bookshops are great when you have someone to talk to- \n\nI don't enjoy anything about my physical surroundings, I think. \n\n(In addition, its hard for me to watch something too because my thoughts ramble around without stopping.)
5	Honestly, this sounds like depression, not a personality thing.
3	I feel like I enjoy it less than most people too. I will realize that something is supposed to be very beautiful but my subjective enjoyment of it is often pretty underwhelming. Maybe because ENTPs are more attracted to ideas and novelty? 
79	Debate vs. Dialectic	Random thought.\n\n ENTPs are supposedly the great debaters, but I've noticed that as I've matured I tend towards dialectic engagement. Dialectic as in "the art of investigating or discussing the truth of opinions"\n\nDialectic also seems to fit the ENTP function stack description better. \n
42	Definitely. Debate is more of an NJ thing imo. In a debate you're trying to convince the other or some third party that you're right. You've already arrived at what you consider the truth (which better be *the* truth). Dialectics on the other hand isn't really competitive and less focused on rhetoric.
29	Agreed. Our 'debating' is more of a means to interrogate a topic to its depth so we can understand its limits and other aspects of it. \n\nLike, if I'm not comfortable with my experience in an area or I'm with someone with clearly greater knowledge in that realm - I'll ask their opinion, they're the most immediate expert. Their opinion will start off as the foundation of my views, but I'll begin 'poking holes' in it to improve my understanding of it. 
12	Yeah, and dialectic is also much more useful for gathering information.  Once you've examined a topic for any length of time (or really, just spoken to enough people) it's really easy to filter out the extraneous details and glean insight from a conversation that would have otherwise been perceived as a confrontation by the other party.  \n\nDismissing someone's argument (or pointing out flawed logic) is better done in one's own head.  Unless it's a topic that is really important to you, and you know the person has an open-mind, debates just get tiring and rarely change anyone's mind.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, I like watching debates.  I love debating with my good friends who I know can handle it.  But even with some of them, a dialectic approach seems to result in more changed opinions, as long as you're willing to bring the other person on the journey with you, and at least appear to have an open mind.  \n\nSometimes it's ok to just do a mental eye-roll when someone says "Yeah, but those guys aren't REAL Christians" rather than explode into rapid-fire questions you know the guy doesn't have an answer for.   Ask the questions someone can actually answer.
8	I prefer the phrase "building on top of each other's ideas" as opposed to "demolish the other's ideas".
6	People don't understand the difference and think you're just trying to win the argument. 
5	If you're a good dialectician you're a good debater, but not vice versa. Although debate is a contest of views and dialectic shouldn't involve a position on your part, so if you have a particular view that you want to recognized as true by others or are otherwise invested in then dialectic won't be so fulfilling.\n\nThat said... Entp's are characterized as flexible in their views, and even when debating are usually just interested in examining the parts. Defending a view out of personal investment for the view is an extension of the sort of moralism entp's are unlikely to have
4	The problem with dialectic is that not all opinion holders are equal.  Entering into dialog with people who don’t know what they’re talking about (but think they do) just becomes an *argument*, as Ti relentlessly pushes for the truth against their mistakes.\n\nIf the other person is more/less knowledgeable, and aware of their limits, then it becomes a teacher/student exchange which is beneficial to both.  \n\nBut true dialectic (outside of didactic leading questions) is for peers. 
3	AGREED.\n\nI tend to use the term "debate" instead of "dialectic" for people who don't know what dialectic is... but yeah, I definitely prefer exploring ideas to advocating for my view.
3	I respect dialectic engagement. no bs.
3	I once posted about the very same thing on r/mbti.
3	Yep. Debate seems to be what other types label our discussions as because we don't just nod and agree.
2	I’m a Marxist also, I’ve recently been engaged in dialectical conversations as I’ve become more educated, just 2 years ago I’d debate people and all it did was  reinforce my own uneducated ideology and pushed those who I’d like to see my perspective further away, the only thing that debate did that was constructive was when there was other people watching the debate, they were always the people that came away from watching another and I debate with a more educated perspective. 
2	I agree 💯. We discuss to discover connections and to test our own analysis, and to find very subtle clues to a bigger problem. We don't very easily attach to an any single idea. Which in a debate you kind of have to. We stir  the pot and bring thing's to the surface and new perspectives to an old debate. In fact an ENTP is likely to change his mind in the debate or even force us to dig deeper for connections. I think that this in particular has a way of irritating others. Why would we want to be chained to particular perspectives. We don't do well in echo chambers. We want to challenge others to fine tune, if need be, what we understand to be correct. We like competency and to make sure our ideas are fully tested.
2	FP's and FJ's still interpret dialect as debate (arguments) no matter what IME, the only thing you can do is subtly inject humor and sarcasm in your flow while playing the fool, to make them follow in and remark into the (dialectic you have probably thought. about alot or researched for years) discussion accordingly, making them come to a conclusion or new question before getting conflicted and frustrated at the "arguing"...then we deliver the punchline (simplified shortened for them)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe cheek of them, often they believe truth and honestly isn't allowed to interject in a social setting if it causes dialect of a serious nature or if it gives someone a tarnished or imperfect image. Makes me so annoyed when they try take advantage of this, then end up shocked we spoke up and didn't give a shit if we are perceived as "negative"(Sometimes standing your own and adhering to principles demands such reaction)
1	I agree 100% debate is just an occasional symptom of fleshing out ideas which is what I really enjoy 
1	I don't think we are living in a Utopia of either.\n\nIt's a heavy blend because both have their merits and uses.
1	I agree with this. I seek to have dialectic and come to an agreement about said topic rather than to debate or argue. I think that it’s the young immature ENTP that is very argumentative because Fe hasn’t been matured yet. I’m getting to the place now where I’ll state that I’m not necessarily trying to argue but rather attempting to offer and/or argue a counter point so we end up with an answer that is more “correct.” 
1	I see it as a sophist-philosophy distinction and wholeheartedly agree

13	In dating, how much weight do you guy put on looks?	Aesthetics, skin, overweight, etc. I'm an Entp (more misanthropic side haha) female and gotta say, I like a healthy lookin' dude--but I'm always weary of anybody *too polished* looking for they tend to be the ones who are the hardest to deal with, with varying levels of overcompensation for insecurity etc etc\n\nThank you and have a nice day\n
16	150lbs of weight on looks I find is about the right quantity. Any more than that and your date becomes too top heavy and is susceptible to tipping over at any point. \n\nEdit: on a serious note I think that finding someone attractive is important, but if someone isn’t stunning but has a winning personality and can hold a conversation and my interest, I can find them a lot more attractive than an idiot who’s smoking hot but a bit dim. 
12	I don’t care that much honestly. I have preferences, but if I like your personality then your looks are irrelevant to me. Attractiveness is simply a bonus. 
9	I don’t like 10s, I don’t like 5s, I like 6-8s. They look nice, aren’t too self absorbed, hard working since they’re not good looking enough just to have life handed to them. Yeah, that’s the sweet spot. 
9	None at all. They just gotta be INFJ. \n\n/s
6	Everything is relative.  Do they have a shit ton to offer in another category?  If so, there's more wiggle room on looks.  Are they dumb as a doornail and boring af, etc?  They better be a supermodel.   \n  \nAlso, context and competition matter.  Are we talking about perusing the bar for a one night hookup?  They just have to be better than everyone else *that night*.   Are we talking about someone to actually date?  Totally different set of characteristics.  \n  \nOr are we talking about someone we picture ourselves delivering a eulogy for after 50 years of marriage, 12 grandkids, and a lifetime of memories?  That's someone else altogether.
4	I will gladly and happily  date a 3 if they have an 8 brain, and I honestly rather have someone low maintainence. My last bf was an absolute gorgeous simpleton, I realised I don't really want that again.... He can be 300lbs and drape himself in velvet as long as he reads.
9	It's basically a deal breaker. I'm a powerlifter. That means I'm stronger than those gym bros with eight packs. I put a fair amount of work into making sure I have a nice looking body. \n\nMy motto is: I don't hold any potential partner to higher standards than I hold myself... I just happen to have amazingly high standards for myself
6	As long he or she weighs < 3 pounds im fine with that.
3	Personally i care about aesthetics. I got my own taste and my taste is not what‘s considered „handsome“ by society. But i‘d want my date to be according to my taste. Most important than anything is fashion for me. If i don‘t like someone‘s sense of fashion, i wouldn‘t get into them. Weird but real\n\nI also don‘t like tall, muscular, big and manly guys. I like feminine and skinny guys. I want a guy to be similar to me. And feel like a friend. But all of that won‘t work if the person‘s mindset is not similar to mine. That‘s why i struggle being interested in people for more than a few weeks. I would say it‘s 3rd priority. 1st being mindset, 2nd being interests.
3	Neat. I prefer neat looking types. If they are not neat with their appearance or their manners, I'll drop their. My mysophobic tendencies will not be able to handle them. I don't care about most things just if they look neat and take care of themselves, then I don't mind. 
2	Looks matter but, heck, being an interesting person matters much much more to me. I've had cute boring smart girls and hot boring and dumb girls. Unless you are an actual interesting human being then long term stuff is not going to happen. \nIf you are an interesting person and have 6-8 looks then that's extra bonus points.\nIf I can't see their faces because of the makeup on top then that's a no go.\n
2	I value them really highly tbh, it may be shallow but if I’m not super attracted to someone I don’t want to be with them and my standards are high
2	I want a mental connection above all.\n\nSure, there are some that I think are prettier than others.\n\nBut talking to an intelligent woman with a wickedly dark and sardonic wit and a gentle heart of gold.. \n\nThats what I want.\n\nLooks don't matter to me that much, I don't really feel intimidated by them in either direction.\n\n
2	Since I'm a *naturally* funny person, he needs to have a nice smile :) 
1	I have definite preferences for looks, but they do not take priority in the least in potential partners as a must.\nSure I like big asses with thick thighs and a pretty face... But I've met countless non "traditionally beautiful" girls that may be too short, thin, fat, ugly for most dudes who have intellect through the roof, an amazing sense of humor with great back and forth who i absolutely melted for before. No looks can hold a candle to intelligence, good sense of humor and a sweet heart of compassion. To me. But Tig ol bitties and a phat ass would be great too.
1	I'm only put off by things dudes have a choice about, like their grooming and clothing. I'm physically attracted to a certain height, build, and coloring but that rarely coincides with dudes I end up in relationships with. 
1	I think if she's sweet I'd give her a chance if I'm somewhat attracted to her. 
1	Looks is how I pick a girl. The everything else determines if they stick around. Well, mostly. I'm not going to be able to fuck you with a slack cock, so you've gotta maintain some sort of human shape if you want to inspire any level of *turgidity* in the long term. I'm not super picky, I just have to know that if crime scene investigators  drew a chalk outline around your body, I would actually recognize that a murder had taken place, and not think that I was on a construction site, or in a Wicca circle, *or* playing hopscotch.
1	I put a high amount of weight on looks.\n\nHit the fucking gym and go on 2 mile walks everyday, please.\n\nThank you for saving humanity.
1	I go for what I want to breed with, as long as I can still get it up.
6	I heard you like INFJs	
19	Anyone want to live their entire life like they are in college?	I was thinking about the ideal lifestyle. Yes, I would have a job but onky work 8 hours per day max. \n\nThen I would have a short commute and spend all my time partying, gaming, and hanging out with friends.\n\nThis isn't actually as non-feasible as it sounds. And once you retire it just gets even better from there.\n\nI don't understand why people want big promotions, kids, and other life altering responsibilties. \n\nCurrently am 27 and loving this lifestyle. While a lot of others I know cry about their mountain of self inflicted responsibilties I just live. Why is this sort of lifestyle so "rare"?
17	Responsibilities mean a more meaningful existence. Pleasure seekers, or hedonistic people, typically do not have very meaningful lives. Sure, partying and taking drugs is fun, but it doesn't have as deep a connection as raising a family. 
18	>Why is this sort of lifestyle so "rare"?\n\nBecause you're not following the Life Script^(TM) invented by SFJs. 
8	Yes... but not for that parting and gaming and hanging out. \n\nI really loved University because I loved academia and studying. I loved dedicating my time to reading social theory, discussing and debating ideas in classes, writing, attending lectures on interesting topics, etc. My professors noted my enjoyment of it and gave me a lot of freedom to construct my own essay questions and research topics, and I took six courses a semester plus summer intensives, often abroad. It was amazing. If I could I’d be a student for life.\n\nNow, that doesn’t mean I didn’t also have a social life. My friends used to complain that we’d all be out until 4am but I still somehow got my work done. That’s because I made having fun contingent upon completing work, and also because I genuinely loved what I studied. 
4	Yes. I do. And that's why, at 36, I have my own (web design) business. I work less than eight hours a day... and I get to change locations all the time (coffee shops, my house, other states)... and I'm getting a lot of work lately, some of which I outsource.\n\nI only want a house if I can build it inexpensively (like a container home where the biggest expense is building materials... $80k tops). Ideally, even the house would start paying for itself since I want to Airbnb out a room.\n\nMy whole goal is to build an enjoyable, inexpensive, independent lifestyle for myself... so far, so good. Fuck the "American Dream".
4	Honestly, this sounds like a question that someone who peaked in highschool would ask.\n\nIt depends what kind of college experience you had and what kind adulting you're doing. I worked every break and graduated with loans. Now I don't really worry about money, have much more free time, can take international vacations and still only have a short walking commute. For me, life has gotten incrementally better every year.
4	Hell no. I was broke in college. Now I make a damn good amount for a single man and have enough money to do almost anything I want to do without worrying about paying my bills. Fuck college. I'm literally doing all the shit I dreamed of doing in college, plus i have money lol. I'd never go back to that lifestyle 
2	My son was an oops baby when I was in college and it gave my life meaning I didn’t know it was lacking.  The day to day practical aspects of raising kids is way harder for me than it appears to be for most others, and I don’t always have the emotional availability I should, and sometimes I just want to do my own thing without the responsibility of taking care of kids.  But overall kids are fun (when they’re you’re own) when they aren’t being little shitheads.  You are kind of forced to play with toys and games and read books and I can’t complain about that.\n\nAfter 7 years in college I just wanted to stay in college, so that I could be a pro student and continue learning without the responsibilities of a real job.  I’d be fine with that now ten years later, though I must say I enjoy some of the clout and experience I’ve accumulated from working in one field for 10 years.  I do however think that my personality and probably ENTPs in general flourish best when we have time and freedom to fully explore whatever gets our creative juices flowing rather than being stuck in an environment of another’s design or with endless responsibilities.
4	You could become hippy yes. But in my experience eventually even they grow up and do adult things but usually starting from a much worse off point.
1	Because people usually yearn for meaning, for me it kicked in when I was 21, for others it does sooner, others later, and some never.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Same here!
1	I currently smoke tons of weed, drink several shots of alcohol daily, watch Youtube, play video games, and I work from home.\n\nLife is AMAZING.
0	Your spirit lives on in your legacy. If you live your life without meaningful impacting somebody else’s then you leave no legacy. If nobody remembers that you were even here, then you have nobody to blame but yourself. 
19	I encourage all ENTPs to share their current random thoughts	I‘ll start with mine:\n\nI think it‘s interesting to think about the system our civilization has established. If there should be any other civilization somewhere in the universe, and they‘d get to know us, they‘d be surprised about the system we use. „Oh, they have three different types of sentences, questions, statements and orders, we got one more over here, and we don‘t use a „?“. Interesting system you came up with humans, but you totally forgot about xy aspect of life. Explains why you‘re still so stuck up. Oh you guys have something called „family“ and can mimic it with something called „marriage“ where you have a bound with someone. We‘re doing it different.“ etc. Most parts of our established system is completely made up by ourselves. But I would still argue that, no matter where you go, some things will be fixed. Example, if we wouldn‘t have used questions, we would have another tool to ask for stuff. But I think the difference would be dependent on the progress, meaning we would have a similar base supporting our system, but they might have developed it more in some aspects and we in other. And maybe applied the base in a different way than us. I wonder what an alternative system would look like. Sometimes this world seems like a puppet house to me, and we‘re all little actors, playing along with the script we‘ve established.
22	An animal has never talked to me in a dream. Seems like its a common occurrence amongst most ppl
13	Something I think about a lot is that we are just part of nature. We are just animals that are a more advanced than the animals around us. Everything we do is down to evolution. Every system, if you look deep enough (or zoom out abstractly) is a is a result of nature running it's natural course. Even things we don't class as "nature" for example, computers, are in fact a result of evolution of our technology and the skills our species has developed. Once this is realised, you can understand things from an outer and literally alien perspective. 
9	Why the fuck has no one ever came up with a chip that you can put into every different thing you own so that when you lose it you can find it again as if you were ringing your phone?
7	I think I’m going to get into pottery

4	They're really is no one single person out of the billions that you are supposed to spend the entirety of your life with. Statistically the likely hood of you finding 'the one' in correlation to your geographic location is just too small. \n\nAdversely there is absolutely a BEST person, but are you ready to toss out someone who is part of top 20% of the population that is best compatible with you? Or even 15% possibly even 10% or 5%..? Just for the possibility of finding someone _marginally_ better?

3	I was thinking about how the general life philosophy promoted by pop culture is that that the meaning of life is to find happiness or find love or otherwise enjoy yourself. It seemed like a basic truth that people would at least generally believe this. But then I realized that it may not been that way in the past. With the material prosperity of the modern age it's all we're left with, but I wonder if it really wasn't the case in the past, where they were preoccupied by daily pressures to the point where they may not have even considered the question of what life is about. According to us, it boils down to gratification seeking. There seems to be a synergy between this and whatever parts of the entertainment industry you see this message occurring. Mainstream films and the like not only grip us with overstimulation, but it stimulates us with the kinds of feelings that it tells us to seek out in life - love, happiness, adventure. Ostensibly they mean "go out and get it" but in reality these experiences are difficult to obtain, especially when the experience itself is the goal, so the desire created by the media sort of brings you back to the media. \n\nI wonder if all people in the past saw regarding the meaning as life with stuff along the lines of 'grow enough wheat for the winter' and 'make sure your children survive infancy'

2	When I was at church on Sunday I sat at a table during fellowship where I sat with a regular churchgoer and her visiting brother from another state. After small talk I mused aloud about how I decided that my brother is exactly who I would look if I was a dude, and I found that interesting. Everyone at the table looked at me like I was crazy, and there was a polite collective chuckle. Doesn't everyone think that, I asked? They all said no. I remembered to keep my random thoughts to myself for fear of being exposed as a fantasist. No really, doesn't everyone wonder what they would look like if they were the opposite gender? at least once?

1	A person who is made omniscient would probably kill themselves since they’ll never be surprised, scared, curious, etc. ever again, also if there is truly a god, they wouldn’t let us know all, since we would then have no purpose unless they made us able to do all as well
1	Everything that is alive is really bad patchwork from the beginning of evolution, from humans to the most insignificant plants. There is really no such thing as "disease", we all walk around with a number of cancerous cells, bacteria or viruses at all times, it is just a matter of other lifeforms trying to survive. There is no such thing as a perfect design, nor any inherent purpose to anything (except replication due to chemical reactions) even though it so often may seem that way.\n\nEnter humanity, filling all gaps of knowledge with gods, magical thinking and a tribal mindset, 100% pointless, and we are still not even close to removing any of that, even though we actually know better. The one and only thing that has been beneficial to humanity is science. No gods, magic or wishful thinking has ever developed medicines or cellphones. And even though we know we all share a common ancestor, that all humans are the same species, we still irrationally live by concepts such as nations/cultures/politics/gender roles or whatever other completely made up systems such as the ones OP talks about.\n\nI hate how humanity waste 99.99999% of the time being completely useless, destructive and fighting for things that doesn't even exist, and all for nothing. One can argue there is no point striving for betterment of humanity as there is no inherent meaning to anything to begin with, except I'd much prefer to have all the things we have yet to invent. For example, eternal life, or at the very least a much more comfortable life and as little suffering as possible.
1	I'm never going to go on a good date. 
1	I routinely check check the opposite of what people say as a simple fact check. 
1	Im certain the 4th dimension is merging into the 3rd as technology brings us together and mainstream morals/values/principles are on there way out, and most peoples "Feeds" are manipulated. With as many pursuing power or accruing it currently as there is, in the 4th dimension there is a war waging (astral realm), the planets keep shifting to increase this even worse, and most people have become agents or insane/gender-confused/fetishist subconcious predators.. if not just blissfully unaware.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is causing big glitches or weird occurrences. Very few in the 4d(spiritual plain, astral realm) are trying to keep harmony and balance, despite the impact on their own life(especially in 3d), so basically everyone has a predatory nature or spirit lingering and growing, weather they are aware or not, the smart metres + smart phones are constantly targeting the masses to be deviants or power hungry and manipulating thought form to try increase this merge, as the war in the 4d continues.\n\nYou can manifest anything you can desire so long as it's not beneficial to you above (as above, so below).. try it if you wish... keep thinking of an outcome today where a bad influence (old drinking buddy) or ex contacts you, or just anything not particularly life/spirit enhancing longterm.. and see what happens. If your good like me you can manifest nearly anything through thoughtform so long as it perpetuates an outgrown and unhealthy cycle.. trying to awaken others to this gets me targeted by many anomalies.
1	When I wake up after sleeping I sometimes think is I went back to sleep and the time might turn back and I could go back to 4am and get another 5 minutes of sleep.\n\nAlso why do people not see that webby from the duck tales reboot is clearly a lesbian. \n\nIf we all allowed robots to take control of us and take care of our needs and wants, would society be perfect? Could that even happen without corruption? \n\nIs killing a cop any difference from self defence? \n\nI’d elaborate but I want to sleep. But also read porn. Can i do both? Probably. 
1	We’re just a variety of ape that hasn’t evolved as far emotionally as the most exceptional members have evolved intellectually. The advanced thinking monkeys keep changing things before the slower and more emotional monkeys can deal with resulting in a lot of the friction that we see around us.\n\nThere is no apparent solution to this problem, just a sort of management of it.
1	Fonts are fucking wild. The scaling of fonts in particular! I just learned about bezier curves and it blows my mind that so many calculations must be made to plot the location of pixels in order to form a smooth, rounded letter.
1	Listening to the Zebra Murders on LPOL and trying to write a reco for an automation suite but don't want to. We're having cake in 25 minutes. Saw a random meme on INTP that had no explanation as to why it relates to the subreddit and I thought, "this is why the INTP sub is better than ours". I love INTPs. Mm, cake later. Ugh, work, though. \n\nThose are my thoughts. I'm a simple woman.
4	What got you excited this week...?	Look **I usually NEVER get bored**, but this week for some damn reason I felt like one of the most boring weeks of my existence, and for the life of me I don't know why that is.\n\nGod, not sure why. But I can tell you one reason is that locally there isn't much big events happening. Whole a lot of nothing, event-wise. Perhaps that contributed to it. And, I wasn't in the mood to play videogames, play board games or mess with technology like I used to. Weird.\n\nAlso, everything news-wise are not really much to go on. That Jussie, R Kelly shit, yeah whatever. Didn't really care much about those headlines!\n\nMaybe I am lacking some nutrition(you all think it could be that?), but I am not sick or anything.\n\nEnough about me. How about you this week?
7	Theres this giant sheet of snow on the slanted roof of my occupational facility that has been growing larger and larger over the past few weeks. It's began to slowly slide down over the past few days, the most thrilling part of coming into work each day is to see if it's fallen or not.    \nThe suspense is almost too much for me to bear.
3	Maybe try going outside if you like that, cycling, running, walking, camping etc.\n\nAlways great to get some fresh air.\n\nOr spend some time with friends. Guaranteed fun!
3	I got into debate club and can't wait for it to start! I have been in band all my schooling life, but decided to switch things up a little, plus it helps that the members I've met so far have really interesting opinions, so I thought it might be worth a try XD\nWell, regarding your rut, since it's not a Si problem (you mentioned that you weren't sick) maybe you should indulge in your shadow functions? (Ni -Te) Try researching really in depth about a topic you are passionate about, and maybe make a mindmap if you feel like it? \nHope this helps :)
45	Honestly, you could be tied to subway tracks screaming for help and an xNFP would let you get rolled over if they somehow had it in their heads that they would slip on their way down the subway stairs.	Honestly. You know that “friend” that you have that is super cool, really fun to hang out with, and seems like an awesome friend until they’re actually tested on it? This is why I never seem to fully connect with my ENFP friends or just xxFPs in general. It’s always superficial “Ne CrAZy TimES”. No matter how much you do, no matter how much you support them, no matter how much you give them advice- if you need them to rationalize or try to “work” for something that they won’t reap the emotional rewards of in your friendship with them, they will never lift a pinkie. \n\nExample: I have an ENFP friend who is genuinely a fun person to be around with. Super funny, always cracking jokes, etc. I wouldn’t bend over backwards for him, but if he wants a slightly inconvenient favor from me then I *will* do it. Asks me to pick him from the bar randomly at 1:30am? Ok, I can come. If I don’t then he will be stuck there, have to pay for for an Uber, have to walk home, etc. I mean what am I doing? Sitting here and watching TV. So I go. He would *not* do the same for me. And for some *fucking* reason I always forget this when I do things for him because I’m being a decent friend.\n\nA few weeks ago he asked if I could get him some weed because he “has really horrible anxiety”. I don’t even fucking smoke weed, but I know my neighbor does. So I ask this neighbor, pester him, etc. so I can get my anxious friend some weed. I don’t charge my friend extra for it, I don’t lose my shit because I’m carrying in my car (which I should have)- I get it because he’s my friend and I know he has huge issues with anxiety. I know weed *does* help him to a certain extent.\n\nA few ago my car breaks down. He is the closest friend near me. I call him up “Hey, dude sorry to ask...but can you come give me a ride? My cars kind of fucked and it broke down about 15 minutes from my house.” Him: “I have a date to pick up in about 30 minutes.” Me: “Oh. Can’t you just ask her if you can come a little bit late? I could really use the help.” Him: “Uh...I’ll try...but I told her I would be there at 6:00pm”. LIKE NO SHIT. I KNOW THIS. But you’re really telling me it’s that difficult to fucking delay it 15 minutes because your FRIENDS CAR BROKE DOWN? You don’t think she might understand? Do you really want to give a girl who judges you harshly on helping your broken down friend a chance in a relationship? Like fuck. I already know where this is going so I just say “Fine, thanks for nothing”. Petty? I guess. But I knew the answer the moment he started using weak fucking logic, so why continue the conversation?\n\nAnd of course I’m being a “bitch” and I’m “whining” when I call him out for it. This has been has been a trend in so, so many xxFPs that I’ve known. They do not give a shit about anything except their mediocre comforts and if you take them out of that then whatever you need from them is a “no”. You really just can’t depend on them for shit. They’re always takers. On the surface I don’t really mind if people fuck me over, but it gets super, super tiring after a while when I think of them as my friend and do things for them.\n\nOf course a Fi response is “You didn’t *have* to do that” or “You *chose* to help me”. Fuck you. I thought we were friends, so I acted accordingly. Apparently that means jack shit.\n
33	I have a few ENFP friends. One of them is completely as you've described. Always trying to be super cool, loving you one minute when they need to seem popular and then ghosting you the next. The other two are are wonderful people though who are the exact opposite. It might be a case of immature vs mature ENFPs.
18	They can have their selfish moments but for the most part, the ENFPs I’ve befriended have been there when I needed it. \n\nI will say they seem to prioritise making a good impression on *new* people (such as their date, in your scenario), even if that means sometimes throwing their friends under the bus. Their need for people to like them puts me off. 
11	Yeah I'm not so sure,  as an infp I go well out of my way to be there for friends in need.  
7	I hate asking for advice or help or favours.
7	Yeah, I haven't had much luck with ENFP friends either.  One of my buddies from the Army and his ISTJ wife were my roommates for a little while.  I thought we were really good friends, but he would constantly put my wife and I out, asking for favors that were never returned.  He'd hold me to deals that were made when the financial tables were turned.  Like, we would pay for a lot of the utilities because when they moved in, they were living off savings.  His wife gets a 6-figure job, and he's still hassling me when the internet goes out, cause we were short on cash.  He'd even devise elaborate schemes to get me to go out and get their carry-out, because he'd pay for ours if I got it.  Come back, "No, you pay for your food, I just thought you wanted to do us a favor."\n\nLast straw was when my wife passed out in the kitchen, hit her head on the counter, and he continued playing his DOTA match until I punched his chair and exclaimed for him to call 911.  She was fine, and had probably just drank too much too fast while cooking, but still.  I had to mosey into the kitchen to find out that my wife could have been in a life-threatening situation instead of him reacting like a decent human being.  \n\nThat was pretty much the end of that relationship.
7	ENFP here, sounds more like your friend is just a selfish asshole to be honest, I wouldn't dream of doing shit like that. 
6	Yes, I totally agree on this.\n\nI have an ExFP friend, and I was the only one there for him when he needed it. Guess what happened when he felt better?\n\nHe ditched me for a friend that showers him with compliments and affection. No words of appreciation, nothing at all. I don't really need those, but when I asked him to read some articles and share his thoughts for me, he did not even try.\n\nAnd it was just pressing on two links on your phone. 
6	>You don’t think she might understand? Do you really want to give a girl who judges you harshly on helping your broken down friend a chance in a relationship? Like fuck. I already know where this is going so I just say “Fine, thanks for nothing”. Petty? I guess. But I knew the answer the moment he started using weak fucking logic, so why continue the conversation?\n\nI think you're completely in the right here. It's not the biggest ask in the world, you have every right to call him out for not stepping up.\n\n>Apparently that means jack shit.\n\nWhy would you assume that it means anything?\n\nI don't think that you helping me out in the past is justification for me to help you, I just don't like that kind of logic. I would actually be somewhat irritated if you brought up your past good deeds as some kind of basis for pressuring me into a decision. *\[edited\]*\n\n\---\n\nYo, while it might be a very natural part of your problem solving process to try to understand the general trends that might underlie your particular set of experiences, I think you're just attaching a convenient label that seems to fit for you.\n\nFi isn't what failed you. Your friend failed you.
9	ENxP here. I’ve called both selfish and a chronic people pleaser a lot.\n\nWhat I do to not be in your situation is basically expect nothing from other people. If I do a favor, it’s because I want to do a favor, not because I want something in return. Whenever I ask for help (and notice that I ask for it, not expect it) I make it clear that I’ll manage even without help. I care very much for every exchange in my life to be volountary.\n\nAll of my other friends who are 100% ENTP do what you described. I think it’s the Fe in third position. ENTPs like to solve problems for other people, that’s one of the main ways they feel useful and show affection. And that’s dope! \n\nBut helping and being helped are two completely different things. Like totally unrelated. When you help, you will use certain skills, like thinking outside of the box and finding solutions (or emotional support if you learned how to do it). When you are helped, you need different skills. You’re going to have to ask for help in a calm way that allows other to listen to you (no, sulking resenting and maybe lashing out is not a way, I’ve been there).\n\nWhat I do to avoid being the selfish asshole is regularly check in with the people I love if they need something from me or if I can help and make sure I show gratitude regularly not just when I need something. That usually mean thanking profoundly and honestly, making an effort to listen and bailing only for good enough reasons. This took time to learn. Your acquaintance might just need time to develop (and a feedback might actually help a lot so maybe talk to them).\n\nBest of luck, you have every right to feel like you feel.
7	Hmm, now I wonder why INTJs like ENFPs. They sound selfish on this post? \n\nI thought they are fun to be with and some of the selfless people around who always want to help.\n\nOr maybe your friend thinks too much about the inconvenience he would give his date? And that it’s rude? So you should find some other nearby friend? :)\n\nDoes he know how much effort you put in for his favors?
4	Yea, this is why I could never see myself with an ENFP. Ti-Fe and Fi-Te clash like cats and dogs when the two types get their heads out of the clouds and things actually start to matter. The Ne part of the friendship is fun...but almost always superficial because anything deeper often leads to conflict. I think being in a relationship with an ExFP would leave me feeling quite emotionally empty and unsatisfied.
3	I don’t recognise it. I’m an INFP. I dislike asking for help and usually try to solve things myself because I don’t want to burden others (which is a handicap in itself, not saying it’s fantastic :D). \n\nAnd I’m the kind of friend who, as a close friend said, she’d call if she murdered her ex at some point and that I would simply show up 10 minutes later with a shovel. \n\nStill unsure whether that’s a good or bad thing. But no, common description of me from others is that I always am there for them when needed.\n\nI do understand your frustration btw. I think I have very different expectations from people so I feel I can’t be of much use for you there in explaining my own reasoning. But I would appreciate you as a friend and make extra sure I’d be there for you when needed. Not because it’s a balance thing but because I’d value you for making the effort to be there for me one way or another.
7	I dunno man, I feel like your example is a bad one. I wouldn't want to fuck up someone's date like that. You never know, she could be the one. It might have taken him 6 months to get that date.\n\nPlus, I've always found self reliance to be one's best bet.\n\nAnd one of my best friends is an INFP, and he's the shit. Flew across country to perform my wedding ceremony.
2	🤔 Personally, this feels opposite for me. All my xNFP friends go well out of their way to be nice, to the point that it's super annoying since it feels like so much investment for such little payout and the favour was nice, but REALLY not needed. 
2	Fi vs Fe. I dated a few INFPs somehow (I guess I like selfish people?) and they were ALL like this. The last one wouldn't even help me move! 
1	Ooo, I have an ESFJ friend like this.  Only gets in touch with me when she needs something: a ride, babysitting, etc.  And for a long time I said "Sure" because we're friends.  Then when I needed something and asked for help she would either say no or suggest that I should be paying her for it.   \n\n\nI must come across as together and reliable because I have several friends who constantly ask me to do things for them, mostly watch their kids (for free because, hey we're friends).  However, I'm super prideful and independent and so even though they would probably be willing to return the favor, I won't ask.  I always prefer to find a way to handle it myself.  So it ends up feeling like a one-sided relationship and I feel taken advantage of by people I want meaningful relationships with.  Sucks.
1	I just wouldn’t be friends with that person anymore. They just use people to get their way, and that’s some shit I don’t have time for. 
1	*Intuitives complaining about other intuitives*. Grabs popcorn.
1	Fi vs Fe ?
1	My xNFP friends are the opposite of this. 
1	You nailed it man. My buddy is an ESFP and what you described is all too familiar.\n\nIt stems from his Fi I think... "Do *I* FEEL like it?"
1	I had a similar experience with two ENFP friends. Spontaneous and excitable yaaas, but when it comes to long-term that’s when the hurdles arise and snag the friendship. \n\nI think it’s more than Fi versus Fe but how selfishness manifests in those two functions. And it’s how you described. Why a selfish Fi person wouldn’t think to call for an uber to take them home and would rather call their friend to take them home (people still do this in the ride share age?!). And that selfish Fi tends to clash because it pokes at what could be a viable solution and their *me me me* tendencies. Or worse case, take from the Fe. \n\nI hate my Fe sometimes. 
0	That's because Fe is about empathy, whereas Fi is about feeling sorry for yourself \n
2	Not sure if my dad is entp or Intj	He’s definitely a dominant intuition user. I’m an INTJ and initially I totally thought he was one too but now that I’ve thought about it more I’m starting to think he might be entp. My case;\n\n1. He seems to bounce around more in his thinking. He jumps around from one intuitive thought to another. More scattered than me.\n\n\n2.He has a less serious demeanor than I do. I come across very serious and slow to process and he is more comical and quick witted, always having sarcastic remarks and somewhat dark humor. \n\n3. I’m obsessively organized and structured, I plan and think about absolutely everything before I ever take action and he seems to do act on the fly and think as he goes. He doesn’t\n\n4. Though he seems introverted and his sarcasms is a little overkill sometimes, he does tend to have more people skills and the ability to flow with a conversation and keep up with conversation with strangers better than I. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\n
3	Wait, what's *your* type?
2	I don’t understand why any of this indicates the possibility of him being an INTJ?
1	Your dad is totally ENTP. I just have one question. Is he more if idealistic person or conceptual? Because the only question is he ENTP or the cousins ENFP. ENFP BEING IDEALISTS AND ENTP conceptual. Sorry for the caps. Hit it on accident and didn't want to backspace and then re-write...but seeing as how long it took me to explain that mistake, I should probably just have deleted and changed it. He is definitely not an INTJ. 
1	Pornhub and free speech ? Yay!	
9	You know an ENTP loves you when...	Fill in the blanks and tell if you are a male or female ENTP. This was a very well filled topic at quora, so show me what you got. I dare you 😉.\n\nCurious if there is a difference in the answers between the female and male ENTPs and if your answers on reddit are different from quora's answers. \n\nEdit: Thanks all for your contribution!
21	 She asks questions about you and your day, even the mundane details. \n^ this is especially important because ENTPs are very easily bored and mundane details like what you had for lunch isn't something that would peak their interest but it would be something they are willing/keen on finding out about you if they like you. Every little thing can offer insight. And this is especially so when you've been together for a long time and you're physically tired and can't come up with a conversation topic so even the most boring of information will be good for the ENTP who loves you. They'll do their best to make it interesting either ways 
15	He stays with you
13	He/she *gracefully* lets you win an argument.
10	She hangs on the things you say, because she finds your thoughts and opinions fascinating.
6	If she likes to touch you, and likes you touching her. 
4	When she will engage in a debate with you. I used to not have standards and would debate with everyone in my younger years, but now that I’m older when I do it, it’s with the chosen beloved few. 
5	She doesn't just walk away with things get tough. She knows she has options and the easier path is just walking away... but she sticks it out and doubles down on trying to make it work. :)
4	When he uses his creative potential to make your day. Time and time again. 
5	Female ENTP. Easiest way to tell is I’ll flat out say it. I don’t say it unless I’m sure. If I love you I’ll want to talk to you often, I’ll go out of my way to do anything I reasonably can for you, and I’ll try to make our time together special. In the early stages I’ll smile a lot and talk about you often. I’ll listen and pay attention to what you say. I’ll do what I can to remain calm while arguing. If I love you you’ll be able to tell by how I put you ahead of others. If that ever stops, the relationship is over. Yea I don’t know biggest one is that I’ll say it. 
5	When you go to make your lunch for work and there is a sticky note on your lunch bag that says,\n\n"No, you're wrong, this is your lunch 🖤"
3	If she is willing to share he sometimes random but really uselessly deep thoughts on this random mundane thing and asks your opinion about it because she values your insight in her thinking process. 
3	You know an ENTP loves you when, they stay with you. Even when their significant other dosen't give two shits about the ENTP's very analytical but general, realizations.
3	Seems like I (F) lost an ENTP (M). Oh well...
2	When she lets you choose
2	Actually cares about the mundane shit you do at your day job and how it affects you.
2	If she doesn’t mind you consuming lots of her time. If she hangs out around you. She’ll straight up leave if she’s bored of you. She doesn’t necessarily treat you too differently from everyone else it’s just she cares more about the boring shit you have to say. 
5	Is it a good idea to date an ESTP	Im an ENTP female and flirting w/ this ESTP guy. I dont know if I should keep this going or let it go\n\nBecause you know, would it be a healthy relationship, considering he is a sensor etc
6	I think you shouldn't date anyone, ever.
3	> I dont know if I should keep this going or let it go\n\nWhy?\n\n> Because you know, would it be a healthy relationship, considering he is a sensor etc\n\nDon't reject anyone based on type. You could be missing out on something great! 
2	Firstly, if you're both into each other, why not? It may not work out, but that's the same for all relationships. \n\nI dated an ESFJ and it was one of the best relationships I've ever had. He tried really hard to understand me. He did think I was "different" or kinda weird, but he really loved that about me. I also really admired how he was able to get things done. I think sensors can be great for us, if we're open to the idea of the relationship. Communication did require a bit of effort and self-disclosure, but I'm pretty used to the self disclosure thing because I'm surrounded by sensors constantly. One thing I like about dating sensors is how grounded they can make us if we're committed to the relationship. All I can do is give accounts for my past relationships, but its up to you to decide whats best for you. My advice- take it slow, feel him out, see where things go. It could be a really great thing. Good luck!
4	On hand #1) you shouldn't dismiss someone just on their type, at least without other reason \n\nThat being said, on hand #2) Yeah I don't think it's feasible for us to date sensors, they literally can't understand us, and ESTP is the most concrete abstract-avoidant type. There's so many people who already don't understand us, ESTP will just serve as a constant reminder of that. 
1	I like ESTPs a lot.\n\nI'm similar to them, and I am way more brainy then they are.\n\nI would love to be around someone who is as physically spontaneous as an ESTP.\n\nThe major issue would be the fact that we would have a hard time relating to each other mentally unless we have the same Enneatype.\n\nLuckily for me, I'm Type 8 and I identify with Se motivations a lot.
34	ENTPs and the Hidden Agenda (Socionics, you and why you attract other types)	The true ENTPs are ENTps in Socionics testing as well as MBTI. One of few to translate correctly. So fear not MBTI-slaves, it's okay big corporations only want your four letters to see if you're an agreeable and hireable FJ/SJ or not! You're not invalid! This applies to you! Anyway... ours is "To Be Loved." What does this mean? To be liked, to be popular, to be recognized. How does this affect us ENTP/ILE people on a spectrum? Subtypes are the answer, we are all different, yet the same, our motivations stem from the same place. The Hidden Agenda (Extraverted Ethics) is our Mobilizing Function, it also correlates to our specific PoLR (Point of Least Resistance, the most sensitive function you have in your being, and the Mobilizing Function/HA defends and makes up for this pathetic function). This Hidden Agenda is a defensive measure that manifests itself in different predictable ways and dictates how your personality adapts to the world, who likes you, who you like, your environment. It is honed by experience. With all of this in mind, let's see the confirmed subtypes...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBaseline ENTp (The Debater/The Seeker, Default Traits) - To Be Loved by proving his wit, humor, and arguments (most obvious ENTP) - Narcissistic, Sadistic, Sociopathic qualities (can be mistyped as MBTI ENTJ) - An asshole \n\nIntuitive ENTp (The Inventor, Inert Subtype, Irregular Ne + Fe, Guarded Ni + Fi) - To Be Loved by proving to be exactly what others want to see him as (can be mistyped as MBTI ENFP) - Narcissistic, Masochistic, Psychopathic qualities - A fool \n\nLogical ENTp (The Scientist, Contact Subtype, Irregular Ti + Si, Guarded Ne + Fe) - To Be Loved by proving his intellect and imposing his mind onto reality (can be mistyped as MBTI INTJ) - Narcissistic, Schizotypal, Psychopathic qualities - A nerd \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat does this mean on types you attract? What psychological functions do you seek out in others without knowing it? The functions of a type that complement or seem to complement yours. But most importantly, romantically, a type who is a Caregiver, as the ENTp is a playful Infantile-Aggressor.\n\nThe Debater seeks out an INFX (Supervisee Role) or ISFp (True Duality Role), one who accepts his temper and understands him for who he is.\n\nThe Inventor seeks out an INFX (Illusionary Role) or ISTp (Neo Duality Role), one who accepts his faces and understands him for who he is.\n\nThe Scientist seeks out the INTX (Mirror Role)  or ISFp (True Duality Role), one who accepts his intellect and understands him for who he is.\n\nAll are Extraverted Intuitive Seekers, thus they are all still ENTp/ILE, despite the cosmetic visage of another type. All have a similar cold and rational mind when making a decision due to being an NT type. All have a fiery temper when finally provoked or cornered. All hate failure to be loved. So, hmm, what do the types that we desire, desire to find in us?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe answer is obvious, this means, the other type is fulfilling THEIR Hidden Agenda! With Socionics, Hidden Agenda is why we see we are MAGNETS for INFjs who want to know that other people are more fucked up than they are (To Be Healthy). They are not our ideal partner, but they are a relation that stems from a self-serving and morbid curiosity - their strange Hidden Agenda. Anyway! The INFj and INTj both have the Hidden Agenda "To Be Healthy" which translates into them using you as a model to evaluate their mental health and prowess against yours (the INTj, overtly competitive). The ISTp's Hidden Agenda "To Love" comes into play with the Intuitive, seeing that the ENTp desires authenticity. This leaves the ISFp (compatible with all three) who has the Hidden Agenda of "To Understand" thus making the ISFp the most genuine, the most resistant candidate is ironically the one who can create true love (Duality) with all three.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh and you can use Hidden Agenda to find out if someone is a real ENTP or not, have fun!
29	You forgot to mention the emotional ENTP (The Hugger, true contact type, Fe) and the traditionalist ENTP (The Gingrich, opportunistic reactionary type, Si).\n\nOh and of course the most common subtype on this forum -- the ADHD psychonaut ENTP (The Druggie, experience type, Se). 
4	I'm excited to see socionics talked about here, cut I have to point out that your MBTI type does not guarantee your socionics type. \n\nThere are guides to conversions, but really you have to treat the two as different approaches to typing. MBTI is concerned with overall skills and personality, socionics is about how we process information. \n\nI am actually an ENFp (IEE-2Ne) in socionics. I think it's because socionics actually treats the F as ethics, whereas that's less central in MBTI. I've found there's no easy conversion without simply studying and testing in socionics. I think it's more interesting and helpful than MBTI, but it's less known and there isn't a ton of English information on it. 
2	This seems like utter shit
1	What? Is this shit real?
1	The "asshole", "fool" and "nerd" actually got me really confused. Like I do well at school and could be considered a "nerd" but I don't really care too much what people think of how smart I am. I am often criticise myself more than I should and when I receive praise sometimes I feel like I didn't earn it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also don't try to fit what other people want me to be. Sure I notice that when talking to different people I act completely differently but i think thats normal. (correct me otherwise)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I guess by elimination that makes me the "default" entp. \n\nI strongly resonate with entp traits and characteristics but I don't feel like I fit the hidden agenda of "to be liked". (unless it's something that I do without realising)\n\nDoes this mean I'm mistyped? Every test I do has shown up as entp with one time as intp.\n\nnb - Everything i've said so far is strictly from a NON romantic viewpoint. Would what op has said here extend to friendships and other types of relationships with people?

I'm thinking specifically ways to train teams in how to recognize the value of Myers Briggs Type Indicator, and how to use it as a way to do better team work. 
7	I'm an excellent study in types.  Here's my take:    \n  \nAlways, ALWAYS set ISFJ's as team-leader so they can delegate appropriately.    \n  \nHave an ENTP in a secretarial note-taking role; something administrative with busy work or you'll never find them again.    \n  \nHave a good ISTJ available for running PR, they'll hate the detail-oriented tasks so PR is perfect for them.  \n  \nGrab a good ESFJ accountant while you're at it.  \n  \nOh, and don't forget a solid INTJ in customer service.  \n  \n

9	ENTP wanting a job in Japan	So I'm really considering going to work in Japan after I graduate school. I know zero Japanese, but I want to learn. \n\nTwo things: \n\n1) how do other entp types learn languages. Specifically Japanese?\n\n2) has anyone done this before and how did it end up for you?\n\nExtra: I hate weeb shit. Kawii or whatever. I like the country. They are cutting edge in tech, And the job is for manufacturing engineering. Plus you can make a bunch bbn of money.
8	Japan is a workaholic’s country. Good luck.
4	Isn’t Japan notorious for how horrible it is to work there? Why would you ever want to work in Japan? Sounds like hell.
3	I personally learned japanese on accident. I‘ve seen so many animes with subtitles that at some point i noticed i understand what they‘re saying and can repeat it. My process was similar to a child learning a language by listening to their parents. So i would say input input input.\n\nI love languages, but i cannot learn a language if i cannot connect it to a interest. Try listening and reading it as much as you can so you get used to it. It will come easier to you learning it that way. I never learned vocabulary by memorizing, but everytime i hear a new word i google it up, i sometimes google up the same word 2/3 times, and then i remember it the next time. Try speaking it. Write a diary. I wrote one with my broken japanese only using hiragana. Because i was too lazy to learn Kanji (since that‘s memorizing) \n\nSo yeah 1. input 2. apply\n\nFuck „studying“ and „memorizing“ a language, that‘s boring as hell\n\nEDIT: Oh and i learned A LOT in Tandem. By speaking with actual japanese people, trying to express yourself, you‘ll be forced to search up various new words, and sentence structures. I always prefer learning by doing over anything 
2	Yeah? There good engineering jobs out there? 
2	back at you man, I fuckin hate that weeb shit
2	I don't thing that mbti has much impact in language learning.\n\nBest and fastest way (but also the hardest) is to immerse yourself in the language. Force yourself to make every interaction in that new language. (Really not easy to do with something like japanese as it is a completely different structure to latin langs)
2	Japan is not cutting edge in tech. Japan is very anti entp. Your first instinct will always be to cause havoc and disrupt the self-absorbed pretentious isfps there.
1	If you really want to invest in a xenophobic society that will always consider you an outsider, go for it. No, learning Japanese will not help you fit in, it will actually make you look more strange to them because they find non-Japanese people speaking fluently plain strange, you will always be a gaijin (foreigner). Oh, and if you think fulfilling the edgy "Debater" stereotype there is going to win you brownie points, think again. The entire society is based on maintaining group harmony and catering to others, remaining polite at all times and sweeping everything under the rug. You will learn to know your place at all times. How do I know this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dated Japanese and my best friend is also.

2	Help me figure out why i am starving as death with women	Hi,I'm 26 and i struggle so hard finding my "soulmate". I'm pretty confortable with social interaction and weighting my words to be sure that i do not hurt someone that's important to me.With the girls : I have no problem talking to them, and getting very nice and intresting conversation. I got ease flirting with them when i just met them. But the issue here is when i'm trying to develop a real relation with them, i have the feeling i'm only capable of just having good and intresting conversation, but it's soooooo hard for me to go to the next step.It's like i fear so much to lose this new person i like so much to talk with, that i won't even try to ask her if she would like to build something together.Well i'm pretty lost and i'm sure you guys have ways to overcome this fear.Thanks !\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS : sorry for this unstructured with bad english message
3	Tell me if I'm wrong, this sounds wrong but it actually can work depending on the woman. Sometimes this backfires hard and you feel  Vulnerable\n\nOpen up.....emotionally........yeah it sucks and if they leave you it will feel like someone stabbed you. Buuuut if it works they could stay and you might just be happy.  Now you may say "but  I'm already emotionally open" the truth is us entp's hate that shit, and are never emotionally open. Now you don't have let the flood gates swing wide open. Just a crack will do, and if that yields positive results try a bit more.\n\nWarnings:\n -too much emotion can kill what ever relationship you have instantly. Due to the fact you can come off cold as satan's tit in the 9th circle. \n-don't just share anything but share something meaningful\n-let it be natural\n-know you will probably get emotionally hurt. This is important as heck. Not every relationship is meant to be.\n-love fades after 3 months. I believe its call limmerance? Or it sounds like that mate, but if you can get past that your fine.\n-most importantly don't let random strangers online dictate how you live your life, you can take hints and sign post but the only one who can read your instruction manual is you man.... it's hard to read but anyways you get the idea you're an entp so you should be smart.\n\nCheers\n\nBedofashes, Entp, male\n
3	Maybe it was the conversation
2	Ask them? "I feel a connection. Do you?" It's a fine line between a romantic gesture she's been waiting for, and unwanted physical advances. So, ask. \n\nBut I'm an ENTP woman, and often mistake an intellectual connection for romantic interest. Therefore I am very passive romantically, because getting it wrong hurts. 
1	I think you have a hard time finding someone you can relate to. What’s your situation? Country? Country of origin? Education level? Interests?
54	Ti in the auxiliary slot, makes us seem kind of intelligent but inferior to the INTP	ENTPs are generally seen as witty and eccentric but we lack the intellectual aura that INTPs and even INTJs have.  \n\nTake Joe Rogan (ESTP) who also has Ti as an auxiliary function.  Many would see him as intellectually curious but not smart.  When he interviewed Jordan Peterson and Elon Musk it was obvious he was talking to men much more intelligent than himself.\n\nExTPs are intelligent in a more shallow way.  For example knowing brief amounts of knowledge in various things while Ti doms tend to have extensive amounts of knowledge in a few specific areas.  \n\nWe may feel intelligent around those who have Ti or Te in their 3rd/7th and 4th/8th functions but not as much around Ti or Te doms.  \n\n
47	I think the ENTP strengths are in seeing the connections and patterns between things rather than depth knowledge in one subject.  It's great for problem solving, discerning threats and opportunities, bringing different perspectives, and integration.  Using our Ne we absorb the knowledge of the people who actually work to mine data.  We get to look smart while not having to work so hard as the other types.  Which is good, because, SQUIRREL.
39	Sounds to me like you're differentiating between specialists and generalists in how INTPs and ENTPs will approach things.  Anecdotal, but the INTPs I know are typically very knowledgeable about one or a few subjects they truly enjoy, and can seem aloof or oblivious to things not quite as related.  Myself and other ENTPs I've met tend to try out more ideas with vigor and candor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think this has to do with Ti being a function of depth and Ne being a function of breadth, and one or the other does not preclude towards an individual being more intelligent.  Knowledgeable in a certain field?  Possibly.  More intelligent?  Not so much.
12	Overall, how are you defining intelligence? What, specifically, do you think it is about Ti being in the first function slot makes one "more intelligent"? What does one "lose" by "demoting" it to a lower slot?\n\n>. When he interviewed Jordan Peterson and Elon Musk it was obvious he was talking to men much more intelligent than himself\n\nHow was it obvious?\n\nSocrates is the poster child for ENTP. Diogenes is a typical ISTP. What makes you say Diogenes was more intelligent than Socrates?
6	Hmm I think it kinda evens out. I cannot imagine an INTP „beating“ an ENTP in their logic, since no matter how much Ti logic an INTP would serve, the ENTP would still find logical faults in it with Ne, or *at least* presenting some alternatives - which might make the ENTP look equally „smart“. What makes the ENTP smart is their NeTi in particular, and what makes the INTP smart is their TiNe too, both stacks have their benefits and strengths that might make them look „smarter“
7	INTP's have a way better memory than I do. That fact alone makes then more intelligent, IMO.
4	I would say that dominant Ne and aux Ti gives you aura of “mad scientist” intelligence. Not always sensible or practical but so much more fun than us dry INTJs.
4	Maybe the best descriptors are Generalist vs. Specialist \n\n\nTwo different beasts with two different applications. There's no superiority imo, each group happens to excel at different things. It also doesn't help that specialization has been overvalued in our current incarnation of civilization, which may skew bias.
7	It's breadth of knowledge vs. Depth of knowledge tbh. Does not make INTJs or INTPs more intelligent than us we just vary our knowledge over specific topics rather than becoming experts in 2 or 3 fields. 
2	[deleted]
2	Meh i am intelligently curious, how i appear to others is not my concern
2	I think this is reading way too into MBTI to look for domination of one type over another. MBTI is at best a psychological theory of fundamentals. You cannot expect.\n\nDifferent types do correlate in some of the baseline behaviors, and how they receive information and go through the decision making process. \n\nMBTI can in no way project the real-world application of someones intelligence or an entire grouping of persons intelligence. This is because MBTI has no implications into an individuals natural capacity to learn. Merely how they receive information.\n\nCase in point, many people struggled in school due to mainstream education favoring more lectured techniques when different people across all types will have a more receptive capacity for learning in hands-on approaches, visual approaches, or molecular understandings.\n\nOf course Elon Musk and Jordan Peterson are going to be "smarter." They have a vastly different skill Set than Joe Rogan. Respectively speaking Joe Rogan is as smart as they are in HIS respective field. Maybe not as smart in the comedy industry as Bill Burr/George Carlin in my opinion, but then again Elon Musk is no Benjamin Franklin/Albert Einstein either.... I have nothing on Jordan Peterson to compare him to so I left him out of that.\n\nJoe Rogan: Comedian  \nJordan Peterson: Clinical Psychologist & Professor of Psychology  \nElon Musk: Engineer, & Entrepreneur 
2	Your intelligence and depth of knowledge have nothing directly to do with type.   I can introduce you to people of all types who are  more intelligent or educated than likely almost anyone you can pull from the intp forum.  \n\nTypes are about **personality** not **ability**.\n\nHere’s an easy “disproof” of your conjecture.   If 2nd place Ti is less than 1st place but more than 3rd/4th, it follows that **all Thinkers are more intelligent than all Feelers**, because all Thinkers have T in 1st or 2nd place, and all Feelers in 3rd and 4th.\n\nThat’s the logical conclusion from your proposition. 
3	Ne is able to gather a lot of patterns and make connections. Ti is more knowledgeable. I would say Ne is a more intelligent function, Ti is more knowledgeable
2	Sorry but Joe Rogan is an ENTJ, not ESTP. He's 3rd slot Se. Si blind spot not Fi blind. Doesn't have the boistrousness of an ESTP; he's too serious. Plus the kind of topics he talks about are too 'abstract' for an average ESTP to find interesting.
1	Well its the choices we make and how we decide to interact with the world. In case of Ti auxiliary users, most of us choose to look outside before thinking and i theorize it gives us the upper hand in terms of time where we use Ti only where necessary, which leaves half of our frameworks incomplete. Again I theorize that is why we procastinate. Even Ti doms i assume start procastinating while using their auxiliary. We still build frameworks of stuff just like the Ti doms but we prioritize external stimuli or input over processing.\nPardon me for not giving solid answers atm cause i gain perspective figuring things out this way. Feel free to criticize as long as you have a good reason.
1	Speak for yourself. We are not slaves to our cognitive function order dictated by our narrowly-defined MBTI type. There’s also such things as IQ and other measures of intelligences, education, and mental discipline. Not all ENTPs are the same, and not INTPs are the same.
1	Rogan is so clearly an ENTJ
1	I wouldn't go as far as to say "Knowledge = Intelligence". Everyone can gather knowledge. Someone who keeps getting A's by studying isn't automatically more intelligent than the kid who keeps getting B's and C's buy who doesn't do jack shit, but perhaps simply more determined. \n
1	Extraverted perceiving dominance (se,ne ) gives us the ability to go through a lot of topics in life and be good in whatever we choose to be interesting whereas a judgmental dominant like Intp would be good at few things and completely ignorant at things they consider non existent . 
1	Nice post but I really don't like Jordan Peterson. Comes off as really pretentious and saw something about him basically where he was denying the holocaust. I just really don't like the guy and any people almost worhip him. Elon also has almost a cult following around him but he seems genuinely smart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that I've finished my tangent, I disagree that mbti has any affect on how "intelligent" you are. First of all "intelligence" is really hard to quantify. But time and work always result in an increase in intelligence and are the main factors here.\n\nSecond mbti probably plays a large role in the way intelligence is portrayed to others. As well as playing a role in the way you are intelligent (breath v depth) like in the post. However, as we all are actual people and not mbti templates, we all have passions and places of interest so it's very likely for an entp to have a focus and therefore high intelligence in a particular area as that's where they spend time and effort most.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; imo Mbti has no effect on level of intelligence. Mbti does affect how we portray intelligence. Mbti probably plays a role in the depth v breath. But each person could have a specific area they are knowledgeable about\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	INTP here. Peterson is quacky AF. Joe Rogan is pretty cool. And isn't Hitchens a better ENTP example?
1	I don't have this problem, since I have strong Ti.\n\nI have a very high control over Ne and I'm able to live in reality while dreaming of tons of realistic possibilities.\n\nNo, I'm not going to be the next Einstein.\n\nI'm going to be the next Warren Buffet.
1	What is thks Ti and Te stuff?\n
1	Jordan Peterson is a classic ENTP. I think that ENTPs are extremely intelligent, we are just all over the place. 
0	Cognitive functions are not real. \n\nThey, at best, describe areas of though. They do not describe humans or human nature. 
-2	\*laughs in Ti dom. oh you ENTPs are so cute, this INTP is entertained by your efforts at intellectualism
0	Joe Rogan is ISTP. Watch any of the episodes with Joey Diaz (They’re all great), it’s a good comparison between ISTP and Uncle Joey is ESTP.\n\n“She comes in with her little shaved monkey you know what I’m saying joe rogan ... I’m an animal. (Se) I’m on weight watchers and they give me points for different foods. An egg is no points. (Ti aux.)\n\nVs. “Actually it’s interesting, Balboa was the best. I think he was ranked 2nd. He combine mui chi and Japanese martial yoga. (Ti) Jamie pull up that Tiger. Look at that thing. (Aux Se) How much do you think it weighs? (Ti)\n\nJoe Rogans flow state is his introverted thinking. He doesn’t primarily exist out there in the extroverted world. Compare him to Diaz. Great example of telling the two STPs apart. Totally different animals.
9	I'm a 15 year-old ENTP, and My Biggest Struggle is Staying Focused and Work Ethic. For those of you who have overcame this, what can I do?	I'm a 15 year old ENTP, and I've managed to keep straight As most of my life, other than a B I currently have in my AP US History class. My constant struggle, however, is staying focused. I don't take notes or pay attention in class. I rarely take notes on my APUSH, usually just reading it or not looking at it at all. I crap my way through my math homework, and I'm essentially the type of student that most teachers probably hate.\n\nLooking to the future, however, I know that sooner or later I'm not going to be able to live the life I want by simply crapping my way through life. Can those of you who have beaten your lazy, procrastination tendencies, can you give me some tips and/or a plan to help slap myself into shape?
15	I was you. Good luck. \n\n-Study something challenging.\n\n-Find a job where ingenuity is rewarded. \n\n-Avoid careers that fail to reward creativity. Monotony will kill you.\n\n-Excel in your field by questioning in good faith and then providing innovative answers or at least stems of answers to an audience that will act on those ideas. \n\n-Marry someone who has very high intelligence and conscienciousness. (That's my top tip haha) They can keep up with stimulating conversation and can keep you organized. Best decision of my life. \n\n-Do the things you say you will do. Integrity is hard to rebuild. \n\n-Sometimes the best play is to keep your mouth shut. Learn when this is. \n\n\nBest Tools in my life, so far:\n\n\n-Bullet Journal\n\n-Pomodoro method \n\n-Lean manufacturing AKA Kaizen (Paul Aker's 2-minute lean changed my life) \n\n\nGood luck, it hasn't been easy.
9	Shit buddy, brace your self cause it's one hell of a ride and there's no magic fix. I've been using the Pomodoro Technique which is basically where you set a timer for say, 20 minutes, give max focus, then have another one scheduled for a break. Set the schedule you really want without being a tyrant to yourself and start with short periods of work to relatively long breaks and work your way up from there. Best of luck.
5	As a 21 year old still struggling with this I too am interested. Well mostly staying focused.
5	The one thing I wish someone told me at 15: high school doesn't fucking matter, so don't sweat it. The you at 20 will be very different from the you at 15 and the you at 30 laugh and romanticize about the you of 20. \n\n\nDon't get arrested, don't have a baby young and don't maim or kill anyone, and you'll make of life whatever you want and no one will care about what you were doing when you were 15. Other than that, now is an excellent time to experiment and make bad decisions so have fun. \n\n\nAlso, find something to fidget with and eat healthy to help concentrate. 
4	Former APUSH KID here:  my teacher made this. The webdeisgn is cringe, but he has notes and things to know for every  section. [http://www.apush-xl.com/](http://www.apush-xl.com/) \n\nsection\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGet yourself a planner. Use it!\n\nTake notes how you like em - I can't do lined paper, I have to use blank. It offers more flexibility.\n\nFind a way to relate the history to your current obsessions.\n\n&#x200B;
3	Music, timers, and snacks help me. I usually don't recommend snacks on these threads, but I've recently discovered that snacks and tea help me focus! No idea how.\n\nAlso, you NEED to use a planner. Or a task manager of some sort. You can't keep all your commitments in your brain; you'll lose track.\n\nEdit: Ugh you're taking APUSH? My condolences. I stayed away from AP courses; all my friends who took them were super stressed.
3	I can relate.\nI'm 16.
3	We'll firstly I would say...pffft good luck. I never overcame it doubt I ever will. I luckily found a job that I can "crap" through. It's very rough for is ENTP's in the work force. You have to find a position that the employees value your input even if they don't recognize it. Look, realistically your best bet is to find a job that will peak your interest at least most of the time. I think ENTP's would thrive in research fields specifically "organizational psychology" after all we really like learning what makes people click.
2	Not sure how much this can help as im good at staying focused but here are my two cents\n\nFor me pomodoro doesn't work as once i start working im good. It's just getting started that's hard.\n\nTo do lists work well for me. Try and make it a thing where you get homework you do it on the day. If you're the kind of student who will procrastinate but will die before handing in hw late (like me) then you have to learn to bite the bullet and just do work well in advance.\n\nNgl I haven't cracked procrastination or time management either. But I can assure you that improv can only get you so far. Also if you're like me then you're not lazy just bad at prioritising.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Consider this. Whatever you do now, will result in whatever happens in the future. While that's an obvious thing, it should be said. Start working on building new habits and do what must be done. \n\nI am currently out of High School, juggling a really boring job and trying to get myself to stay in college. High School only matters if you want a high paying job for the next 10+ years. This is also assuming you go to a Technical school as well. If you get your grades up enough, you can get a bunch of college paid for. Promoting in the workplace takes a good while, thanks to mediocrity. If you can focus on the here and now, you will thank yourself for focusing now. It's super boring , yes, but it benefits you so much in the long run. \n\nPut simply : Dew it!

It's best to start developing healthy study habits now... they're what you'll take with you to college, your workplace, etc.\n\n\nGood luck my dude. Bullshitting your way through math is gonna *hurt* when you realize how solid of a grasp on trig you need in calculus.\n\n\nPut in the work required *now* so that future you won't be screwed over by your current lazy attitude.
7	How to help a stressed out ENTP	Context: ENFP girlfriend of his. He’s 2 years working at a law firm he’s happy to be productive and slayin’ in, but the workload can be too much and lotsa asshole clients.\n\nLately he‘s ALWAYS tired, like for the past 2 months. Like he just wants to sleep. We seldom talk anything aside from his work. And when we do talk the first words he always say are “I’m so tired.” I’m doing my best as his girlfriend but I’m starting to tire out myself . What’s a girlfriend of a workaholic ENTP gotta do? 
8	Hey, I'm also a stressed-out ENTP lawyer! I can weigh in on this with actual experience. I'm actually in a much, MUCH better place now than I was just six months ago, but god I remember those years of my life... not-so-fondly.\n\nFirstly, something I REALLY appreciated from my partner was how he rarely made me feel bad about working so much. Although I knew he missed having me around, I generally knew I could stay at the office until late into the evening and he would understand. He was also very understanding (and sympathetic) when I had to miss certain fun events, e.g., over the weekend, because I had a last-minute deadline or needed to head to the office for some reason. Obviously, it's hard not to feel some guilt about leaving your partner alone most of the time, but he tried his best not to *add* to that guilt.\n\nAdditionally, it helped and he had (well, continues to have) a full-time job and activities of his own. Certainly, he waited around many nights, but I would have felt extra shitty had I known he was waiting around 24/7.\n\nFurthermore, my partner took care of a lot of the household needs due to my work schedule. I can probably count the number of meals that I cooked on one hand, my first two years of practice. I did dishes afterward, but he made sure I came home to a tasty and nutritious dinner most nights. We split other household chores, but I honestly failed on my end of the bargain quite a lot, particularly as I have pretty high cleanliness standards. Over time, I took to just hiring someone to take care of the cleaning. In any case, the point is, he took a LOT of the domestic burden off my hands, something for which I will be forever grateful.\n\nMy partner also tried really hard to make sure that I *did* have fun, in the moments where we could. He planned cute dates and little surprises here and there. He made sure I continued to see my friends (e.g., regularly reminded me to respond to text messages I'd forgotten about). When he could see that I was feeling shitty, he bought me cake and various alcohols, and always did his best to cheer me up, often by way of goofy joking around - not always an easy task for an ISTJ. That being said, if I said I didn't want to talk about something, he didn't pry, and that also helped - he usually just cuddled me until I was ready to open up.\n\nAll throughout, he *always* made me feel like he was on my side, and that we were Doing This Together. As you can probably tell, I'm incredibly grateful for his love, support, and devotion. If I could change anything, it would be that I wish he had voiced his own needs more, as he *doesn't* tend to voice his needs and it leaves me guessing as to what he's feeling inside. Whenever I asked him, he would just wave me off and say "I'm fine" or "it's fine", even if he was clearly bothered by something. Truthfully, I don't think I could have handled a lot of emotional maintenance, but I *know* I could have handled more than what he gave/gives me. It definitely wasn't easy for him to put up with me - still probably isn't easy sometimes - but he rarely ever complains and sometimes I'm worried whether he's okay.\n\nTherefore, my final piece of advice is not to neglect your own needs in this process, and to communicate those needs when the time comes. Otherwise, that's not fair to you, and most ENTPs I know are interested in fairness in relationships.
1	Is he depressed? It is that time of year when depression is more likely...not to mention the stress.
5	Book recommendations ?	First I need to know what is the best mbti book to read if I wanted to become an expert on the "personalities" thing.\n\nAlso, Some book recommendations in general would be nice, my recommendation would be "12 rules for life" by Jordan Peterson.
9	I recommend [How to Live with a Huge Penis](https://www.amazon.com/How-Live-Huge-Penis-Meditations/dp/1594743061). Phenomenal book. Even comes with an inscribed ruler in the cover to measure your penis. 
6	You can probably get copies of what Jung and Myers/Briggs wrote online for free. I'd look into that if you're interested in "personality theory". \n\n>Jordan Peterson \n\nI don't find his 12 rules to be impressive tbh. I get why people flock to him but he's mainly stating the obvious. I could have asked my mom for that. \n\nAnyway, one book I'd recommend to every JP fan is Paul Boghossian's *Fear of Knowledge*. \n\nPeterson rose to prominence partly by opposing postmodernism. I don't find his arguments against PoMo to be convincing nor does he strike me as someone who has the necessary background to criticize it. \n\nBoghossian is an academic philosopher who writes very clearly and engaging. The book is rather short, I read it in a week or so, but offers a strong case against epistemic relativism.\n\n
3	I'm reading *Watership Down* veeeeeery slowly. It's good. Personally, I identify with how the main character thinks. 
2	Sapiens
2	Science of Being & Art of Living - Transcendental Meditation by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi\n\n* meditation is one of the best tools for developing your intuition, among countless benefits. As an ENTP, your intuition is one of your foremost assets\n\n* the book doesn't dive deep into step-by-step techniques, but those are easy to read on. The book gives context, what to look for/strive for, guiding philosophies, and how it all can be applied to day-to-day life. For instance, meditation is a procedure that doesn't have immediate effects/benefits, although the mentality cultivated through it is leveraged increasingly throughout your day. \n\n
2	I'm currently reading 12 rules for life and enjoying it. Next on my list is "The hero with a thousand faces". 
2	I purchased this book on cognitive functions, I have found it excellent so far:\n\nhttps://personalityjunkie.com/my-true-type-book/
2	Norwegian Wood by haruki Murakami 
1	Honestly I lost brain cells reading jordon Peterson’s name let alone book. He’s not a horrible guy but not exactly a novelist either. So ignoring whatever you put here I’m just going to put the book I’m reading now. It’s originally chinese and is being translated by a group online. I adore it. It’s fiction. \nMo Dao Zu Shi- https://exiledrebelsscanlations.com/gdc-chapter-1/\nYeah. That’s about it. Nothing more nothing less. 
5	Cognitive function / stacks	Ok so I did a bit of reading on the above and this is a brief summary of the main functions. Feel free to correct me if I have misunderstood.\n\nDominant functions (strengths) in order\n1. Ne Extraverted intuiting - A creative process and rule forming function after generation of a lot of ideas and observation. Focussed on breadth not depth of connections between them. This may usually result in an a ha moment as your mind is constantly working on something in the background.\n\n2. Ti Introverted thinking- Striving to analyse people and relationships, inferring function using logic, philosophising, understanding how things work and fixing them if necessary. Can result in laser concentration on a task.\n\n3. Fe Extroverted feeling - being energised and motivated around others. Relating to others, understanding their position and influencing a group. Possibly being outspoken. Needing to be validated and respected.\n\n4. Si Introverted sensing - an information filing process that can lead to nostalgia for things in your  past. Also an interest in history, traditions and their development because it can predict the future. Maybe related to a fondness for childhood. Related to poorly carried out plans long term\n\nNeTi is the primary mode of interacting with the world with TiFe and NeSi as auxiliary modes. TiSi and NeFe are also suggested by some.\n\nAn ENTP matures from primary NeTI to incorporate and develop Fe and Si successfully as these are secondary strengths. Si is classed as a repressed strength as it relies on routine and predictability which is something we should in theory be able to do well but in practice we rebel against it.\n\nInferior functions (weaknesses) in order \n\n5. Ni Introverted intuiting - an egocentric process, believing your way is the correct way / dogmatic. Not retesting your own beliefs. Thinking things will work out because they always have AKA blind spot function\n\n6. Te Extraverted thinking - a disdain for order and convention especially if it’s inefficient and there’s a better way. Hating being forced into a role or maybe even a commitment AKA critical parent function\n\n7. Fi Introverted Feeling - could be seen as uncaring and inconsiderate. having own value system, we might make up our own morals to suit us AKA child function\n\n8. Se Extraverted sensing - running away from painful situations, we can be prone to self destruction ie poor self care/addictions, maybe procrastination AKA character flaw function
2	Personally I've begun to think that Ti while working with universal logic also deals with circumstantial logic. The reason being anything makes sense in its context at least that's what I think 
2	I don’t think I’ve come across something that so accurately defined the functions for us ENTPs, thank you very much!
5	Developing Ti through study of logical fallacies, a request for help.	Greetings.  \n\nI've recently looked into how to develop Ti.  Experience suggests that I often let Ne/Fe dictate  my thinking, and this is not a pleasant fact.  I've read that studying logical fallacies could help add language and understanding to utilizing Ti.  So 2 questions:\n\n1) Does anyone have any suggestions for a good place to start looking into logic and logical fallacy?\n2) Are there any other suggested ways to develop Ti?\n\nThank you for your time. 
3	Logic and math. You can probably find introduction lectures on formal logic on YouTube. Alternatively, google for "introduction to formal logic pdf"
2	Start here: https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/\n\nTry to recognize them in everyday life.
2	Personally i notice i refer to computer science a lot when i try to explain ti logic stuff. When i try to explain my logical process, i get those images in my mind which usually look like [flow charts](https://d3n817fwly711g.cloudfront.net/uploads/2011/11/Bank-Teller-Flowchart-Template.png). Or like writing a code. But this is personal experience. I don‘t think it actually developed anything it just made me be able to visualize it more easily
2	Playing FPS shooters
7	I feel miserable but I don't know why	I don't understand myself, the past few days I've been feeling like utter shit. It's ironic because I'm doing all of my schoolwork (I'm in senior year of high school) and stuff on time but it's like something has hit me and I can't get out of it. I'm doing what I need to, but I'm frustrated because I don't know how I feel. \n\nHow do I get out of it? I feel like I just want to cry, but my body isn't physically allowing me to. I am so frustrated. \n\nI've been also having a major identity crisis and existential crisis the past few days. How do I get out of this? This has never happened to me before. If it has, I dont remember it. But I feel so tired and exhausted and I'm not sure why? Any other ENTPs have had this feeling? How in the damn world do you get out of it? 
9	Is it just anxiety about leaving something and moving onto somewhere new?
5	i just got promoted at my job. im 2 weeks in and have responsibility of 10 people now. And i feel exacly the same as you do.\n\nim 23y M. What i learned is that i allways feel this way when i take big steps in life, doing new things that changes alot for me.  Time is the only thing that makes it dissapear for me (and accepting this). Nothing else.\n\nstay strong
3	Well I would call it being a teenager (not joking). I don't how strong you feel that way, either you make your best to refresh your mind (do a lot of sport, hang out, etc...) and get over it, or you're feeling depressed, in that case I don't what you can do.\n\nPerhaps I'm entirely wrong...
3	Society is shit. That's why bro. 
3	That's how I feel during times of extreme stress.
2	Is it impending graduation? I know I'm all over the place like lots of us, but I've realized over the years that one thing that makes that okay is the stable base of family and home that I've always had to come back to and rely on. It turns out that I don't actually like change much, or at least not fundamental change. It's like *I'm* allowed to be crazy and on the move, but everyone else has to stay the same so that I feel secure. Maybe knowing things are shaking up soon is stressing you out?
2	Probably stuck in your head. That happens sometimes and it can get really negative up there. I know nothing really about functions but Sensing isn't really our thing, and that can cause us to be really abstract and out of touch. Carpe Diem. Start focusing on living in the present. Be spontaneous, work out, read a book. Find a way to get our of your mental rut, because that is likely what it is. 
2	You should talk your feelings out with someone, preferably a professional.\n\nAlso, I’ll sharepractical advice from just personal experience YMMV- exercise, clean your diet up, be outside more, and set some goal (save X dollars, write some story X pages long)and work to accomplish it. These essentials do wonders for the human mind.
2	To all ya mistyped High Agreeableness (F) whusses. Being a cold bastard is the way to roll with reason!	
2	>The remaining\n>personality factors yielded no differences, except for\n>Agreeableness, for which the differences were in the\n>opposite direction to that of the hypothesis. That is,\n>participants scoring low on this trait made more MT\n>inferences with the trait-related material (45% valid\n>inferences versus 19%; t(36)= 2,220; p<0.02).\n\nThe most relevant excerpt from the study. \n\nI am just very fucking irritated people are scared of bluntness and individuality. Just fuck off mate; just no.
2	I think you'll find my lack of agreeableness does not agree with other people's lack of agreeableness. 
2	There’s a way to be reasonable without causing unnecessary social problems for yourself. 
1	I hate that the font is small. Then again I'm ok mobile 
4	I know this is a difficult question, but what are you favorite movies of all time?	What movies do you absolutely love and think are some of the best movies ever? Just curious to see what you ENTPs like!
5	Lord of the Rings 1-3, Interstellar, and Les Miserables 
4	Not much of a movie person, but drunkenly watching [End of Evangelion](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion__The_End_of_Evangelion) without knowing wtf is going on started my deep obsession with Eva, so there. \n\nAlso, I rate [Kara No Kyoukai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2593/Kara_no_Kyoukai_1__Fukan_Fuukei) very highly for being dark and gloomy. It's seven movies iirc. 
7	For some reason I have an easier time choosing favorite books than movies.  I guess because movies take so much less time to consume, I am open to a wider variety and the criteria to choose is murkier.    \n\n\nIn no particular order these are some (but not all) of my favorites.  And I feel the need to clarify that I don't think these are the BEST movies, they're just my favorites for personal reasons.  \n\n\n* Terminator 2: Judgment Day\n* Rocky (all, but particularly 1,2, and 4)\n* Rocky Horror Picture Show\n* This is Spinal Tap\n* Halloween\n* Vision Quest\n* Breakfast Club\n* Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken\n* 16 Candles\n* Heathers\n* The Little Mermaid  \n\n\nJust for fun, guess my age and gender.  :D
3	Seven psychopaths. Helluva movie
3	My favourite movies  have changed over the years\n\nWhen i was a kid:\n\nHook, and Last action hero.\n\nWhen i saw this movie (i was 11 and i watch it one night i couldnt sleep):\n\nDonnie darko\n\nNow as an Adult:\n\nDrive\n\nI like every one for diferent reasons, Hook and Last action hero ar movies with a lot of soul, last action hero because i could imagine all the possibilitys and hook is just beautyfull and Robie Williams is just love, i havent watched that movie in years thoug.\n\nDonnie Darko was the first movie that i simply got ,my mind after i watched it was blown away, i remenber tripping after watching it and went to the bed and began traveling to places, that movie touched me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDrive, i watched that movie in the middle of the night, one day i couldnt sleep and got restless in bed,that movie is pure art,i guess i fall in love with it, because the main character just feels things exactly like i do, and the wy he is so empathetic, and the wa he handles things there ar not many characters like him in any movie, and i was blown by seeing someone who process emotions, just like i do.I have watched that movie over 10 times, is just too good.
3	The big Lebowski
6	No movie has ever affected me quite like Interstellar did. 
2	Pacific Rim the first. Thing is I don't even like the movies. I like the Jaegars. All the Transformers movies except the new bubble bee one. 
2	The Lobster !!!
2	Imo, The Silence of the Lambs is the greatest movie of all time. It is pure perfection and the golden standard for film.\n\nI also really like Black Swan, Nightcrawler, Blade Runner 2049, Whiplash, Psycho, Vertigo, Aliens, Terminator 2, Gone Girl, The Shining, Ex Machina, and Se7en. Luv me sum strong female characters losing their shit amirite \n\nI really like psychological mystery/horror movies that make you think, haha. I eat that shit up like a fat kid at a candy store. I remember back in 2014 when I skipped school one day, went to see Gone Girl all by myself a few months after it came out, and *hated* that I had no one to talk about it with afterward. I’m not kidding when I say that I sat there with my mouth wide open in amazement at how insane it ended up being, haha. This is why I don’t see critically acclaimed movies alone anymore, lmao.\n\nAlso, Dune? 2020? Anyone else LOSING THEIR MINDS?
1	Little Miss Sunshine, Creep, Hush\n\nStruggling to think of more but those are the biggest standouts. I like anything unpredictable 
1	I tend to emotionally latch onto TV shows more than movies, but I love *The Right Stuff.* I saw it in high school and it blew my mind. I didn't know a movie could have such real characters or hit me so hard. When Gus Grissom and his wife were arguing in the hotel room... dang, I just felt their pain. Their humiliation.\n\nAlso, *A New Hope* and *The Empire Strikes Back* are perfect movies, structurally. I would be happy if they were the only Star Wars films.
1	Undisputed 2/3. The Godfather. Any Sylvester Stallone movie.
1	Auntie Mame (Rosalind Russell 1958) - favorite role\n\nHe Died With a Felafel in His Hand (Noah Taylor 2001) - favorite writing\n\nChildren of Men (2006) - favorite cinematography\n\nThe Gods Must be Crazy (1980) - favorite cult classic\n\nFour Rooms (1995) - favorite anthology/shorts
1	Arrival\nBig Lebowski \nKiss Kiss Bang Bang\nI cannot turn away from Deep Impact.\nIf the sound dies on The Hunt for Red October, never fear, because I can recite the thing for you, Alan Partridge style. 
1	I’m not embarrassed to say that I love Top Gun. 
1	Back to the Future 😍🙌

15	A friend leaves a $100 bill at your house. What do you do with it?	Curious ENTJ.  What is your thought process?
56	I'd give it back. It's their money, not mine. I also try to operate my friendships on a bedrock of trust. \n\nTo be totally honest, though, I have random money lying all around my house, so I'd probably keep it by accident assuming it was mine. However, if I knew it was theirs, I'd give it back.
17	Chase their car down the street to give it to them
25	I would text him "Hey, thanks for the 100$. I can finally buy the Lunar Eclipse Leona skin."
27	Give it back. What kind of question is this? Jesus. I don’t care to be friends with people that I’d be willing to lose over $100. 
6	Tell them they left it, give it back next time we hang, or if they come back for it. 
10	If they're a true friend, call them. Let them know.
8	I wouldn’t feel comfortable with myself taking it unless I had come to an extremely set-in-stone negative viewpoint of that individual and could “rationally” justify it in my mind...however this person probably wouldn’t be in my house anyway if I had such a bad image of them in my head. \n\nIf they’re a stranger, neutral acquaintance, or friend, I would definitely tell them. I could be taking their groceries for the next two weeks or their kids school supplies money. That’s fucked up.
4	Call them, tell them. Keep it aside for them until they get back. Did an ENTP shaft you?
4	give it back for two reasons:\n1) my conscience <- this is the primary reason\n2) it could harm my reputation and relationship with the friend if it was found out. not worth the risk
3	Judging by your responses to people, are you just a troll...?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwell, either way, here's another ENTP saying of course I would give it back.
2	Immediately contact the friend, and/or meet them somewhere to reclaim it.
2	Not an ENTJ, but look at it this way. Find a way to multiply their $100. If you fuck up, oh well, give them $100 that you have. If you manage to succeed in multiplying the money, well... you've created a win-win situation my friend. They're happy with their $100 back and you make a shitload more off of it. Don't tell them of course, but smile and get them a beer.
2	Give them back. 
2	Ask them if them lost anything to get them to say it first to return it. You don’t just ask “hey did you leave a 100 bucks” cause they might say yes to get free money. But yea. Pretty much return it to the owner.
1	I'd ask them if they intentionally left me spending money...then take them on a nice date with their money to repay them...I'd even kiss them on the cheek (if they get angry) just to lighten the mood and make it more memorable!\n\nAaaand if there's any left over, just tip the waiter they'd appreciate it!
1	Lol, I don't care about money. I'd absolutely tell them.
1	Return it next time i see them. Have handed 100 bucks back to a lady on the street after i saw her drop it. She had no idea she dropped it. Do the right thing. You don't know how badly that person may need that and its just the right thing. Now finding random cash on the ground with no idea who dropped it is another story though...
1	Hell yeah! New coke straw
1	I would say it depends on a lot of things. Will I give the money back?\n\nThey’re are a close friend and there is a certain loyalty between? I will give it back.\n\nThe person is in a tough economic situation? I will give it back. \n\nThey asked specifically for it? I will “search and find it” and give it back. I lie only when it’s absolutely needed.\n\nIf it’s not the given/similar circumstances. I would probably keep it:’y
1	Give it back, obviously. Thats like two to three weeks worth of groceries. Would feel awful for keeping that without saying a word. 
1	Give it back, I’m super tight on finances \n\nBesides, I don’t steal, let alone from my friends 
1	Give it back. I have a similar story with an ESTP whose friend left $100 in his house in a bag, and the ESTP fabricated this whole story about his mom throwing the bag away. If that happened to me, I'd consider it owing them money and give it from my own. 
1	Just take a massive bite out of it. Why? Because fuck capitalism.\n\nNo Im kidding, I'd let them know and work out a plan to give it back to them as soon as possible.
1	Give it back.
1	Text them saying you'll give them $100 next time you see them. Then when you see them next give them it, tell them the full story.\n\nBut I'd also lowkey check they weren't strapped for cash so I'm not fucking them over for a joke. 
1	Depends. If we're talking about someone that I truly consider my friend, and not just acquaintance then I'd give it back. If we're friends then there must be trust between us and I ain't gonna betray it. \n\nIf it was acquaintance then I'm not sure what I'd do. I think I'd keep it, but I can't be sure of it unless I'm in that specific situation 
1	Go to the bank, have it made into 200 x 50c coins, start hiding them all over his house when ever I go visit him/her again. 
1	I would tell them I don't accept tips
1	I'd toy with them for a little bit about it before offering to give it back.
1	Give it back. More interesting is if you found it on a shop floor. I would keep it.
1	I would use this as an opportunity to show off my origami skills by making it into a shirt, then give it back
1	Just spend the $100 on an escort, Steve. We won't judge you.
1	Text them and immediately tell them
1	In my opinion, if you don't give the money back, then you and whoever left it weren't friends to begin with
1	I'll give it back, what else? =D
1	Draw a penis on it then give it back.
1	I‘d give it back. No matter who they were. But - I‘d probably forget giving them back 2 days laters and feel strong guilt after finding it again after some weeks. 
1	Upon rereading this post, it really sounds like you're saying "I am ENTJ, what do you peasant ENTPs do in this situation? Debate me for my entertainment!"\n\nWho needs enemies..
0	If they're a true friend, return it, if they're a meh friend, keep it for a few weeks and if they haven't asked about it, spend it, if they do ask just search for it and "find" it.
0	I'd probably hold on to it for a couple of weeks and see if they asked about it. If they never ask that Benjamin is mine.
0	Who? A friend? What's that?
14	Ladies, and fellow ENTPs, dating advice??	Lemme start out by saying I usually find posts asking for advice kind've annoying, and this is a last resort effort\n\nAs a female ENTP, dating has been rough for me. My best friend is also an ENTP female and we seem to struggle with the same problems. It's not that I have trouble getting dates. The guys that I find interesting and often want to pursue always end up being unable to result in a relationship, for one reason or another. I recognize that I am the common denominator in these situations, and I was wondering if any fellow ENTPs could offer any advice for other ENTPs in regard to the dating world. Thanks in advance :) \n\nedit: probably should add that i'm a 22 year old college girl\n \nedit 2: A lot of guys are emotionally unavailable, and I realize this when I'm already in too deep. Emotionally available guys rub me the wrong way. They seem clingy/needy, & I feel pressured by them to match their energy/reciprocate what they're feeling before I know if it's mutual. It results in pushing me away, even when i try to be patient and feel things out. I spent a year or two maintaining autonomy and sleeping around, and now I'm over that. I don't know if it's type related, but types that inherently attract me and seem emotionally unavailable are usually ENTP, INFJ & ENFPs. The most healthy relationship I've had was with an ESFJ. The clingy-seeming guys were oddly also NTs. One being INTJ and the other INTP. 
18	When I was in my early twenties, lots of guys were attracted to me but seemed not to be interested in a relationship with me. Now, I feel like it’s too easy (36 now).\n\nI have a couple hypotheses. \n\nOne: I wanted a relationship too badly; it came across as desperate. I got attached too quickly because I wanted to _be_ attached. It’s man repellent, even for pretty girls.\n\nTwo: guys at that age (i.e. your age) are generally NOT looking for a serious relationship; they’re in “play” mode for a long ass time... at least the ones I (and probably you) would ultimately be interested in. Sure, the emotionally clingy ones are around, but... they’re like you are: _too interested_ in being _in_ a relationship. \n\nThe ones you want have lots of options and are far from being ready to choose just one girl. There’s this sweet spot between 28 and 30 that guys suddenly become “ready for a relationship”. \n\nI’d say seek the older ones out, but do you really want to sacrifice your own youth to hurry up and find someone ready to lock it down?\n\nTake your time. Besides, YOU will be better if you wait. Trust me, give yourself time to change your mind about what you even want out of life.
8	I've known quite a few ENTPs in long-term relationships, including myself. The common denominator is this: even their all our partners are quite different, they're all far more loyal and "stable" than we are. I think there is something to be said for loyal, stable types making good partners for ENTPs, to counteract some of our flakiness. Others have advocated for more "grounded" partners; I'll add myself to that list. (FWIW, I've been with an ISTJ for 5 years. Incredibly happy.)\n\nPersonally, I think fellow ENTPs, INFJs, and ENFPs *could* be a mistake, unless they (and you) are really healthy. We're all too airhead-y. Additionally, there are far too many emotionally unhealthy INFJs who will just drag you into their pit of despair with them. I've never seen one who *didn't* do this to their partner over time. I'm sure they exist; it's just - risky.\n\nI *totally* understand being turned off by overly emotionally... enthusiastic guys. Back when I was dating, I also had this problem. I think what you could do is look for men who are not necessarily emotionally unavailable, as that obviously runs into its own problems, but men who respect your personal (head) space. In other word, a non-neurotic type. As you said, the most healthy relationship you've ever had was with an ESFJ.\n\nMy final piece of advice is not to force things too much. I'm sure you aren't this type of person, but it's easy for us NE-doms to try to forecast what's going to happen in the future. In my experience, this leads to subconscious expectations. You're still really young, OP - you have plenty of time to find a good partner. When I was 22, I just took each day and each dude as they came (hah). Is there really a particular to be *in* a long-term relationship? As a goal, it can be overwhelming. I always enjoyed myself far more when I didn't think about the long-term - that is, until I met a particular person who put those thoughts in my head post facto. Takes the weight off, IMO.
8	As a fellow young, female ENTP who is happily married (!) I have a bit of insight. I always found that I always went for fucking douchebags. I didn't even realize it until my ENTJ best friend told me. After that I actually had to make a conscious effort to not dismiss the "nice guy," which is how I actually met my husband. He wasn't the kind of guy I would typically go for, he was a bit quieter, not as showy, but goofy and fun as all hell, and very established and accomplished in his own way. He has always been blunt with me about everything from how much he loves me and supports me, down to when I fuck up. \n\nI also found that I need a lot of independence in relationships. Nothing turns me off more than if my partner is always up my ass and worships the ground I walk on. I like having my own life and I expect my partner to have the same. I also like having someone who will spar with me intellectually, I CRAVE it. If my partner is too busy focusing on not upsetting me, I will eventually get bored. \n\nMy final bit of advice is to stop looking so hard and just do you boo. I've always found that my best relationships began when I wasn't even looking for them. As an ENTP, people will gravitate towards you, especially if you are thriving. Freedom to explore the world and learn is an ENTP's happy place, don't ever give that up in search of a relationship, and ESPECIALLY don't give it up IN a relationship.\n\nIf you would find it helpful, I believe my husband to be an ISTJ.
6	Needs more information about why it doesn’t work out for you, impossible to advise otherwise.
8	In my experience ENTP females are very attractive from afar and seem to have it together but can be quite self absorbed up close. This is not good when as a male ENTP you want someone to feed your ego but they might be great to hang out with in bars etc \n\nThe vulnerable I suppose and intimate qualities of caring and listening needed for a relationship are often easier to obtain in other personality types. \n\nOne classic ENTP party girl I can think off settled with someone introverted but quietly successful, intelligent and not clingy. I guess there’s some truth then that opposites work well.
3	You're 22, lots of guys that age are going to be emotionally unavailable, especially at college. If you're half as abrasive as I am, i think that plays a big part in either getting this "emotionally unavailable" vs clingy beta guys, if that's the right term. lol i realize this basically shit advice but i'm in the same boat as you and struggle with relationships through high standards or just getting bored with it. I'd be interested to meet an ENTP female, actually i don't think i've ever met another ENTP and would probably be scared to lol. Good luck and let me know if you crack the code.
3	It SEEMS like some guys are distant, and that other guys are clingy. That's a perception issue. You're only viewing these guys for a small sliver of time.\n\nIn reality, the SAME guy is clingy one year, and the next he's distant, and the next he's clingy. We're all just trying to figure it out and bouncing from one persona to the next until we know what the fuck we're doing. NTs get clingy because they're smart enough to be self aware of themselves and their own shortcomings. They overthink.\n\nI don't think I became WHO I AM until I was 29. Looking back, I realize I was faking confidence and I hoped nobody saw through the cracks. Today, I'm finally genuinely happy with the world and with myself which brings about the true confidence and comfort ability.\n\nIf you're looking to date guys your own age, just know that every person (including yourself) is a work-in-progress regardless of what seems to be going on externally.\n\nYou're not going to find perfection (yet) and "Mr. Right Now" might be the norm until "Mr. Right" has matured.
2	An ESFJ is a good one, b/c they can protect us from our self-destructive nature. Although the only female ENTP I've ever been friends with started out as someone who hated me and I hated her, then we ended up having a brother/sister bond that's still strong 15 years later. Tends to make my wife jealous, then again INFJs are what they are. \n\nI think in the end, it's more about who you find personally that can handle your personality and the type won't matter. What will matter is time and effort put forth by both parties to make a relationship work, but as far as ENTPs go, it honestly could be any of the 16 types.
2	As an ENTP, I was one of those clingy-seeming guys when I was undergrad. I was just trying to be funny and kind, but kindness seems as a weakness to most of the population (maybe I was seeming a little bit shy also). Nowadays, I talk slangy, I give harsh, funny, ridiculous or opinionated answers to the questions asked by girls, I turn back when girls ask me to help them. And what? Things are going better for me. I became much more matured in last few years, thanks to all the failures I faced up so far.\n\nMy opinion is to try both types. You can't know well a person based on a few dates. You need to spend time together. It's a rare chance that you are going to have serious relationships that will take a few years with your next date/partner. Just be cool, try to have fun with that person, try to know that person, try to learn something from your relationship. Since, we look for personal growth, to have a bad relationship is much more better than to not have any relationships.
4	> and seem emotionally unavailable are usually ENTP, INFJ & ENFPs.\n\nI think the only type that would have a strong argument for being emotionally unavailable, are INFJs. And, that's only because they can be very guarded at the beginning. But, ENFPs practically wear their hearts on their sleeves.\n\nAnd, despite all the stereotypes, ridiculous assumptions (even within this very thread), and general misinformation regarding ENTPs (and MBTI for that matter), they are very open with their emotions. \n\nEven their very own emotions, thoughts, and reactions are something to be studied, discussed, and rationalized. And, they'd be happy to do that with someone willing to listen.\n\nAll of this is to say, that perhaps what is more likely is that these "ENTPs" were mistypes. \n\n> The most healthy relationship I've had was with an ESFJ. \n\nIf by healthy, you mean that you got along with them the most, then I think that says more about what your type actually is than what went wrong in your past. 
2	Your problem is you are seeing too many guys.\n\nMen and women in this modern age are too liberal with their sexuality and their emotions. \n\nThey think having a pool to select from is preferable than building a relationship with someone over time.\n\nFor women this is unwise, For men, This is in their biology.\n\n"The evolutionary mating strategy"\n\nAge will solve this "Selection" problem for most people. (Maturity is a big factor)\n\nRemember Men and Women are very different even if they are the same personality types.\n\nRelationships are built not found. You are not spending any time building one. You are trying to find one.\n\nThis will never work.\n\nAlso as a female the more "Selections" you embark on the less valuable you are on the relationship market.\n\nThis dynamic does not exist with men. In fact quite the opposite.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy advice to you:\n\nFind someone you are very very attracted to both physically and personality wise.\n\nTry to build a relationship with them. Don't "Run" every time you meet a little hiccup.\n\nKeep your "Selections" to a minimum. They only reduce your relationship market value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing an ENTP I know you value independence and freedom. But a relationship is the exact opposite in its early stages. It requires work and time. Only after you have built a decent enough foundation in your relationship will you be able to exhibit freedom. Whether it be financial or otherwise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother dynamic I notice with ENTP women is our casual stance on manipulation. Both men and women. Dial that back to 0 if you want to have anything even remotely real. Otherwise it is all built on nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ninb4 slut shaming. I stand by everything I say. Like it or not men and women have different preferences.

9	|[ Guide On Starting A Business ~ How to take the first step into reality ]|	I've been constantly thinking of starting a business. Unfortunately, I can't seem to gather the most simple of steps that I need to take to go from literally nothing, to having created a business. I wonder what I could be doing better....I never do seem to ever begin anything because I spend so much time at the drawing board. I never have ended up deciding on something and trying to accomplish it. This makes me wonder if perhaps someone else could shed light on how they eventually got into creating one of many realities they thought of. \nThis brings me to question many things. Many things not said are still welcome as well. These are some of the particular things I have been thinking about....\n\nIf you disregard at first, the actual business idea, how would one go about getting things together to start? What strategy work best, to start going through with the hypothetical plan of creating a business? What kind of steps would one take to get things rolling? Could you describe the procedures that can be acted on to begin?  \nDo I need a certain amount of money to get started? Should I try and run things out of my own home, or should I try to rent a location to source the work out of? I understand this might be irrelevant since we are trying to look at this without a actual business plan in mind. I'm just trying to gather a sort of, blueprint, on how to put together a action plan.\nIs there anything you would recommend avoiding, and why? If you have already accomplished this, could you share your experience in as much detail as possible? I'm looking to get refined information that will be viable enough for this post to be linked as a prime example of starting a business.  I would highly appreciate your opinion and experience, if you have already done this before yourself.\n\nThanks for your time, and let the posting begin!\n\nEdit : These thoughts drove me to quit my job, and start looking into these things. 
5	1) Look up the Small Business Development Office in your area (if you’re in the U.S.) - they offer free resources, classes, and sometimes mentorships. \n\n 2) Complete a business plan. A full, REAL plan. Don’t BS yourself - it’s your future, not a class assignment. Do your homework. If you’re excited enough about an idea to do the paperwork, it’s an idea that just might stick.\n\n3) DO something. Anything besides sit in your head and dream. \n\n4)Expect to make mistakes. Be ok with it. Learn and move on. \n\nGood luck!
4	From *Entrepreneur*: [How to Write a Business Plan](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/247575)
3	Having done this many times myself it really depends on what you are trying to do, and what type of lifestyle you are trying to live. Essentially you have two options:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Raise venture capital investment funds in an attempt to go big or go home\n2. Build a business that you (and partners) own totally yourselves (called bootstrapping)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've done both. And number two is what I recommend for most new people to business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo bootstrap a business, don't write a business plan. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFind a problem, and then try to solve it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlways start with a specific problem. It's literally that simple. It could even be a problem of your own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce you have the problem, think about your audience and if there would or currently is enough demand if you created something to solve that product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you do the research and the audience is big enough, next think about potential products that you can sell to solve the problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI prefer building products in media (info-product/courses etc). Physical products are a lot harder for beginners, and don't scale up as fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce you've got a product idea, do the numbers on how it's margins. Think about marketing spend etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere you should do back of the napkin maths, not a finance plan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow you have a product idea, you need to think about your customer avatar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni.e. Who are you talking to?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWrite down who this person is. For example, Mary, 19, she lives in California, went to college, has anxiety, feels her parents don't understand her, Instagram is getting her even more stressed, she loves Kylie Jenner and so on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWrite a specific person, NOT demographics like 18-25, female etc. That's too broad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou now have a potential product that you can produce, some basic financials and a target customer avatar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext stop is to learn about sales copy and marketing BEFORE you make the product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLearn sales copy and run some FB ads targeting your avatar to a sales page about your product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSell a few products first, and then give them a refund, and tell them it's actually no longer available.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis validates your idea without you have to produce an actual product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have enough interest in your product, then produce it and start selling it for real.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's a basic route to starting a business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is more to learn but that keeps it simple for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou'll learn as you go along. It's the best way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck!\n\n&#x200B;
3	There are plenty of books telling you step for step about how to start a business. Use those steps and further elaborate on them by yourself. Personally i recommend everyone to learn about taxes as an entrepreneur and general business law. Never forget: what you don‘t know will cost you.
2	Go read a book.  Also get an idea.
2	If you're asking about practical steps to start a business, I wonder if the ENTJ and ESTJ subreddits might also be able to provide some insight.\n\nIt's hard to give advice if you don't know the business idea, as that may impact things significantly. In addition to the advice already given, I'd say you should turn your mind to:\n\n1. Preparing a budget. You'll need to calculate your likely revenue, your expenses, cash-flow, assets and liabilities, etc. This should all be a part of your overall business plan. I strongly suggest hiring an accountant.\n\n2. Figuring out your actual financing (e.g., source of funding). Are you going to take out a line of credit from the bank? Angel investor? Crowdfunding? How much will you need, based on your financial plan? How much debt can you carry? You will definitely need a separate bank account, at the very least.\n\n3. Arranging space and supplies. Yes, this could be a home office, but you may be better off renting some office space, depending on your needs. I would also think about obtaining any equipment that you consider necessary. Keep any receipts as well; they may be tax write-offs.\n\n4. Deciding on your legal structure. Are you going to be operating as a sole proprietor? A corporation? Some kind of partnership? Different structures have different advantages and disadvantages and it'll be important, moving forward, to know which one is best for you. I strongly advise hiring a lawyer.\n\n5. Making sure that you're compliant with the relevant regulations, depending on what industry you'll be operating in. For example, if you're going to be issuing securities of some sort, you should probably comply with securities regulations (e.g., register the business and file a prospectus to your jurisdictional securities commission, etc.). A lawyer will help with this as well.\n\n6. Obtaining insurance. Again, this will depend on your industry. At the very least, you should give it some thought in case things go belly-up. \n\n7. Hiring people. This may not be applicable if you intend to be the only person working at the business for the foreseeable future. However, you may eventually need to think about hiring people and all the risks having employees carries. This could be a whole other topic unto itself, tbh, as could almost any of these other points.\n\n8. Marketing. *Do not forget marketing*. It could be social media, social networking, word-of-mouth, your face on a bus, whatever. Some of the best business advice I've ever gotten is not to skimp on the marketing. You will need customers if you hope to make any profits. Although I've listed this item last, I would spent a considerable amount of time, money, and brain power on it, unless you have an existing customer base/a steady stream of contracts already.\n\nBasically, there is a lot.
2	The answer is simple. Do NOT disregard the actual business idea as you are trying here. Executing your business idea, the solution that you are offering to companies or people, will guide you towards your path. This is all that matters: giving your customers a good solution to their needs. If you start from that point, the rest will fall into place along the way. \n\nDon't bother with elaborate business plans and all that nonsense. It's a recipe for analysis paralysis, especially for entps. You got an end goal (the service or product you will offer to clients), just focus on the next small step you can take.\n\nIf you want to read a book, read exactly one: The Millionaire Fastlane by MJ DeMarco. No other general business books, that's just more procrastination. 
1	Updated response. I'm still thinking over the responses. I appreciate the advice and time you have provided me.
299	Mmmm that 'crastination tho	
24	The Ne is strong with this one.
13	Why not producti-crastinate?
3	The Te users be recrastinating
2	Ne is always like LOOK AT THE NEW THING while Si gets left behind. Ti and Fe are up for analyzing and socializing with the new thing.
2	Hey can you add a comment that will satisfy the Ti rule? Thanks!
1	This is brilliant 
1	You're a pro either way, I don't see anything to worry about 😎
3	How to NOT diverge and how to not offend ESTPs girls?	Okay, this is a simple question, and I believe everyone who reads that will understand what I mean, however I must note, that I want the specified answer for "When doing a presentation, how can one not diverge from the main topics?".\n\nOh also, I cannot understand why ESTPs tend to take our arguments so serious and are easily sensitive when we are making points that goes against their vision. Principally ESTPs girls. It stresses me out, but I know that is a problem, normally I become passive-agressive when talking but I do know that's a bad thing also. One of my best friends is actually an ESTP, funny enough but whenever I talk with a girl that is an ESTP and try to debate something they feel like we are acting superior to them (OK maybe some of us do, but that's not the point because I hate that approach), I mean, yeah I know I can be arrogant, but that's because I try to be the most realistic possible with myself, even when talking to my friends I always like to spot my own mistakes and how we can evolve as a group and not as an individual but it seems the egocentric world of a ESTP girl is to much when their reality starts to fall down and thats for me is to much to handle. I mean yeah they are visionaries like us, but their ego, oh boy their ego. Last time I got heated is because of how ignorant they can be, maybe is me, I seriously don't know, I just want another point of views from you guys and if someone have had the same problem. Oh also, they seem to hate when we steal their spotlight.
6	> but it seems the egocentric world of a ESTP girl is to much when their reality starts to fall down and thats for me is to much to handle. I mean yeah they are visionaries like us, but their ego, oh boy their ego\n\nThis isn't ESTP. \n\nESTPs are Fe users just like ENTPs - i.e. not egocentric. The girl you're describing is probably ESFP.
5	Interesting. This has not been my experience with ESTPs. We typically have a mutual respect for each others viewpoints and they only get offended when you underestimate their abilities (like an ENTP). Yours sounds more like an ESFP than an ESTP.
2	Simple question, simple answer. Tell them what they want to hear. Really works on any type that's fussy so you can avoid having arguments over stupid shit that you don't really care about.
2	I am seriously confused as to how you would offend an ESTP as an ENTP, when you both are similarly annoying.\n\nThe ESTP is the one pinching, poking, and punching you all day to get a reaction.\n\nThe ENTP is the one making jokes, using wordplay, and using mental tricks on you all day to get a reaction.\n\nSame shit, different process.
1	You sound like my ESTP friend describing me (im ENTP, like you).
1	The only experience I‘ve had is that somehow all ISTPs I‘ve met until now treated me with suspicion. They kinda acted like we‘re opponents, with no reason known to me. I force them to be my friends though. And i always somehow annoy them. But that‘s because they’re Introverts, I sometimes accidentally cross the line
1	I think you'll have a real hard time offending ESTPs. Sounds like Fi. 
13	Think I might understand Ne dominance finally: one or two last questions.	If Ne dominants are like crack addicts for chasing the unconscious feeling of possibility, do they know what the possibility they are chasing implies? For example if you get the intuitive feeling to kick a ball down a hill to see what happens, are you aware of the possibilities? Are you even concerned with the possibilities that might arise, or is it simply an overwhelming drive to just kick the ball and see THE exact possibility that does in fact arise? This would make sense for Ne data gathering.\n\nAfter that data point is observed is it stored within the judging function models of objects which are less conscious in the Ne dominant compared to the Ti dominant. I.e. it is sort of unconsciously integrated into your understanding of gravity? Or is it stored subconsciously into Ne and over time you get better and better at predicting what will happen despite still desiring to see the possibility that does actually occur(once you kick the ball down a hill enough times you know roughly where it will land and that it will drop with gravity, so you just extrapolate the data despite wanting to gather one more data piece)\n\nNe's desire is primarily gathering more Ne data, and then they likely utilize this stored Ne data towards Fe goals. The Ne data gathered or tended towards at any given point will also be primarily Feeling driven followed by thinking's efficiency evaluation within the context of feeling's current value orientation to objects.
6	I skimmed. Raw intuition leads you to what's good ideas, you get more excited when there's more promising things.\n\nHowever Ti helps make it more concrete and explainable, it helps you not just be a gut feeling you can't explain to anyone. 
2	I, personally, wouldn't characterize Ne-dom as "crack addicts for chasing the unconscious feeling of possibility". Ne is, many or most times, subconscious or unconscious. Ne is *always* observing what happens, whether we want to or not; like breathing. Sometimes, we just happen to become really interested in what we're observing and actively pursue something new. Ti is what allows us to analyze whatever patterns we've consciously or unconsciously picked up on.\n\nTi-dom goes into the world with a PREformed opinion; secondary Ti analyzes *after* observation.\n\nThrough much NeTi observing/analyzing, we (ENTPs) eventually develop reliable predictions for cause and effect... that, yes, help with Fe goals, but not after MUCH trial and error through our youth.\n\n>The Ne data gathered or tended towards at any given point will also be **primarily Feeling driven** followed by thinking's efficiency evaluation within the context of feeling's current value orientation to objects.\n\nNot really. Facts are much more valued than how we *feel* about said facts. We use facts to inform our decision-making. We may want to be in harmony with the group, but the group is so often at odds with facts. We learn, through NeTi trial and error, how to navigate human interactions - or group interests (Fe) - more fluidly, but our truth-speaking is what consistently gets us into trouble with Fe/Fi-doms... who DO use their feelings to guide their decisions rather than observable facts.\n\nEdit: "possibility" can mean many things (I think you mentioned that in a previous post)... if I do A, what will happen? at some point, we observe that B and C happen when A happens... and then we wonder if D could also happen... it's like unraveling a spiderweb... at first, we only see a couple threads, then we see more threads and involuntarily wonder if there are even more... eventually, we see the pattern of the whole web... and then want to or can't help but realize THERE ARE ALWAYS MORE WEBS
1	too tired to understand the second and third paragraph, but to answer your first question:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I'd kick a ball down a hill then I am aware of the possibilities (not all, because who can know all?), but I kick it to find out which of them is correct =)
5	Any advice for an 18 years old ENTP?	Any advice for an 18-years old ENTP?
21	You're not as cool as you think you are when you feel cool.  You're not as bad as you think you are when you feel bad.  You might be as stupid as you think you are when you feel stupid, but it's unusual.  Nobody can tell you're faking the confidence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo the dishes.  Make a place for your keys and make sure they ALWAYS stay there when they are not being used.  Become anal about this or you will spend a lot of time waiting for AAA.  Come to think of it, make extra keys too.  Just in case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoney matters if you like eating.  Cash = freedom.  Find a job that isn't heinously awful, learn it, and do it.  All it has to do is provide you with what you need to be free outside of it.  Props if you can save up and retire early (see [r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence)).  When you start an important project, promise yourself a treat if you finish so that you don't forget it halfway through.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all I can think of while I procrastinate and avoid my important projects.
10	No one else really cares about your life the way that you do. Don't wait around for anyone else to take charge of it. **Never** *allow* anyone else to take charge of it. Learn the word 'no' and use it about as often as you exhale.
6	Love will find you the moment you stop looking. Make yourself better by learning, reading, watching. try to not argue in a negative way. Try not to be toxic in a relationship, ENTP types are great at manipulating partners to get outcomes. But turns out that isn't a good thing. Learn to enjoy life in your own way, and listen to your gut.\n\nAnd you learn so much more by shutting your mouth and listening, But chime in if you feel passionate or necessary. I learned the hard way to not chime in with snarky comments or trying to feel superior. You are great but there are always tho who will be greater. Overcome that feeling of anxiety to blurt out and you will overcome all.
7	listen more than you talk. it wont happen but youll be better off for trying 
5	Grammar maketh the first impression. 
9	Hold on tight it’s gonna be a fucking wild ride.
3	When I was 18, i was lost. In my family, in my life. \nSomehow I am still, but I learnt, it's ok to be the stranger. \nTalk to people instead of asking them. And let a person talk, even it itches. \nLearn to understand people. In your eyes they might be wrong, but they wouldn't have come so far, if their way of doing things was stupid. \nAnd find that seed that make you handle stress and ease your things. Let it grow to a tree that you will stand strong in the wind of uneasiness. It came to me when I realized: "i didn't choose to do that (certain thing) to be stressed in the end"\nLife is never easy for us, because we see problems everywhere. But we are so welcome often, because we can help so much with our different point of view. \nDon't overvalue your opinion when you get in an argument, because your opinion changes soon anyways. But stay persistent with your values. These values you think would make your environment a better place. You have the strength to defend them\n\n 
3	As a 19 year old entp who is living on his own working two jobs trying to get established on the other side of the country from home, idk man. Lots of trial and error comes with becoming your own person. I've found that advice for general stuff is pretty difficult to apply because until it smacks you in the Si-inferior face it feels irrelevant and uninspiring to have someone tell you do the practical things(like when models tell their followers on Instagram to drink enough water every day if they're feeling depressed lmao) in life that we all know to do and have had our ISFJ mothers remind us of every day for our entire lives. 
2	self discipline seems to be important. I'm 20 and so far I haven't found reliable ways to work around it.\n\nmaybe because that's literally the point tho, still trying to figure that one out.
2	Learn to develop some routines. We tend to lack physical self-awareness, which can lead to neglected health and what my mom calls The Sloven. I think this is part of why we're accused of being undisciplined. It's not that we don't care. We simply don't notice. If I become aware of a deficiency, I figure out a routine that compensates. Like, don't go to bed with dirty dishes, or, call/text Grandma every Tuesday. \n\nAt this age you might also read 7 Habits of Highly Effective people. I was forced to read it for a class when I was about 18-19, same time I took my first big MBTI. You may find that 90% of it is Book of Duh stuff. What I found useful is the idea that you structure your daily life so that "urgent" issues (things we ignore until they're a massive problem) don't eat up time better spent on "important" issues  (all the things ENTPs need time and headspace to explore). This is where routines that take care of the banal stuff have saved me a lot of hassle. 
27	Fun take on traditions	
6	This is what living with Asperger's and taking everything literally is like.
3	Please add a comment that will satisfy the "Ti rule." Thank you!
2	Wtf
2	I’m cracking up at this 
2	This is my favorite thing ever. Thank you for bringing light into my life today.\n\nP.S. Seconding u/curvesofyourlips, please slap a short description on this post.
13	ENTP are difficult to manage	Interestingly I recently realized that all my line managers had a very hard time to manage me. The good ones where the ones that said:\n- It is difficult to always find something new for you. You are always on the new/research projects I have...\n- I know you are underchallenged, I will support you for the next senior role....\n- You really need a different kind of brainfood...\n\nThe bad ones just tried to muzzle me (I quit).\n\n\nSomehow I feel bad for a person needing to manage an ENTP (or me). What is the way to be a good linemanager for an ENTP?
15	You don't manage ENTPs, you release them into the wild. Is there a problem? Tell the ENTP about it, maybe a week later it won't be there anymore.\n\nGet them involved in the decision making process. They will be able to pick out the best solution in the room if they don't make one themselves. 
5	Well, I can't even manage myself.
4	Yes where I talk freely it can go one of two ways... they either can’t stand me (because I’m much better than them) or if they are confident they will be semi equals and see the value in what you say (even if they don’t agree).
3	Here’s the other side.  \n\nAs a manager, sometimes you just need something done.   You don’t need it done more efficiently, or in a totally new way that’s better.  You just need it done.  \n\nSo what’s bad about EPs (not just entps) is when that outward confidence is actually masking incompetence.\n\n“Yeah, I got a better idea.  We can do XYZ instead.  *Trust me.*”\n\nOne month later the idea still isn’t implemented because the EP is actually full of ideas, but lacks the knowledge to implement them.  Then as a manager, you’re the one getting blamed because it was your responsibility to get the job done.\n\nIf your manager needs you to shovel snow, he’s not asking you to invent a flamethrower shovel that will make it “totally easier”.   He’s asking you to shovel snow.  \n\nThat said, anyone who is competent at what they’re doing isn’t usually stuck low on the totem pole forever.   But you usually have to start there.
2	I pissed of my direct manager so much.. I am lucky our boss knows me and I am free to do and say what I think is right
2	We fuck up the eco-system with our ability to solve people & things.\n\n\n
1	What type of work do you do? 
7	What was the most unexpected/abnormal type you have fallen for? Why? How did it go?	As in you fell for a person that you wouldn’t usually fall for. What made you do it? How did it all go?
6	This is genuinely something I don’t do on purpose, but I’ve never been romantically interested in anyone outside of the IxxJ realm except for one time when when I started having a major crush on my ENFP friend in High School. It was a long, long process before I realized I had feelings for him because I just...idk...I’ve never really been interested in other extroverts. It’s always been “Okay, cool. That was hot. I’m gonna go now” like some ESFP whore.\n\nThis ENFP was definitely way, way more intense than any IxxJ I’ve ever been with but omfg the DRAMA that an ENFP can create. Literally anything. ANYTHING! Constant fighting over the dumbest things imaginable. And I never felt any real emotional connection with him because when you’re with an ENFP, you’re constantly in Ne mode and anything deeper just ends in disaster. I cannot *imagine* that I would ever be happy in a long term relationship with an ENFP.\n\nThat being said, in the end we remained really good friends and still talk all the time (I was actually a best man at his wedding a few months ago), but looking back on it, it was mostly just because he is literally model tier attractive. I never would have been with someone like him if it weren’t for that, tbh. Shallow? Probably. I was 17, ok?\n\nMy bi-ENTJ buddy constantly insinuates that he wants do stuff with me and always flirts but I’m just not in him. Like in the slightest. Can’t we just talk about like...philosophical shit and our beliefs? God damn.\n\nIxxJs are just way easier to handle and I’m naturally more attracted to them even if I do truly, honestly, and full heartedly, think INFJs are a complete waste of oxygen. ;)\n
4	My most toxic relationship was with an ENFP. \n\nWe met school, where we were both living on campus. It's a small school, so we were bound to meet.  I knew that he wasn't relationship material, and I frankly wasn't ready for a relationship anyway. (I really enjoyed my freedom and flirting). He was also self-described as 'off the market' because he was in the military. (Red flag alert)\n\nBut I fell for him because I saw the passion inside him, and I saw his caring nature.  He fell for me for my honesty.  Our relationship was passionate; it was fire. And honestly I've never had a better sex life than I did with him.  (Spontaneity is a virtue).  I had many alarms go off in my head, because I knew he was not a match for me. But I ignored them because things were great. Or at least I thought they were.\n\nHe was aggressive with everything he did, and sometimes it was good and exciting, but sometimes it was very, very bad.  But he kept me distracted. I was always in for a wild ride, and that was fun. I never knew what to expect. He showered me with gifts, and always left me sweet notes.  But we argued. All the time. It was exhausting and took time away from things that I actually needed to do.  I found that I was always trying to tame him and reason with him, because he could be incredibly insensitive and he often acted on emotion before thinking it through.  A major problem was that he lived a sheltered, privileged life, and was ignorant about a lot of social inequalities, as well as the complexities of gender and sexuality.  And his stubbornness made it very hard for him to change.  But at the end of the day, he would have some clarity, and would usually come to the conclusion that I was right about whatever it was he challenged me on.  (I don't need to be right, and honestly it sucked that I was right that much of the time.)\n\nI helped him grow as a person, but the arguments were always there.  I felt like were like Noah and Allie from The Notebook.  The only problem is that they had a toxic relationship. Full of passion, but toxic. \n\nHe claimed to be good at communication, and we both took pride in the way we could talk/argue about anything and feel better afterwards.  But one day he got he letter announcing his deployment.  He went away for training a couple of times, and things between us got pretty bad.  I flirted with a few people and he found out by looking through my phone. I'm not a dishonest person, but I felt that I couldn't tell him because of the way he reacts immediately on emotions.  And because he was already acting different and we didn't have as strong of an emotional connection. After that, he lost trust in me, which really wasn't fair.  He got physical with me right before he left for deployment, but I forgave him because I knew he was different at the time. A different headspace.  \n\nWhile he was away, he was verbally and emotionally abusive.  I knew when he stopped loving me, but I wanted to make it work, and didn't think it would be fair to his old self if I left him when he wasn't quite himself.  The abuse continues. He started to think I was the spawn of Satan, and was convinced that I was cheating on him. All he did was argue and yell and call me names over the phone.  And every time he blamed me for the argument, for the reason things weren't good between us.  I tried everything I could to save the relationship, trying to look at it from every single perspective. Eventually he broke up with me.\n\nThe problem with ENFPs is that they can only give you the extremes. When things are good, they're amazing. But when they're bad.. 
1	An E / ISTP... The relationship was in a vacuum since it was an affair...\nBut we click well even in arguments...\n\nSince getting a divorce 2+ yrs ago, I met another E / ISTP... (@24..1/2 my age)\nI can't stand her 1/2 the time.. \nYet we hang out a lot...
1	 ISFP . Idk if I was attracted  because his sensitivity (what I sometimes lack )or just because of his looks . It went terribly of course he could not handle my effervescent and critical personality.  A complete waste of time for me.
1	I've fallen for an INFP, which completely caught me off guard. In fact, it took me 2 years to realize I'd fallen for him, so yeah being taken off guard would be an understatement. I usually hate feelers due to many (not all) of them being overly sensitive and they tend to easily get defensive (from my experience). We're decent friends, but don't talk much anymore. Back when we did talk; however, we get along extremely well and our conversations were full of laughter and smirks. Unfortunately, we tend to both be a little awkward at times...\n\nI don't plan on making any moves.
28	Hello forlorn lovers of ENTPs, a friendly reminder	/r/mbtirelationships is a better place to post your tales of romantic woe.\n\nJust noticed a recent flux for the first time in a couple months and thought I'd remind you! 
23	Ah, yes. A subreddit with 600 subscribers and a post every five days or so with little to no responses is a much better place for people to get advice.
13	Thank the gods
1	I do offer some advice where possible but a lot of these posts are poorly framed, with no effort put in and frankly retarded. For instance my bf is like a robot and doesn’t respond to my texts or plans... what do I do btw I am a IS** or whatever. What should I do? Ummm ... perhaps find someone more suitable?!\n\nAnd then lots of people not understanding the vague post start vomiting their own random views.
34	The One Thing Holding ENTPs Back From Success	Ideas. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd why do you have so many ideas?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot boredom. But fear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHolding on to eight ideas and plans out of fear. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSemi-believing it's possible to execute them simultaneously. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFear of doubling-down on just one of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThinking that having eight plans is going to make you more successful than actually doing one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfraid of going into the darkness. Where it's lonely. Where you have one idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat needs five years of work before you achieve success.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThinking you can run two or three businesses at once first time around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTelling yourself that they can build a business and go from fat to great shape in weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's all fear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd an ENTP you are terrified to enter into the darkness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut that's where the good stuff is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause if you haven't entered the darkness recently, then you're not growing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not about how many personal development books you've read.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not about how many great ideas you have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's about challenging yourself to understand your weakness and act on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be able to prove to yourself (not others), that you're not afraid of having one idea and one thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if do that one thing for at least five years you'll probably have some success.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo forth. Walk into the darkness. Don't look back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuccess awaits you there.
10	I enjoyed reading this.\n\nSincerely,\n\n from an ENTP who has walked into that darkness you speak of. 
7	I once read procrastination is not a function of fear of failure but possibly a fear of unimaginable success. I’ve always found that thought provoking.
12	Nah mate, it's definitely boredom. Once I figure it out putting the work is just tedious and boring. Nothing to do with fear.
4	Honestly, I've hypnotised myself with a video on youtube to stay focused...that seemed to work 💁
3	I dont because \n\nshiny\n\nTired\n\nShiny\n\nKids\n\nShiny\n\nTired\n\nOmfg tired. \n\nOne day I'll have the energy to do all the things. Maybe in 1.5 years even\n
3	It is fear. Overcoming fear hurts. It's so scary. Fear and lack of confidence prevents us appreciating the process and understanding how to overcome what you're afraid of is how you make meaning out of your life
3	For me personally, it’s due to the fact that settling into any sort of routine makes me come to terms with my own mortality. The idea of doing some activity, repetitively, over and over, for a long time feels like a terrible use of my time when I might have maybe 40-50 quality years to live tops. Especially if it doesn’t make me feel especially happy, fulfilled, validated, or excited. \n\nI know I will eventually die, and the idea of not “getting full” before that happens fills me with some pretty intense existential dread. I do new things all the time that scare me, I try to get outside of my comfort zone all the time. I apply for jobs I know I’m not perfectly qualified for. I get emotionally involved with people I know may hurt me. I take on projects that I know I might fail horribly. I take on workloads that Might burn me out. I ask people to dance with me who I know might reject me. Failure is a very real possibility but I’m not really afraid of that because I’m good at most of the things I put my mind to.\n\nI definitely have fears, I’m afraid all the time. I’m afraid of getting complacent, I’m afraid of becoming mediocre, I’m afraid I’ll eventually stop caring, I’m afraid I’ll stop having a positive impact in peoples lives, I’m afraid of being alone, I’m afraid of waking up at the age of 60 and realizing I’ve wasted my life in a job I hate, or married to someone I don’t really love, I’m afraid of all of these things, but most of all I’m afraid of not trying, and not doing enough before I die. 
2	I’m writing this before I read any other comments. This hit something in me so I plan to write a bit.\n\nWow. That rings extremely true... for the past few days I’ve been very honest with myself and I’ve got to the point where I do see that fear is holding me back, beyond having paralysis by analysis. I’ve got an unlimited amount of ideas, and some I’ve even pursued!\n\nI took a part time job that I really don’t like, the pay is pretty bad and is extremely boring. I’ve stuck with it because I “think” I can make more $$$ by becoming a producer, but in reality making more money won’t take away the bordem.  The owner is a good person and probably sees that I could help make him some money, but the business model and day to day are extremely repetitive... \n\nPrevious to this job I was applying to front end development jobs but was unsuccessful in landing a job let alone any interviews. After 2 months of looking I gave up and looked for an easier route. Which landed me at my part time job where I do nothing that I really like to do. I enjoy the people, and some of the customer service bits, they  are fun to work through but that’s about it. \n\nI feel like a wuss, I’m so afraid to pursue what makes me afraid. The rejection from all the dev jobs really dug into me, and since then haven’t looked back into that industry. But if I’m honest with myself even further back I only pursued learned development because I read there’s tons of job opportunities, and great pay. Again I think wasn’t being totally true to what I wanted based out of fear. Maybe I followed that based on the wrong things too.\n\nOn the weekends I’ve been helping my mom get her marketing back together for her real estate business. It’s been fun and I actually enjoy it. I can be very creative and come up with ideas for her. I’ve considered getting licensed and learning from her before she retires but I fear that I won’t be good at sales and won’t back any money. For years she’s told me that I would do great in real estate and my first toe dip in with this marketing stuff has actually been fun but I just fear screwing up when I dive all the way in...\n\n\nThanks for this post.  I’ve got to get ready to sit in an empty office and watch the paint dry.

9	Are sensors better at rote memorizing?	INTP here and I loathe mindless memorization. I desire to understand concepts before I commit to memory. I almost never use mnemonics or other tricks. I'll draw schematics to illustrate relationships and memorize those (ie  pathophysiology diagrams), but that doesn't feel like a trick because there's logic to the pictures. When it comes to academics, I live for the moving parts and cause-and-effect. \n\nBut where I struggle is when it comes to FAST rote memorizing. It seems like the sensor feelers in my life have no problem with it, but I find it disappointing and undesirable. Why is that? What is it about Se/Si that makes it so quick and easy? It falls apart, however, when I ask them to explain "why" or "how" and they have no idea. \n\nHow can I use Ti and Ne to be more like them when it comes to memorizing random ass shit? \n\nI don't know any sensor thinkers, but I imagine they have the best of both worlds.
4	Memorization is so difficult.  I can read something and understand it quite well, but if someone were to ask me to be very specific on the details I had read rather than the overarching theme or patterns I have discovered I might become a deer in the headlights.  Unless it’s one of my favorite topics that I have endlessly picked apart, memorization is a chore at best.
3	It’s easier for me to memorize and understand things when I can see the Ne-Ti “spiderweb”. Being thrown into some random ass concept with no basis makes my brain want to find possible/rational connections...but sometimes these concepts only want one “factual” solution. If I have the choice, I like to start from the bottom to the top because it allows me to go “this + that + that = this” at a rapid pace. But if I’m thrown into the later stages of a concept that I have absolutely no way of understanding and then suddenly people present the full data to me 10 minutes later, my brain can get a little jumbled because I’ve already thought of the “rational” answers...and now have to backtrack and completely throw these huge string of connections away that I’ve already deemed as the likely solution.\n\nBasically, I just fucking hate being thrown into situations with vague, broad concepts that could literally have a million different rational solutions but expect ONE answer and *only* one answer. Let the Ni and Te users do that shit.\n\nIt would be like if I was suddenly teleported in a race car in the middle of nowhere, told that I’m already halfway through a race that I only vaguely remember signing up for, and then told that at the end of the race I will reach some State on the East Coast and I will I WIN- and that I will “know” the finish line when I see it. Te users would be like “Okay this is weird but let’s go. That’s the only thing we can do.” I’d be like “Okay wait excuse me.” with everyone turning to look at me like I’m crazy “What the fuck is going on? Where was the beginning? How did I end up here? East Coast? Okay, okay...fine...WAIT! That sign says we’re in Texas. How long is this fucking race? What does the finish line even look like? If it’s as random as this situation then it could be like...A CACTUS OR SOMETHING. I’ll just “KNOW IT” when I see it?! WHAT??? WHICH STATE? HOW DO I KNOW THIS ISN’T A BIG SET UP? WIN WHAT??? I’M CONFUSED. I NEED ANSWERS HOLY FUCK.” and then them responding with “Why do you care so much? JUST RACE. STOP THINKING SO MUCH!”\n
3	Not sure about sensors generally, but this definitely seems to be true (based on anecdotal experience) for xSTJs. I think having SiTe or TeSi really helps.
2	I think anyone with first or secondary Te is probably pretty good at memorization, and I'm not sure Se has much to do it. Ti is analysis and Ne is observation... so, I think you're right that *understanding* a concept is key to then proving you've mastered it while taking tests/exams.\n\nTBH rote memorization is a terrible method of learning. I can't understand why it was ever been put forth as the standard. Being able to sing some dumb song about, I dunno, the periodic table in no way helps you understand anything about it. The very fact these people can't explain it to you proves it doesn't convey true understanding. Clearly even *they* don't get it... but, good for them for being able to remember a weird little diddy?\n\nI wish I had something constructive to add here; just a bit of commiseration. The best road to learning is, obviously, *understanding*. Our education system (assuming you're in the U.S.) is in need of a major overhaul since it definitely sets people up for failure.
2	I can only memorize something if it lead to an "aha" moment of understanding.\n\nUnless it's for a play or poetry reading. I have to practice a shit ton, though. I also think it's different because it's for a performance and I'm trying to hit the right tone/message with my body and voice. So the memorization is a tool to get there.
1	Yes.
3	ENTPf in LDR with INTPm - Commitment Issues or something more sinister?	Hi, I’m an ENTP, F and I’ve been in a long distance relationship for two months with an INTP m (although we met and were in a non-LDR relationship for about 1.3 years before that). I love him a lot and try to express that to him often, but it is very tough right  now. He cheated about 8-9 months in, and I forgave him as I did have a lot of walls up in the beginning of the relationship/felt that I could have been there for him more. He was also a virgin before me and I think he felt insecure about it...\n\nAnyway, he moved across the country at the end of December. He kept asking me to live with him before he moved and with him across the country while he was moving, but I was still getting over the cheating at the time - so we decided to keep things going in a LDR. I wouldn’t move in with just any guy, esp if I’m not sure he’s serious about me. \nAlso, he promised me he’d be in my area for two years, but then left after 1.5 to “be closer to parents for a little while” and for a job which pays more than his current one. This flakiness has also made me unsure about my desire to live with him. He also had a weed and porn addiction which he admitted to me near the end of the time before he moved, the weed addiction has stopped since he moved and uh idk about the porn..... he says he’s gone no fap, but anyways —\n\nIt was going pretty decently (our LDR). However... he had some setbacks in finding a new job back in my area (he thought he might move back for an even better job in my area a few months after moving away?) ... and eventually he bought me a flight and a hotel to visit him next week. The flight leaves tomorrow. The thing is...I don’t know if I want to go and/or do this anymore. Since he bought the tickets, he’s been very distant by not picking while I call at night, and just keeps asking me to send him more pictures of myself instead of having conversations. He sends me lots of his selfies, and keeps requesting that I apply for law schools in his area even though it’s not sensible / do favors for him like send nudes or return his internet box router. \nWhen I told him I finally finished my law school essay after a year a week ago, he wrote back with a snide comment, then said he was joking. \n\nThe flight is tomorrow, but he didn’t answer my calls or messages at all today. I’m getting very bad feeling about him... and wrote him a message saying I’m just not going to go see him if he doesn’t care to respond to me. I know he shows care in his own ways. Such as offering to pay for my law school apps or giving me advice when I’m a little stressed about my ambitions. He’s asked me numerous times to live with him and even suggested we could get married if I would live with him. We’ve planned trips together, and would spend a lot of quality time together when we were close in distance, always going on dates and having nights in with long conversations into the morning, but I can’t help but feel like something is wrong here. He was very depressed in my area, still seems depressed, and keeps saying he will eventually move back to my area.\n\nWhat do you ENTPs guys think...? Am I just having commitment issues? Thanks in advance for any responses D;\n\nIk the title of this post is dramatic lol. But my feels are strong rn >.<
5	> I’m getting very bad feeling about him...\n\nGirl, three words:\n\nFollow\n\nyour\n\ngut.\n\nI'll admit that I see red flags in relationships before I see green flags. But I have never known a girl who regretted following her gut in a relationship. I've known plenty of girls who ignored their gut and regretted it, though.\n\nYour subconscious picks up on little details that your conscious mind can't. If you have a bad feeling, **there is a good reason.**
4	Dump him before he dumps you, win the game.
6	You asked me what I think and I will be honest. I think long distance relationships are large bags of bullshit surrounded by broken bags and even more bullshit, and at some point the bag breaks and sprays bullshit all over the place but nobody is surprised because it's just another broken bullshit covered bag.\n\nI hope I was clear enough.
3	OP your BF is full of shit and it has nothing to do with MBTI. From what you’ve written, he sounds like an incredibly selfish, immature person and it sounds like he has an avoidant attachment style.  \n\nHe cheated on you 9 months into your relationship. He only contacts you when it’s convenient for him or when he wants something.  He wants you to uproot your entire life and move to another country, when he was the one who unilaterally decided to move in the first place. And he can’t even be bothered to find a few minutes to answer your calls/messages when you try to make plans? Girl, no.  He’s just stringing you along because he’s afraid of the prospect of being alone or going through the hassle of finding someone else who will put up with this bullshit. \n\nDon’t go. Stay home, treat yourself to some nice wine/food, watch something stupid on Netflix and hang out with your closest friends.  Your time on this Earth is one of the most precious things you have. Don’t waste a second of it on people who will only dick you around and take it for granted.
1	Please post this sort of thing in /r/mbtirelationships instead. Please and thank you!
1	He probably really likes you, wants to be with you, and not being able to, because of distance and your emotional unavailability, has driven him to the brink of insanity. Speaking from personal experience. I agree with the bullshit guy. Long distance relationships are torture, because you're always hopeful that there will come a time when you are together and things will be good again. At the same time, when you're not together, it feels hopeless, and you think you should just break it off and move on. Always toeing that line between hopeful and hopeless, it pulls your heart in every direction, and it is absolutely *maddening*. At least for some people.
43	[Slowly losing interest , in a job? ]	I've been working jobs for quite some time now.\nI've noticed that once the jobs starts to get repetitive, I start getting sloppy with my arrival times. At first it might be a minute or two late, then five, then ten.... eventually I become constantly fifteen minutes late....I end up talking to a higher-up about how I'm getting bored and complacent...and that I need something new to do....\n\nEventually I end up leaving the business without ever getting the change of work I was looking for inside the company.\n\nCan anyone else relate to this? Does this happen to any of you ? Any advice that I could take to assist me in this struggle?\n\nThanks m8's !\n
35	Pretty typical. For the first 10-15 years in my work history I not only jumped jobs every few years, I would entirely change what industry I was working in.\n\nThat being said, being able to stay engaged in a job in the face of total boredom/disinterest is a very important skill for an ENTP to master. 
14	I just got called into a meeting to discuss how to get my performance back to where is was about six months ago. I told them that the best way to do that is to make my job less mind numbing. They said they couldn't let me stop any of the mind numbing tasks I mentioned. I am now looking for a new job that is more active. 
8	Assuming you are all like me, it is quite a dilemma. Our passions can dim quickly, and our interests are vast, and we always want to explore new possibilities. \n\nI had a pretty dynamic job managing audio/video needs for events at a university for 5 years. so no super boring. But I left that to freelance in the film industry. As much as I consider myself a self starter, I know I’m not organized, and it’s hard to keep at it. I kind of miss having the structure and routine forced on me—took a lot less mental energy, and freed myself up emotionally to explore ideas and be creative in a way that I feel like I’m too drained currently to do. \n\nI’m a firm believer that work gives people dignity, and that idle minds and hands are the devils workshop. Without the structure of a job, whatever it is, you run the risk of spiraling into unhealthy mentalities, habits and routines. \n\nTry to get past the notion that your boring job is trapping you. In many ways, it actually liberates you to be pursue other interests without the guilt of feeling like a lazy bum. Don’t try to find interest in the job itself, but find interest in becoming the best at it. Consider what it means to be an expert in that workspace. What does it mean to communicate well? What does it mean to lead well? What does it mean sell somebody on a product? These ideas should interest you endlessly, if you are like me.
7	I definitely have felt this at almost every job I worked at. As a data analyst at a digital ad agency, I made it a point to speak to higher ups about different clients I would want to work on (lucky for me there was a variety of work on different clients... maybe look for a company like this). Since my performance on each client was good, I was able to move to three different clients in four years, which kept my interest up as I was learning new things, constantly growing and interacting with different groups of people.\n\n\nHowever, to be fair, my interest in my boss’ job waned as I learned more that being a director of analytics was more about sales and less about being creative and learning. I quit my job to study programming at a boot camp.\n\nNow, (five years later) after working at the same ad agency as a software engineer for a year and a half and  a number of freelance positions, I work at a startup of a company where I am basically sole engineer (CTO) for now, and able to make all technical and UI/UX decisions, which has given me a lot of freedom and learning opportunity.\n\nIt’s not been an easy road, but for now, I definitely enjoy the freedom to make decisions and to be trusted in this position
5	Happened to me all the time. You need a hustle and then eventually a business. Easier said than done, but start trying to figure this out now
5	The only reasons to have a *job* are to make money and acquire skills.  Now, if you've acquired all the skills you can get at this place, and you can make money somewhere else, get the hell out of there. Go and try to do something *really difficult*.
5	This is my exact situation right now! Problem is, I got my MBA on tuition reimbursement and have to stay for two years. If I don’t, I have to pay back half (My two years is up May 30 this year). Getting very sloppy and disengaged, but pursuing things I find interesting more and more. I’ve started building databases to solve problems, but I never quite finish them. Typical ENTP, in my opinion 
5	Oh boy! Finally something i'm an expert on! Yeah dude, i've had like 10 jobs at 26 and got complacent or resentful with them all. I'm just learning to focus on jobs i'm actually interested in rather than bullshit that brings in a paycheck / freebie suicidal thoughts. I'm not mature enough to have anything figured out yet but i've begun to realize the importance of an ability to be creative in my career. Still my greatest fear is never finding a purpose. 
2	Sounds like my entire career in a nutshell. 
2	I'm having trouble with this as well, so I'm glad to see I'm not alone!
2	We are (built) to find and build on our best selves... We have to continue to search for our purpose and or passion...\n\nIt's ok to do multiple things\n\nIt's ok to be different\n\nWe are not normal so we really shouldn't have to conform to the normal way of doing things\n\nBut always make sure you know can bring in ( money) while finding out  whatever it is you you like  doing... We can do it!.... We can do anything remember!... 
4	Jung on Ne	>Just as extraverted sensation strivesto reach the highest pitch of actuality, because only thus can the appearanceof a complete life be created, so intuition tries to encompass the greatestpossibilities,since only through the awareness of possibilities is intuitionfullysatisfied.\n\n"Yeah heh heh, surely my audience will get what I mean. I don't need to define possibilities nor actuality here, surely my audience knows my brain."\n\nOf course nobody took him seriously, I swear the dude doesn't know how to write.\n\nLike...possibilities towards a goal? Possibilities towards WTF ARE YOU SAYING GUY....jesus...so frustrating reading his shit.\n\nIt's certainly not ethical goals as he specifically says Ne and Se are to a large extent immoral relatively(as are likely all perception dominants, and probably thinking dominants until they recognize feeling).\n\nLike the dude is just gonna toss some generic term like that out there...the fuck man. Possibilities would have to be relative to something, so of course following this he proceeds to not define what that something is other than "intuitive guidance" aka referencing the thing he is defining in the freaking definition. How can a man so brilliant be so utterly unaware that his terms are so ambiguous...\n\nCan one of you please define what the hell an intuitive possibility is....
8	> so utterly unaware that his terms are so ambiguous...\nBecause he was an INFJ
2	Seems pretty straightforward to me. Am I missing something?\n\nActuality is what actually is. It's the physical. The concrete.\n\nPossibility is what is *actually* not, *physically* not, but potentially *is*.\n\n> Possibilities would have to be relative to something\n\nNo, I don't think so. Possibility just means it isn't actualized, but it could be.\n
2	Jung is trash. Beebe / Nardi / Linda are simply the best.
1	I don’t think Jung used the term “intuitive possibility”. Or at the very least, he doesn’t talk about intuitive versus non-intuitive types of possibilities, afaik. In the section “The extraverted intuitive type”, a possibility seems to be a scenario containing objects whose potential is unknown:\n\n>\[613\] \[…\] Because he is always seeking out new possibilities, stable conditions suffocate him. He seizes on new objects or situations with great intensity, sometimes with extraordinary enthusiasm, only to abandon them cold-bloodedly, without any compunction and apparently without remembering them, as soon as their range is known and no further developments can be divined \[…\]\n\n(He throws shade at every function; I’m sure there’s a more positive description somewhere, but for the purpose of defining possibility, I think this suffices.)
17	recently typed ENTP; help me understand things	I have noticed, from reading many of your posts, that the typical progression route through life for an ENTP is: \n\n\-thinking you are introverted \n\n\-spending a lot of time in your adolescence on the 'outside'\n\n\-coming to terms with who you really are in your 20s(-ish).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmy (20 M) route was much different. Im from a small, Canadian town, where everyone knows everyone and, as a result, it becomes tough to escape who you are (once you are labelled in a small town, you are normally labeled for if you return). I played a lot of sports, had a huge social circle, and was pretty popular in high school, but only because i was friends with the right people growing up. Since getting to uni, I have come to find I am nothing like I am back home; i got artsy, really into history as opposed to physics, and i turned into a huge 'hipster' (not liking popular clothes, music, etc just because they are popular). Likewise, I feel so brittle emotionally now as compared to winning the "i love myself award" in highschool (as voted by my peers - an award for, essentially, the cockiest person in school. I also was runner-up for athlete of the year). In hindsight, i think i developed an "i-was-popular-in-highschool-so-i-deserve-to-be-popular-now" mentality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have really bad depression and social anxiety that has never existed before and it isnt very fun to live with, if im being honest. i cant develop any relationships that arent superficial, i cant get along with any SJs, and my only two friends in uni thus far are two INFJs (i made both of them take the test). i really want to go back to the confident, happy, and albeit cocky person i once was, not this sad ball of sadness. oh, i also have a bad ego problem (caring what others think of me) that i believe stemmed from everyone telling me growing up. "if you dont be nicer, you wont have any friends." now i just feel infinitely fake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I know this is just a classic, humble-brag, entp-ridden wall of text, but I have nobody else to talk to about mbti/personality stuff. any advice?
10	Wait, so an ENTPs life ends in their 20's?
13	The secret to being happy is to, just be happy.\n\nI know I know it's not that easy bla bla bla.\nBut think about it, it's true.\n\nWhen ever I'm sad etc. , I try break it down with logic (typical ENTP thing to do)\n\nWhat will make you happy?\nWhy will it?\nWhat makes you sad?\nWhy does it?\n\nWhat can you do to make X better, why aren't you doing it?\n\nI live by this, find what makes you happy/sad and act on it.\n\nDon't sit around feeling sorry for yourself. Go and actively spend at least an hour a day working on your problems (even if it's reading a book about it)\n\n
5	I think the part about expecting to be popular in college because you were popular in high school is very insightful.  And you say that the part about finding yourself in your 20s doesn't apply to you, but it sounds like that's exactly what you're doing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGetting away from my small hometown (for college) was huge for me because it allowed me to figure out who I really was in the absence of all that (my parents, my status in high school, my failures, etc).  It's an opportunity you really only get at your stage of life before you are defined by your job, your marital status, your children, etc.  So figure it out.  You sound like a generally confident person.  Be authentic and the right people and the right opportunities will find you.  \n\n\nPS- Be nice to INFJs.  You will come to realize just how good they are at helping you figure out your emotions (because you are an emotionally muted a-hole probably - as we ENTPs tend to be) and they will always be there to lean on, to laugh at your jokes, and be the kind of friend you can have genuine, platonic or not, intimacy with.
4	This is depression. \n\nI experienced almost the exact same thing when I went to college and I became an alcoholic which I struggled with for 12 years. I was never suicidal, I just couldn’t recapture the guy that I was in my youth (extroverted, pragmatic, fucking happy...) and I hated living in my own head. \n\nI never took ADs, just pushed through it and found the other side. The depressive part of me is really useful now as an alternative lens to view the world. Therapy and 12 step didn’t work for me as someone that thinks ahead analytically. I had already worked out all of the things that I heard in those settings and realized I just needed to suck it up and apply it. \n\nI would suggest looking into therapy if that works for you, but also start reading more. Read about neuroplasticity, finding motivation, finding purpose, etc. If you’re a varsity athlete now, try to find fun in it. It took me a long time to take the stress out of sports and play in rec leagues for fun. And most importantly, find a safe place to be yourself. Be it people you surround yourself with or environments conducive to happiness, this will help you feel closer to normal. \n\nLastly, life gets a fuck of a lot better than where you are today. My wife used to tell me all the time “life’s not as hard as you’re making it for yourself” and goddammit, she was right. Get out of your own way, let people help you and don’t give up. 
2	You say you want to get back to how you used to be. There is no getting back to how you were before, but that’s a good thing. \n\nI went through a similar experience albeit at a different time in my life, I ended up practically alone for a year. I went to a small school, so once I messed up with my circle (it turns out being an asshole doesn’t bode well with the people around you, shocker) it was practically impossible to make new friends. As you mentioned in your post, it’s hard to shake your reputation. This caused me to spiral downwards. I was often told that I was mean, that I should be nicer to people. I think I prided myself on being an asshole, I didn’t see it as a flaw until I lost the people around me. I’ll tell you a secret, learning to be more diplomatic and agreeable in certain situations doesn’t compromise your integrity as a person. Make sure you don’t keep yourself on edge about being a “good” or “bad” person either, all that matters right now is you’re trying. Keep your debating spirit alive, but there’s a time and place for it.  \n\nHowever, loneliness is still a vicious cycle. \nYou end up terrified your attempts at getting to know people will be rejected, so you stop trying all together. Small interactions that may be an everyday thing can be seen as negative, you think the world is against you even if logic says otherwise. It messes with your mind as I’m sure you know all too well. It still has lasting effects on me to this day. \n\nDespite all this I’d still say I’m glad it happened. I’m glad because I’m not the same person I was before this happened. Your life has already changed, you’ve had new experiences, there’s no getting back to how it used to be. Analyze your situation, what’s stopping you from forming deeper connections with people? Would you really be happy in the first place if things went back to how they used to be? Think about it this way, when you get through this point in your life, you’ll come out a much stronger and socially adept person. You just have to push through and confront your flaws, there’s a reason why you’re in this situation now. It’ll be worth it.\n\nFor good measure, maybe reach out to a SJ you know, ask them out for coffee or something. I think concluding you can’t get along with certain people because of their type is a mistake, you never know after all. Reach out to anyone at all in a small way, do something you guys like together, people are more willing to be open than you’d think.\n\nThis ended up being longer than expected. It may not even resonate with you at all but I hope you gain something, however small, from my comment. Here’s to hoping for a better future.
2	Analysis paralysis is like that one annoying kid from middle school.\n\nJust ignore it.\n\nThe key to growth is incremental steps (and consistency). If you want to start getting your life on track, make small goals and then do them. Just do them. We all live in reality, not our heads. That means, any sort of action and actual result means much more than a thought.\n\nIf you don't know what areas you should be improving, here you go:\n\n1) Physical Wellbeing\n      a) Exercise - Lifting (I recommend starting    strength.)\n      b) Exercise - Sports (Team sports are a great way to fulfill part of your social needs.)\n      b) Nutrition (Cut the shitty stuff, add the healthy stuff [and drink more water {when you think you've drunk enough, drink more}].)\n      c) Sleep (Wake up at the same time every day. Go to bed at the same time every day. Get 7 hours minimum.\n2) Non-Physical Wellbeing\n      a) Mental Challenges - Logic Oriented (Take up a challenging mental activity like debate, programming, or my favorite: chess.)\n      b) Mental Challenges - Non-Logic Oriented (I highly recommend you invest in a musical instrument. However, other creative activities are great as well. Writing and drawing, for example.)\n       c) Social Needs (Humans are social creatures. We like being part of groups. Don't worry about this one too much, as you start doing all of the stuff above, you'll meet people doing the same things.\n\nDoes this seem overwhelming? Remember what I said about incremental steps. Start with the physical stuff, as it serves as a basis for all the other sorts of improvement.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing you posting progress updates.\n\n[Edit: This formatting makes my eyes hurt. I tried making it better, but it's still pretty shit. Hope you can read it. Also, philosophy is a big part of non-physical wellbeing. I recommend looking into stoicism--after you start with the basics: eat right, sleep right, and you'll be all right.]

1	You should go for school clubs that you enjoy, since you’ve gotten more artsy, try going for those kinda clubs. The way you were popular in high school was sports, because you liked sports and hence ended up with people who liked sports too. \nSame with the artsy stuff. Meet people with similar interests, you’ll most likely get along with them. As for social anxiety, that’s something you’ll have to work through. I did it by embarrassing myself in public a little bit. Of course what I thought was ‘embarrassing’ wasn’t that bad at all. \nI think the easiest advice and most difficult thing to do is putting yourself out there. ENTP or not, that’s something you’ll have to do. 
1	Any chance that you think you are living your ‘true life’ but it’s not really you? Perhaps you never had a chance to trully introspect and you’ve just entered a passing phase.
0	No, you scream ESTP/J. Firstly being popular in highschool, I was the biggest loner at that time. Only at 19 I became increasingly more and more extraverted and had like close to 50 close friends. Now at 21 I am very avoidant and stuck into a Ne-Ti loop. And through sports? ENTP's like to f-ing relax as a sport. Not to say I haven't lifted for a while, but I hate competitive sports because I'm a true N. You know how I know that: because i am avoidant, while you brag attention.\n\nSorry, but you are a... filthy Sensor. You just act depressive to attract attention. Typical hisitronic narcissist.\n\nYou enjoyed highschool popularity which is pretty much 50% of the entire life realized.
10	[INFP female] Need advice on how to deal with my ENTP boyfriend’s constant argumentative behavior…	Hey ENTPs. I’m hoping you all can help me here. \n\nAs stated, I’m an INFP girl, and my boyfriend is an ENTP who constantly argues with me. All day, everyday. Anytime I say something, he always has something smart to comeback with. I can’t win with him. It always ends up making me feel like I’m inadequate or stupid. And it’s about the most insignificant things too. \n\nFor example, I say he shouldn’t interrupt people while they’re talking because it’s impolite, and the response I get is — “Well if I don’t interrupt people and say what I have to say I’ll never be able to get my story across and I’ll forget it!” Or “I’m sorry your feelings got hurt but I’m not wrong.” \n\nIs there anything I can say or do besides having to cry or tell him my feelings are hurt when he pushes me to make me feel like I’m stupid every time he argues with me about everything? I know it’s an ENTP trait to be argumentative, but it takes a toll on me after a while, and I’m not good at comebacks and I use feelings when trying to defend my side, not logic like he likes…
27	I’ve been dating an INFJ for ~3 years now, and I think the biggest hurdle I had in communication was how to interpret her emotions. Whenever someone tells me they’re mad at me or I hurt their feelings or they didn’t like something I did, it always just felt like manipulation to me, or like they were trying to curb my behavior without understanding why I did something. It bothered me because I didn’t understand why she thought her feelings were more important than mine, and I sometimes felt that we both had different views of reality because she would appeal to me in her most fluent language (feelz) and it wouldn’t resonate with me because I felt my feelings on the subject were equally as significant, but she wasn’t interested in knowing about them. \n\nI think what ended up working out was I would ask her to tell me what she needs from me and how my doing that solves a particular problem. \n\nSo rather than: \n\n“it hurts my feelings when you said x”, which translates to me as “I don’t like when you do x, so stop”. This simply wouldn’t resonate with me because to me, plenty of things implied or not seemed to hurt her feelings, it just seemed like an easy excuse to always get her way. \n\nI would ask her to say: \n\n“ I need you to not dismiss what I say as trivial because it makes me feel like you don’t value my opinion” or something like that. That ends up phrasing the problem in a way that I feel like I can be cognizant of and in a way that I can sympathize with. \n\nConversely if I have a problem with something i will phrase my questions differently so that she doesn’t feel attacked. So rather than “I just don’t see why this bothers you so much” I would say “I can see that this makes you upset and I need you to help me understand what specifically about this has rubbed you the wrong way”\n\n\nIt’s gonna feel kinda awkward or goofy at first but it requires that both of you step out of your comfort zone with regards to emotional or logical language and frankly if you guys really care about each other and improving your relationship y’all both just need to establish sort of common/neutral language during disagreements. Otherwise you just end up arguing over misunderstandings which gets dumb because neither of you wanted to intentionally hurt the other person in the first place. 
18	Spray bottle with water. Bad ENTP! Bad boy!
8	Honestly it doesn't sound, based on your description, like you two are a decent match.  Maybe wait for someone who can actually appreciate you?  Sure his arguments may be his way of trying to impress you or something, but if it's making you cry and it's a personality trait, I wouldn't hold out for a change.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you INSIST on staying with this guy, try to not respond.  Arguments are no fun if you don't argue back, and that may help get the point across if you simply stop responding to him when he's being a jerk.  Practice a flat stare in the mirror until your expression can state, "I'm amazed by how stupid you are" without you actually saying anything.
7	How old are you guys? That'll help people give you advice. 16 is very different from 26.
13	It's not your job to make him a decent person. Being argumentative is not a healthy ENTP  trait; enjoying debating and verbal sparring is. There is a difference.\n\nAlso, beware of people who completely discount emotion and are all about "logic." Many people who claim to be all about logic think that they, as an entity, are logical, and so they believe cannot do anything illogical. There is a time and place for both. If he disregards your feelings that's a huge red flag\n\nIf you feel like you have to constantly have comebacks, that's not a good relationship.  Relationships are more than verbal sparring matches. They can be a part of it, to discuss issues and expand thought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I 'd drop him. 
6	He sounds immature and like he hasn't figured out how to navigate relationships with people unlike himself.  However, when you're trying to get your point across, it's useless to justify it based on your emotions.  You have to give him a cause/effect or cost/benefit analysis of the repercussions of what he's doing.  It's hurting your feelings SO you will now put some sort of boundary or distance between you and he and that will affect your level of intimacy.  You're bluntness alienates your friends SO you might not see them as often now because no one wants to be around that.  I don't know the specifics of your situation.  And these are simple things he should be able to figure out himself, but you might need to spell it out for him.
4	Lmao so many of these behaviors could be eluded by being a decent human being. "Im sorry but im not wrong" dosent mean that your smartass gets to cheap shot everyone not in the mood for a verbal fight.  Dude just needs to get bitch slapped in order to realize that there can always be a bigger dick than yourself, and that he needs to get friends with whom he can do this. 
3	Also an INFP female with an ENTP boyfriend here. \n\nWe had a few months kinda like this. We were both stressed and having difficult times. Now we hardly ever argue, especially not about things like that. He dialed it waaaaaay back. I think we’ve had one serious argument in the past four months. Communication is key. Have you talked to him about it? He might do the same. I would definitely give him some time to pull back on the behavior, but if he doesn’t even try he’s not going to (and doesn’t respect your needs). \n\nGood luck girl. 
2	/r/mbtirelationships may be a better place for this, please and thank you.
2	Ok, easy answer one is fight back, hit hard. He will respect you for doing that. He doesn’t understand that you’re not “equals” in how you interact. Speak his language, see how he reacts. If it’s badly, either go to counseling together or say good-bye. 
2	He sounds like me a bit. Just tell him how you feel, if he loves you he will try to mellow out and take into consideration your wishes. All relationships involve growing together and adapting. Fundamentally he has to appreciate your intuitive and feeling nature.
2	Tell him to be a better human being, to treat you with respect, or he is putting the future of your relationship on the line (which it sounds like he is, if you actually have to cry at him on a regular basis). His sense of entitlement about being heard doesn't trump your right to peace of mind.
1	Tell him your feelings are hurt and why. My wife does. I don't want her feelings to be hurt so I change my behavior. Allow him the chance to do the same, or to tell you he doesn't care. 
1	Sure, he can argue circles around you all day because that's what he thinks of as conversation, but that's not the point. You don't build a strong relationship by being the most "correct", you do so by supporting each other.\n\nHe's an ENTP... I guarantee that if he can get past arguing for himself he can argue for you instead. \n\nIf you're upset with something, challenge him to see it from your point of view and let him come up with it himself. \n\nI'm an INTP, and my boyfriend is ISFJ. A sensor! We had a lot of issues in the past. If he doesn't like how I do something, instead of being defensive, I make myself argue for him instead of for myself. For example, he's upset if I don't put things exactly back where they belong but in my mind it was a messy pile to begin with. Well, I've trained myself to see it his way - that pile is still part of his mental inventory and accounting of *his surroundings*, and if I fuck that up I am literally upsetting his dominant Si. That creates more significance in my Ti mind and allows me to remember how important it is. \n\nIf can do that for him, it's possible he can do that for you. \n\nOn issues like interrupting, I wouldn't even bother explaining, just point to some etiquette video on YouTube for how to interject politely.
1	So... you have to take a more logical, less emotional tack... and I'm not at all saying you shouldn't feel hurt by his behavior, only that he can't hear you when you speak Feeler language. Crying won't help; telling him he's being impolite won't help. Those things, on their own, are not "good" arguments. He feels self-righteous because he's delivering TRUTH... and our feelings about truth don't alter it.\n\nIn any case, he sounds inexperienced in learning how not to be ass.\n\nYou need to challenge him to be constructive. What's his purpose in going around sounding like a know-it-all all the  time? If he's not adding something of value to conversations and interactions, then his self-aggrandized truth-speaking is pointless if not detrimental.\n\nIs he trying to inform you or shame you when he argues with or corrects you? If his goal is to inform you, then he should learn to do it in a way that is constructive and NOT hurtful because that is counterproductive. People do not receive information when they feel attacked.\n\nBasically, he needs to pick his battles and be more intentional. Is it worth the conflict to *always* call you out and cause strife? Is he merely pumping up his own ego, or does he have *misplaced* but good intentions? If he has good intentions, then he should want to be a more effective communicator... and part of that is learning when to shut up.
1	I don’t know. My philosophy with people is to take them as they are and deal with it. You can accept it, or you can move on. \n\n
9	How many of you guys manage your own business?	I’ve became my entrepreneurial journey and it’s looking really hopeful. I constantly try to educate myself in order to build a sharper business sense. \n\nI’m curious to hear what your experience has been and what ventures you went into. 
9	I do. You have to be able to fairly fearless. As an ENTP, I learnt from working with previous ENTJ business partners that sometimes you just got to go with your gut. And normally everything works out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't over-analyse coulda/shoulda/woulda like ENTPs do. Just go balls deep and put your all into one-direction for a few years. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nENTPs are smart enough, but they can be too soft to push through the hard times when required. If that's you, then acknowledge it but push through anyway, and show yourself what you can be made of.
4	I partially own my own business (I'm a partially sole-prac lawyer). I just started recently, but it's going well so far. Luckily for me, I have a pretty good amount of work coming in. My advice to others is that networking is extremely important. I have a decent flow of work because people keep referring me files. People keep referring me files because, either having worked with me in the past or interacted with me in some other capacity, they're assured that I'm competent in what I'm doing. Moreover, I'm actually out there talking to people and seeing what is happening in the legal profession in my jurisdiction in general, as opposed to just... staying in my office over in one part of town, never really interacting with my peers.\n\nTalk to people in your industry who have also struck out on their own to see what they did. They will apprise you of potential mistakes. If you happen to work in a highly-regulated profession like mine, I would personally recommend calling your professional association/society/whatever to make sure you don't run into any easily-avoidable problems a year down the line. \n\nMoreover, I try to treat everybody, including opposing counsel, with respect. I've definitely gotten files referred to me just because people liked me better than somebody equally (or perhaps even more) capable of doing the work. I've also had *parts* of files referred to me (e.g., not a full case but a legal opinion), and I've really tried to impress in doing that work. Yes, I might - for example - spend 20+ hours on a opinion that I'm only getting paid $1,000 to write, but, assuming that the additional hours led to a better-researched/thought-out opinion, I'm more likely to get repeat work because my client (in this case, another lawyer/law firm/whatever) is impressed with my work.  \n\nI haven't had to advertise, but I hear it makes a significant difference if you're looking to go big. (I'm not. Law is exhausting.) Some of my friends/associates spend staggering amounts of money on Google ads, for example, to make sure they're the top search result when somebody googles lawyer for "X". It's a bit of a cliche, but being everywhere - and looking like you're already successful - is very powerful for attracting more business. In other words - be prepared to spend money on advertising and marketing. \n\nFinally, make sure you file your paperwork properly and hire an accountant. 
3	ENTP here, I’ve owned my business for 6 years now (3pl) and this year we are going to hit 8 million in revenue. Never thought I’d be saying that, but the best advice I can give is hire people that are strong in your weakness, always ask 3 people for advice but knowing the answer before asking, have confidence in your judgment and be a bull in a China shop. It’s 2 types of people in this world, people that makes things happen and people that lets things happen. Be the person that makes things happen!
5	I kind of am. I work as a freelance programmer. I say kind of because I got into a good company as a consultant and they find work for me and I just program. It's all work from home and I set my own hours, schedule. As long as I'm able to attend the client meetings. For me personally, I like it a lot. It's a lot of freedom and money.
3	I am trying to right now. Getting started is so hard when you have another full time job to deal with. Hoping the side business takes off so I can do it full time. Wish I had more advise ha. 
3	Running a business now with an ENFP and an INTJ. It is great, I really enjoy the freedom. 
2	I currently own an LLC, and I work as an Information Technology Consultant.\n\nI'm not rich in money.\n\nI am rich in time.
3	Using Si as a way to find common ground with people/connect	Do you guys find that you’ll often look back into your past as a way to connect with others? I do it a lot, and I’m starting to recognize it more as I’ve gotten more acquainted with MBTI. \n\nOr is this an indication that Si may not be my inferior function? Or is this a sign of aspiring Si? 
5	In my experience Si is always about me. Even when I feel nostalgic and think about good times with friends or family it is focused on it being part of the memories I have built. Maybe sometimes it will kickstart Fe and I will start thinking about someone I miss, but that's it. I think Si is my most introverted function because while Ti is introverted it can be affected by others when they convince me I was wrong about something, thus changing part of my understanding of it, but Si just stays there, always focusing on me, like a writer working on my biography.
1	I think my Fe+Si helps me connect to others, and is more used now that I’m in my 30s.  I also work retail where there’s a lot of old timer customers, and boy, some of those SJs sure do like to reminisce and you get on their good side by sharing your fond (or not so fond) similar memories with them
1	Or it could be Ne noticing pattern that people loves reminiscing into past and be comfortable with you easier than most method.\n\nI think Fe is catching people reaction during their interaction which us, Ne observing the pattern (You say A their reaction is Z etc), Ti & Si working together building the information library, Si is categorizing the pattern observed by Ne and Ti is deciding which sets of response you could use in predicted/familiar situation.
11	INTJ woman trying to understand my ENTP boyfriend	Hello ENTPs of reddit. I’ve been in a relationship with my ENTP boyfriend for 4 years now and have always been confused by one of his behaviours. When I’m with him I often talk about either random things in my day or strange ideas I want to share/discuss with him. More often than not I get either no response or a simple “hmm”.  \n\nThis also happens when I try to talk about things relating to our relationship. \n\nI’ve asked him before why he doesn’t engage in conversation when I’m trying to start one but all he tells me is that he simply doesn’t know what to say. On the flip side, he can talk forever about things that interest him, wether it be hockey, cars or any ideas he has been stirring up in his head. We also joke together a lot so that does get him talking. I love to engage him in these subjects but sometimes I want to have deeper conversations.\n\nHow can I bring out the side of him that loves to talk? Is he maybe interested in what I’m saying but would rather analyze it in his head than talk about it out loud? Is what I’m saying just simply not interesting enough for him to engage in? Or am I over analyzing this and he just really doesn’t know what to say?\n \n\nThank you, I’m interested in what you guys have to say :)
7	Hiyah, ENTP here. From experience, I can say he is definitely just in his head. When I was a young lad and something emotional was brought up, I’d find myself getting quiet and just thinking about it rather than expressing it all. I think when you bring those topics up, they’re something he feels deeply about and it throws him off, perhaps. ENTP’s normally have to sort their feelings out in their head first, especially something as his relationship. It’s nothing to take personally but I do understand the frustrations. I’ve had girlfriends get mad at me for this kinda thing before, the best is just letting him know how it makes you feel and trying to meet each other halfway. Best of luck 
14	4 years, had this always been the case? As a rock hard ENTP, the only reasons ***I*** can legitimately think of (maybe also depending on his age and the dynamic of y'all's relationship) either he might've internalized that you're overly sensitive and the typical blunt ENTP style would hurt your feelings so he holds his tongue or that happy wife happy life, meaning that even if she's wrong or her reasoning is stupid leave her be at least she's happy. Relationship my be getting stagnant and feels like he knows you enough to not need to try cause it'll be resolved on its own. Or he might be giving you subtle reasons to make you leave him so he won't have to, making you feel ignored since that seems to be an integral part of a relationship. He might be less assertive than typical ENTPs, he might not actually be an ENTP. Just some of my thoughts.\n\nI love talking and solving problems as efficiently as possible, so I can't relate to not talking I never shut up.
3	I think one possible explanation is that he doesn't find your interesting anecdotes that interesting and zones out/tunes you out. That happens to me all the time. I get really excited to talk about something I'm interested in, but when other people talk about something I don't understand or am not interested in, I become a reluctant conversational partner with monosyllabic responses. He could also not know what to say because he wasn't paying attention.
2	SombraRanma brought up a good point.  I know I clam up around people I perceive as sensitive because I know myself and I know I can't help but be contrary, glib, direct, whatever. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm married to an INTJ and I rarely feel that way with him.  I can tell him things that I know would evoke an offended response from most people and he will legitimately consider it and take it seriously.  It takes a lot to offend him and I'm the same way.  I think that's a common trait of INTJ as they tend to be pragmatic problem solvers and thus not rush to offense.  So for that reason I would dismiss the idea that he's trying to circumvent your sensitivities.   \n\n\nIn y'alls situation, I would say I would behave like him if I were simply uninterested which you hint at in your post.  Not that I don't want to hear what you're saying, I just have nothing to contribute because it doesn't get me going.  But I'm happy to listen about whatever you're interested in.  
2	He’s either not an entp or he is doing it consciously for whatever perceived gain or image he wants. I’d say the former. It being in his head is something that should be happening, but consistently all the time to where he isn’t talking? Nahh. 
2	Hi, here’s my input: I identify as an ENTP and I would say that we are quite adaptable. We also have difficulty trying to process anything related to the emotional aspect of anything, unless it can be logically processed. That’s just a reality. If the ENTP doesn’t have genuine interest in the conversation, they most likely won’t engage. They “pick their battles” so to speak. \n\nI’m just guessing he’s “adapted” to these interactions in your 4 year relationship. He may have possibly realized that he is an ENTP in a relationship and that requires balance in listening to their partner. He may be even “forcing” himself not to respond, just so he can simply enjoy your company and listen. \n\nI say this because when ENTP’s, like myself, go into a relationship, I tend to analyze and anticipate the “logically natural” way to engage certain conversations. So if it seems that we don’t care, does not mean we don’t understand. \n\nHowever, part of me, is also feeling that he’s not really an ENTP, cause we tend to want to talk about anything and everything. You shouldn’t ever have to bring out the side of an ENTP that loves to talk. \n\nTo me, you might even be the ENTP. 
2	I can somewhat see this is myself, it’s because usually if I don’t know enough about a subject I’m very hesitant to talk about it. \n\nIt’s not that I discredit someone’s idea or something, I just don’t want to say anything that will make me appear foolish. Guess it’s just an insecurity I have. Maybe it’s the same case with your boyfriend. Either way, if this hurts you, you should talk to him about it \n\nEdit: if you want him to engage more in the discussion, give him as much info on that subject. Try connecting your ideas with some of his so that he can make some sense out of them. 
2	I actually "hmmmm'd" thinking of a response. I can be verbally spontaneous but completely derp when someone tries to force something out of me.  Maybe pre-face topics early so he can come back later with discussion. Also, another ENTP that likes hockey :D!
3	[deleted]
1	It's one thing to enjoy debate, another to be a bully. He sounds really narcissistic. Being ENTP isn't an excuse for ignoring a clear boundary you pointed out to him more than once. Telling him to step off should have been enough.  \n\nWhen someone tells me I'm being too blunt or hurting their feelings, I back the EFF off, because why would I want to hurt someone I like?! I may not understand why it hurts their feelings exactly, and I may get carried away and go too far, but when they let me know I've ENTP'd all over them, I stop, and file it away as, "That particular thing hurts them, so don't do it." \n\nThere's probably nothing you can do to get him to change his ways because personality type aside, he's just not respecting you or your boundaries. I recommend distance, as in, "Boy, BYE." and don't look back. There are plenty of other dudes, even ENTPs, with respect for others. You deserve to be with someone who respects you and your boundaries. 
1	ENTP here, to me this "I don't know what to answer so I'll just say nothing"-syndrom happens every single day.\n\nHere's an example: My grandma asks me a question. I don't know the answer to it, so I'll just say "I don't know". When she asks the same question to my granddad, he also doesn't know the answer but will TRY to give an answer, like "hmm, maybe it was this or that or bli bla blub". It satisfies my grandma because then they'll further discuss the options and bla bla..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIdk, I really don't feel this. To me it feels dishonest, because then they make assumptions and base their decisions / emotions etc etc on that, even if they don't know if it's true.\n\nTo me this is kinda is dishonest, that's why I'm not giving answers / replies if I don't know what to respond.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nException: If I know what the other person wants to hear and I categorize my reply as a minor lie than I'll reply with what the other person wants to hear. But to do this I have to know the other person very well.\n\nExample: My mum bought a new dress. From her face and the way she talked I could "feel" (hehe) that it made her happy, so ofc I replied that it really fitted her. In reality she is beautiful anyway, doesn't make a difference if she is wearing that new dress or one that she already owned for Idk few years.. But I won't phrase it like this, I'll just say that it really fits her and that I'm happy that she got it.\n\nAnd because it doesn't matter in the big picture, it's not a decision that has a high chance of influencing anyone's life in any major way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: If I don't know what to reply, I'll usually reply nothing / say that I don't know. Everything else seems dishonest to me.
1	Please post this sort of thing to /r/mbtirelationships instead, please and thank you!
1	It’s possible he is also just being a guy. Does he do that with ALL conversations? Or just the casual ones. \n\nZoning out sometimes means he needs to put more effort to be open and emotionally available where it matters because that is what being in a relationship is all about. It takes work and perhaps he needs to see that. 
-2	Maybe because you are boring? ENTP dont really like to talk with boring people

4	(INFP) So I'm bored at work and I'm looking at different types and it occured to me that I really, really don't understand your's the most. I've met one tested ENTP in real life, and I'd really like to understand the internal mechanisms and drives better.	As far as the ENTP I knew in real life: We had the most bizarre friendship. We loved to talk about what was going on inside our heads, but he could be enough of a troll sometimes that I'd get kind of annoyed and needed a break. Admittedly, sometimes he thoroughly pissed me off. He was also super apologetic, though, if I voiced it. I loved shooting videos and music back and forth with him. He had excellent taste in stand up comedy. One of the few people in this world I've met to really understand when I said things that were dark or kinda mean but intended to be funny. I got rid of social media,  hence don't talk to him anymore.\n\nFun anecdote: When I first met him and I was still on facebook, he invited me to the most vulgar facebook group I'd ever seen. Like, within days of meeting me and having no idea what kind of person I was. I thought that was fucking hilarious and figured he must be a pretty unique person with no filter. I put a meme about fisting in the group almost immediately after just the fuck with him and see what he'd do.
10	We’re shitheads. 
5	INFP dating an ENTP. Pretty sure the dark humor is universal, lol.  He didn’t want to show me his old Facebook because of all the “edgy memes” — it took me a good few months to get him to accept my request (at that point I was basically used to the weird/dark/etc humor).\n\nI can’t answer the question as well as a real ENTP but I do know my boyfriend pretty well. They love debates and controversy and pushing the boundaries of what’s accepted. He will argue the opposite of what he believes sometimes just for the sake of argument. He’s also very matter-of-fact and blunt. He takes his work really seriously and gets super sucked into it (it’s both annoying and funny how often I’m competing with computer code for things like finance programs to get attention lol). He’s not very emotional but is also extremely compassionate — definitely a good thing when your girlfriend is a delicate little INFP flower with depression and anxiety. \n\nNot sure how much this helps but I figured I’d try ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
3	ENTP married to an INFP.  AMA.
2	INFP and ENTP relationships are interesting, and things like Socionics take note of this. According to that system, the relationship is called a "supervisor", if you will. INFPs can often be dissatisfied with the things ENTPs do, and ENTPs can feel controlled. Your experience sounds quite typical of this!
2	I don’t really care much for dark humour or racist jokes, I mean I get them instantly, def don’t get shocked but I find them kind of puerile. \n\nBut then again I find practical joke set ups such as ‘Who is America’ hilarious. I wonder if it’s the power element.
2	 I like to understand people because I see what they could be possible of and I want to help them achieve it. But I'm also big on not forcing it. More of a "Hey if you wanted to take the path of growth I think it's here."  I've been on a long path of self development and I love how it makes me feel so I like helping people be better versions of themselves.  It helps me feel like the shit I've been through has value if it helps me help others.\n\nI'm always working on ideas for how to push forward, both for myself and others.  I know we don't all work the same and so I throw out ideas until they stick, and as I get to know someone better I get better at the suggestions I make.\n\nIf you're not living life in a way that challenges you, I think you need to challenge yourself.  Challenge leads to growth.\n\nI think before a certain point it was a lot more pure play with pushing boundaries.  After a certain point it's developed into having a purpose, though, and it's better this way.  It works for me.
30	Check out my new (android) dating app for MBTI and Enneagram communities!	
28	So now not only I can be rejected because I'm ugly, but also because I'm an ENTP. Neat! 
5	Dggg looks real cute.
3	I had this idea, didn't think it'll work tho! Great job! 
1	Good luck with this one my friend haha.\n\nENTP will probably be the least desirable type because of what comes in our package haha! But really we are the master race!
1	This... is quite primitive and it showed me 3 or 4 people all of who were many states away
-6	It's about time somebody followed through and actually did this. \n\nMaybe include zodiac searchability? I still can't decide for myself whether that seems legit, but i've seen enough evidence to believe it might be a nice option to include
8	What is an Ne possibility to you?	>Because, in the main, intuition is an unconscious process, theconscious apprehension of its nature is a very difficult matter. In consciousness,the intuitive function is represented by a certain attitude of expectation, aperceptive and penetrating vision, wherein only the subsequent result canprove, in every case, how much was [p. 462] 'perceived-into', and how muchactually lay in the object. \n\nJung man, it is difficult. I'm Ti and defining intuition is giving me a head ache lmao\n\n>The primary function of intuition is to transmit mere images, or perceptions of relations andconditions, which could be gained by the other functions, either not at all, oronly by very roundabout ways.\n\nSo it is primarily visual, but the processes from which the visual arises are unconscious and largely undetectable(i'm guessing this is likely why intuition dominants struggle to present real life examples of intuition at work)\n\n>so intuition tries to encompass the greatest possibilities,since only through the awareness of possibilities is intuitionfullysatisfied\n\nSo Ne is decisively guided by POSSIBILITY. Historically when I talk to Ne they speak of associations that take the following form:tree->fire->caveman->spongebob->time machine->chrome world.\n\nNow if Ne is visual, these are not verbal associations. My Ti dominance likely lends me a tendency to be able to do these associations strictly verbally. Now historically I've thought these were strictly associations presented in the form of visual images, like iterating through a slide show. If they are not strictly associations, but possibilities, how are they presented to you? \n\nTo use the last example: is your mind visually presenting a picture of a tree which leads to a picture of a person cutting the tree into logs and using the logs for fire. Then you see around the fire is cavemen, and it reminds you of spongebob cavemen. They got there from the time machine elevator which brought them to the chrome world.\n\nIt makes me think that verbal/written associations that Ne dominants cite as examples of their thinking are actually just pieces of videos/scenes playing out in their head and that these videos are decisely of possibilities of use of the object.
4	1. Te: Jupiter **is-a** planet\n2. Ti: Jupiter **has-a** moon\n\nTi is de/constructs objects into component pieces, Te is associates objects into a hierarchy of categories.\n\nWhen Ti compares two concepts, it compares the concepts by how similar the components are. When Te compares concepts, they are not directly comparable, only the hierarchical relationship between the two concepts is. \n\nE.g:\n\n1. Ti: uranus has a ring (of rock), a donut has a ring (of dough). Uranus and a donut are comparable because they are composed of similar things (rings). \n2. Te: jupiter is to a planet as cat is to an animal. Jupiter is one member of a set of planets, cat is one member of a set of animals. Jupiter and cat do not compare, but the relationship of Jupiter to planet and the relationship of cat to animal do compare. \n\nAssociation doesn't have anything to do with Ne vs Ni in my opinion. Intuitives spend a lot of time thinking without any external stimuli. The difference between Ne and Ni is that Ne generates shit some of which sticks via TiFe or TeFi, whereas Ni sifts through the shit that TiFe or TeFi has already got stuck.\n\nNe doesn't find possibilities, it just creates random shit which either sticks or it doesn't. That said, the noise coming from Ne doesn't come from nowhere, it is going to be highly correlated to your existing memories, i.e. the shape of the data in your mind. 
1	ENTP here, and wow - I love this description of Ne, it’s highly accurate... but not at all what it feels like (in a literal sense). To me, Ne feels like a sudden almost theatrical sense of an awareness of an opportunity. Once I realize (more like feel, or see) what the potential responses might be of those around me, or a future domino effect of consequences, I get an overwhelming sense of curiosity about if my predictions will come true, so I am prompted to act. Sometimes I get the feeling that people will react negatively, but it’s often too funny to pass up acting out.\n\nIn short, it’s a feeling of awareness and curiosity that almost spontaneously comes about, in response to something that sets off a set of internal scenarios inside my head.\n\nWhen I rarely control my own intuition, it’s usually in response to boredom- like I’ll be at work and come up with a side project I can convince others to work on, or act like I’m a fictional character working in the Death Star to keep myself entertained. Even then, it’s more of a feeling of imagining potential scenarios inside my mind.\n\nSo, my answer is: to me, Ne feels like imagining possible scenarios that prompted some feeling of curiosity or interest to me. Sometimes it’s to get data, other times it’s to just see how powerful my influence over a situation can be, and play with the variables (people).
5	ENTP Location Calibration (California/Not California)	In the past several years I've absorbed a lot of comments and some insight into how people perceive California, which I do think is not normal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs someone who was born and raised in the Bay Area (before it was nutty with Facebook/Tech), and moved to SoCal for college, I developed a lot more perspective whereas before I just didn't think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I'm kind of curious about other ENTP's in California - have you noticed things that're different? I know socioeconomically and politically and interpersonally (Coastal Urban areas/suburbs tend to be different than most other places), things are different so I'm curious to hear any developments here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nENTP's outside California... thoughts on above? haha
2	You've said quite a few words but I'm not sure you've asked a coherent question.  \n  \n> other ENTP's in California - have you noticed things that're different?  \n  \nDifferent from what?  From when?  \n  \n
1	What the hell, "that're". Is....is that English? 
1	Also, you aren't being clear on your question. "have you noticed things that are different;" do you mean different from a time perspective(then vs now) geographically, something else? And what are asking we compare to? We can compare NorCal vs. SoCal, but about what? I'm not really sure what you're asking at all, seems like a ramble. 
1	was also confused by the question but have a similar story. from socal, ended up in the bay area lol, so i might have some insight into whatever you’re wondering
1	Sorry about the ambiguity. Basically I want to know if other people think that California is weird or if they've heard that it is weird and in what ways might it be different if you can explain
1	ENTP who has lived both in, and outside of California here.  \n\nCalifornia isn't weird.  You want weird, spend a couple days in Mississippi.  
1	california is honestly about four completely different states and should be viewed as such. \n\nsouthern - santa barbara to sd; central - farmville; bay area; far north - tbh more PNW than california
28	Any ENTP writers?	I've been attempting to write a novel lately, believe it or not, I'm *not* doing a good job. \n\nI have a vague idea of what I wan't it to be about but my Ne gets the best of me. I usually go off on tangents and get incredibly detailed about my writing and loose perspective. It's also quite easy to persuade / influence me so sometimes I get rid of my drafts completely because I think they're (a) not good enough compared to the vast literature out there (b) I get bored of sticking to a story and want to sWitCH iT uP a BiT \n\nI hate myself for being so indecisive, what have successful ENTP writers done to deal with the crazy Ne spiral. I usually am better at finishing things at one go. And don't even get me started on when I have to edit the drafts, I feel like they're just not good enough and want to delete the drafts entirely (oftentimes end up doing so). I hate editing drafts, how do I stop changing my mind and hating my work? \n\nAny help is appreciated, thanks  
10	Get an INFJ to balance you out and filter your ideas to form depth. Mainly anyone with a prominent Ni would help. \n
7	Perhaps let the ideas flow and stop fighting yourself, but don't start fresh just start a new chapter. And when you have enough chapters maybe you'll find some link between them, have fun with it, and perhaps in the constant spiral of creation you'll find something truly profound AND worthy of your attention and love.\n\nHitchhiker's Guide would be the best example I can think of as literally it's just one thing after the next with a group of misunderstood space travelers linking everything together. That story really never sat still, and yet he somehow kept it together.. "Together." He also struggled with deadlines and such, and his start was by accident so maybe just let it happen without comparing yourself to "all of literature." That's dumb, cut that out.\n\nSo yeah, maybe research Douglas Adams- ENTP extraordinaire.\n\nEDIT: I want to specify how important it is to attach love to your ideas, stories, and characters- would you toss out something you love or change it? If you truly loved it than you would love it for what it was and not for what it could be, and you would show how such love and depth carries over to any number of things- transcending all other works as love is something only you can have in your own way. Design a character and build the story around the character, so that you have structure- you have that character no matter what you come up with. Use somebody in your life, a lot of writers do(intentionally or not), and think about that person experiencing the story; it's a start on firm ground. What are all the silly things that person would do in these situations, what are their motivations, what are all the crazy adventures they could have, what will they lose throughout it, how will they inevitably look back upon the story at the end? If you cannot be true to yourself, and hold yourself accountable to commit, than commit to the characters; commit to the person you brought to life; commit to that person as if they were truly and honestly real, and perhaps so too will the story become real in form.\n\nAnd if you want a personality approach to something like this, what I described in the edit is seemingly the writing style of an INFP friend of mine. His Fi does transcend the Ne, so the love will always be there as the ideas shift, but perhaps just find something to like about someone, anyone, and let that one thing spring into a thousand. But... keep true to that core thing, as should one lose that than it can be said that you did not love it; perhaps you'll learn more about yourself than your readers would(I hear that's the test to be one of the greats, and then it will be others comparing themselves to your work.) Write that core thing down, bold and italicize it. You got this.
3	Oh man. You’re not the only one. \nI either have too many ideas, or no motivation. The only pieces of writing I’ve actually completed are poems and one short story (God only knows how.) My advice? Take it one step at a time. Keep it simple. Maybe create a storyboard of some sort to lay out your thoughts, so that you can decide definitively what you want to do with the ability to add/subtract from it at will. Make sure you fill in all the holes, because if you don’t, you’ll start to make things up on the spot, which even though comes easy and works well, should be thought over first. \nJust take your time to think things through. Make sure that you know where you’re going and narrow down your ideas before writing. You’ll make it to the end of that book of yours, I promise.
2	> sometimes I get rid of my drafts completely\n\nAre we talking a draft of a full novel, or chapters?
2	So, when I write with the intent of making a novel or something I start by mapping out the ideas, the main plot points and what happens when so that once I start writing I can reference it and make sure I am progressing how I expect.   Also you could get more inventive with it's structure to kind of use the Ne as a tool.  An example that always amazes me is Cloud Atlas, since it's 6 different stories that are interwoven and all written in different styles that do half each story at a time... something like that works really well if you are going all over, and makes a short attention span or spiral into random stuff into a more creative thing...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBtw I know what you are going through.  One time I was writing a novel that I didn't map out very much and had a professional writer review it and he liked it but said it was so verbose about random stuff that it felt like a tourist guide and less like a fictional story haha... needless to say I realized I did waaaay too much research and tried waaaay to hard to put in tons of details to flesh out the world... should have spent more time of moving the story along
2	Maybe, rather than focusing on what the story is about, ask yourself who you could picture your readers as being and what you want them to get out of your story? I've found that having some philosophical idea behind the work deepens it and makes it more satisfying since you can hide your plot threads behind seemingly unconnected scenes. It doesn't have to be very philosophical - just a particular perspective on life that you want to introduce to your readers. It could even be the perspective that randomness is normal and fun!\n\nSomeone mentioned Hitchhiker's Guide - I'd say you might also benefit from looking at: multiple tangent stories (loosely connected), allegorical work, episodic novels (where each chapter is like an episode in a TV series, completely different from each other but with an overarching storyline to tie them together). Your story doesn't always have to hang together plot-wise. You could tie it together through the main character, theme, time, place... \n\nFor another perspective on the many different possible story formats, as well as an overview of the evolution of narrative storytelling, I recommend M.M. Bakhtin's 'Speech Genres and Other Late Essays', especially the chapter titled: "The Bildungsroman and Its Significance in the History of Realism (Toward a Historical Typology of the Novel)". The chapter is incomplete since the publishing company was bombed to pieces and Bakhtin didn't have a copy of his manuscript. He is also rumoured to have smoked some pages from it since it was hard to get cigarette paper in the Soviet union at the time. He was rediscovered recently and is considered one of the most brilliant (and sadly incomplete) literary theorist of our time. I personally had my mind blown by this chapter, so I hope it can help you!
1	Oh dude I know your problem. I have alot of stories that I want to write. And I also have folders so that whenever a new idea pops up in my head I can write it down so it doesn't get lost. However not procrastinating and actually starting to write has proved the hardest part for me.
1	i write a little every day, maybe about the same thing as yesterday, maybe a new story or new poem. writing is freedom for me. so the thought of pushing yourself to write a novel seems weird but i wish you great luck.\n\n\nand i think you should find a piece you do really think is up to standard and make that the standard, yes it will mean deleting(please store these somewhere) some pieces but you will be more satisfied 
1	Based on the time needed to publish the 6th book I'd say George RR Martin is one...
1	Um..\n\nListen to the same playlist while writing. Write the book around a concept instead of always writing about yourself. Read Thus Spoke Zarathustra. \n\n..Maybe?\n\nSource: finished 2 novels, 1 in middle school, 1 at 22. Left several more hanging. Don't trust meo_o xD
1	Yeah, I'm standing by that one: Write about a concept or an idea that intrigues you. A good example of that is Thus Spoke Zarathustra. That book is more Nietzsche ranting than telling a narrative, but he still strings it together really well, letting his characters act as a medium for his concepts' expression rather than as living, breathing characters with their own free wills.
1	Well hello. I'm a college student currently working on my own book. It isn't really one genre so I can't describe it well without revealing it much but, I can share my 2 cents on this problem. I have faced this problem before myself. I didn't go around it but capitalised on it. Now I am writing a book focused on randomness all falling in together pretty much like my thought process. However, it can't be too random else no one would read it. Hence, I now just write everything that comes to mind and finish a chapter. Then I do many iterations of editing on it, trimming unnecessary stuff. There have been chapters which were almost 16000 words long initially and I trimmed them to as low as 3000. The chapters don't miss anything, they are just a more concise version where I leave bits to the readers to imagine.\n\nAs someone else pointed out, read Douglas Adams. His works are very close to raw works by ENTPs but on a second thought, they aren't random at all. It is not necessary to write the same way just because you are ENTP' but that is an example of a good way to capitalise on your weaknesses.\n\nBest wishes and I hope you turn out to be an excellent author someday!
1	Because of this exact same reason, I've been writing only poetry....average sized poetry that I can write in my notepad when I feel the urge
1	I do screenwriting- like a shit ton. Book writing was something I used to be super into...but I’ve realized that it’s just too tedious for my poor little retarded brain, tbh.
1	Me. \n\nI have to write short stories because I don't have the attention span to write a full novel. Perhaps you can take it chapter by chapter in accordance to a theme? This is the most difficult part for me.\n\nAlso, I paid my INTJ friend to edit them for me because I also hate to edit.
1	I'm a failed writer (gave up and went back to school for engineering) so take this with a grain of salt, but I always found it helpful to get some outside eyes on my work.  Let somebody else do the edits and give you feedback.
23	What types are regularly NOT compatible with you?	Whatever comes to mind strongly. No bashing other ENTPs, we are beautiful, no matter what they say. Anyway, so, I'm sure most of y'all get/got relation theory/theories down already, but let's see something anecdotal? Opinions and all that. You know for research. I'll start. Oh, and no, faking being nice to them and making them like you doesn't really make them compatible; I know my kind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINTJs (cold know-it-alls, act hard but cry whenever a dog dies in a *movie*)\n\nENTJs (I really don't want to be your sex slave, but I can try to help you avoid taxes)\n\nINFPs (stop trying to emotionally manipulate me)\n\nENFJs (stop trying to convince yourself you aren't trying to emotionally manipulate me)\n\nINFJs (one did genuinely say I was a good person, so that's got to be like an award or something)
19	I tend to philosophically disagree with the archetypal values of SJ types, that's all.
13	ESTJs. Never met a good one. 
11	all SJs, all SFs. breaking a rule won't hurt you. 
10	Anyone \*S\*J  \n\n\n&#x200B;
7	ISFPs- I tend to only encounter histrionic isfps so they leave a foul taste in my mouth\n\nISTJs- obvious reasons. I hate rules, they love them. (But I'm great with estjs simply bc bossy, loud men are sexy lmaoooo)\n\nESFJs- my mom's one, and as much as I love my mom, I find myself avoiding her often bc she loves guilt trip me about not wanting kids, and it frustrates me that shes so paranoid. She makes friends with a lot of other ESFJs and they always do some shady shit to her, so I really can't trust them\n\nENFJs- used to go to a cult-like church; leader was an ENFJ. P self-explanatory\n\nESTP- Sexy in theory but I've never met one I could tolerate
7	SJ don't even APPEAR on my radar, but I will 100% notice cute NT's and I like shots of xSTP. I used to go along well with NF's but now I mostly find them boring.\n\nEdited: SFJ + STJ = SJ
3	Anything that's not NT. I'm on the brink of being I or J, but the NT is strong within me (though I'm definitely ENTP still, but if I ever were mistyped, it'd be as a ENTJ/INTJ). \n\nI've tried some S's and F's in all flavours, but the result is always more or less the same.\n\nNo no, just give me the "hard" INTJ any day of the week, if it means I never have to deal with an ISFx ever again. They really, really can't handle how I communicate and it kills me in the end. The INTJ is at least asshole enough to rub my wrong-doings in my face. Makes me want to improve myself. I like. 
5	Fuck ISFP's, not even literally just stay away from me. 
6	ENFPs!!!!!!!! But somehow I seem to find myself surrounded by them all the time...
4	Please tell me more about infp's. Emotional manipulation, you say?
4	Any type with unhealthy feeling functions piss me off quite a bit to be honest. I'm more sympathetic towards unhealthy Fe users since I tend to display unhealthy Fe behaviours myself when my anxiety/depression hits. Unhealthy Fi, however, is annoyingly painful to deal with.\n\nMy ex used to scream at me a lot and get upset at me over stupid things like "not showing me affection the right way" because that's apparently who he is and that was what he felt like doing. \n\nSomeone in my cohort tends to act like she's unique and quirky just because she's "introverted" or "sassy" or some other bullshit. I'm having a bit of drama with her ATM because she basically slandered most of the lecturers and all of her batch mates online, tried to lie about her intentions in that post, and then got salty as fuck when I called her bluff. Why she did something like this, I don't have any other explaination other than: "it was just a passing thought" (her words, not mine.)\n\n\n I've noticed both unhealthy Fe and Fi in my ex though, as well as a pretty strong Si due to his fixations with the past and old tech. My best guess for his type is ISFJ. \n\nThat other girl though? I really don't know much about her, but only that she doesn't like "weird people" and tends to snark at anybody and anything who doesn't fit her idea of "normal". I'm not sure if that's Fi, Te, or just being a shitty asshole. ISFP might fit, but I'm not too sure myself.\n\nSo I guess that in conclusion, I'm less likely to get along with ISFx s. Probably. I'm not the best at typing people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
4	I'm convinced that most ESTJs are bad people. Ultimately with them, when it comes to money or whatever their priority is (probably money) they don't mind abandoning principles or morality; if something is between them and their objective, then that thing has to go. 
3	I married a bossy ENFJ that calls me out when I'm being brash and callused. I can't stand IxFJs. The difference is definitely that E. I've chilled out over the years but I'm an honest and open communicator and it bugs me when others aren't.\n\nI have a hard time with a lot of I types actually. Just frikkin talk to me! I can't stand when you're silently resenting me for treading over some line I didn't know was there because you never let me know. I don't share your values (probably) so your common sense might not make sense at all to me.\n\nIt's tough with the judgers too - Having a set of values and not being able to mentally put yourself in anyone else's shoes seems so strange to me.
3	[deleted]
3	My father is a strong ISFJ, and we get along just great. But we are polar opposites in the way we think. 
3	All Sensors except xSFP
3	SFs in general, and INTJs. 
3	Isfps, see enneagram 4 unhealthy. Irritating and I'm not easily irritated. I can take weirdos and socially inept people who are out of place. But bullshit from people who can't take themselves seriously and always talk in character for the sake of being themselves ticks me off. \n\nThis is the only person I've called out in the group chat and asked if they were willing to fistfight to deal with a conflict we were having. I was a good 30 lb underneath the guy but was willing to lose and punch my just to demonstrate a point that he was being an ass hat\n\nINTJs are good as long as they aren't prideful and cut off things 
2	I can’t tolerate whoever bores me so any sfj/stj is out
2	I dislike or clash or don't connect at all with xSFx' & INFP's \n\n\n\n\n\n
2	IXXX types generally, but especially? INFJs and ISFJs. No, I cannot fucking read your goddamn mind and just magically know how the fuck you’re feeling and just suddenly know why the fuck you’re giving me the silent treatment. If you think I’m being an ass then say so directly or fuck the hell off already. \n\nI also find that disagreeing with INTJs about... anything, literally anything, no matter how fucking infinitesimal... turns into a fight. Not a debate, not even an argument. A fucking fight and holy shit it’s absolutely insufferable because no, I am not going to fucking agree with their assertions that I’m apparently unenlightened and somehow *went full retard* just because I disagreed with them about usually something that doesn’t even *matter* in the grand scheme of things anyway! Fuuuuck that. Same problem happens with INFJs too tbh just in a different way see: Fe hitting you over the head vs Te hitting you over the head... Ni doms, blergh... 
2	I dislike xSFP, xNFJ, and xSTJ.\n\nI dislike high Judgers in general outside of xNTJs, because they're boss and I'm similar to them.
3	ISTJ when we’re talking about anything other than an issue we hate. \nI think they conflict with most other EN types anyway. \nThey’re a lot more hostile when it comes to ideas that incorporate short-term loss for long-term benefit. 
1	2 of my closest friends are INTJs. I spend a lot of time trying to understand their perspective and having my mind blown in a good way by their different conclusions and how they consider things I don't find important at all, or never even noticed. \n\nRomantically, I'd be concerned about the effort required to try to anticipate their reactions and avoid inadvertently trampling their feelings, beyond the usual "do try to be nice" approach. That's probably an overblown concern, because why would an INTJ be any less logical, intuitive, and thick skinned just because I want to curl up in his beard?  
1	I wouldn’t say I’m not compatible with any type. I just get bored or Some types quicker.
1	Can ENTPs be successful project managers?	I have been dissatisfied with my career which up to this point has been in the administrative/operational area.  The tasks were very much in the Si and Te arena, not really utilizing any of my strengths (Ne and Ti).  At the moment I am just a loser food delivery driver (one of the popular apps) and feel really directionless, pardon the pun.  Upside being that I am not stuck at a desk and it is stimulating visiting new locations all the time.  I just can’t work at an administrative job anymore, I refuse and feel like it is feminine bitch work. \n\nI hated my old positions because the work was boring and repetitive.  I also have a really useless degree (Film and Media Studies) that really hasn’t helped with going in a more business analyst, data analyst direction.  I am really good at Excel, but have no SQL or VBA skills so I can’t really sell myself as someone that is an expert with data.  \n\nAnyways I thought about how Project Management may be something I would find more fulfilling.  You are not in a boring repetitive operational role and deal with constant change and new projects.  You get to see things in the big picture and are able to strategize and bring change to organizations (working with various stakeholders, departments, and vendors).  Also they make decent money 🤑.  
14	“Feminine bitch work” - please don’t enter project management if you’re going to shit on the work that your PMO will likely be doing
4	INTJ Project Manager for 4 years here, also with an undergrad in the same area as you described. I also have my very own ENTP, my wife. \n\nYes, I think ENTPs can become successful project managers, probably more effective than most. Here are some things to think about:\n\n1. From my experience, a lot of people get out into being a PM because the organization isn’t sure what to do with the person or they aren’t clear on what Project Management is. This could be good or bad for you, but take care. \n\n2. A lot of people become PMs because they love planning. In fact, they love planning so much that they wanted to plan for a living. This makes for some very bad tendencies, because things *never* go according to plan. I’m a big fan of the agile value of “adapting to change over following a plan,” but many of my colleagues at my last job disagreed with me. I ask you to trust me when I say I have the credentials to back this up: They’re wrong to take that approach. \n\nThe purpose of project management is to create successful business results. It’s not for PMs to make pretty charts and record lots of information that will probably never be used again. If you can get behind that (I suspect as an ENTP you can), you’ll be in good shape. \n\n3. That said, there is going to be tedious paper work, meetings galore, and you will benefit from discipline. For me, the more successful I am at my job, the fewer problems there are, which also means my job becomes more boring the better I get. It’s 99% talking, planning, politics, and waiting, but that 1% where you know you saved the day and made something great possible make it all worth it. But consider carefully if you can deal with that 99%. \n\n4. There are as many types of project managers as there are project managers. My style is one of playing the facilitator, diplomat, cheerleader, challenger, and devil’s advocate. As you might suspect from an INTJ, I’m not really into confrontation and prefer you either get on board or get out of the way, but I recognize that I need to do a better job with the middle ground - open conflict. Conflict is a big part of Project Management, and you have to demonstrate wisdom in knowing when to fight, persuade, or surrender. That said, as an ENTP you’re ability to build relationships and to hit things head on can be an asset and it’s something I respect. You may actually have the opposite problem than I have. \n\n5. Take care to remember that you leave when the project is over. This means that “your way” and “your input” are actually the least important positions most of the time. If you have a natural proclivity to debate, you will need to set that aside when dealing with the project team. They’re the ones who have to build the thing, so your job IMO is to get everyone to understand what the objective is, get them to clarify how it will be achieved, and then get them what they need to do it. However, when people attack your team or throw up obstacles, have at it: your job is to protect them like a guardian angel. \n\nAs far as actually getting into a PM job, I became an IT support manager, got my Master’s in an IT field with a concentration in IT Project Management, then got in through a reference at another company. Since then I also earned multiple certifications and racked up thousands of hours of experience before jumping ship again for better compensation and working conditions. \n\nIt’s an awesome job, and I love it and the life it affords me. The pay is also pretty damn solid. Don’t be intimidated, but do be prepared to put in the blood, sweat, and tears. It will pay off. \n\nCould go on all day but that’s enough for now. I’m glad to chat further if you like via DM or in response to this comment. \n\nGood luck!
2	I am. I don’t love super detailed record keeping, but I have been pretty successful.  It can be fun wrangling a lot of different things, especially if you have some strategic flexibility.
2	Don't project manage if you're gonna give roles labels like 'feminine bitch work'. Having worked in events and production for over a decade, good PM requires appreciation and understanding of all the roles and what they play. \n\nEach element of a project is as important as the other. 
2	You might find everything you're looking for if you become the direct executive assistant to a CEO/Owner of a small business. You'll oversee everything, meet new people constantly, follow up with people, direct people, and help in the challenge of helping the company grow, by being "the filter" for the CEO. By mixing in your degree you could oversee or be the project manager of the Marketing/Advertising department of a small business, while simultaneously be the direct executive assistant to the owner. The challenge to overcome problems in helping the company grow should be a perfect fit, as you'll do something different everyday. 
2	If you don't want to do "feminine bitch work" get into construction so a bunch of dudes and some women can school you. \n\n
1	Can be a hit or miss. On one hand you get to juggle lots of different projects, teams, and responsibilities. But in the other hand than means PLANNING for lots of other people, and having to deal with their whining when they don't meet schedule. 
1	Only Enneagram Gut Type ENTPs want to be managers in the 1st place.\n\nThe other ENTPs would rather get the project done no matter how it gets done, when it gets done, or even if any steps are followed in getting it done.
1	Hey I was a couple of years in project management.\n\nThe good: Talking alot, meeting various people etc.\n\nThe bad: Often Project Managers are used for all the Administrative and document and QA work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn summary - yes but only if it is either technical or close to business. The rest is a support function which I say NO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know if I should give more details...
-1	Based on your post and your comments - you will be unable to become a successful project manager.\n\nENTP's in general could though.
23	Why does being bad feel so good?	I have a tendency towards manipulation and messing with peoples heads, especially when I'm bored or having a weird day. Trolling and antagonizing are some of my favorite past times and sometimes I just wonder why does it feel so good? as fellow ENTPs maybe you can help me solve this conundrum. 
24	Maybe you feel powerless in other aspects of your life and manipulating people gives you a sense of power and control there?\n\nRegardless of the reason it's not healthy and you should seek therapy.
11	Oof. I used to do this in high school  when I got bored. It’s not cool though.  Recommend not doing it and just let people live their lives, man. Life is hard enough without some asshole messing with it. 
9	It probably makes you feel powerful. \n\nDo you want to stop?
10	We need more honesty like this on this ENTP subreddit 
6	Because you're a sociopath, duh.
3	Im not sure but I can relate.
3	Perhaps it's because you get away with it with minimal to no repercussions.
5	You are probably not as good at it as you think you are. \n\nWhen you get tired of being a wanker to the people in your life you will soon stop.\n\nReserve this skill for the work place when there is actually something material to gain from doing so.
4	Just be careful, your reputation will follow you and at some point, the charm won’t work to fix the social issues your trolling has created. This will hit you hard in the Fe at some point. My Ne likes to get into some trouble also, but I try to avoid dragging others along for the ride. Try to find a debate club or like minded folks to expend that energy on. 
2	I get how you feel man. You just get bored, y’know? Not saying it’s a good thing, but I feel like I’ll go crazy if I don’t shake things up.
2	This is one ENTP stereotype I don't personify.  I think it has to do with my parents (who were both manipulative in different ways).  I'm a do-gooder ENTP.  I only use my powers for good.  ;)
2	It feels good because you're an asshole.  What's the mystery?  
1	You grow out of it. And yes I think it’s about power... setting something off like a firework and seeing the explosion can be quite satisfying.
1	Are ENTP's sociopaths?
1	holy shit sociopathy ahoy\n\n&#x200B;\n\nkidding! It's just something ENTPs often do, depends on how developed they are, or what functions they lean on more at any given time, subtype, etc, but often as they age ENTPs can even go so far as to come off as ENFJs! I've seen it with my own eyes, it can be staggering if that Fe really develops. The tertiary is like a child... It knows little, but is fun to play with. The auxiliary is like a parent, it knows a lot but it can be boring or less enjoyable to use.
1	Talk to me when youre able to do this with actual gain like get money or beautiful woman as thr result
1	When I was a kid, I would rile my little brother until he was so mad that he would chase me with a hammer. I didn't even really do it deliberately. I think I just wanted to play with him, and that was my immature way of getting his attention. As adults, we are good friends, I don't mess with him in that way, and he never tries to kill me.
3	Indicative of ENTP?	I always have more than 30+ tabs open of ideas, grandiose dreams and I write everything interesting that I think of or hear about down and I like to absorb knowledge. People also say I am absent minded and dopey, but I feel like that's because I'm always thinking. When I am at places like the museum, while most people skim past things I take the time to read every panel. Is anyone else like this?\n\n&#x200B;
1	Almost sounds more like INTP to me.
5	I’m planning a big project for all of my friends and I desperately need people to bounce ideas off of!!!	Hey everyone! I have a big plan that I’ve been working on, and I need people who aren’t involved to point out it’s flaws and flesh out/develop the idea as much as possible! \n\nBasically, if you’ve ever seen the TV show Survivor (or something similar such as Big Brother or Total Drama Island), I’m planning to host one for 30 of my friends at the end of May. Huge task, especially given that I’m doing everything myself and I can’t discuss anything with anyone (giving them an advantage in the game!). It’s KILLING ME not to tell people all of my plans!! (Also, my friends and family are legit going to off themselves if I don’t stop talking about Survivor) \n\nSo far, the idea has been very well-received, especially since if everyone brings $10, there will be a $300 pot for the winner!! \n\nThere are TONS of elements to this game— lots of strategy involved, especially on my end. I essentially get to “play God” and intentionally create drama and conflict for the purposes of making the game as interesting as possible. \n\n(I have lots of details, but I won’t bore everyone unless they specifically come up.) \n\nWHY I NEED ENTP’s: This is an *extremely* unpredictable game!! I would love feedback from logical and creative people who can find flaws in my plans, and pose important questions not only about logistics, but about how my choices will impact the strategy of the game and the experience for everyone involved!! \n\nPlease please PLEASE pm me and give your 2 cents — feel free to ask absolutely any questions, all help is appreciated!!!! 
3	What's your basic plan?
2	I'm feeling like one of your friends, totally in the black, maybe you can share info about your plan and then you might get help from me.
1	Ey m8, wut are ye dank plans ? ;_; 
38	How to deal with depression/lack of motivation/will to live as an ENTP?	To preface, i am a 19 year old boy, and you probably already know a good deal about me because almost all of you guys sound and think basically exactly like me, up until i realized that being an ENTP is actually the most dominant part about me and fully describes me to a T i didnt think there was anybody else like me (3% gang rise up) , i just wanted to know how you guys dealed with the aforementioned topics as an ENTP, im sure we have alot of the same issues ie god awful love life, lack of connectivity to others, general feeling of isolation and seeing very small profit to be had in the continuation of living. Im sure you all understand how difficult it is for me to broadcast all of this (because you and i both know we hate sharing this shit) but i wouldnt unless i felt desperate so i thank you for your respect in advance :|
20	I have found that working out and eating right help with depression (as well as meds for me b/c I have bipolar II disorder on top of  my ENTPness).  I haven’t been doing it lately and I’ve been feeling the blah.  I would get checked out for low vitamin levels and the like, and then depression if that’s all fine.  I’ve noticed some responders on here and other social media don’t seem to have mental illness and their outlook is slightly peachier.\n\nI felt a lot like you do at that age.  Finding a career path that gave me something to look forward to that would also provide variety on a daily basis also with different job options should I get tired of my current employer and want to move on (and I have done so twice in ten years) helped me get out of a hopeless feeling funk of thinking I’d never find anything that would satisfy me.  
15	First off: I'm 17 and a male as well\n\nThere is no personality type that inherently has these problems. Not every ENTP knows how it is to lack a will to live. However each type does have a different way of dealing with these problems. I think I kinda know how you feel. Life feels like and endless slog. Having to wake up each and every day just so you can go through the same boring routine again. And for what? So you can have a oppertunity to wage slave the rest of your life away. \n\nBut there are a few things I enjoy in life. And its those things that you should live for. I'm definitly not a guy you should take advice from when it comes to feeling happy. However for me it works to keep me going each day.\n\nAlso I'm scared of death. Idk about you but I'm scared shitless of not existing so thats another thing to consider.
12	Also try not to obsess about a gf etc you are still very young. I know the subconscious feeling of pining for a perfect relationship to cover my ENTP gaps/flaws. Work on being the best version of yourself. There’s a YouTube channel by alpha M that may give you some tips. As the saying goes, the more balanced and fulfilled you are, the more attractive you will be to the opposite sex.
8	Start pursuing one of your goals. Having a goal changes *so much*. Most of my problems suddenly disappeared when I had a goal in my mind instead of just living for the heck of it
5	Also meditation.  I’ve started with a guided app and it does calm my mind a bit to be more at ease with the present moment and feel less anxious, if you have issues with that
4	Try to get enough good quality sleep. Min 8hrs.\n\nJoin some free meet up groups. 
3	Women are like cats man, the harder you try and pet em the harder they'll make you work.\n\nI've been where you are, then past where you are, then back again. Starting a family is still my biggest goal in life, but I went through times where I didn't even WANT to be successful by myself (without someone to share it with), but truthfully other goals can work in aid of it by making you a stronger person in others eyes. \n\nI know realistically how difficult it is to take advice (our lot are much better at giving it...), but the best way to get where you wanna be is to be direct, find a way to get over your fear of rejection, be as you as you can be, and you'll find your person. Show your passion and enthusiasm for what you love, it's one of our strengths, use it to cut through the bullshit. Share your plans OTHER THAN getting with them, and I promise you it will be appreciated. \n\nGoing on from that, don't seem desperate, they can smell it a mile off, at your age especially that's one thing that will make girls run a mile (hell, as a guy I do the same if a girl comes on too needy).\n\nDon't be afraid to take pride in yourself, work on yourself, there's no shame in a little vanity; it doesn't detract from our academic ENTP pursuits, in fact it can be one in itself.\n\nEdit: just going back over your title too. \n\nI figured out my reason to be, but everyone finds it in different ways. We're all just transient in this world, a coalescence of ideas, of matter, a product of the collapse of every wavefunction that's gone before, struck by the arrow of time. Before long this state passes and our ideas and matter dissolve into the rest but are never lost, so I'm determined to make mine count, and try to make life better for everyone else around me before it's too late.
4	There isn't really going to be a set way that ENTPs deal with depression. I mean, look at all the different answers you're getting. \n\nSeeking professional help is one of the best things you can do. Sometimes your brain is out of whack chemically and medicine can help; sometimes it's just the way you think so therapy can help. Many people need both. Sometimes the first doctor or therapist you go to doesn't really click with you. You might have to try a few before finding a good one. I highly recommend getting a professional to help you. You don't try to deal with a broken bone by yourself, treat depression the same way.
2	This isn’t a type problem, it’s a personal one. I’m definitely an ENTP and I don’t have any of the issues you seem to have. My love life has always been fine, I don’t get depressed very often, and I definitely enjoy living. With that being said, I recommend eating better and exercising, as well as getting out of your comfort zone. I used to spend a lot of time on the internet and playing video games and it left me feeling lonely and overall toxic. I forced myself into a new career that dealt with different people, and since then my life has only gone up. Take time to understand your passions and things you enjoy and pursue those things. Also remember you’re young and as you age you’ll become more comfortable with who you are and hopefully find some people that appreciate you for you. Also, make sure you’re sleeping enough. 
2	This saved me from my depression, and when it creeps up, I'm usually neglecting some of these things:\n\n1) Drink 2 glasses of water upon waking up\n2) Drink 2 glasses of water before bed\n3) 6 glasses during the day\n4) Get your heart rate up in the morning, even if it's just a 1 minute wall sit, or 5 jumping jacks, keep it simple and eaay\n5) Lukewarm - cold showers. No more hot showers. In the morning. \n6) Magnesium, Zinc, 5HTP, Krill Oil Supplements daily in the morning. \n7) Audible, talking to myself out loud, saying 3 things I'm grateful for, can be big can be small, vague or specific, just be honest.\n8) Write down the 3 things I can do today that will make today a win. Sometimes it's just laundry, groceries and calling my parents. Sometimes it's more impactful things. Basically, I never beat myself up for being a typical entp that doesn't do things because I make sure the 3 things ARE achievable, like very much so. \n9) speak nicely to myself. Listen to inspiring podcasts like Impact Theory\n9) *struggling with this one alot* increase human interaction and connection. I've recently signed up for TedX at my uni and a hackathon, just waiting for those to meet more people and do the human connection thing 
2	Deadlines. Meaningful objectives. But mostly deadlines. 
2	Do you feel sad?
2	Perspective helps to build confidence and motivation. You have to seek that perspective out. Your current perspective is a state of mind where you feel like living is hell. You have to find a new perspective that is better than that. Finding a role model to look up to etc. Its all a mindset. Also if someone else can have a good life then so can you. Just because you have a different personality doesn't make it impossible.
1	Kickstart projects and ideas always give me a rush. And purpose to live cause it's like...there's so much in the world to be done. 
1	First, you're getting good feedback here from total strangers not only because we can relate but because we care. Second, seek help, I've done it a couple times in my life and they were excellent learning experiences. Third, it might be hard to see this now but, there will be a day when you look back at this time as something you conquered. Some of my bouts with depression went on for years and I thought they'd only end one way, but now I know those were hard times that lead to my biggest growth periods. You will see. \n\n\nThe best thing I ever did for myself was to commit to creating something new, once a week. Not an idea, something tangible. It could be that I learn to play a new song, or a write one, I write an article or story, create a new recipe, a craft project. Anything. The only requirement is that I have to add something to this world that wasn't there before me. \n\n\nIn the beginning I talked about it a lot on Facebook and was excited to share my ideas however, this was demotivating. Enthusiasm like that gives me all the dopamine I need to move on and never realize the actual product so, I got off everything but reddit and shared results only. You have to cut the dependency on approval for this to be fully realized. \n\n\nHere's what I learned: i'm healthier when i'm creative. I feel good about what I accomplish. I'm capable of being disciplined. For me, an Ne, this was monumental. I can't recommend it enough. Best of luck, and feel free to pm.
1	I think three of the things that can affect us in this regard 1) not looking after ourselves/addictions 2) social apathy in between periods of socialisation 3) overthinking/wanting perfection 
-1	Try join the army, did wonders for me
-7	Grow some balls.  Or dont.  If you're too weak to will yourself to keep going, the species is better off without you anyway.  
6	How do you create with purpose? [creative wellness]	I'm posting this in a few mbti subs.\n\nWhat techniques have you discovered for enhancing, refining and inspiring creativity in your life?\n\nPerhaps the Ne users can speak more on discovery and inspiration and Ni users can speak more on converging and focus.\n\nIn my experience finding a place where I can express myself seamlessly (without overthinking) is critical to my mental health. It is a couple stages away from Maslow's self-actualization and self-transcendence but is a necessary level of human development.\n\nHow do you define creative wellness? \n\nOn a scale of 1-10 how would you rate your level of creative wellness?\n\nPlease answer any of these questions, or all. \n\nThanks for reading, I look forward to reading your thoughts/feelings.\n\nTLDR\nentp curious about your perspective on creativity
4	I would expect it translates across other extroverted types but my creative wellness draws massively from sharing my ideas with other people. \n\nSomehow bypassing the poorly connected parts of my brain straight to the auditory processing regions (by hearing myself speak) seems to enhance the way I internalize thoughts and concepts, and being in the presence of other people is so inspiring, to be asked questions, to see the curiosity on their faces; it's one of the greatest joys to be had in my life. \n\nI would define my creative wellness as comfort in accepting my ideas and confidence in sharing them. \n\nI'm lucky to have found many curious souls in my travels, and right now I'd easily self rate at 8/10.
6	“Sensors are more in tune with reality”	How accurate is this statement? \n\nIntuitives are stereotypically seen as being “day dreamers” with their heads in the clouds in shit but here’s the thing... Having extroverted intuition FORCES you to read between the lines at all times. “Are things really how they seem?” \n\nWith all that said, I’ve found that the things that we see as reality really ARENT how they seem. Sensors can be gullible af imo because they take things at face value when in reality nothing really works how people say it does. \n\nI.e. People/companies get awards and credentials and get recognized for their “excellence”, but behind the scenes they either make some calls or paid for the recognition. I’ve seen this first hand working for corporations. \n\nI can say that ESTPs are pretty aware of the fraudulence that’s passed off as reality. But from my personal subjective experience with them, I’ve noticed that they can pick and choose what they see as reality based on what they want to see. They also exploit it to their advantage too lmao which I can’t really blame them for hahah\n\nShare your POV 
3	It's pretty accurate. \n\nSensors not only *perceive* primarily through their surroundings, but their thought process is often a reflection on day-to-day occurrences. That doesn't mean they have short term memory or anything, but they're typically not concerned with topics that are not of immediate relevance. \n\n> Having extroverted intuition FORCES you to read between the lines at all times. “Are things really how they seem?”\n\nNe is also a double-edged sword (it can cause an Ne-dom to overthink), so it's not like that advantage exists every time. \n\nYour example seems like something SFJs would accept by the way, but not necessarily all sensors (STPs and STJs, for example).\n\nI think an interesting thought experiment would be, what if the ratio of sensors and intuitives were reversed? Would sensors still be the type that would be considered "more in touch with reality"?
3	I think sensors are more in tune with reality when it comes to people, where observation of body language, facial expressions, and overall behavior are king. Maybe Se will be the first to identify danger, like when something feels "off" (I've never experienced that as an INTP) but I don't think Se is superior to to Ne when it comes to understanding the world on a macro scale.\n\nNe is bomb, I wouldn't trade it for anything.
1	Yes? Isn't that the whole point being a sensor? being more in tune with reality? However, intuitives have better understanding of reality.\n\n\nDaydreaming has nothing to do with S or N. It's more about an individual's state of mind (boredom, discontentment with reality, etc)
1	Pretty true ? Isn't the very definition of sensing being in tune with reality ? \n\nI mean, you're using to different level of things here. Say, when you read between the lines, you're not more in tune with the real world. You used an abstract N model to simplify and better understand it, then (in this case) used that to your advantage. (It can lead to analysis paralysis or reading too much into it, see all the esoteric Bs floating in the world)\n\nIf anything, the problem with the scam scenario you describe is that the S-Type was too much in tune with what's happening.
1	Duh.
13	You seem like the perfect people to ask this: One of the people in my life is pretending to be vegan and they don't know I know (long story). I can't call them out openly because its a coworker. How can I subtly mess with them about their BS without drawing attention?	As a side note, who the heck pretends to be vegan for street cred.? Vegans aren't exactly popular amongst the general public.
30	Get a life. Nobody cares about vegans
18	I can’t believe I have to explain to a Feeler how to be passive aggressive.   \n\nYou simply bring in some homemade baked goods to share around the office....the kind you make with lots of eggs and milk.   And make a big deal about sharing them.
12	Dude they‘re probably just into a vegan girl, or actually want to be *part* of a community, but don‘t have enough self-discipline to actually commit. Let them live. It‘s not your but their lie they‘re living
4	Welcome to /r/entp\n\n  \n\n\nWhere we will spend more time convincing OP they don't actually want to do what they asked instead of just answering the question.\n\n  \n\n\nIm gonna try and break it down and show how id approach it. (AS best as I can. Knowing what you know would help get an actual plan together)\n\nTo me, the question is not how to fuck with this one person, but everyone else in the office. You need to take whatever info you have, and come up with a way to get the other co workers to unknowingly exploit it.\n\nThen you sit back and watch him. I think you'll miss a lot of the reaction you want to witness if you're the one doing the manipulation.\n\nCome up with questions to ask your team that will get them talking about it later/with the person.\n\n\nBut, other ways would be:\n\nIf you saw him at a restaurant, buy a gift card for the restaurant and gift it to his department in a way it looks like it was from the restaurant. Like a "business card drawing" or something like that that. " Congrats on winning, We hope you enjoy your next meal as well as your steak and seafood"\n_____________\n\nMy personal favorite for these types of people is to simply steal their thunder.\n\nYou mentioned in a reply here that he's usually very loud about his disease, er lifestyle. Make him make an ass of himself. Bring in things that are made in a way he can eat them. Or educate yourself on being vegan, and see if he's doing it for social, health, or beliefs.\n\nWhat about you seeing the light, and "become" vegan yourself? Use him for advice and info, so you know more on why he does certain things. Then confide in him on cheating and see how he responds. Your cheating could be the exact knowledge you have on him. His reaction to hearing that story as if it was yours should be interesting, as the story SHOULD be the first time he's heard it.\n\nIt also will make it easier to keep your composure is you consider this as a positive learning experience for all involved. You either find out he's doing it to impress someone/social reasons, health benefits that when you research it more would show if it's a misconception on his part or yours, or beliefs in that "hurting animals is bad man".\n\nEither way, you can't really bring him down a peg until you understand his decisions better than he does.\n\nI think this is where the ENTP becomes the master at these kinds of situations. The naturally inquisitive nature of someone who fits the ENTP description means we've probably already gone through and analyzed the reasons for the lifestyle choice(s) being made - often without even realizing we are doing it. \n\nBecause of that fact, it's also much easier for 'us' to act on a plan like this because we have this knowledge on everyone we work with regularly. We have a damn good idea on how each person is going to respond/react to get them to do things in a way we want, or to get them to at least question themselves in their own thoughts. \n\nENTP's are good at this kind of task because of how, and how much information we can gather and put together to create patterns/methods. I dont think we are malicious by nature, but instead, because of how much we notice, take in, and analyze - we  have much more at our disposal to perform these tasks than most other types would. \n\n\nEdit: I'll clean it up in the am.\nok, kind of cleaned and additional info added. 
2	So they make a big deal about being vegan, right? What you do is make an even BIGGER deal about it. Parade them around the workplace, praising them for their heroic deed of putting animals first. Bake them mediocre vegan treats.  Ask a bunch of "did you know ____" questions/fun facts about veganism.  Suggest vegan places they could dine in.  As many places as you can find.  Go a step further and make some assumptions of their views, and suggest the two of you go do some not-so-pleasant volunteer activities that would benefit the environment/animals.  Be way over-enthusiastic that they chose this lifestyle.  Basically act like someone who's trying to relate, but wayyyy over-doing it.  Over-exaggerate so much that they don't know if you're being sarcastic/messing with them or not, which will your them on edge. They won't know what to think, and it will make them very insecure. 
4	Why do you need to call them out?\n\nEdit: nvm, was skim reading and just realised you want to mess with them. My humour is more opportunistic with this stuff, like slipping sly comments into casual conversation. 
1	invite them to a barbeque place and eat like a pig in front of them with a whole bunch of other people
5	Should I commit?	hello hello fellow ENTPs\n\nI am finishing up my final semester of undergrad with degrees in Biology and Science Communication (because I couldn't just pick one). As graduation approaches, the pressure of choosing a career is mounting. I tend to pick career paths that sound interesting and latch on. I'll go all in for a span of a few weeks or a few months before growing bored and making a sudden switch. I know, deep down, that I need to force myself to commit or I'll be running through this same cycle for far too long. I *really* want to find a career to be passionate about; one that stimulates me and makes hard work a fun challenge, I just don't know how to find that. Last night I decided I want to become an architect. I think it's an ideal marriage of creativity and logic, math and art. How do I commit? Should I commit? I know (or, I think that I know) that I need to fully commit in order to reach my full potential in a field, but how will I know that it's going to be stimulating enough for me to stay entertained? 
7	Do some work experience. Shadow people doing it. For a career. Ask them about the worst points of it. Where is field heading/demand for it. You are only as good in a career as your ability to deal with your worst qualities in it i.e if you put procrastinate is that a deal breaker?\n\nThought I wanted to do law as a kid until I did the above.
117	An interesting study on sexual preference in correlation with MBTI. ENTPs are second to last when it comes to being gay.	
67	Interesting how much more F people are gay compared to T
29	Source?
30	Missed me with that gay bullshit
73	Wow, now I feel even more unique. Look how special I am.\n\nAs if being an ENTP wasn’t already a fluke in the gene pool. God damn.
32	[deleted]
9	Not surprised INFJs being so high, they are pretty gay. ESTJs should be higher. Most of lesbian women that I have met are probably those two.
9	lol you guys are gayer than ISTPs
15	This is total bunk, there's no way that all of the feelers rank higher than all of the thinkers, plus the massive fluctuation in sample size could lead to seriously inaccurate data. Plus who is the one determining the MBTI types of those surveyed? If it's all self assessment there's a lot of room for mistyping so who's to say even the types themselves are accurate. Too many details need to be ironed out before this study is legit. 
6	>FJs tend to be insufferable\n\n>gays tend to be insufferable\n\n>FJs most likely to be gay\n\nvery legit
11	The numbers seem high... super high.\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/record-4-5-percent-u-s-adults-identify-lgbt-gallup-n877486
5	Here's the problem with this, though: Wouldn't this study rely on self-disclosure? Wouldn't that throw a wrench in the results?
5	well now i know why i feel so lonely and don't fit in with the other gays
7	I'd be interested in seeing a more kinsey scale spread. With ENTPs being more open minded and seeking out new experiences it wouldn't surprise me if they're less polarized of a spectrum than other personalities but have nothing to back this up
7	0.95 of Bi ESTJ sounds like a lot in hiding imo...
3	Lol what? That’s wayyyyyyyy off. Maybe this was sampled at just some random Tumblr page of something but the percentage of the population that’s lgbt is about 4-5% on all the real polling. This is just bonkers and so the validly of the entire thing is called in to question. 
3	Would be interested to see how this looks with males and females separated.   \n\n\nFrom what I've seen in my personal life there are a lot more bisexual women than men (could be because it's more socially accepted)
3	ESFJ \nWhy are you gay?
3	Well that's gay
2	Fake news all INTP's are big homo confirmed\n\n&#x200B;
2	Sound logic, we aren't gay because that's gay.
2	those judgey gays!
2	I'd be curious to see gender identity breakdowns. I'm a nonbinary bisexual and I feel like that is usually reserved for the F's of the world. 😂
2	Why are the # of profiles so high for intuitives and so low for sensors? Starting to think more people in this world are intuitive.....
2	What a bunch of mumbo jumbo...
2	Now I’m just gonna throw this out there, but I doubt that 25% of ESFJs are gay and that every other type is statistically *above* the commonly reported percentage of 3%.   \n\nThis isn’t a “study”.  This is someone posting a survey on Reddit and making an Excel spreadsheet.  Garbage.\n\nIt’s worthless to draw conclusions here, except  maybe that MBTI is the gateway drug to sucking dick.\n
2	Bi squad 🦄
1	Trans and Queer.  Interesting stat.
1	Somehow I'm not surprised Feelers would place high tiers. Lmao
1	My sexual orientation is “bitterly cynical”, and I would be outraged that it wasn’t listed as an option if I wasn’t so thoroughly apathetic about the whole thing.\n\nYou’re lucky I don’t care, or I would’ve said nothing and bottled my anger up so it could fester away quietly as a latent mental illness. 
1	or maybe high libido makes someone more likely to be bi
1	7.36... no wonder I never met another gay ENTP\n\nBut it means I m rare ! 😁
1	I am almost insulted. :P
1	OMG, thank you for this! I've been hardcore wondering!  \n\n\nNow I need one for nonbinary and transgender binary people. \*rolls d100\* ... \*waits for internet to respond\*
1	there are two different lists for men and women
1	nahh you gotta say no homo after that\n\n\none of ENTPs most uttered phrase at least in grade school
1	Interesting to note that the feelers dominate the top of the percentage of respondents 
1	My twin brother and I are not only both ENTP but also both gay. 
1	I'm kinda surprised tbh
1	Statistically, ENTP is the most evenly gendered type. Almost 50% male and female. So I mean, we may not be the gayest, but we do have the most gender equality.
1	The sample sizes are also vastly different amounts so looking at the chart as a whole and ranking all of them is kind of a wash.
1	This explains why most bisexual and gay men annoy me as a bisexual man.\n\nGoddamnit, where is the free male booty at???
1	Even thought the chart doesn't have any source. The one who made the post still didn't give us the link. This chart still can be a gag to the guy who said ENTP was the most "female" of all types. 
-2	This chart is very, very silly. I just can't take it seriously at all. Pretty sure someone just typed some bullshoot into excel. \nPlus, ENTPs are usually very sexual and often enjoy playing with expected gender norms (freely bucking authority/ society, that sort of thing). That doesn't necessarily = gay, but it adds to how goofy and unsubstantiated these "statistics" seem.  \n(Lol but maybe I'm biased, as a queer entp)
3	The Peculiar case of "Me"	My functions are... "interesting"...\n\nNote: also posted in r/mbti\n\n\nI believe myself to be an ENTP (am 19M) with a fair amount of certainty. (And i consistently test as it, both in humanmetrics and 16personalities, of the ENTP-A kind, and i relate the most to it in a normal state, but not with everything and am more of a vague than an extreme case of the ENTP archetype, eg. Starting many projects but not finishing, because i generally perfect any project i start and care about, i just don't start many, but that of course depends again on the type of activity eg. Hobby "here i behave more typical of ENTPs" vs important stuff " behave as i stated before" )\n\nI just want everyone else's input on what they make of em.\n\nSide info: dad was ENTJ (very likely) and mom IxFP, so those are my influences in life.\n\n[Keys2cognition functions test result](https://i.imgur.com/PyktgG2.jpg)\n\nNote: the reason Fe is so low is that i could not get myself to agree with any of them because they were too general while I'm selective with that (for the people i **care** for, i do use that function around them quite a lot more as needed, especially if they are feelers, although i don't usually surround myself with a lot of feelers in general, well unless i really like them in which case I'm very nice to them and censor a lot more, in other words i care about their feelings since i like them, would act a lot more feely around em if it's a romantic situation🤣; generally i like to surround myself with people with thick skin who are fairly easy going, mostly xNTx people). I like to be a master of myself so i restraint/turn off feelings when i deem them unnecessary or harmful to the cause, like in  everyday/intellectual/practical scenarios. You get the picture.\n\nJust as an extra source of information,\n[My big five test](https://i.imgur.com/swt8mAU.jpg)\n\nAlso my mistypes are "entj, intj, intp"\n\nSo what do you make of my results? 
3	Well a criticism of mbti is that it is a type based theory ie a few questions here or there can tip you into a different category and has poor test retest reliability. You are not strong on a few scores which may be related to you or the quality of the test.\n\n\n\n
1	Now, you could definitely be an ENTP, however, there is a case to be made that you could, with unknown certainty, be regarded an INTP. \n\nFor ENTPs, Ne and Fe are the "Hero" and "Child" functions, respectively. These are the main functions used to navigate the world until the other functions have developed properly. This would imply that, throughout your childhood and adolescence, these functions would habitually have been used, thus growing your ability to use them, and ultimately their everyday use. This is contradictory to your results, wherein Fe is the most unused function, by far. If I were you, I would be suspicious toward your "mistypes". However, my hypothesis may very well be invalidized, by the very results themselves being invalid. \n\n\nAdding to this, if you were an ENTP, you probably would be a little more pessimistic toward your own thinking (Ti), as it would be the parent function, having a pessimistic "charge". This would show in such pessimisim toward certainty as I, in the first and second paragraph, displayed.\n\n\nIf there is anything I have written to be factually or theoretically corrected, please do! :)\n\n\n
5	What is within an Ne association?	I'm trying to undersrand the essence of Ni.\n\nIf we compare Ne and Ni to Te and Ti : a Te user would say that the object(turtle, hat, ball) has empirically verified qualities about it. So an example for gravity is Te has measured gravity on mars and its 4.5m/s, earth 9.8 m/s, jupiter 500,000 m/s. \n\nBasically, the point I'm trying to get at is  rhat when you drop a ball on jupiter it flies through the surface of the planet and breaks the planet in half.\n\nBut within these is a reason, or a "why" for each data point measured, which is where Ti steps in and says "Gravity=(mass of ball)/(mass of planet)" or something like that. Essentially the equation that would be used in mathematical calculations of any planet that hypothetically could exist regardless of size.\n\nSimilarly, Ne is coming up with data points:\nSoap: shower, washing machine, laundry, call of duty character, soap opera\n\nBut within each of these associations is a "why" that Ni deduces. What is the form of that "why?" What is the essence of an Ne association? In other words, what is within the connection between shower and soap? Is it that the object of soap is used within the shower, and thus Ne is objects(shampoo, water, showerhead) within the context of the use of the object(soap is used in the shower). Like what underlies every single Ne association? If I get this correctly, just like Ti is summing up gravity in all places hypothetically, Ni is trying to sum up all possible associations that could arise from a tree regardless of the context.\n\nAnother question is : are the associations Ne comes up with dependent on context? Does Tree always bring up the same associations and you simply gather them up like a collector over time? What is gathered is whatever is concerned with your goals at the given time? The Te example has the same underlying variables but the values of the variable changed based on the context(mars, earth, jupiter). How does context change the Ne associations that arise?\n\nPlease PLEASEEE dear god use examples for ambigious terms. Trying to decipher intuition dominants writing(which continually seems to be ambiguous) is making my brain hurt.
2	In physics terms, I’ve always thought of Ne as potential. it’s like: Is this likely to fall into this or that category? If I threw this up in the air, where would it probably land?\n\nIt’s categorization based upon everything a concept could potentially be. \n\nLike: Is a taco a sandwich? Ne users unanimously seem to say yes\n\nTe would say “No! Who thinks it’s a sandwich? Nobody thinks that.”\n\nBut, if you don’t care what other people think, tacos seem likely to fall into the category of sandwich, being filling between layers of bread. It has a lot of potential to fall into that category, at least. That’s what Ne is noticing. If not everybody thinks it is now, in another time or place, it wouldn’t seem unusual if it were thought of that way.\n\nWhen you come up with a new connection using Ne, it’s either aha smart because you see how it’s likely, stroke of genius!, or else humorous in how non-congruent it is: it’s so unlikely, this connection, it’s an Ne joke. Let me tell you these two things; they have no potential to be anything together!
1	Jupiter doesn't have a surface in any meaningful sense.
1	1. Te: Jupiter **is-a** planet\n2. Ti: Jupiter **has-a** moon\n\nTi is de/constructs objects into component pieces, Te is associates objects into a hierarchy of categories.\n\nWhen Ti compares two concepts, it compares the concepts by how similar the components are. When Te compares concepts, they are not directly comparable, only the hierarchical relationship between the two concepts is. \n\nE.g:\n\n1. Ti: uranus has a ring (of rock), a donut has a ring (of dough). Uranus and a donut are comparable because they are composed of similar things (rings). \n2. Te: jupiter is to a planet as cat is to an animal. Jupiter is one member of a set of planets, cat is one member of a set of animals. Jupiter and cat do not compare, but the relationship of Jupiter to planet and the relationship of cat to animal do compare. \n\nAssociation doesn't have anything to do with Ne vs Ni in my opinion. Intuitives spend a lot of time thinking without any external stimuli. The difference between Ne and Ni is that Ne generates shit some of which sticks via TiFe or TeFi, whereas Ni sifts through the shit that TiFe or TeFi has already got stuck. 
17	Is there a subreddit for ENTP girls? And if yes, where is it?	Title basically.\n\nI thought I was ENFP, but lately I’m starting to think I’m actually ENTP. \n\nI was wondering where to find other ENTP girls to do some comparisons and maybe make a friend (and by friend I mean someone I spend 4 hours debating about capitalism and then never speak again).\n\nLet me know. And btw my inbox is rarely checked but always open.
39	/u/Not_NotYourFather touched on it, but I want to expand a bit more: I don't really think entp males and entp females are that different at all. I'd even wager that, of all the types, ENTPs are the ones for whom male and female gender roles blend the most (I.e. is the type with the smallest separation between males and females).\n\nA majority of the ENTP women I've encountered online seem completely like the ENTP men online. And often the ENTP men give off vibes they're women. It's really the username that gives some of them away. And when they have a gender neutral name.. you're essentially lost in guessing. \n\nThere are a lot of ENTP women here who, if they didn't reveal their gender, nobody would be able to guess. In theory, I think males and females generally have different typing patterns. Females tend to use more exclamatory remarks, more emojis, and have a specific nuance in their word choice. Males, in contrast, tend to use more pure sentences, fewer emojis (and actually more emoticons, E.g. :-)) and also have a specific nuance in their word choice. \n\nMales and females also tend to have different foci in their comments. Men tend to have more of a T-bias in their comments, and women tend to have more of a F-bias in their comments. This is actually what Jung observed. Jung argued that Feeling seems to be present more in women, and Thinking more in men (this is also reflected by MBTI statistics). \n\nOkay, so in general T type women will look more like men. That partially explains the dissipation of gender roles for ENTP men and women. The other half is that N canonically looks more like a female facet. Jung also remarked on this, that Ne doms in particular tend to appear more feminine in nature than masculine (which seemed to be more Se oriented). \n\nWhen you couple these together, NTs will tend to not favor generic gender roles, and NTPs in particular will simply blend them together to give way to ambiguities. I really don't think ENTPs exhibit much in the way of gender, aside from looks. \n\nThis is also why sexuality *looks* ambiguous in ENTPs—they tend to be more attracted to *ideas* and pathologically flirt with everyone (often unknowingly.. they just think it's teasing and good fun). Then when someone starts to make advances on them, they're confused (oh no, I didnt actually mean to give off the impression I was *flirting* with you.. I thought we were just bouncing around ideas, which I got excited about).\n\nOf course ENTPs do have a sexuality—a majority are straight. But I'd wager of all the types, they're the ones most often confused for being gay. Because they joke around with everyone which is seen as flirting, when really to an ENTP it's all in Ne-space — a cognitive game of back and forth. Even the straight ENTPs tend to be oblivious to the other sex making advances toward them.. like painfully oblivious. \n\nBecause, to the ENTP genders don't really matter, they just see people as "idea-bags". So they treat everyone the same and evaluate only the ideas they see. It's only when the opposing party starts taking off their clothes does the ENTP start to realize that this person is no longer an idea-bags, but also a person to copulate with. \n\nIn other words, *cognitively* entp men and women look virtually identical. So in written form, you really can't distinguish them that easily. To come back home to the original premise: seeking an ENTP female subreddit seems incongruent with the notion that ENTP women will function just like ENTP men. In other words, a subreddit filled with ENTPs would be sufficient for her, regardless of the gender makeup of the user base. 
13	What if I told most of the mods here were women?  This sub is a matriarchy.
23	/r/gonewild
6	I'm too lazy/non-committal to participate much in *any* subreddit, if I'm being honest, but I'd be interested in and happily lurk in a female ENTP subreddit. There's plenty of interesting things to discover with mixed gender discussions, but I'll be honest, most of the time when I look in to discussions here, I see people going over more of the male oriented aspects of being an ENTP (and when other types come asking questions, they seem to be talking about ENTP males more often than not.) And that's fine, but being an ENTP female is a weird experience throughout life...and I'd love to see how others are handling it/have handled it. 
5	You could make the subreddit but I guarantee it would be flooded with ENTP men pretending to be ENTP women for fun (looking at you /u/The_White_Baron and /u/azdahak )
3	I prefer communication with adults and as such know nothing of children's reddit groups. Best of luck.  \n\n\nAlso, 16personalities will clear that F/T question up for you. A strong T would never think they were a feeler. Could be you're close to borderline. 16personalities gives % results.
3	Don’t know if any subreddits but ENTP girl here! Feel free to message me!
3	I don’t think I’m much different than a male ENTP, but I’d talk to you if you wanted. I’m a very stereotypical ENTP so maybe I could help. 
3	I'm interested in the contents of such a sub-reddit, and less interested with ideas of why there isn't or shouldn't be one. If you find one, inclusive to general lurking, please oblige ya boy.
2	I'm in
2	There's an INTP one, but not an ENTP one.\n\nWhat would the benefit be besides kvetching about lady problems? Because I love some kvetching, but that alone is not enough to sustain a sub.\n\n>  someone I spend 4 hours debating [...] and then never speak again).\n\n> And btw my inbox is rarely checked\n\nNo offense, but you're not exactly enticing us to contact you. :P
2	ENTP Female here.  u/The_White_Barron made a lot of good points that I agree with, but I think something important to note is that they were talking about the differences between the genders ONLINE. \n\n  While both male and female ENTPs may sound very similar in written text, I have found that we can be very different in real life.  It is important to note that I have yet to meet another ENTP female in the real world, while I HAVE met a few ENTP males.  The first time I met an ENTP man in college, I disliked him very much, and I told him so every time I saw him.  He came off as an arrogant, selfish asshole, and in many ways, that's exactly what he was.  When I found out he was an ENTP like me, I was pissed.  Over time, however, I found that he grew on me, and I think he also grew as a person. (Still an asshole, but an asshole with a heart.) \n\n  Although ENTPs are all similar at their cores, I have found a few key differences between the genders out in the real world.  And these differences are not necessarily caused by biological differences,  but instead by the gender roles and expectations forced onto us by society. One of the more obvious differences in person is the arrogant exterior.  Yes, ENTPs come off as arrogant, and in many ways, we are.  But a confident, perhaps arrogant man is WAY more acceptable than a woman of those qualities.  (Ex: Hillary Clinton was disliked by many simply because of her personality, which was not unlike the personalities of most male politicians out there.)  Yes I know, bringing in a political figure is controversial, but I'm looking at personality traits alone.  I also know the difference in treatment from my own experiences.  As a woman in a STEM field (physics to be specific), I have noticed a huge difference in how people respond to a woman saying something vs how they react to a man saying the same thing.  It wasn't something I noticed growing up, but it was brought to my attention in college, and now I see it everywhere.  In STEM fields, as well as many academic or typically male-dominated fields, women spend way too much of their time trying to  prove they belong there and deserve a voice, instead of just proving their work.  I've had so many guys (who have no business being in physics) try to tell me I'm wrong on something they literally just asked me how to do. (And no, I'm not wrong, because I actually know what I'm doing.)  Women typically have to defend themselves so much more than men do, and they also don't get as much recognition for their work.   Anyway, this isn't supposed to be a feminist rant, so I'll make my point.  After living their lives being told by society that they can't be too proud or confident (as it's a very unattractive trait), ENTP women tend to not show this trait as much as the men do. (Yes, I know some people are cool with a woman who's a bit cocky, but most people find this trait repulsive in women.)  ENTP women are also more likely to have self-doubt and anxiety for these reasons. \n\n  There is also a trait seen more in ENTP women than in ENTP men, which is a more developed Fe.  Aka, a sense of empathy.  Now, I didn't naturally have this trait, as I have the dominant Ti function and make most of my decisions based on logic.  Before college, I was like "Feelings? What are those?".  Obviously I had emotions, but I always had difficulty processing them, especially if they were strong.  I pretty much never cried as a kid, except for on extreme occasions.   But as I grew into the person I am now, I became more in tune with not just my own emotions, but also with those around me. Any healthy ENTP will have developed their secondary Fe function more fully, as it becomes very important for having healthy, lasting relationships (romantic or not). However, this development is more commonly seen in women, since the general view is that females are supposed to be more in tune with the emotions of those around them, as well as having a more caring nature.   Personally, I was tired of not knowing how to help friends/being viewed as heartless, so I learned how to handle emotions by watching others and doing some research.  I also developed my own moral code after taking an ethics class, which really helped me become what I consider to be a better person.  This is something I prioritized, and it sets me apart from many ENTPs I've met. But of course, I still have constant debates in my head about my moral code, because I still play devil's advocate for everything. \n\n  Anyway, my experiences as a (cis-gendered) female have affected my personality as an ENTP person.  I find that I tend to think about my word choice and phrasing much more than my male ENTP comrades.  I have also suppressed my sense of pride a bit, although it shines through when I'm with people I'm comfortable with.  I have learned to understand how a Feeling (F dominant) person thinks/reacts to things, and I have learned how to comfort people other than providing actual solutions. (Although I still provide the solutions!!) So in the public eye, I may appear to be more caring and people-friendly than an ENTP male.\n\n    P.S. u/The_White_Barron mentioned that most ENTPs are straight, but I don't think I'd be so bold to assume that.  I think out of all the types, ENTPs are some of the most likely to question their sexuality, because of course, it IS a spectrum, and we don't tend to like being put in a box.  (Personally, I'm pansexual, because I'm attracted primarily to personality and intelligence.) 
1	Meanwhile I'm wondering why'd you exclude the men? After all, there's so little of us, so much time to debate with any person just once and never see again, we'd run out of other girls within no time?\n\nBesides, men have other bits. It's fun to hear people with other bits as it may lead to polarizing views?\n\nI dunno, I feel like most ENTP women would think similarly, so I'd be surprised to find this coven. 
1	Why is capitalism always the first example for a debating topic?\n\nYou know we are only %2-3 of the society. Gender filtering will get you nowhere girl. \n\nOh I understand, you are playing Devil’s Advocate. You almost got me.\n\n\n\n\n
-2	Why can't you look this up yourself? It really shouldn't be that difficult.\n\nEdit: Maybe they're trying to be hidden, but if so I wouldn't expect them to respond to this if so. 
7	How do you manage to beat procrastination ?	So since we're all ENTPs here I'm pretty sure procrastination is our worst enemy. So how about we share our experiences on how to beat it ? \n\nI tried to-do lists, promodoro timers and a bunch of other stuff but I seem to have reached a dead-end. So some advice would be much appreciated.
9	I imagine myself as a Jordan Belfort like character, do a few lines of adderall, and pound out some work.\n\nIt works, but would not recommend for people out of college.\n\n
7	I learn to just do it. Respond as quickly as I can. If there is something I can do in 10 seconds. I’ll do it. \n\nFor the bigger things like projects etc, I tie them to emails and with replies and people waiting for replies, there is social pressure. 
5	At some point you have to just make yourself do the crap.\n\nOf course, keep searching for systems that work for you. But even the best system **will not work** without self-discipline.\n\nedit: ok, getting off reddit now to do my work!
2	You know... sometimes I don’t think procrastination is even half bad. Sometimes I need to let something kick around in my brain a bit before I can actually act on it. Call it procrastination but I like to think of it as some of my ideas have an incubation period in my own brain, and once it’s percolated in there for a bit and I see a way forward I take action...\n\nThe risk is that sometimes thinking about something so long makes you feel as if you’ve actually done the work and then you never do it... that’s when procrastination turns bad...\n\nAlso, I need a bit of pressure to work best. I’m a little pressure-prompted. 
2	I don't, I just end up doing something that I was procrastinating in order to procrastinate on the things I was supposed to do.
2	Ummm... \*proceeds to open 20 reddit post tabs after this one\*  \n\n\nAnyone else wanna have a go?
27	I have a theory about us ENTPs. Were you really indecisive as a child?	For example, did it take you many minutes for you to decide which ice cream flavour you wanted as a kid? Maybe sometimes you couldn't decide and so the pressure and stress was too much that you ended up having a tantrum?\n\nNow for my theory, I theorise that in adulthood this manifests itself into been indecisive about opinions of ideas. We don't want to commit to an opinion, so we float around from agreement to disagreement. Maybe we don't want to be wrong, or we are just constantly looking for a better and better opinion. We may temporarily lightly settle on an opinion, but we are open for any new updates to this opinion (even if it's from the opposite side).\n\nWhat do ya think homies? \n\n\n
15	I would say this fits my experience. In group discussions I don't overtly express my opinion (at first). I will let others express their opinions and doing this helps to get a sense of the other opinion options out there. After hearing all the options then I'll start to weigh in and elucidate my perspective a little bit. I have a stronger opinion of what I am averse to vs. what I like or want.
5	[deleted]
3	I have a memory of being about 12 at red lobster and not knowing what to get. Mom said I had a $20 limit. A few different things looked really good and I couldn't decide. There was a platter for like, $24 that had a little bit of everything so obviously I wanted that. Realizing it was over my spending limit, I obviously started crying because now I couldn't get ANY sea food and pushed out "chicken fingers" through tears when they asked me what I wanted. \nThey ended up buying me the platter but I while I was eating I was so disappointed in myself for being that dumb about ordering and letting myself cry in front of the waiter and all my family that I couldn't even fully enjoy it \n\nI still think about that often when I'm reflecting on a recent indecisive moment or feeling. \n\ntl;dr yeah I kind like that theory. It's at least personally relevant
3	Are you arguing that childhood indecisiveness leads to openness to ideas in adulthood?
2	Thank you for sharing!\n\nI am not certain about your first theory with the tantrum example. (Not because I disagree, I simply haven’t given it much thought so I’d need to think through it.) I will try to share my thoughts to your theories by sharing my experiences.\n\nI do think that I see myself as indecisive with minor decisions as an adult. Sometimes, if I don’t have a strong opinion on something (like where to sit at a restaurant or which dessert to order), I much prefer the other person to decide.\n\nOn the other hand, I am very strong on my values and principles. However, I am open to new ideas because I want continuously test and refine it to perfection. With major things, I do not believe that I exert indecision.\n\nIt is possible that I do things that seem like indecision at times. For instance, sometimes at work, if I am trying to solve a problem, I may delay finishing it until I think I have enough data points for the right approach. (I try to be mindful of the ultimate deadline though and will work toward meeting that, even if it appears that I am procrastinating.)\n\nTl;dr Usually if I have an opinion or preference, it’s quite strong. I am open to changing it if given strong enough reason or evidence to the contrary. When problem solving and collecting information, it may appear that I am indecisive though I am not really. I try to weigh where I put my efforts and energy, so sometimes I truly do not have a strong preference on minor issues.\n\nHope this helps!\n
2	No. I made my choice really quickly when i was a kid. 
2	Yep, for sure. Still to this day, when go out to eat with my family I have to make them vote on what I should get to eat
2	Maybe.
2	I think rather it’s the other way around.  Openness to ideas leads to the kind of indecisiveness you’re talking about.  Ti latches onto all the possibilities presented, but can’t find a rational way to choose....so it gets caught up in a loop and chases its tail.  \n\nThe way out is to just get what you always get (Si).  But also with age and experience comes better ways of deciding...like learning to not blatantly reject Si.\n\nTeFi types on the other hand usually have little problems knowing what they *want* (because of Fi).  But being able to justify getting it, logically, can still be a trap for them.  They can’t successfully “pro/con” the situation, but they feel the emotional desire, spurred on by Fi.\n\nA way out of that trap is cognitive dissonance.  (“I work hard. I deserve this expensive Rolex that really does do anything different than my $20 Times.)
1	A little more elaboration on indecision.\n\nI tend to do a cost/benefit analysis in my head of how important certainty is in a decision. I think that’s how I prioritize decision making for myself and discern between “need more data” and “good enough”.\n\nI actually get quite impatient with others in their indecision and slowness if it seems like we’ve crossed that line from my analysis. (FWIW - I have been working to be more understanding in this area since I realize we are all wired differently.)\n\nFor minor things where I do not have a strong preference (again like ordering from a menu or scheduling something), I often will use built in checkpoints (like a waiter/waitress taking our order) to force myself to make a decision.
1	This is simply a derivative of being a Pe-dom. \n\n> We don't want to commit to an opinion, so we float around from agreement to disagreement. Maybe we don't want to be wrong, or we are just constantly looking for a better and better opinion. \n\nIt's not about *committing* or being *wrong*, but more about what the reasoning behind the opinion or idea is. There is no inherent Fi dynamic tying the two together, or a Te approach to finality. Rather, Ti-doms need time to sift through, and digest different approaches before settling on an answer (and it doesn't necessarily have to be just one answer) that is consistent with the framework they built. \n\nNow, whether that type of judgement style is reflected in childhood...is anyone's guess. But, MBTI is meant to be used as a tool to analyze normal adult personalities. This is definitely beyond that scope. 
1	Depends in your own development. Plus you cannot really compare a "child" to what you are now. It's after puberty where your personality really settle down and the development of each person lead to different results. If I had the money, it wouldn't be a research that I would do based on the MBTI, because that type of research is most likely to have a lot of different results making that an unreliable source. However seeing that we are the most argumentative of all the personalities, it could have connection to indecisive choices as a child. But just like I said it really depends in how each person sees the world. \n\nNote: I was determined and confident as a kid. Always had the ambition to go against everyone and everything when I knew I was right.
1	No I did my own thing, my own way. I was a little psychopath in all honesty.
1	Absolutely not. As a child, when given a choice, I wanted to know what my options were so that I could enjoy the choice as much as I was able while I had the opportunity. For this reason alone would it take a couple minutes to choose an ice cream, candy, or soda. What I wanted in the moment wasn't always the same flavor. I had to account for mood, what I'd had last time, what was or wasn't available, and other factors. It was a highly sophisticated IF:THEN process I'll have you know! :P\n\nTLDR: Your theory is shit. :P Also, I'm not indecisive about a damn thing. I'm a walking bag of well-informed opinions. \^\_\^
1	As a child seeing as we weren't well off I wasn't able to ask for large variety of options i almost always knew what my options were when going to buy something " cheapest items and food" so i always picked very decisively. To this day I only become indecisive about life altering decisions otherwise I'm not indecisive 
-1	I think you should go back playing Minecraft.
7	ENTP “guide”?	Howdy! I am an ENTP and discovered this “guide” when perusing r/ISTJ.\n\n[Your ISTJ Care and Handling User Guide and Manual.] (https://reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/8w632i/your_istj_care_and_handling_user_guide_and_manual/)\n\nHave we ever created something similar? It’s pretty nifty so I’d be interested to see what our sub could crowdsource together.\n
8	I found this: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/68dmms/the_official_entp_user_manual/
2	I think we're pretty low maintenance tbh
1	someone needs to make a masterpost of all these guides \n\nedit: I found one. https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/69kp6t/mbti_user_manual/
48	Why do people think we’re “mushy gushy” deep down???	I’ve come across a lot of posts and YouTube videos of ENFPs and INFPs saying deep down ENTPs are “mushy gushy” and they hide it on the surface but honestly I can’t relate to that. My face is pretty expressive so like there’s not much to hide. \n\nI’ve found that most often if I’m alone in my room, minding my business or whatever, deep down I feel like a computer. \n\nI’m naturally a technical and emotionless writer and this conflicted with my last job as a copywriter bc they wanted me to write “feel good” content and it was super counterintuitive to me bc they wouldn’t give me any references and I’m not naturally sentimental. 
25	I’m not sure. All my feelings are out in the open and I seem extremely „feely“ on the outside (Fe as fuck), but that‘s me trying to hide my monotonous inner world, and what I‘m like when I‘m alone. But even deeper down that „monotone wall“ I‘m quite sensitive. I care about some people, and care about „validation“ and shit. That‘s why I think I might be a feeling type I just haven‘t figured out which one yet. 
41	Simple.  Part of Fi reasoning is about making assumptions about motivations.  They assume everyone is motivated by what they understand as valid motivations, and the NeFi combo can get really creative with "discovering" them.    So when you don't behave like they expect, then you must be hiding things.  \n\nSimilarly they don't initially understand how TPs like to tease people, and then get "surprised" when they find out that "underneath" the apparent meanness is really affection. \n\nThey're not finding the gushy inside of an ENTP, they're just penetrating their own Fi (or Ni) assumptions and finally recognizing what's has been right there on the surface all along. \n\nLikewise, INFJs assume that people have this deep, nested onion of emotional layers that they shed bit by bit as they get to know you...because that's what they do.   They keep peeling away looking for the hidden layers, excitedly, in an ENTP.  Then after a few months it finally dawns on them that they're peeling potatoes and it's the same all the way down.  Then they blame you for not being what they assumed you were ;D
5	I've got 2 layers of "mushy gushyness". \n\nI'd definitely say I'm more open about my sentimentality and affection for animals, other people, kids, my family etc. than most other guys I know, but I've no idea if they just genuinely don't care for those things the way I do.\n\nOn the other hand I tend to guard some of my feelings of affection for girls I date, because I don't have great self esteem and I worry they won't feel as strongly as I do. It's just kind of been drilled into me by past experience with the whole "too intense" and "moving too fast" bullshit. I'm very much a demiromantic and don't waste time with people I don't see a real future with, because otherwise I don't feel any motivation and I can't deal with the guilt of breaking up with them later on.\n\nSo I guess I am even *more* mushy gushy deep down.
7	I can't speak for everybody, but because I am. I never noticed it, until the right person brought it out of me (an INFP ironically). I never felt secure/comfortable enough with others to express my emotional sides, because I'm afraid of it being used to their advantage. But with enough talking, and trust in between me and the other person, it began to show and open up. I'd also have to give partial credit to my friend who is also an INFP, as he showed me that expressing my emotions isn't the worst thing in the world. I only tend to be "mushy gushy" when the time is right, and I try not to overdo it, otherwise, it'll simply lose it's meaning, and that's the last thing I'd ever want.
4	Idk I'm very mushy gushy deep down
9	INFP with an ENTP boyfriend here — y’all don’t seem mushy gushy at all to me lol. You do seem to be pretty guarded emotionally and it does take a bit of time/effort/trust to get to the more serious stuff. Maybe that’s why?
6	It's just an amateur's version of the Barnum effect.\n\nAs they write these descriptions, they HOPE it will apply to a large number of people so they can feel like an expert on psychology. The voices in their head look for objections and  counterarguments, and then they phrase things in a way to minimize dispute. It's not malice, just human nature.\n\nSo they make it vague, yet specific. This makes it hard to argue. I can argue that your inability to write 'feel-good' content means you have a 'lot of heart' which in turn IS mushy gushy deep down. You fight for your ideals.\n\nAlso, you don't gain anything if you argue. Being "mushy gushy" on the inside is a human thing... and it's socially seen as a good thing (the alternative is being pretty far along the autism spectrum). At best, by arguing you look like somebody people might not want to associate with.\n\nAgain, for the most part this isn't intentional. The people who write this have an instinct to be correct, and they add these safeguards without thinking.
7	I only really feel mushy gushy when im drunk. Thats when i get caught up in my feelings. 
2	I think it all comes down in how we judge sentimental things by logic and how our action can comedown as moral. For example, only an example, let's think you wanted to kill a dog, a puppy, you know you aren't going to do it, however is it because how you feel deep down or in all honesty or because logically that would be the worse decision? Same thing can happen when deciding, and thinking about the world. Do you want to have an impact for society for your own sake, for fun, or for others as you see potential on them? All those things and how your final decision turns out to be, as we are more open than most people, is most likely to be the convergence of all that points, however for all I know at least in my case, things like morality and how my feeling can act upon those decisions can have a logical impact as well.\n\nTo be honest, this will matter as how much your "F" has matured. There is ENTPs and there is ENTPs. It really depends for each person. Even thought the MBTI divides humanity in 16 personalities, there is still vague information about how the individual itself can play with said type. In the end, at least for us, we are more likely to find a logical answer for said feelings and embrace them as they stand for biological needs and doing this, even thought is the most logical answer you will also be failing to that, "mushy" deep down, cliché type. Not because we want to, but because we found out that was the most logical answer. This confusion between or T / F is what causes the majority of our existencial crisis imo, at least for my own experience.
2	Sometimes I do think I’m quite empty and unemotional inside. I guess I just never know how other people feel normally. I wonder if the excitement generated by parties, socialisation etc is a way to feel alive. Certainly in the context of a relationship this may manifest as a ‘yearning for the other’.
1	I mean, there’s definitely a more “affectionate” side to me, but it’s not really “mushy gushy” or some sort of secret.
1	XNFP's bring out my "mushy gushy" side. All my best friends, exes, and generally favorite people are XNFP's. I find something attractive about irrationality. I present myself socially as a chaotic, joker, flirty type, but I know that is only an wall I have built to protecy my own vulnerability. I really hate reason-driven people and don't feel like its worth it to connect with anyone who isn't a Feeler. \n\nI also tend to get myself into situations where I can get something that I desire but then I get to thinking and I begin to feel like it isn't truly what I want. Its pretty annoying too..
1	I do have a soft spot for romantic songs e.g Roy Orbison etc, more so when I was younger/teenage
1	Lol, WTF does "Mushy gushy" even mean ? Just being emotional ?\n\nFor an explanation : Se Role function + Fe Hidden Agenda. And a Fi PolR.\n\nYou're not too bad with reading the mood (Fe) and being aware of what's happening (Se)(so reading bodylanguage, facial expression, powergames, the way people occupy space), so it makes sense if you can navigate it or express yourself that way.\n\nBut you also have Fi as your PolR/Blindspot function, so you're not too familiar with what your values are. Like, you don't pay attention to your Fi, so it may look hidden to people, but suddenly it bubbles out a bit out of your control. \n\nFe being your (not so) "hidden agenda" may impact that description, since that Fe hides the Fi ?
1	Because you post stuff like this instead of getting on with your own business.
145	When the hell did r/ENTP become r/sociopath	We've always had our edgelords but in the past month or so it's gotten way worse.\n\nSeriously go over to that sub instead of shitting up this place for everyone else ya bunch of pathological twits
42	Can you give us an example? I don't really feel like we're sociopathic over here, to be honest. 
15	Ever since the immature ENTPs started flooding in, so basically ever since forever.
46	Wait, there's an r/sociopath ?\n\nSubscribed.
12	Probably due to a misunderstanding in how typing really works. I can see why they would think all INFPs are emotional unicorns & all ENTPs are genius improvisers & inventors with all the skewed info out there. \n\nSame thing goes on in other mbti subs. People need to realize an infp uses logic just as much but in a different way and that an entp has a sense of morality in their own way as well. 
17	Haven’t been around long enough to say anything relevant... but I did notice some edgelord posts around ENTP subreddit. I just ignore them. Same shit happens over at r/INTJ with edgy teenagers who looove to talk about how they have no emotions and hate feelers for their “lack of logical thinking” or some such shit.
13	I’ve been here for 6 odd years and this place is *the worst* I’ve ever seen it,   Some theories I’ve heard?\n\nReddit app makes it easier for kids to “participate” and exposes the sub to the wider Tumbler crowd.  So we’ve been spiked with young, self-centered ESFPs who think this is their own private support and advice line,\n\nWe were apparently supposed to get some new kind of auto-flair to try to cut down on the bullshit, but it’s been months so I figure it hasn’t been figured out or worked on.  \n\nFrankly, I only stay here out of some perverse habit. There are other, better places for talking to people who aren’t 13 or crypto-ESFPs I’ve discovered,\n
5	“You have emotions? You have values and care about others? You must be an ENFP” - The half of the subreddit under 18
8	What do you mean with “edgelords”?
3	My biggest beef with entps tbh 
3	Hmm... the amount of likes received for this post, in a short span, and the direction of most of the comments seem to offset... This is mildly interesting.
3	r/sociopath is a dumb name. Sounds like it's about only one sociopath but when I go there I see many people posting.
2	Maybe it's a kind of psychological defence? When I first read ENTP description I imagined quirky young mcgyver, not some holocaust apologist
2	Id rather shit up then be shit on
1	Wouldnt ENTPs to lazy to act 
0	Surely ENTPs or ESTPs are the most sociopathic types?
11	What type are you currently dating/married to and how is it going?	Which type have you been going out with? How has it been? Any drama? Fights? Arguments?
8	INTJ. I’ve never been with another thinker before so it’s nice and like a breath of fresh air. Before this it’s always been ENFPs, ISFJs, and INFJs. ISFJs were probably the best of those three. \n\nWe’ll see how all of this goes since we both seem to be on equal grounds about our feelings and overall views so like OMG MARRY ME LOL. 
7	INFJ, everything is going great. New relationship though so things might change but I honestly don’t see it changing much. He’s great and pretty firm with who he is. I always have a fantastic time when I’m with him and I’m always surprised by how willing he is to try new things. He says he loves that there’s never a dull moment with me. One of my favorite things is that I’ll text him multiple times in a row with a lot of random different things (whatever crosses my mind that I want to say) and when he’s not busy and gets around to responding he’ll respond to every single thing I’ve said. There’s been times where I’ve sent him Reddit threads and days later he brings it up and tells me what he thinks. Something small, but I really appreciate it and haven’t had that from anyone else. Dunno, ask again in 6 months for an update. 
5	I date an enfj. She's awesome. Very little fights always excitement to be had
4	ISFJ. Not been the easiest. Married. But realize there's an unbelievable opportunity to force myself to discover the other side of the coin. Fought it for so long but am now at the beginning edge of understanding.
3	ExTJ... pretty sure ESTJ but I could be wrong.\n\nWe just celebrated our tenth anniversary on Thursday.\n\nHe’s good people - sometimes infuriating - but overall takes really good care of me, makes sure our house is organized, food stocked, etc. Honestly, without him probably I’d be behind on all bills and living in chaos. 
5	Infj and also im seeing an Esfj.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWE have being together for years, and im polyamorous, there's a clash between her almost shut in lifestyle, and her need to make me endure her emotional stuff, by basically making me play the part of best friend, boyfriend and entertainer, she is also very hard to deal because she needs to actually push any emotions to the point that they explode, so being with her has made more able to completely shut off any emotionalism to endure her Infjness.\n\nAlso i find draining the different communication styles, i give an opinion about something and ill move to another topic basically we start talking about potatoes and somehow we end up talking about north korea, well she would try to go back to talk about potatoes because her Ni likes to stick to a singular topic and continue to go back to it, this is draining even thou i like giving insights or hearing her opinions, i enjoy more those conversations that drift and drift and u end up talking about everything and nothing.\n\nTons of Drama, but we work together so well, were a team and complement each other in many ways.\n\nThe Esfj(she could be Enfj but no she is focused on the now), is more recent so there's little i can add, i find her caring ways surprisingly refreshing and also her social skills are top-notch, the only problem im finding is that she will try to adapt to me so badly that i told her that im more a villain than a hero(im the bad guy for a lot of people in my life they need me to be that to play that role), and i made a comment about Megamind, and told her about personal stuff, and she began adapting and emphasizing her evilness(she works in medicine and is a great person and extremely caring so imagine).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso i see more people but nothing that is currently going anywhere.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf the people i have dated, i think i have dated from almost all the mbti, the only types i cant currently type any i have dated are Estj, Istp.Because women of those types are rarer.\n\nFrom all the women i have dated, Isfjs and Infps are my favorites and i also like Estp woman.Infjs are extremely attractive to me in the beginning i can't help but go after them but when long term, several years on it, there's a lot of things i dont want in a partner but i put a ton of effort to look beyond that out of love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI found that Infjs thrive on drama an intensity because it shuts their inner voices, but they're draining to date, yet people around her would treat her like she is made of gold, while asme who see the real her, deal with all the self sabotage, the drama and the manipulations. And those things ar drainning, and get old.
3	ISFP and it's great!
3	Enfp. He's wacky and very caring. In a nutshell, he would be dreams, cats and cuddles. We do fight sometimes mainly because I'm the type to take action and be more aggressive meanwhile he's more peaceful. Which often means that he gets shit from a lot of people and I get upset that he doesn't take more affirmative action. But asides from that i love telling him my ideas and random thoughts, we make great inside jokes and he balances me out cus he's much more disciplined and organised than I am. He also teaches me to take life in a stride, not to be so upset by injustices in the world and control my feelings. I'm an entp.\nOh and he's also the most understandng and patient boyfriend in the whole wide world. I'm incredibly lucky.
2	ISFP. Married 20 years. It’s mostly amazing! We do have moments where our debate styles really clash, though. She’s not a fan of my relentless pursuit of logical integrity for any and every subject; or of conflict at all. But then I suck it up and apologize and remind her that our types are different after all. ;) It’s important to realize that love and relationships naturally have ups and downs. And despite what some people think, any 2 people of any types, if developed enough and dedicated enough, can make a relationship work. IMHO.

1	ENFJ, been dating for about a month. Going really well so far and we have very similar goals and values so it's got a good shot of continuing to be good. 
1	ESTJ... don’t ask why or how. And yes, it is very hard.
25	Fuck off	Since I found this sub Reddit I have had some cool insight into other like minded people on topics like music, relationships, and the workplace. I really like this place since it isn't all ways easy to find people who you think like in day to day life. Sure there are some immature individuals posting for attention i.e, I feel no pain, I feel nothing etc. These posts can be annoying but you know what is even more annoying and seems to be more frequent, assholes who bitch and moan about everything even remotely negative posted. Yeah some of it is stupid kids but some of it is people actually trying to work through some shit. These people also seem to be the people with a fetish for telling everybody "you obviously don't fit the entp description". If you feel someone doesn't fit the entp mold don't be a dick about it or better just stick to advice pertinent to the problem. Bottom line if you're an asshole more interested in shitting on people rather than engaging or helping, go ahead and fucking bounce. To the rest of you guys you're dope stay dope. 
1	Thread locked and comments removed for breaking rule #3
8	Some people dont get any recognition irl. Then they stumble across a community, learn the rules, create good content, get recognition and respectz, finally some good feelz, and then naturally they need to ensure that their little ego feeding enclave does not get polluted by people that see them for the losers that they are. Ive seen it many time. Personally I'd like to see myself as the one contrarian that calls them out, instead of sucking their dick like the rest, however to them im just merely an enfp :(   \n\n\nI guess my personality is defined now and set in stone. I have been typed, the bubble burst, the dream expired- I think im going to go count some flowers now, feel for the starving children in africa and change my gender to apache helicopter. If youre confused, read my post history its all written in there.
25	You obviously don't fit the entp description.
16	>If you feel someone doesn't fit the entp mold don't be a dick about it or better just stick to advice pertinent to the problem. \n\nAgreed 300%. ENTP: A Type For Everyone^(TM).\n\n>more interested in shitting on people rather than engaging or helping,\n\nAgreed. Since ENTP is a Type For Everyone^(TM), anyone who suggests otherwise is an asshole. How dare someone discuss MBTI in an MBTI sub and nudge others into trying to find a better fit. That's not helpful at all. \n\nI really wish more people in this sub could just turn their Ti off and be more accepting of us, no matter what. And by more accepting, I mean stop trying to dispel ENTP: A Type For Everyone^(TM) as fiction. It's not fiction, it's true. \n\nYou see, humans are infinitely more complicated than MBTI. Therefore, why bother learning MBTI at all? Just pick a type, and fall back on the Humans Are Complex argument. Anyone who tells you otherwise is just an asshole. \n\nIt's 2019, I fail to see why others can't agree with us. Types, like gender, aren't fixed boxes okay? If you identify with a type, you're that type. End of discussion, dont be an asshole. I'm sick of these typist bigots who can't accept that not all ENTPs act like ENTPs, some of us act like other types too but we're still ENTP because humans are complicated. Get it? \n\nI'll say it one more time just to get through to these pig-headed typist bastards: ENTP is a TYPE FOR EVERYONE. 
4	The fact that this drivel isn't sitting at 0 and people even supporting it because they think discussing MBTI on an MBTI sub is somehow a problem shows what kind of a dump this place has become.\n\nYou can find a lot of people here -- quantum mystics, JP fanboys that wouldn't know what rationality is if their lives depended on it, immature ESFPs. But the one thing you will no longer find are actual NTs. \n\nI thought this place reached peak retardation with [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/akpdhk/empty_out_your_dookeybucket) post. Thanks for proving me wrong, OP.

8	How does tone of voice and body language affect the way you receive information?	My reason for asking is I am quite sensitive to tone of voice and body language. I might even react entirely based on my perception of the interaction through tone and body language.\n\nMy wife has said she has to vent and explains that these things are her way of emoting her sadness or frustration about the situation. She's tried to reassure me that she isn't yelling at me, she just needs to process her feelings and yelling out of frustration helps her.\n\nHow do you react to situations like these? How can I encourage her without being offended by her approach so quickly?
9	I think I'm more like your wife than I am like you in this regard.  I mean, I don't generally go around "yelling" but I can have a really sarcastic, loud way of getting my point across sometimes, and it's not usually directed at someone else as much as it is at my own situation or evaluation of some sort of injustice I have witnessed.  \n\nAs to someone else's tone or body language, I notice it, but I think I just sort of filter it out most of the time and listen to what is actually being said.  Someone could have a demeanor that would really annoy my wife, to the point where she would not interact with that individual, but I'm much more likely to look past the body language and actually analyze the content of what is being said.  \n\nNow, if someone seems angry, and what they're saying matches that, it all sort of accumulates and I act accordingly.  Sometimes I'll be analyzing a conversation I just had with someone and have to consciously go back and try to remember their tone of voice and how they were acting.  For me, it's really about the content of what's being said first.\n\nBut more to your point, if your wife says it's not directed at you, try not to take any offense at all.  Maybe just try sympathizing with her, and yelling at whatever it is she's yelling at. Maybe distract her with something more pleasant.  
3	My first thought on reading this was to wonder if you’re the ENTP or if she is. I rarely get upset by someone else’s emotions unless they’re specifically about me. However, when I’m fired up I also vent without considering the receiver’s feelings. (I’m not complaining about them, so why would they take it personally??? Turns out... people just do. Oops.)\n\nI agree with the other poster. If she says she’s not upset with you, 1) trust her, and 2) LISTEN without talking/solving, 3) be supportive in your tone and responses. \n\nI think you’ll find this method will actually bring the whole thing down a notch. Once she vents in a safe environment, she’ll cool down faster. If you react to her negativity, you’ll just fire her up and add a new layer to the problem.
2	I feel ya. I don't think it's an ENTP thing specifically, but something that arises based on background, conflict history (or lack thereof), and family. If you're not attuned to negativity it can be tough at first.\n\nBeing an ENTP just stresses the situation. It takes a LOT of emotion to get you to have an outburst... so you perceive her emotions as being way more extreme than they actually are.... and you take offense.\n\nOther people have lower thresholds for displaying emotion than ENTPs... and it can be very beneficial for you to be able to maneuver in the emotional realm. If you provide this basic 'service' for your wife of being her rock while she vents, you'll only thrive. Comes in handy with friends and family too.\n\nI suggest exercising your emotional toughness and empathy. Give yourself a mental on/off switch. When you identify "Wifey is venting", turn the switch on. Give her permission to be crazy for a bit with no judgement or consequences. When the venting is over, turn the switch off and perceive things as normal.\n\nEventually you won't need to do the on/off switch thing. You'll be able to put yourself in a temporary state of mind to empathize with people who express things differently than you.
2	More than tone of voice and body language, what affects me is the "why".\n\nIf the person who is sharing information with me is doing it because of a reason I find stupid most of the time I will get annoyed and shut down completely to the information. Even if it makes sense I will be searching for a way to bring it down. I actually try to prevent this, but sometimes the urge is way too strong.\n\nFor example, a close INFP friend identifies as a communist and every time she brings up politics I just change topics because I know she will be sharing something that supports communism. It might be true, it might be false, but I don't want to hear it because I disagree with the views she holds on communism and I know she will end up crying and probably hating me if I say what I truly think about how she has based her entire identity around a political system that has failed every time it has been tried.
1	Se role function.
7	Does this accurately describe Ni vs Ne?	Think of intuition as simply associations.\n\nFor Ne associations work like this: object(tree) : wood, roots, leaves, trunk, water, forest\n\nThese are all singular associative data points relative to the object tree.\n\nNow Ni doesn't particularly care about any of these data points, as they are all just pieces within the underlying associative equation for tree. In other words, the underlying associative equation for tree, when known, will explain all of the Ne association data points.\n\nOne Ni dominant(INTJ) explained Ni like a cauldron that constantly is adding shit into it. There is one big pot with all the flavors in it accounted for and as you collect ingredients(ne data points) you add them to the pot.\n\nIn essence, the underlying structure of Ni is HOLISTICALLY represented by the cauldron simile. Ni attempts to make these holistic associations. Then after that it peers behind the object into that association to help it understand the current object(Just like Jung said "Ni dom is seeing a man pierced through the heart")\n\nExample: Imagine a business has been investing all of its money into a product, but a competitor comes up with product that makes what they are investing in irrelevant. It is a damning outcome. Ni perceives the essence, and it is a man being pierced through the heart, and they perceive a market's essence to be one of a gladiator arena. Ni is going to watch this gladiator scene of the man dying to try to understand what is happening because it shows how other things would interact with the dying man. The crowd falling dead silent. The betters on the fight having hearts broken and others having pure happiness at their wins. The winner of the fight experiencing a lul in their focus because they are basking in their victory. Ni doms then go back into reality to utilize these for their judging functions desires. For example, the crowd falling silent and all focusing on the death scene would be a great opportunity to get great air time and views from the nation at large. The Ni dom should seek to find who is doing the coverage and ask to make an opinion on it.\n\nNe on the other hand could go to the same picture, as it is what underlies the essence of the thing happening, but rather than watching it like a movie(an Ni dom) they are going to focus on particular aspects and then think about each one individually.\n\nNe: gladiator dies=crowd, animals, weapons, armor, betters. Then it will individually explore each one of these things through associations again. Ne users CAN streamline thoughts in the following form: fire->caveman->spongebob->time elevator->chrome world. But this kind of streamline is more useful for creative work than specific problems unless the problem is the gladiator scene but the Ne dom is wanting to know how timmy, the bakers son, on the outside of the city is going to be affected by the gladiator fight and they try to focus in on it as much as possible.\n\nNe  has two modes. One is like casting a circular net and exploring each point within the net, and then iterating to one of those points within the net and casting another circular net. The other is constant iterations as mentioned in the fire->caveman example. It does not explore the net of the single object.
3	I see the N/S dichotomy as a measure of what proportion of brain activity is caused by external stimuli.\n\nAn intuitive has a high base level of brain activity without any external stimuli. Their mind is still whirring away, alone in an empty room. When they are externally stimulated, obviously brain activity can increase, but over their lives, most of the activity comes without an external stimulus.\n\nA sensor's brain activity spikes when one of their senses senses something, and their baseline brain activity without external stimuli is comparatively low.\n\nSe spikes brain activity immediately with stimulation.\nSi brain activity spikes a while after the stimulation.\nNi brain activity is high without stimulation, but with stimulation there is a significant effect on brain activity.\nNe brain activity is least related to external stimulation. It has the highest baseline brain activity compared to the activity with stimulation.\n\nThe observations of your INTJ friend seem to me to be more about the Ti vs Te dichotomy. I think the differences you see between each other are due to that dichotomy as opposed to Ne vs Ni as you suggest. \n\nTi facts/data are not structured, data are associated with related data (bottom up). Te facts and data are structured top down, where there is an implicit assumption that data should be structured.\n\nSpeaking of trees, I think Te organises data this way. There is a strong root of data which branches down into smaller and smaller subcategories of data.\n\nE.g. Everything is a thing, splits into things which are x and things which are y. For example: things which have mass, and things which don't.\n\nThis is why new data given to a Te user will be discarded if it cannot be assigned to a unique branch in the tree which the Te user has constructed in their mind.\n\nOn the other hand, a Ti user just adds data right next to something which is related, whether or not it belongs in any specific category. Any two distinct "categories" of data that do exist can merge any time if some datum is added that is related to both "categories", effectively linking them together via this datum. \n\nThe benefit of the structure inherent in Te is super quick data access, whereas a Ti user might take a while to remember something. Ti users will have to sift through quite a lot of data in their mind until they find something related to what they want to remember.\n\nTe always comes with Fi? Why? Because the identity is the root of the tree. The fundamental assumption made when organising the data. It is why it is very hard to get a TeFi user to shift their principles, it would require rebuilding and restructuring the whole tree.\n\nTi users don't tend to have a strong "root" or identity, and can shift their perspective very easily as there are few assumptions made when organising information.

2	> Another common characteristic of these “logickier than thou” movements is a narrow focus on the type of skill that can be classed as “intelligence.” Affinity for things like social interaction, languages, or the arts (or at least certain types of art) often don’t get a look-in. Everything must be reducible to numbers\n\nI wonder why this is. Anyone wanna try to explain it?
1	 You're preaching to the wrong choir here, for several reasons that i won't list on a single comment, but if i recall u were a psychology student or professor right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Well the problem people have here, is that they forget that this is simply cognitive preferences in to 16 groups and the purpose of this is to be able to short almost anyone between those groups, and by everyone they forget is not just the white American males, and the woman on the spectrum, they forget this is also to classify people in tribes and people whit absolute different backgrounds to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n the problem here is that they project a lot of egos on the T and F split and actually make the T split about the ability to adhere and obey a formal logical system, when there are T types out there who have no idea about what formal logic is, because the T and F dichotomy is not about that. If it were about it would deny the entire purpose of the mbti and similar systems but is easy to forget that when your trying to either adapt the system to yourself by redefining it to your Ego, or cram yourself into some idealized vision about an archetype by denying reality about yourself and projecting that denial upon others. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n About the topic at hand, i have seen here again and again the same logic and way of talking that is so prevalent on the incel community, and the truth is i am done with it, what is obvious for some of us, will be obvious for the majority here, and those groups will continue to gain support, the best way to reduce their strength is attack what is important for them, their weak masculinity(usually use the buzzwords they typically use and remind them of who they are in real life) and their ability to feel Envy which is Strong(this is very easy to do, just put emphasis on reality and the differences with a ghost construct that embody their toxic characteristics they can't help but be sympathetic to the construct and everything aimed at it will reach their Ego), envy becomes like a virus for that type. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat your doing, presenting an article will be ignored more than for its logicality it will be ignored for the propositions it makes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  Also well i skimmed that article and even though the overarching theme is correct the author himself is not that lectured on several topics regarding psychology and made some points that could be easily attacked, wich is probably what will happen the focus will not be on understanding but on attacking details as that article touches too many different topics attacking some of the topic it brings The weaker ones will invalid it as the implications of all the topics it touches too big for most people to actually understand. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  Sidenote being doing heavy research using articles and papers,u know those that u can only access with a researcher account on universities(the ones behind paywalls, etc,etc, blablabla authority appeal, coff im joking) and the amount of shit spelled on this subreddits is just too much, is a mix of people who again and again say that they're very insecure, and their ability to believe they're more competent than anyone else regardless of proving themselves to be lack competence again and again, roped by the fact that mediocrity calls mediocrity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Wanted to share that the one on the right:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n https://imgur.com/a/Vxk3SYW \n\n&#x200B;\n\nActually makes some points that are heavy easily to extrapolate here,\n\n except that there's a big problem doing so humans are not linear mechanism our brains are anything but linear, \n\nand that logic is not a personality trait but a consequence of that, were talking here about cognitive preferences and particularly when we talk about Functions as preferences were talking about where we put our emphasis on consensus, where we put the emphasis on the feelings, to reach internal consensus or to reach consensus with the tribe, or to put it in other words the objects outside of the subject, and the same is applied to the rationale, what is rational to someone may be completely illogical to someone else because the someone else dont know what's inside the mind of the first subject, when subject a and b try to reach a consensus of what is rationale they are putting a preference on objective oriented consensus in this case a rationale consensus, which is easier for Te types but simply because is a matter of aptitude and practice, not because people who have a preference for the subject oriented counterpart can't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n What that article claim that logic isn't a personality trait, is like claiming that logic isn't a function Te types existed way prior Wikipedia and the internet existed, and so did Ti types, and specially N types existed way before internet, if one where to find the reality about any type of preference they should ask themselves if that preference can be had by someone inside a tribe in the Amazons? If the answer is yes, then u have a function as what it is, is the answer is Not but then youre giving cognitive functions the believe that they're like superpowers more so than actual preferences. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Also the article on the left and several others of the same type are quite interesting, being reading a lot of Argentinian psychoanalysis research and damn its interesting, what a gold mine.(and also fuck how postmodernism is so prevalent in every university) .\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  I constantly think about Moulton Marston, and what he had to perceive and face because of this same type of people, ignorance that every movement specially science and the study of the mind is heavily dependent on the prior beliefs of the people doing it, and how in history some held and strong beliefs about for example Woman are still prevalent this day, because doesn't matter how objective anything can be, in a 100 years most of what is objectively truth today will be proven false, because what is objectively truth know is anything but unbiased. But that's the problem of believing o science but not having read anything about science philosophy and why is so important critical thinking. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut aniway im not the best to actually answer this, i see much more than im actually able to explain translate  easily here. so ill just do what i do, drop some thougs and move on to reading some more.

3	Cmv: no one should be a billionaire	
3	Nobody actually has billions of dollars just sitting around in their checking account. That kind of wealth is primarily in assets and such. Limits should not be placed on wealth but on whether or not someone can use that wealth to circumvent the same laws that apply to everyone else.
1	Everyone could become millionaires and potentially billionaires if the economy wasnt rigged.
1	Honestly, once you get to that point in wealth it's not really a choice. You can't liquidate a lot of your assets without setting off SEC alarm bells or making your company drop in value.\n\nSo unless you like jail or fucking over tons of lives, once you're a billionaire, you're in it.

7	All aboard the NOPE train.ENTP/ISFJ trouble.	 \n\nHey there!\n\nI have recently discovered that an (online) acquaintance of mine happens to be an ISFJ-A.\n\nI   supected it before since we seem to think entirely differently and I   almost never understood what he meant, all the while he seemed to adore   confusing me time and time again. As a person, who usually isn't THAT   clueless, this was absolutely infuriating to me. I just couldn't   understand the problem. After coming across the test and observing him   for a bit, I started to suspect that he might just really be THAT   different. I finally got him to do the test (if only to boost my ego)   and naturally, I was right....\n\nI   guess I understand his "caring" nature better now (I did read up on  his  profile, after it was confirmed), but it doesn't make it any less   overbearing. As an extrovert, I always strive to meet new people and   (possibly because we are so different) I felt like he was interesting   for quite some time. Interesting enough that I invited him to a little   get-together I have planned. Soo....This leads me to the real problem   here;\n\nAt  this point I am pretty sure he  is INSANE. Like, for real. I mean,  normally I wouldn't mind this one  bit. I have depression, most of my  friends do, a friend of mine suffers  from shizophrenia...I am chill. I  don't judge. If anything it makes  people all the more interesting.  Gives them a certain flavor, an  edge,...You get it.\n\nBUT   he might be too much for me to handle. He is absolutely OBSESSED with   this video game character. I mean...I wouldn't care...Really...And I   didn't. I just wanted to know if he was pulling my leg or really in love   with her. Partly because I didn't want to offend him and say anything   wrong, if he was. Partly because I never met anyone so much   into...Something essentially less than an object since he can't even   physically interact with her...It intrigued me. I wanted to know more   about it, so I asked....And....After some time...He started to see some   parallels between her and myself....\n\nSooooo   basically lately he's been asking me if he can cuddle me. If I need   someone to "protect" me. That it would be hard to care for both "her"  (aka the character) and me, but he is sure that I am just "acting tough"  and need someone to...Essentially baby me...I presume;\n\nI  was not online this ONE time, did anything happen? He missed me and  worried about me. Am I eating right? Can I cope with my phobia for  spiders? Am I sure that I don't  want to hug him? Like...REALLY sure?\n\nLong   story short...I am starting to regret inviting him to this  get-together. But he already booked it and so did I. It's too late to   chicken out. I mean there'll be a lot of people and he's still   introverted, so I am not sure if he'd try to do anything funky...And as   long as he doesn't get too infatuated with me...I mean...I still   consider him a friend...Somehow....I am just dreading the awkwardness I   am expecting. And I really don't like physical contact all that much.\n\nI   mean. I don't even know if this is a real issue. He is still obsessed  with this character. Maybe I am overreacting. It just gives me the  chills how he keeps  comparing me to her lately. Since he was so  obsessed with her from the  start, I never even considered the  possibility that I might gain his  interest...But here we are...\n\nKind   of an unusual story..Do you guys have any...Literally ANY tips on how   to approach this? I still have a few months until the get-together (we   live in different countries)..\n\nCheers,\n\na very, very confused ENTP-T\n\ntl;dr: Guy is obsessed with video game character and possibly starting to obsess over me to. Help?\n\nYES! I did post the same thing on r/mbti was not sure which community would be more willing to give me advice. I mean I feel like it belong here more, but then again...The mbti community is bigger and more active.
9	Huh?\n\n&#x200B;
3	Draw boundaries as soon as you can. Let him know where you stand, how much of him you are willing to tolerate and the the things he just needs to keep to himself. \n\nThe longer you wait to draw your boundaries the more misunderstandings you will create. 
2	He's nutty, but can you mention maladaptive daydreaming to him? He might be suffering pretty hard from it. Maybe tell him to read up on r/maladaptivedreaming.
2	These types of posts are gross. I literally couldn't read further than two lines of this 
1	I've got nothing m8. \nGood luck with this bizarre situation....
4	Horror movie recommendations?	I want a good scare.\n\nI’ve seen insidious, sinister, the nightmare. Anything else that you recommend?
6	The Witch\n\nThe Ritual is a pretty decent one for a Netflix film as well and a lot of people haven't seen it
4	I was born for this thread. This is my time to fucking shine:\n\nMy favorite horror movie of all time is The Thing (1982). It has practical effects that still hold up to this day and the acting is amazing. Recommend it for any horror lover that is also ok with gore.\n\nMy favorite most recent horror movies are Hereditary (2018) and The Witch (2015). Both excellent slow-burn stories, Hereditary being more gory than The Witch.\n\nIf you're looking for some awesome cheesiness, check out Braindead (1992) or Evil Dead (1981). The first Evil Dead will always be my favorite, but most people like the second and third ones best.\n\nIf you want something more on the serious side, Alfred Hitchcock is your best bet. Psycho (1960) has some absolutely amazing music and direction. \n\nI may come back to this and add in more as I think of them.
5	Going to have to second “Hereditary” and “The Green Room”\n\nIt’s a tv show, but worth watching: The Haunting of Hill House
3	Idiocracy (2006).  
2	The Green Room \n\nIt’s on Netflix in the US 
2	So based on the three movies you posted,  I'm going to say either The Grudge,  or It Follows. Or possibly The Exorcist. 
2	Obviously The Haunting of Hill House, that tv series is the best horror movie ever. EVER. And it comes from me a horror maniac.
2	Threads (1984) is by far the scariest movie I've ever seen. It's not a horror movie per se, rather it's a realistic portrayal of a nuclear war and its horrific aftermath. I've seen it twice, and each time it sent me into a depression and anxiety spiral for a week after the fact. Won't be watching it again. Buyer beware haha. 
1	Check out Afterlife with Liam Neeson
1	The Ritual had one scene that actually had me on edge for a second which is a rare occurrence. Strangers was terrifying back in the day but idk about now that I'm into horror flicks. Suspiria and IT are both my most recent favs (the remakes, not the originals)
1	The Exorcist is a great film. If you get a good scare or not from it depends on your level of immersion. Everyone should see that at least once. 
1	Midnight meat train.\n\nIts terrible. And awesome. And bad. 
2	Question about something I read online	I read online somewhere something about entp's and it went something like a method of flirting as showing interest in people and like flirting with other people near the person you actually like, but not with that person. Any thoughts on this? Is this something you do/ have done (either consciously or not)?
11	Nah. I just talk suggestively or use double entendres with everyone other than the person I like. With someone I like, I get a case of the dumbs and blush a lot. 
1	Pretty much. Until the dude I fancy looks in my general direction, which means I have to run and hide. 
5	All in one test	Tried the all in one thing to see what it's all about. \n\nOne thing i dont get is the Jung percentages. If i'm only 42% thinking that's the other 58%?\n\nAnother thing I don't like is that there a loads of questions on migration. Measuring a political view creates a bias as what do you set as your 0 base line value? Additionally people's views on migration are heavily subject to their circumstances. eg if you have ever moved countries in your life.\n\nAlso i'm not sure that 'dictator' should be part of the career advice section.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/d82z4mud70h21.png
3	Lol "dictator" was on mine too, also I'm an ENTJ but this test is the first to type me as something else. It typed me as ENTP. That surprised me. 
1	I think it’s because your feeling score is so low, relatively.
1	could u give the link? 
6	How was your experience with ENFPs?	No MBTI bullshit explainations. Just share your experience.\n\nFor me it was fucking incredible ( maybe because she was very hot that's why I'm asking ). We are just done talking after 4 straight hours of messaging. I loved the confidence when it came to sharing ideas( I talked to an INFJ for a very long time so this made me happy). My only selfish complaint is how she doesn't notice the logical connections I make sometimes ( it makes me really happy when someone does but not everyone is an INFJ.)
6	I'm married to one lol my experience ranges from about as amazing as one can feel straight to omg I'm gonna kill her lmfao
6	Very easy to connect to, but when they get emotional, they get **EMOTIONAL**. No amount of reasoning will reach them
4	I love ENFPs. I have best friends, close friends, and acquaintances. They’re honestly some of my favorite people because they pretty much go about doing things like us (ENTPs) except their reasoning behind their actions are sooooo different. They make me feel less like a computer on the inside cause they feel soooooo many different things and I can vicariously live through them and analyze their perspectives and what not. I’m pretty much a chill person but when I’m with an ENFP my energy goes through the roof and we pretty much have conversations screaming at each other without even noticing. \n\n
2	They make me feel less alien to other humans, and usually introduce me to all my future friends. I find them easier to trust than most.
1	I don't get how people are able to know the type of someone else
1	They can be stubborn. Veeeeery stubborn. I’ve known quite a few over the years and everything is all roses up until an invisible tripwire is activated and there’s no getting past Fi-rooted stubbornness.
1	I dated an ENFP and we used to get along incredibly well, but eventually problems built up in the relationship (some major fuck ups by me tbh) and we parted ways, the biggest problem communication wise was discussing abstract concepts and ideas, a lot of the times she just could not get behind the logic I was using and vice versa (Fi vs Ti imo) and I say that this was a problem because sometimes those abstract concepts and ideas were directly related to our relationship and we just couldnt get to agree on what to do and fighting ensued, it got exhausting
5	As an ENTP, what is the best way to motivate myself to do things?	How do I'm an ENTP, 3,7/5,8 enneagram type. How do I actually motivate myself to do things? I have this problem, as I see is common here, where I start off extremely motivated and accomplish a lot, but that motivation quickly falls off. Like the semester just started, and I'm doing really good, but I don't want to fall back into the pattern where I lose all motivation and my grades start to slip. How do I prevent that?
10	You don‘t wait for motivation, you learn to get your body moving out of discipline.
3	> but I don't want to fall back into the pattern where I lose all motivation and my grades start to slip. How do I prevent that?\n\nTape your report card above your desk to remind yourself what happened the last time you decided to fuck off.
3	Eventually, you'll get sick of being all talk and no action and you'll be sick of people calling you on that fact. Then you'll look to others to motivate you and to team up with because you're an external thinker and there's an ExxJ or INxJ out there that will drive you but you'll either get sick of compromising all day or depending on others to get anything accomplished. Once that happens, you'll choose the next logical option, to self motivate, and it will take years to get used to but you'll realize you can do it and everything works out. Cheers. 
1	I treat it as a quest and do self-reward after, a pretty big one. Example:  \n\- Scheduled for a meeting with someone I don't like? I'll go have my favorite steak afterwards.   \n\- Must do a job with someone difficult? Set an expensive pampering session afterwards.  \n\n\- Class with professor I hate? Extra gaming time tonight. \n\nSmall things work too, like chocolate or ice cream. Of course, if you failed/bailed on your quest, you didn't get the reward.   \n
1	You have 3 options:\n\n1.) Create a schedule and adhere to it. (Type 8 Shadow xNTJ showing here)\n\n2.) Let go of controlling your weakness of lack of motivation, and get your grades as high as possible before you stop caring.\n\n3.) Change your major to something where Option #1 works out for you.
2	Who Likes Maze-Like Puzzles More, INTP or ENTP?	
2	I dislike almost any kind of puzzle. It is just not practical, not close to solving real world problems.
1	Give me a puzzle, no matter what kind, and you have me. If it's difficult enough I can get so obsessed with it I spend days not eating, sleeping or even leaving my room.\n\nLast time it happened was a few days ago, I got obsessed with finding the optimal algorithm to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem and I spent 12 hours locked in my room solving it.\n\nI love puzzles so much I actually got into Computer Science so I could make solving puzzle-like problems my career.
40	Paradox of anti-social behavior even though it makes me depressed?	I'm a male, mid 20's boisterous extrovert. When the overwhelming responsibilities of my unemployed, relationshipless life demand me to make a public appearance or exert brainstorming energy, I find myself effortlessly riffing and laughing with people literally everywhere I go and end up feeling more energized. What's weird is, if I have the choice i seem to somewhat prefer kicking it solo and don't make a regular effort to stay in contact with friends or go out to bars. Basically every time I chill with friends they come over to my place or initiated the interaction even though I know long periods of isolating myself have led to serious depression in my past.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone else have any similar paradoxical social traits or strategies for improvement? Because the best tools in my kit right now seem to be adderall and wellbutrin.
25	This is exactly me. I lose contact with friends because i just never reach out. Even tho i am pretty good with the whole being social thing. \n\nI am quite energized by others. But for some reason i will rarely choose to be social. I don’t get it. 
11	So, I'm decent at socializing, but it's anything from effortless. In fact, I find it highly draining. Most people in my life would classify me as an extrovert. They have no idea how much time I spend alone.\n\nThat being said, I don't tend to get depressed when "isolated". You said something about being unemployed and single. Are you looking for a job or SO? Are you prevented from either of these pursuits for some reason?\n\nI don't know about you, but I'd be wickedly bored if I didn't have anything to do but dick around on Reddit for most of the day. Even if I saw my friends and family from time to time, my existence would feel aimless and likely meaningless. Do you have any goals? Are those coming along? Sometimes, the best solution to existential angst is just to straight-up keep yourself busy.\n\nBarring that, drugs and therapy. 
5	I am the exact same way. In work and school environments I get along with everyone but I rarely become friends with people outside of the places I met them. I tend to get into a relationship and devote any effort for social interaction to them. I have had a lot of friends say "don't be a stranger" because they know that even though I'm happy and fun when I do show up, I'm usually MIA for months. 
5	Here's something simple I do. Whenever I think of someone, I send them a message. Or atleast try to make an active attempt to contact them. It helps maintain an active social life
4	I read somewhere that we need lots of down time to reflect and renergise but when we are at a party we are hyper social. Sounds like me anyway.
5	Welcome to our magical world of unhealthy entps. \n\nTake a seat and enjoy the sausage.
3	I am the exact same, and I have questioned whether I am an introvert or extrovert because of it. Being around others obviously energises me. Yet, I sometimes find myself wishing I wasn’t so reliant on other people’s company and I rarely reach out to others.\n\nPart of it may be that I don’t like committing to things. If I make plans with someone, then I MUST show up. Similarly, other things things I enjoyed in the past - sports, for example - were great once I was there, but knowing that I HAD to be there killed any excitement for it beforehand. I really dislike locking myself down when it comes to my time. \n\nThat’s likely only one piece of the puzzle, however, and potentially not applicable to you. I share your behaviour but I’m no closer to understanding it. 
3	I’m afflicted with the same issue. And I think I kinda understand why I behave like this. Basically I think I lose interest once I feel I have figured someone out: what drives them, why they do what they do etc. \n\nI know it sounds horrible to say this but it is the reason I think. Once the intrigue is gone, I tend to just avoid people after that cuz some part of me is like mehhh I just can’t be bothered with all the intricacies of social behavioural decorum. Another part of me doesn’t want to offend people with my crude honesty & humour. Another part of me is just too lazy to bother with being all fun & entertaining.\n\nAs for tips, I guess try not to be super jovial & involved initially just so people don’t always expect you to be like that. Ease into the social scene, learn about the people first and then be fun and entertaining if they are worth it for you.
3	> if I have the choice i seem to somewhat prefer kicking it solo\n\nMaybe you're not really an Extrovert? Maybe you just have the ability to fake it, well, and find it makes your life easier so you turn it on when you have to. Just a thought.
3	I think you’re going to get a lot of confirmation bias here. Most of the responses saying I love being social and am never alone aren’t likely to be on reddit.
2	Anti-social behaviours are those where you kill animals and burn paper bins, are you sure that's what you meant?
2	My friends have started texting my mom to ask if I'm getting their texts. She answers, oh, yes she is, she's just a bad friend. Lol \n\nFor a while I started to just allow those people to be around me but eventually they stopped coming around. That bothered me so I started trying up reach out again but that's just so much work... I can be extroverted with a few people at a time. Maybe like 2-3. The rest get pushed under the rug. It doesn't work because often those people are friends, family, and even clients whoall need me. Ugh. I don't know what to do either.
1	I have those paradoxical social traits. I get energized by talking to people, but I never keep in touch with old friends. When I stay home all day, I start getting depressed because of the lack of interaction. I don't know exactly why this happens. Maybe because the act of having to go out and talk to people seems kind of tedious when I'm chilling on the couch, watching Netflix or reading. Also, it's never guaranteed that the subject matter of the talk will be fun. I absolutely hate it when people discuss the weather, or something I have no idea about and don't understand even with some explanation. I just wish people enjoyed talking about or doing the things I like. Maybe then I wouldn't have the seemingly paradoxical behaviour. Because the best of both worlds if I could be home and watch something with friends in while we can discuss every line, every scene.
1	Quick Summary of text below: entp thinks he hates solo, finds rules “ which he inherently hates”  learns to follow them finds out who true friends are and has enough time to become totally new by the time they interact next. Sharpens skills  becomes powerhouse feels liberated. \n\nThis has been true for me until I found out I was an ENTP and watched a bunch of videos on it. The cure for me has been making friends with similar habits or willingness to understand behavior. The biggest running gag between me and my friends is at the end of interaction be it phone or in person is usually “ well take care of yourself cause I won’t hear from you until next year” this has been happening for the last 7 years and bugged me in the beginning but now I find liberating. Because all these friends were better at keeping up with normal day to day check ins hanging out with them on a consistent basis made me think I was doing good but overall drowned me. I almost became like the little brother you bring along just to send them over to girls you like to say sweet things to and laugh at them when they say things like “ I think she really likes me”. \n\nThis followed me into college but I started smoking marijuana which apparently makes me go batshit crazy. I called my parents one night and demanded by cussing my mom out profusely to not let my dad hear our conversation because I swear he was trying to kill me. My parents drove 8 1/2 hours to come pick me up that night. I would go in and out of delusional states for the next two days and have episodes weeks following. Must have been laced I though but I had a friend from my home town who had some and same effect but was able to contain the situation. After this I went solo solo.\nWorked at a local farm and though myself no good.\n\nSo like all hero’s journeys you go through pain not around it. I started watching RSD videos “ real social dynamics” pick up videos while going solo I watched these for months. Then going out and practicing my game on girls. I became a player pulling chicks daily sometimes twice a day. Then my brother had his wedding. I was his best man and my current girlfriend for 3 years was the maid of honor.\n\nFast forward we now live together back where I freaked out on marijuana “Saint George Utah” and the only thing that keeps depression and crazy episodes at bay are waking up early working hard eating right and bed on time not a minute later or it turns into fights and circled unanswerable questions.\n\nAlso try and spend 0 mins watching or surfing social media’s unless it’s for current task at hand. The. Only spend time at work or at building my skills so for me I wake up work 8-4:30 then come home eat shower work on music until 8 block time for my girlfriend 8-10 then sleep repeat. This is hard at first but the more I do the more I realize how much of a powerhouse I am and can’t be ignored for my skills. I currently have prospects I can choose from and make my own timelines.\n
1	What do you want to improve, exactly? Do you want to initiate more?
1	I advice questionning your judgement whenever there is a social activity and you avoid going for it.
1	yep
1	I'm the same honestly.  As a teenager I had such a hectic social life with probably literally close to 100 friends in different social scenes.  I was constantly going to parties and events or at people's houses or having people over at my house and I loved it. \n\nNow I'm mid 20s and moved to a big city, I find it so hard and so much effort to form and maintain social bonds, events are so tiring and everyone lives far away and it takes forever to get anywhere in this damn city!   I moved to an inner suburb close to the CBD thinking it would help but it hasn't really.  Some days I barely speak to another human being in person.  I wish things were different but also kind of don't mind it.   I imagine when I get a proper full time job in my field, after I finish my degree, that work will be my main social source. \n\nI think a big reason though is my creative projects.  Recording music and writing my novel take up a lot of time but I'm happy with that.  Also talk to my mum on the phone every day and without that I'd probably go insane. 
1	1) You find it easy to socialize\n2) You choose not to\n\nSo, what gives? Most likely, the people with which you socialize. You just don't find them to be sufficiently interesting such as to warrant putting in the effort to maintain a more continuous relationship.\n\nSo, if you want to be around people more, I'd recommend finding people you really want to be around.
1	Yeah no sweat I’ll share it all if it helps. I watched a Myers Briggs video about ENTPs saying we need to watch self help as a habit. I’ve done that for a long time. I think the next level up is teaching it. So all my friends I talk to every other month  usually talk to them about deep meaningful stuff. I also use this forum to preach. Get disciples man it helps you get those thoughts out and creates better filters though actual trial.  \n\nMy thoughts on marijuana are use it but don’t abuse it. So if it’s getting you out and social use that, I’d say that regularly take days off to get it out of your system since it suppress rem sleep.\nI heard about this negative effect on the joe Rohan podcast another place to gather dope ass teaching materials.
12	A day in the romantic life of an ENTP - (I fucked up)	This week (day before Valentines) I was at a coffee shop and ran into a girl i used to hangout with years ago. Since then she's got her masters and teaching a college sociology course. I'm beyond intrigued. 20+ mins later and i'm overflowing with passion on the subject and bring up George Orwell's book 1984. She's saying she knows it, but i can tell she doesn't and ended up overly-aggressively calling her out on it. I couldn't believe a someone who studied sociology could have never heard of 1984 and felt it impossible to ignore.\n\n5 minutes of dry conversation later and I'm starting to realize she's mysteriously upset about something, which naturally.. made me hyper-curious to prod for details. After a vague briefing, The chin quiver was already setting in. She said she needed to leave before the waterworks started. To which I jokingly responded, "Okay.. well.. don't forget to check out George Orwell!" which was met with a chuckle, sniffle and "shut up". Which I consider a semi mood lift. I left the place with the new revelation that somehow my vocal inflections or eyebrow raises apparently carry the same level of power and responsibility as fucking spider-man. If i had intentionally tried to offend this poor girl, she'd have shot off in horror toward oncoming traffic. I really wasn't trying to be patronizing or a dick but I can't stand bullshit small talk and in this instance, came in like "Heeeere's Johnny!" to get to brass tacks. If i hadn't pulled it out of her, i'd never had even guessed what I said and unfortunately only really only think about words after they've been said. In trying to share my enthusiasm i can get pretty intense and come off as abrasive in my effort to have authentic interactions toward the an efficient resolution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent Valentines alone drinking whiskey.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nMy excitement to talk about sociology / psychology with an old friend resulted in me looking like a patronizing asshole and nearly causing a nice girl to start crying in public the day before valentines.
13	> I was stunned but wanted to share the obvious relevancy\n\nWrong reaction. You hurt her pride.\n\n> if for no other reason, the sake of her students.\n\nImplying that she isn't capable of teaching her students properly. Again, not helpful. Let her do her job.\n\n> to prod for details.\n\nInvasive. \n\n> I wasn't trying to be patronizing\n\nYet you succeeded.\n\n> and literally 0% of a dick\n\nI'd argue for a higher percentage.
36	> I read her body language and like a knee jerk, instantly call her out (accurately) on having never heard of either.\n\nNothing good ever comes from this. It's not funny, informative, or clever. All it does is annoy people and make you look bad. Make a point of never doing the "OMG! You've never seen such and such?!?" routine again.  You won't miss it.  None of your friends will miss it.  It will improve your life. 
9	>I spent Valentines alone drinking whiskey\n\nSounds like a great day to me.

1	Spider-Man level responsibility haha lol I laugh cause it’s true. I’d say we’ve all very well at keeping emotions under wraps but other types “not all” just can’t. Assume people can’t Handle straight truths to their character until true rapport has been made . So play the fool. I recall a story where a king or maybe one of the famous queens had their fools tell jokes with harsh truths in them and if they felt they weren’t honest enough they would be punished. People are looking for answers with most a spoonful of sugar helps and I know ENTPs have the most cleaver minds make the journey epic. \nBe the hero\nBe silly\nBe spiderman \n
-3	Sociology professor that never heard of 1984.. Just goes to show how much of a joke humanities are. 
-4	You did the right thing. She deserved that.\nNever feel sorry for being a good ENTP. I so regret that. New generation ENTPs should be proud of themselves more and more. \nMove on. Time to accept your powers and use them to your advantage. \n

3	Came out INTP, \n\nMaterialistic, offbeat, thinking, interpersonal, vital, easygoing, sectarian\n\nHigh on schizotypal and antisocial LOLLL\n\nEnneagram 9\n\n\nceo, executive, ambassador, strategist, businessman, business analyst, corporate lawyer, international business specialist, project manager, diplomat, political scientist, business consultant, business administrator, business manager, political analyst, entrepreneur, stock broker, politician, management consultant, financial manager, lawyer, scientist, investment banker, scholar, college professor, international relations specialist, philosophy professor, policy analyst, marketing director, judge, financial adviser, academic, research scientist, consultant, economist, philosopher, marketing manager, operations manager, financial planner, analyst, marketing specialist, supervisor, mathematician, advertising executive, dictator, entertainment lawyer, biomedical engineer, business owner, nuclear engineer, administrator, researcher, genetics researcher, aerospace engineer, astronaut, biochemist, data analyst, international spy, financial analyst, chemical engineer, public relations specialist, civil engineer, neurosurgeon, neurologist, real estate investor architect, military intelligence\n\n\nIt‘s pretty accurate. Even though I expected to get a feeling type as a result.
2	This scored me as ENTP, that's literally the first time I've ever gotten anything other than ENTJ on any test. Holy shit lol. \n\nEnneagram 8w7 which is correct. \n\nI scored really high on ASPD, NPD was in second place by a wide margin. \n\nOne of my career choices was "dictator", ahahahahahaha. 
1	I got ISTP though I'm an INTP. \n\nI got 9w1 which is correct. 
7	How to prevent reinventing the wheel	For a while now I do this shit where i find an interesting book and start reading it. Few chapters in I realize that I have thought about this before and stop reading the book to protect the originality of my thoughts and start forming the rest of the knowledge from what I thought, shunning everything I read from that book and never reading that book again. For example I started reading the book called "The winner effect " by Ian Robertson and 60 pages in I realized I have thought about what makes a person win more often and decided to go off on my own. I did land up researching about the zone or flow state and frame control and stuff, but mostly i spun up theories and started connecting them on the basis of what i have researched. This has lead to me rediscovering existing things often and even though I am proud of it for a short while i realize so many people already know it and to them these were the basics because it was handed to them from the start while i was "figuring it out". It hurts my ego sometimes and honestly i desire to stand out because i can produce knowledge and anyone else who can deserve respect. Granted statistics and experimental results can't be hypothesized and are often acquired unless you work in that field, also granted reading sometimes sheds light on possibilities and perspectives that haven't been imagined till date. But I am still curious is there a work around.
3	Yeah, I can relate to what you say.\n\nBut you know, it's what you're skilled at: Your intuiting is always finds patterns and discovers something. You can't stop this. If you were living centuries before, you would be a great inventor but here we are.\n\nThis will work out when you are specializing in a field. You will find something new.
3	OMG this so me! I'm an avid non-fiction reader but I rarely finish books. Sometimes when I reach the last 50-80 pages of the book I lose interest and I tend to skim through them & just read the bullet points so I could convince myself that I've finished the book. Other times I simply "fast-read"  books that are centered around single concepts i.e. "The five second rule" by Mel Robbins. (Especially when I already kinda know exactly what the book is talking about.)
2	I have never related to a post more than this 
2	> I realize that I have thought about this before and stop reading the book to protect the originality of my thoughts \n\nWhy?\n\nYou realize that all scholarly thought builds upon previous thought, right? It's okay to be "derivative." In fact, you're depriving yourself of deeper understanding by ignoring existing ideas.\n\n> it was handed to them from the start \n\nNo, they sought out knowledge and took the time to read. How is that "having it handed to them?"
2	Hahaha, this is the first time I read someone who does this.  \nIt happens with everything. What I figured with the years is that having original thoughts is a waste if one doesn't produce. So now I'm bummed out if it happens, but I don't stop reading. I keep on reading, taking notes of old thoughts and new thoughtxs and in the end, you will see the result
1	Have you asked yourself if originality of knowledge is an actual thing?\nName something that’s original? 😏
2	An Attempt at Best: Who An INFJ Is? My best friend is an ENTP an it thought you might enjoy this!!	
2	It got [removed]. :c
1	I Thought*****
103	Found this online. Can relate	ENTP secrets.\n\nDon’t tell me what to do, I’m going to do it anyway.\n\n1. We have no idea what’s going on. Like, ever. Not even one time.\n2. We’re damn good at making you think that we know what’s going on, and that it was our plan all along.\n3. We’re so frickin loyal it’s not even funny. We play it off like we don’t care about anyone, but we would legit do absolutely ANYTHING for those we care about.\n4. If we’re trying to be extra funny, you know something’s up. We’re most likely covering up our emotions with a good ole unhealthy dose of sarcasm and depreciating humor.\n5. Our secrets have secrets. We may seem like open books, but believe me. There’s sooo much more going on under the surface.\n6. We absolutely need time for ourselves to think. We’re the kind of extroverts that you may have to drag to a party, but we’ll be the life of the party when we get there.\n7. We. Need. Attention. For everything we do. Even though we give off this sort of “I don’t care what you think” vibe, we need constant validation, even just someone saying “oh cool”. We thrive to impress people, no matter how hard to believe that is.\n8. We feel stress just the same as any other type. We just choose to bury it deep deep down where no one can see it, and let it blow up in our faces later.\n9. I didn’t talk enough about validation. We have this hunger to do something and to be someone. We need to make a difference, somehow, somewhere.\n10. We hate it when people have us figured out. We hate it even more when people only think that they have us figured out, but they’ve got us all wrong.\n11. We hate to be ignored. Like, seriously. If we ask you for something, which is something we very rarely do, we expect you to take the time to listen to us.\n12. We are the most caring assholes you’ll ever meet. We love to make people happy, but we’ll grumble about it the whole time.\n13. We hate being overestimated. Underestimate us, please. We get strength from being the underdog. If we feel like you’re putting too much on us, we’ll just give up because we don’t see that it’s worth it to fail.\n14. Challenge us. For the love of God, give us something to argue about. Complacency is a danger to us ENTPs, and it can lead us to very bad habits. We need someone or something that’ll spark our interest, or we’ll go insane.\n15. We’re really full of mushy gushy stuff on the inside. No one’s supposed to know that.\n16. We feel overwhelmed a lot, and when we do, you need to give us space to sort things out. Like, two minutes. Please.\n17. We lie. Constantly. About everything. Watch your back.\n18. We deserve respect. With everything that we do for the people around us, we deserve at least a little bit.
21	Fe makes me lie. When that’s not operative I’m telling the truth. I’m telling the truth as I understand it the vast majority of the time.
60	What a self-congratulatory list.\n\n>We’re really full of mushy gushy stuff on the inside. No one’s supposed to know that.\n\nThis is IxFP and all the TJ variations. My mushy stuff is right outside for people to see. It's the semi-robotic innards that I'm trying to hide. Hey world, look, I have Fe, I'm really a human I promise.\n\n>We lie. Constantly. About everything. Watch your back.\n\nNo.
10	as much as i hate to admit it, most of this is true for me lol
8	Omg, I basically can relate to the whole list. And that's a first one for me. I especially really like the first one, I see that others don't agree but jesus it's true for me. That's why I need validation,  to kind of get of I'm doing ok for a second. 
18	1. I don’t get it.\n3. I mean I can be loyal but “so fricken loyal it’s not even funny?”...eh. \n4. If I’m trying to be extra extra funny it’s probably because I want to fuck that person tbh.\n5. You mean like literally every human on the planet?\n10. I don’t think I consciously care if people have me figured out or if they think they do.\n17. If we lie about everything then literally this whole list to make us look more human and relatable is completely useless. Why the hell should anyone trust a chronic liar? Lol. This makes a horrible habit seem like some quirky trait.
6	I don't agree with inviting people to underestimate me. I want people to see the quality in me and what I have to offer. 
4	You forgot "We love generalization"\n\nJust kidding. But, as a reminder for us, never let purported traits influence your actions. Even if you do have certain qualities, that's no excuse for what you do.\n\nThe mbti memes are there to remind you of what negative aspects of your type you should continually be working on. Keep on grinding, fellow ENTPs and other types who may or may not be reading this. 
6	TBH this seemed very ENFP to me. My guess is author is mis-typed
15	I hate how cringe this is
4	You've got me all figured out and I hate it!  Apart from the lying.  I don't really lie much unless there's a good reason. 
15	What a completely retarded list of bullshit.  I hope you get lots of upvotes. \n\n
8	This list is such a crock of fucking shit. Let's assume an ENTP wrote it (i.e., you), and that ENTPs are supposed to be self-consistent via Ti.\n\n1+11. If you don't know what's going on, how do you know you're being ignored? \n\n1+13. If you don't know what's going on, how do you know you're being overestimated? \n\n17+18. If you lie, why do you deserve respect? \n\n7+16. If you crave attention, then you don't need space.\n\n3+17. You're so loyal, you lie. Constantly. About everything. \n\n7+14. If you need to validated, then you can't be challenged.\n\nAnd that's just at a fucking glance -- this entire list was obviously written by someone who couldn't be self-consistent if his type depended on it. 
5	Apart from number 1 I can relate \n\nI am def ride or die for the handful of those I care about  but didn’t realise this was an ENTP trait.
2	\#3 is highly inacurate for me. I struggle with the fact that I have zero loyalty; when someone fucks me up I don't give the benefit of the doubt. I'm pretty sure that's a common ENTP trait too.\n\nI don't think it's good, but it do be like that sometimes.
2	Used to lie a lot but my parents got really mad at me once when i was younger and I just dont do it anymore. I was actually pretty good as well.\n\nNo. 8 hits too close to home. Like if someone ever sees that im stressed they know it's super serious shit.\n\n3. Is actually solid to an extent. If anyone ever backstabs me I won't forgive that\n\n14. If not challenged will just coast then when crunch time comes big oof
2	~90% accurate.\n\n**I never brag about helping people unless I was being funny.\n\n**I rarely lie, but when I do it's usually to avoid showing any kind of vulnerability, most of the time it's not even lying I just change the direction of the conversation to something I'm more comfortable talking about.\n\n"people, unsettled by their vulnerability, eternally fear to tell the truth, to mediate between chaos and order, and to manifest their destiny." -Jordan Peterson.\n\n**About the attention thing; I'm always conflicted about receiving compliments, I always get like "you're so funny.. you're so smart..etc." most of the time I feel like I don't deserve these compliments. I always feel like I should receive compliments for not-easily-gained achievements/accomplishments not for my fun personality.\n\n**I do like getting validation, but not getting it never stops me from doing what I want to do.\n\n
2	ENTP has no idea about what is going on in the clouse environment but ENTP is the best type that can understand what is going on at a conceptual level... why do you think ENTP is the best debater ? Becouse he/she can see an concept connected with everything.\n\nWe understand the warld better then anyone  and mb we can't see what is in front of ower face but we can "see" everything that is not in front of ower face.\n\nDo not forget that.
2	>Hur durrr watch your back \n\n\nThis so fucking cringy
4	What a load! Maybe a few points are valid but this seems to describe a 13 yo immature ENTP if anything
2	Wow, it's amazing how they know the secrets of approximately 24 million ENTPs.
1	I don't think we lie to the one who care about us but we lie if you desrve it. If you are an idiot who thinks low of us, ya you get our lie with no guilt. We can full you badly, manipulate you, drives you insane but only when it is necessary. Good thing we avoid you and when we can't ya we lie to you. 
1	Mostly true but 7,8,11,15,16 sound more like ESFP. ENTPs don’t care about getting attention, rather they care about attending to others to be valued. Also as far as I’m concerned, there is no mushy-gushy inside. If I am surrounded by mushy gushy people, I will react to their mushy gushyness and possibly come off as mushy gushy but take that away and most ENTPs will seem stone cold. And stress is not a thing. We may get choice paralysis in the form of procrastination but stress implies worry over the future. ENTPs don’t do that we worry about the past in the form of regret. I should have done this, I should have done that blah blah blah.
1	I’m super honest, too honest and I hurt people because of that, but at the same time I lie everytime, you have to believe me, it’s possible 
1	hm. I can’t relate to the lying part, I’m too honest and blunt for my own good. I might hide the truth and the crumbs that could lead to them, but I wouldn’t reach to a point where I lie. If i got confronted, I will reveal the truth expecting the consequences. \nAnd when I’m being funny, or generally sarcastic, it’s mostly to push someone’s buttons, to witness their reactions or plainly for my own amusement, though definitely not to hide pain or any sort of emotions along the line of it. In pain I rather retreat in my own space or viciously try to distract myself. 
1	This is scarily accurate. Especially the idea of "validation". If we feel as though we have mastered a skill, it loses all usefulness in our lives therefore one must make us constantly feel like we need to work for it - this goes especially in the case of relationships/love.  Quite idiosyncratic to our validation is our loyalty. We simultaneously want to drop anything that doesn't satiate our need to grow while relying on those who have become entangled in our lives to feel as though we have their back. For example,  I keep in contact with all of my exes and I have recently ran into the realization that some of them think I can't get over them (which is absurd as I am the one who lost all interest). What I have concluded is it is something deeper. Once you get even a taste of who I am, I need you to protect you because you are now in the inner orb of my existence. I will do anything for you and not out of a desire to be with you. Maybe it relates back, once again, to validation? I need to be validated by those who know me or my existence seems futile? Not sure. 
202	I’m an ENFJ dating an ENTP for 6.5 years. He sent me this Valentine that just about sums up how well we’ve adjusted to each other’s type	
63	>Ironically using Ben Shapiro\n\nYep, he’s an ENTP lads.
7	He meant he cares about your facts.
11	Okay , this is epic
28	Ew Ben Shapiro, but also, like, yeah. Lol
27	Ugh Ben Shapiro? 
6	I get the meme but what do you all think of Ben Shapiro? \nI like JP and improve yourself and all that. But BShapiro is just there to throw shit around and "Ebin Troll LibTardzz with FACTZ" . He most certainly is an ENTP. I don't like him. He's exhausting and EVEN if he raises some valid points, they are completely drowned by how close minded he is
3	ew, Ben Shapiro
1	Sent this to my INTP buddy who's dating an ENFJ.
1	He loves you. 
2	Stab at Ne(inspiration: family guy)	I just recently started family guy and it is clearly Ne dominant type shit. Just constant random crap happening, references to obscure things at every turn. And I was reading Jung about how "the present moment is a prison"\n\nI've recently done a post about Ti and how it operates as a function and I'm trying to define what it means for Ne to make an association. I.e. behind every association that Ne makes which may appear random, there is always the exact same underlying reason.\n\nI've suggested that the root of Ne associations when combined with Ti is that the underlying structure of the object reminds them of another underlying structure. I can also make the observation in myself(an INTP) that I love caricatures. Extreme versions of things that otherwise might be nuanced. In other words, when I watch a psychological thriller I don't want the serial killer to be some average joe. I want some quality of his psyche to be turned up to max so that the impacts can be easily observed and abstracted into a model, and then that model can be used for all cases of changes in that variable no matter "the volume."\n\nThe scene from family guy: Chris has been taken to become an artist by some famous painter. He has sent Peter and Meg into the city to find an address that didn't exist.\n\nNow I'm gonna briefly go back to what Jung said about "the current moment being a prison" and then I'm gonna turn up Ne's volume in the Ne dominant's psyche all the way up to max. \n\nBack to the scene: Peter and meg are walking along on the new york streets talking. The exact same animation is playing over and over with the only changes being very slight changes in their mouth movements and the background city buildings. Ne at max volume immediately makes the pattern and the scene becomes utterly boring, their words are now the only thing that is interesting. As peter and meg walk along we reference Ti's understanding of walking(walking means to go from one place to another, implying a change of scenery. Rather than having the change of scenery be minor like you would expect of an Si show, we make the small change turned into a massive change). Peter and meg suddenly walk straight into some fantasy land and continue talking. Then they abruptly notice the change in scenery. Stop talking. Stop moving. And then slowly walk back into new york.\n\nNe's association is based in the Ti underlying structure of what it means to walk, but turning its volume to max.\n\nDoes this essence underlie all Ne associations or only a select portion of them?\n\nThan again this might be only one example of an Ne association rooted in pattern "change of scenery via walking." I suppose this could all be more heavily rooted in Ti, while deducing Ne would be more rooted in the question "what is a pattern." If Ne is dominant I'm not sure the association is always rooted in Ti. This is me as an INTP. Situations remind me of similar situations because of the underlying framework. To free Ne from Ti(since Ti only serves Ne in ENTP, not stays confined by it), would be to free the need for any underlying Ti structure.\n\nUghhhh freed Ne is so hard to pin down!!!\n\nEdit: ffs I watch family guy and all I can see is just Ne galore. Peter griffin randomly lights a tree on fire. I can see the possibility being utilized, but what it is rooted in has to be some "thing." Just like the direction Ti is used it can only be oriented by Fe value in INTP, I'm assuming Ne possibilities are always perceived in terms of classical Si uses(cutting wood, furniture, burning wood->caveman->rockpaintings). It's all associations but so hard to define.
2	hm
2	what I just read
1	I believe the creator to be of an enfp personality, and what you're doing is overanalyzing this to the point of nonsense
7	How I Debate	I have always kind of struggled with the name of the ENTP being the debater because I have really never felt like I was much of one, but I realized recently that I do debate a lot, it just doesn’t look like it. \n\nHere is what I do: I get really excited about a topic and I want to talk about it with someone. Then I take a while to formulate some thoughts about this idea and then I find someone to talk about it with. They give me one of two possible objections to this idea and I rarely ever immediately have an answer to those objections and so I take those new thoughts about this topic and I go away and thing about them and work through them in my head. And then I come back with answers after a while and they give me new objections and I go away and think again and then come back with more thoughts that I want to talks about. \n\nDoes anyone else feel like they do this? It’s like a slow debate. Sometimes people get annoyed because I will get stuck on the same topic for weeks at a time and they feel like we are talking about the same thing over and over again but it’s because I need this time to step back and think through what they are saying before I can respond to it. 
13	Debate is for NJs because the goal of a debate is to convince the other side (or a neutral third party) that your position is the correct one. \n\nWhat NTPs are doing is dialectics. 
2	If you get better at this, you can debate on the fly and even talk in a none debate way. The opposition won't even know they are apart of a debate.
1	This is what's happening when I'm smoking weed with one friend and we start talking about God and the world
1	When I do it I’m not thinking faster than I talk. As soon as the thought forms it’s simultaneously spoken. New information fills in previous gaps and the bigger picture gets clearer...to me. It’s hard to realize some people don’t see the same things I do, which is why we end up talking for 20+ minutes just so they can unpack all the thoughts behind a single sentence. 
1	You absolutely nailed it on the head. I get extremely uncomfortable with contradictions to my current way of thinking but actively seek them out. I then take this discomfort along with my current orientation and work through them on my own time, deciding if the new opinions can be accommodated into my current framework or if I need to rethink my initial position. As a result, I love to debate but hate to be wrong yet actively seek out a debate in just about anything. It makes for a really uncomfortable existence to say the least. 
40	Dear ENTP	You have a way of infuriating me like no others, but I just can’t quit you charming sexy beasts. \n\nHappy Valentine’s Day \n\nLove ENFP 
14	Dear ENFPs,\n\nPlz stop ghosting meh plz.\nThank you, that would mean the world to me! :')\n\nAnd happy Valentine's Day to u, too!\n\nLove ENTP-T
13	Dear ENFP,\n\nYou drove me crazy for many years trying to chase your ethereal ass.  I moved on with an INFP.  Still ethereal, but she stays in one place.\n\nLove ENTP
4	Dear ENFP,\n\nyou are and will always be my favorite brother. Granted, you are the only one and you know how to infurtiate me like no one else does, but when push comes to shove, you are there for me and I can't thank you enough for that.\n\nLove,\n\nENTP\n\n&#x200B;\n\nside note: I do have some ENFP friends too and they are about the same as him. Understanding, goofy and great to be around, but also have a talent for pushing my buttons, even though they are all far better people than I am. Certainly don't desereve their kindness.
5	ENFPs make a good team. I dated one and it was like friends and partner. Friends as in do and like the exact same things. Best of both worlds.

2	Saw you on the INTP subreddit, how thoughtful of you to put time aside for all the types. Something I'd never do 😏
1	I almost made a college sociology professor cry after calling her out on pretending to know who George Orwell was. Then spent Valentines alone getting drunk. In other words.. it was a pretty typical day.
1	Dear ENFPs,\n\nStop making people think you're us.\n\nThey can't tell the difference.\n\nWear a pink heart so everyone knows how flighty you are.\n\nSincerely, \n\nENTP 8W7s
7	If you could revive any famous person just for a day, who'd you chose and why?	For me, as a fantasy buff, it would be Douglas Adams. Never in my life had anything made such perfect sense as did "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" series. As random as it first presents itself, the story seems to oddly work out in the end; every tiny, little detail falls into place, in a way I never felt possible.\n\nAfter finishing it, I hesitated for several years to read "The Salmon of Doubt", because it was "just a collection of interviews and unfinished ideas, he never got to publish". I am so glad I did though. Reading through his interviews and short stories about his life, I really felt connected to him. For the first time in my life, I started to mourn the death of a person, I have not even met. Not because I felt he deserved to live (which I am sure he did), but because I felt robbed of an opportunity to meet this guy, who was so much like me it almost hurt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter finding out that he -supposedly- was an ENTP too, I wonder if you guys have any other authors like him you could recommend? I am also interested to know, if you there's any (deceased) famous person, who you'd love to meet if given the chance?! Do you understand my fascination for this author or would it be someone entirely different for you, and why?
11	Robin Williams, so I could tell him how inspirational he was to me growing up, how much he meant to people, how much we love him and how we miss him dearly.\n\nI'd love to laugh with him.
10	Hitler.   I get along pretty well with most INFJs because they’re our soulmates.   I’d like to ask him where he think he went wrong, and how scared he was in the bunker before he was rescued. 
6	> If you could revive any famous person just for a day\n\nI find I can do this any time simply by reading what they wrote. :)
5	Jesus, I would like his opinion on how things turned out, language would be an issue but I think if I had Jesus himself for a day any linguist on the planet would get on a plane very fast.
2	Emma Stone bc i’m curious if she’s an Ne lead lol 
1	I don’t really agree with George Carlin much, but I’d like to hear his thoughts about what’s gone on since he left us.
1	I‘m not sure who the wisest person on earth is, but them. I‘d like to have a 3/4 hour talk with them about the world and my thoughts. This would be a dream I‘d pay thousands
1	Answering seriously: None really. I believe forcing people to return to this world past their time is not the healthiest of things. \n\nAnswering for the sake of the thread: Probably Fr. Seraphim Rose. 
1	Avicii.\n\nI want to understand how a man who has the #1 watched video on Youtube of all time currently was so suicidally depressed that no doctor was able to help him.
5	Parents’ types?	I have an INTJ father and ENFP mother. It’s been hell so far. What types are your parents? 
5	ISFJ father and ENFP mother.\n\nAt least you had an NT...
3	My mom is an INTP and my dad is an ENFJ. My older brother is an INFP. I’d say i’m pretty lucky but it was definitely a turbulent household growing up. \nMy mom was a borderline sociopath/alcoholic when I was younger. My dad was more stable and acted as a mentor, but he is extremely sensitive. I’ve always felt the need to make my dad proud, or I guess feared disappointing him. But they gave me the freedom to explore my ideas and emphasized learning which i value so much. \n\nFast forward to now, i’m 21, my parents are honestly the most supportive people in my life. My mom stopped drinking about three years ago, and my parents are content it seems. I’m super lost in life rn and they don’t pressure me to do any career I don’t want to pursue. \n\nMy boyfriend is an INFP. His mom is an ESFJ and dad is ESTJ, his whole family is in public service. His brother (ESFP) is going into the family business and my bf was pressured to as well until he stood up to them.  But he had an extremely stable “normal” childhood (sports, boy scouts, block parties). Seeing this dynamic makes me even more grateful for my parents. 
3	ENTP dad, ENFP mother. Get along like a house on fire, especially with my dad. \n\nAlso, me and my dad both dislike my INTP uncle, and it's hella fun teaming up with my dad in debates against him.
2	My mom is ISFJ. Like, textbook. She was pretty easy to type.\n\nMy dad, on the other hand, was more difficult. I thought he was ENTP for a long time because my mom read the ENTP descriptions and told me, "Yep, that's your father." (This was back in my Tumblr days, before I knew about the functions. lol) He's creative, nonconformist, and loves to debate. It seemed to fit.\n\nBut as I learned more about the functions, ENTP didn't seem quite right for him. As I got older, I learned how to debate better, and my views gradually diverged from his. I thought that he would enjoy debating different views with me, but instead he seemed annoyed. I realized, after observing him more, that his goal in debating was not to explore, but to drive home his own view. He seemed to think I was acting immorally when I played devil's advocate or explored different views just for fun. He also would get annoyed when I used Ti to work out the intricacies in ideas. It's a waste of time to him. He cares about "what's right" and "what's true." Incidentally, this attitude is very like my ESTJ sister's. I think he's a Te user.\n\nHe's also ridiculously punctual, has a meticulous system of organization (though it appear disorganized to my ISFJ mother, so she thinks he's "messy"), and was a corporate executive for years. \n\nYeah, he marches to the beat of his own drummer, but he also thinks his drummer is the only right one. ;) Definitely an Fi user. He also prefers Intuition over Sensing, but his intuitive process is more focused on coming to a conclusion than generating new ideas. Therefore, Ni. I can't give a ton of reasons for Se over Si, but Se seems to fit him better. (Unfortunately I don't have a good grip on how the Sensing functions work.)\n\nSo, uh... yeah. My dad's ENTJ. It was pretty surprising when I finally put the pieces together, but it explains a lot. :P
2	ISFP father and INFP mother.  Let's just say I am used to coddling dominant Fi...
2	lmao yall lucky enough to have at least one intuitive parent \nimagine living with ESTJ mother and ISFP father \nnot to hyperbolise, but it’s a living hell sometimes. 
2	I'm not ENTP, but a developing-ish INTP (Socionically a light subtype of INTj-Ne so I could meh sort of qualify), and my father is ISFJ, mom ESFJ, brother ESTP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll very stereotypical. Well, not my dad, who comes off as an ISTP mixed with an ENTP, due to his aspirations and his love of Ti. Your parents sound MILES more compatible with you than mine do-- I've got that very stereotypical nuts relationship with the SFJs and the STP butting in trying to bully and getting off scot-free.
1	mom is isfp; and dad is probably istp; brother is isfp
1	INFJ mother, ESFJ father.\n\nI‘m the only thinking type in my family. It sucks. I‘m basically a therapist in my family.
1	ENTP mother, ISFJ father.
1	Archetypical family:\nISFJ mother, and ISTJ father.\n\n
1	Father estj, mother isfp\n\nIt really sucks
1	ISTP dad and ISFP mum. \n\nFor the most part, we get along. Just don’t always see eye-to-eye / misinterpret each other. 
1	My mom is an ISFJ and my father is an ESFP.\nI am an ENTP.\n\nLite has Not been easy!
1	My mom is surely an ISFJ and father could be an ESFP.
1	Holy, exact same situation. INTJ father, ENFP mother, ENTJ sister, INxP sister. Curious why do you say it’s been hell? \n\nFor me my father has always favoured my ENTJ sister. I think he’d rather have me be INTJ like him or ISTP.
0	Is being a theist and socially conservative ENTP an anomaly?	Reading lists of celebrities or reading comments by self-identified ENTP, one would be led to think that an overwhelming majority of the people typed as such are overwhelmingly agnostic or openly atheist people often in league with socially liberal politics. Do you share this impression or is it just sampling bias?
13	NT's are rationals  \n  \nRationals believe truth should be determined by reason and factual analysis rather than faith, dogma, tradition or religious teaching.  \n   \n
5	NT's in general are usually more STEM oriented which usually coincides with less theistic and conservative values
5	Who gives a shit about what the norm is. Just do you.\n\nIf I can give you one advice, and I‘m not trying to accuse you of anything, never conform to „what ENTPs are supposed to be like“. Don‘t lose yourself to MBTI.
5	Celebrities are very liberal in general, so you can't really base the entire population off of them. I'm in the middle, lean conservative. I was raised religious but stopped believing after high school.
7	About 10% of the population calls themselves atheists. \nAbout 10% of the population are NTs.\nCoincidence?\nYes.\n\nThe fact is that 90% of the population profess some kind of belief  in something.   And that roughly is going to be the norm for ENTPs as well. \n\nWhat you will find is an over-representation of atheists among NTs, likely especially well-educated intelligent ones.   But it's not actually going to be the norm, especially since (again going by statistics) *most* NTs are not intelligent and well-educated. 
3	I think rearing and social environment have a lot to do with faith and ideology. I was raised by a feminist hippy, but with Lutheran foundation. I'm more conservative than her in some ways, but more in regards to my personal actions, but still really open minded to most stuff, but keep it to myself where I live because lots of mennonites etc. \n\n\nI'm also skeptical about the idea of a spiteful angry jealous god that "loves us" even though he wants us all to suffer eternally. Not a dude that seems particularly perfect or a guy I'd want to drink a coffee with let alone worship. Sounds more like an abusive controlling dad or bad relationship to me. 
4	Being a rational person tends to result in rational beliefs, a.k.a. atheism and progressivism.
2	this is internet forum bias mostly, there is a tendency towards it for the type, but different people of the same type will have different reactions to their environment resulting in different views about different subjects
2	Why do you consider yourself to be a socially conservative ENTP?
3	There's really no such thing as being "socially conservative". It's just a polite label for morons who are afraid of gay people.
3	I guess consider me an anomaly as I am a super conservative ENTP preacher. Religion doesn’t have to be simply based on feelings and it shouldn’t be. I believe there is ample evidence in nature and the Bible to support everything I believe religiously (as well as  politically/economically for the most part)  \n\nI do believe that a majority of celebrities or that you see on Reddit are going be to agnostic/atheist and left leaning.
1	Is there something wrong with this thread and this question? It is now at 0 points. I wonder if I did something wrong asking this?
1	The lack of details in your post makes it impossible to answer your question accurately so don't take this if it does not resonate with you at all, okay? \n\n\nObviously, we are all different complex creatures who can't be completely contained within the stereotypes that a personality theory suggests so if your 101% sure that your an ENTP, possesing the general attributes that the function stack of this personality suggests (based on the actual theory and not just from personal opinions of the people in reddit such as myself), then cool. I'm an ENTP and I've had a similar experience like this in the past... There was a somewhat long phase in my life when I subconsciously suppressed my authenticity because of a low level of self confidence and being uncomfortable in the environment I'm in. \n\n\n\nThe result of that is me unwittingly conforming to the behaviours that I perceive the people around me does which is a completely different person from who I am growing up. Rather than being authentic and at peace with my real personality, I instead looked like an imbalanced ISFJ in people's eyes. \n\n\n\n\nIf you're feeling like this then I suggest you to read more and feed your system with knowledge that feels right for you, if not then thanks for reading this all up to this point anyways. 
1	It’s not in principle but in the UK a while back the conservatives adopted a belief in the free markets and privatisation via Libertarian ideology. 
1	The Republican conservative viewpoint is based on fear. Fear of the actions of another, fear of what you have taken from you, fear of your life controlled by another, fear of a higher power, etc.\n\nENTP tend to be aware there is always another side, another viewpoint, another way of conceptualizing the world. In so, we are more libertine, more open-minded, and will seem not to fit in with rank and file conservatives. Even if we hold a belief or two that aligns we will be dressed too colorfully to fit in.
1	I am for sure a theist ENTP
1	I am a conservative and am very spiritual (although I don't believe in a personified god but rather a higher consciousness).  \n\nThe majority of people on the internet are liberal and atheist.  It just goes with the territory as liberals are more about telling people what needs to be done rather than going out and doing it themselves.  Social media is a communication tool so it makes sense that liberals would use it more than conservatives.  \n\nAtheism is a bit of a cult as well.  They are very strong with their "beliefs" and demanding proof is what secures their beliefs.  
1	I’m a Libertarian which is basically pretty conservative. I think you can be liberal or socialist too if you can justify it in your worldview.
0	See, I started out as an agnostic. I dove so deeply into science and other subjects, and came out a theist. I reject the logical fallacy that just because something can’t be measured empirically it must not exist. And it seems to me it takes a lot fewer miracles to believe in an intelligent designer than for all of this to be totally random.\n\nI would say I’m socially libertarian. I’m a Christian and try to observe certain ways of living, but it’s ridiculous for Christians to impose “social conservatism” or whatever standards on anyone outside their own numbers. IMHO. 
5	Question on ENTP	Happy Valentine’s Day, even though it is evidently a scam holiday created by corporations. However, that is another talk!\n\nI just wanted to ask, I’ve been reading a lot on ENTP’s recently and I took the Myer Briggs test with complete honesty. I got ENTP as a result. I’m a bit nervous, about if I am actually an ENTP. I personally believe I fit into this category perfectly. All my friends believe I do as well. However, from my research it appears ENTP’s dislike “small talk”. Personally, I don’t dislike small talk, it can be a nice pass time or introductory to a deep and valid conversation that I adore. If the conversation is purely based on evident and face value bullshit I’d assume everyone would be bored to death? I get bored as hell from that type of stuff. However, it appears ENTP’s absolutely despise small talk. \n\nI’m mainly here to ask for some clarification if my statements about my ideology on small talk shifts me away from being an ENTP.\n\nCheers! 
8	I don’t dislike small talk per-say, but every time I engage in it for too long I feel this horrible “Oh my God what the fuck do I say next???” feeling in my gut. There is this unending thought that I will soon run out of things to say and everything will become awkwardly silent. Small talk requires me to be 100% conscious of everything I’m saying. \n\nI don’t hate small talk for a brief amount of time. After that I definitely get sick of it not because “I JUST CANT FOCUS LULZ”, but because it makes me anxious and uneasy since it’s not really my territory nor is it something that interests me. \n
3	First of I'm an ENTP and I do hate small talk. I would much rather discuss ideas and outlandish theories. Small talk gets really boring for me really fast. So that might be a sign that you've been mistyped.\n\nThe Myer Brigs test is pretty inaccurate and often mistypes people. I would recommend you to check out the test 2keys because it is more accurate then the official test on the site.\n\nI don't know a whole lot about all the different types but I think your description of yourself sound more like ENFP than ENTP to me. However if you want to know for sure do the test I mentioned. 
1	It's a personality type. It's not like there isn't some room for variation in individuals. Not everyone will fit perfectly. I've done the test a couple of times and sometimes I am INTP although for the most part i get ENTP. Things are also situational or dependent on your mood. In a certain setting you might react differently than in another.
1	It's actually a pagan expy holiday that Christians derived from the Romans.  Also no, typing isn't going to predict specific variations like how much you like/dislike small talk.  It can only predict based on correlations.
1	Small talk to me is mentioning the weather for the third time today with literally everyone who speaks to you. Yes. It’s nice. I too noticed that. The shaman (meteorologist) says it will be nice tomorrow too. Oh, weekend weather is what you’re talking about now. But then it will change and be not nice weather, and you don’t like that. \n\nJust let the conversation die already. We don’t have to talk, but if we are going to I want to really talk; and about fun things. Like physics and potential laws of gravity. The existence of time or not. Why people age. \n\nNot the effing weather. It’s raining? Good observation, Sherlock! Case closed on that one. Maybe the rain should have clued me in, but I was still a little foggy on it. Glad to have you around, old bean. 
1	Immature ENTPs don't understand the value of small talk for social interaction with non-ENTPs.\n\nYes, it's boring as shit.\n\nIn addition, making small talk with the right person will provide you with sex, money, and friends.\n\nDon't be an idiot; develop your small talk skills.
4	I'm an INTP and I was hoping you all could help me define Ne by laying out an INTP cognition and having you explain Ne afterward.	 \n\nWe use Ti to build a mathematical equation model to represent objects. I.e. we approach objects in terms of "wholes" that unfortunately are subjective. Te types have incomplete models of objects but are objective.\n\nSo we basically have this conglomerate of how changes in variables affect the other variables within the equation of a certain "thing" or object. And have an input and output. Then Fe presents Ti with a goal of perceived value(connotation literal perceive, not perception function. So perhaps evaluated is the better term). Ti will reductively work backwards.\n\nLets say your goal is low amounts of E. If A at a high value implies B then C then D then low E, then A needs to be at a high value to achieve low E. So we have reduced the complexity of the problem from a system of "A, B,C,D, and E" down to a simple relationship of "high A then low E" by understanding relationships between each variable. But lets say A is at a low value. There is some reason it is at a low value. We have to "solve" the thing that is causing A to be a low value by making changes to that which produces A. An illustrative example of this is as follows: imagine you have a two objects. A large box and a small box. Now imagine there is a keyhole that can only be unlocked by putting an oval in it, the oval is smaller than the large box and bigger than the small box. To make the key, we have to change the large box by chipping away pieces of it until it can fit, or we add pieces around the small box until it fills up the entirety of the oval.\n\nNow lemee take a short second to explain Ti-Ne and Ne-Ti together. If ne ti perceives a box, Ne might also associate the box with a dishwasher, or a dryer, or a shipping crate Etc etc. They all have the same essence, they are boxes.(Ti will sometimes fuck this up. An example of a fuck up is when you use a hypothetical to prove something but the hypothetical isn't the exact same form as what you are getting at so it doesn't follow perfectly). A hypothetical example I once used: if a person walks out into society and gets punched then it is kinda their fault. My hypothetical for this was "well if an elevator said *50% chance you die if you use this* and you used it and died then people would say it was kinda your fault for using the elevator." The difference that wasn't initially spotted is that ethically speaking an elevator=/=a person.\n\nThe above is also why Ne users rule over their meme domains with an iron fist, crushing all Se users who come within striking distance. Kill on site as we don't want them. Basically Ne doms are constantly associating what happens to other situations with identical underlying structure. Enfp will be utter meme gods for emotional reaction memes and relating them to how they are currently feeling.\n\nSo basically Ti-Ne has this equational representation in its mind of the difference between the oval and the box sizes. For the large box it's gonna try to come up with ideas to shave the box, but for the small box it will basically say "equation of oval keyslot minus box dimensions=oval with box cut out of the middle" then Ne will make associations to everything it knows that equals "oval with box cut out."\n\nI do not yet know how Ne presents ideas for chipping away at the large box despite knowing what changes in form need to be made i.e. choice of tool. If Ti has a underlying equational representation of an object it needs to solve a problem, where does Ne turn for ideas? Similarly when Ne notices objects is it finding associations simply in similar underlying structures? What causes an Ne association? What is the essence of an Ne association? How would you define Ne?
6	I think you have to consider NeTi as a dynamical system.  You can pull it apart into Ne and Ti on a theoretical basis, and hence define them separately, but the two work together as a system, and [in reality are indivisible. ](https://consciousnessminded.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/drawing-hands.jpg)\n\nSaid another way, Ne is a Perception and Ti a Judgement.  But what what can be Perceived without preconceptions?   And how can you judge with no object to cast the judgement upon?  So these high level cognitive functions are really only independent in a theoretical sense.  \n\nThat said, if we define Ti as a set of rational, self-consistent rules which are distilled from observations of objective reality ( that is Ti is our own internal model of the Te universe)  then we can see Ne as the Perception function which works with the raw data before it (rather than on an internal conceptual map of the universe like Ni ).\n\nSo the associations that Ne notices come in part from happenstance — what happens to be passing through the mind, the memory, and perception of the person at that time.  Since these are intuitive associations, they are not based in tangible aspect but in conceptual ones.  \n\nSo Ne does not notice primarily similarities in color, size, sound, taste, and other Sensorial qualities.  It notices juxtapositions of concept.  That’s why Ne is especially keen to things like irony and innuendo, coincidence and similarities in more abstract senses — like how a raven is like a writing desk. \n\nTi and Fi just step in and reject or accept those observations as being meaningful according to their respective principles, Ti based on the logic of the Object and Fi based on the logic of the Person.
5	This was a pretty fun read. \n\n> But lets say A is at a low value. There is some reason it is at a low value. We have to "solve" the thing that is causing A to be a low value by making changes to that which produces A. \n\nYeah, this is where Ti *can* have the advantage, and also why TPs in general are labeled as great problem solvers. Sure, for most scenarios knowing that A needs to be high to achieve low E is enough. \n\nBut, when the *concept* is the same and the *problem* is different, then having that complete framework via Ti gives TPs a head start. \n\n\n> I do not yet know how Ne presents ideas for chipping away at the large box despite knowing what changes in form need to be made\n\nSo, the difference here is between TiNe and NeTi. TiNe, for example would say, \n\n*“Ok, if the size of the key is x, the small box’s size is <x, and the large box’s size is >x, then either we cut down the large box, or add pieces (somehow) to the small box so the key fits. Either the large box, or the small box needs to be adjusted for x.”*\n\nNeTi would run through several different scenarios (I assume the tool cannot be changed), \n\n*”Ok, let’s cut down the large box. It’s possible that there may be a clue inside it, like another key that can be used to open the small box.”*\n\n*”Or, what if we do cut down the large box, and the pieces that are cut off are the exact amount needed to attach to the small box in order for it to be big enough for the key? Are the boxes able to be disassembled and reconfigured in a different dimension?”*\n\nAnd, when each scenario fails (or succeeds), that information gets tacked on to Ti’s framework of the problem. Some adjustments are made, and more ideas are proposed. TiNe builds the *complete* framework from the beginning by not just understanding the problem, but by building relationships between the different variables.\n\nNeTi takes the problem, builds a skeleton framework, and then tries *A* to see what happens. *A* results in *X*, then *B* is tried, which results in *Y*. Well, the solution calls for *X+Y*, so *A* is executed first, then *B*. \n\nEssentially, NeTi builds a lightweight framework, and then starts running through several different solutions (often jumping from one to the other if a new piece of information was discovered). 
1	I think Ne is one of the better defined functions in Dario Nardi's research. LEMME PUT TOGETHA A PRE SEN TATION  \n   \nNe seems to be related to trans-contextual thinking.   \n  \nThis is the distinct pattern he observed  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/YuIRD7x.png  \n  \nHere is a description of it.  \ni.imgur.com/YuvHOfg_d.jpg  \n  \nHe has a great google talk  \nhttps://youtu.be/MGfhQTbcqmA   \n  \nAnd here is his PDF from the talk.  \nhttps://www.pdx.edu/sysc/sites/www.pdx.edu.sysc/files/neuro-systems.pdf
17	Non-obvious ENTP figures/ characters you personally relate to	For me, Sam Rockwell or at least the type of character he usually plays hits very close to home.  Especially his character in Seven Psychopaths.  How about you all?
21	Mark Watney (the Martian).\n\nEspecially in the book, his morbid humour, brainstorming out loud, thinking about stupid shit like how he's technically a space pirate.\n\nThat's 100% ENTP. I like this character because he's a bit more fleshed out than some other fictional ENTPs. Tony Stark is also great in this respect
14	Iron Man
5	Are there any black female ENTP characters?\n\nI don’t think I’ve seen me anywhere, honestly. 
4	Chelsea Peretti 
3	Gigolo Joe (A.I.), Reno (FF7), that guy in the Jurassic Park movie who runs away from the dinosaurs while cradling his martinis in his arms.
3	Tyrion Lannister. 
2	I like a lot of the anime characters. Ed from Cowboy Bebop, Izaya from Durarara, Haruhi Suzumiya, Koro-sensei from Assassination Classroom, Okabe from Steins;Gate. Of these, I relate the most to Haruhi - constantly bored and disappointed in my everyday life. When I was a kid I kept wishing for something more, like she does. If I were a teacher, I think I'd be more like Koro-sensei. And I am almost as crazy as Okabe, except that I don't have whacky conspiracy theories, just whacky interpretation of events.
2	Perfect Cell from DBZ.
1	Yakko. From Animaniacs
1	Oddly enough Goro Majima from the Yakuza series.
0	The joker. Such an interesting personality 
5	Stephen King - Friend is CONVINCED he has a ghost writer	
2	While it is possible considering his alcohol and drug abuse when he was younger, I think it is impossible to know it just by his writing unless you are an expert on the subject, and even then it's Stephen King. That guy has written A LOT. Some of it good, some of it bad, some of it a mix of both.
1	I think nostalgia makes people annoyed when anything is a perceived change. He has been writing for decades, and it would be absurd to think he hasn't grown as a writer. Imagine never growing or changing at the one thing you do every day, especially in a creative profession.  He has pursued different genres in some ways too throughout his time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been listening to a bunch of his work over the past year to two in no particular order. Life events are likely to effect his writing though, and accidents and drug use even more so. Now, he has done some joint writing projects, for example he co-wrote *Sleeping Beauties* with his son, and I think that's a great book.
7	What's the most common mistype on the sub?	So far I've seen FP mistypes in this sub yet I don't have enough sample data to extrapolate any valid conclusions.
12	ESFP. A smarter ESFP who prides themselves on their intellect can come across ENTP.\n\nAlso an ESTP who doesn't fit the jock/sporty stereotype might mistype ENTP.\n\nGoing the other way... Some less standoffish ENTP get typed ENFP if they don't relate to the 'argue about literally anything' stereotype.\n\n Some young/less confident ENTP may be mistyped INTP and find their extraversion later in life.
9	Ive tested entp every time for the last 11 years.... but that white barron cuck tends to tell me im mistyped when ever we argue on here
4	The clearest mistypes here are ESFPs, but that seems to be a Reddit thing in particular, likely because it has a more general and younger overall user base than a forum dedicated to mbti.   What people see as the ENTP stereotype here often shares more similarities with the ESFP as described practically everywhere else.  I think part of that is due to age and ADHD getting confused for Ne.\n\nI think for most genuine ENTPs the confusion will be with INTP, since that is the most similar type, functionwise.\n\nI think ESFPs are more similar to ENTPs than ENFPs, because Se grounds them in a way that makes them seem less like Feelers and more T oriented, especially in the males, and especially over text.   \n\nNeFi are usually the more obvious space cadets or “artistic” sorts.\n\nESTPs are about as rare as ENTPs, compared to ESFPs and ENFPs, and I don’t think there are many of them here.  \n\n
3	I did the mbti test about 10 times. 9 times I tested ENFP, and last time I tested ENTP.Yet, while this sub is entertaining and definitely not as useless as ENFP sub, two days of browsing was enough to know I'm not ENTP. Knowing about functions made me almost immune from mistypes, since\n\nFunny thing, browsing these NT subs can change a person :)
2	I got ESFP on the 4 question socionics test. 
2	How are you gathering this information, OP? 
2	INTP > ENFP > ESTP > ESFP, is how I would expect to it be.\n\nBut, in terms of visible mistypes on this sub, it's more like:\n\nESFP > ENFP > INTP > whatever is left (I think there's like five ESTPs on reddit lol). \n\nEdit: forgot to mention that I think the discrepancy is due to the larger proportion of sensors over intuitives. 
2	Everyone wants to be an ENTP, because the only weaknesses are either hidden or hurt those around the ENTP, not the ENTP. x)
1	I'm ExTP(?) which I haven't really seen a lot of. I have ADHD. On a good day I can be ESFP, on a cynical day, I can see how I'm more ENTP. I tested on the MBTI as ENTP but that was before I got or understood at all my ADHD diagnosis and I may have done some personal growth since then. Idfk.
1	I was mistyped as an INTP, but when I read the description, it did NOT sound like me. I talked to my husband about it and when I said I'm an introvert he laughed in my face. When I thought about it some more, I realized he's right. I'm not a crazy party animal, but that's not what extroversion has to be. I like to command the room, tell jokes and stories, and then retreat back into myself when I please. For years, I thought the Meyers-Briggs was bonk, until I read the ENTP description, and it all made sense :P
1	I've been typed INTP, INTJ, and ENTP on a variety of tests. Considering function stacks is what has lead me to believe I am best classified as an ENTP. 
3	What is the fucking point of trying so hard to look pretty if it gets me absolutely no where?	I constantly see girls who dress like absolute shit be surrounded by a lot of friends and have boyfriends. I pay a ridiculous amount of attention to my looks. I make sure my hair is straight, I put on makeup everyday, i wear pretty clothes that flatter my hourglass body, etc. Yet I constantly find myself being called "annoying", ignored, or hated. However before that, when I was younger and spent no effort on my looks, i was bullied, ignored, outcasted AND hated. Is it my hyper ENTP personality? I have no idea what the fuck to do. No one approaches me. No one texts me. No one tries to befriend me. I am always the one starting conversations with people and friending them. Everyone acts like I dont exist. Im so fucking conflicted, Should I begin not giving a fuck about my looks? Should i go to school with rat nest hair and a tired-looking face like everyone else? Since it seems nothing I do will ever be good enough. \n\nPerhaps my high Ne makes me clueless in social situations, thus i come out as a fucking idiot regardless of how i look? I have no idea why people think ENTP are charismatic. Not a single person has ever called me charismatic, but rather, annoying, messy, dumb and heartless. 
17	It sounds cliche, but when you orchestrate your life around appealing to people, they can definitely tell something’s off. Have you ever thought about what you actually want to do? How you want to dress, or act, without filtering it through comparisons to other women, and wondering if it would make people like you more? \n\nRather than lamenting that those women who you think dress badly get more attention than you, why not think about what people enjoy about their company, their authenticity, how fun they are to be around, etc and try and realise what other qualities you yourself have beyond looks.\n\nYou mentioned people call you heartless- maybe that’s something to unpack a little more. Generally people are drawn to those they feel care about them, take an interest in them, remember important details or take their thoughts seriously... not people who they feel don’t have a heart.\n\nYou’re obviously really frustrated and hurt by this and I get that, I think getting bullied and allowing it to wreak havoc with our ENTP overthinking skills isn’t uncommon. But bitterness n envy won’t help. I feel like you’ve gotta start figuring out who you are when you’re not being seen. 
8	I would just be yourself.  \n\nI don't wear any makeup, wear tomboy clothes (men's tshirt, plain jeans, sweatshirt, and sneakers), I have Asperger's, and I am blunt, bossy, and logical.  Considering all the above things, I should be readily disliked by most.  But somehow, most people like me.  I even get hit on by guys a lot and am told I'm pretty when I'm wearing baggy tshirts and I haven't brushed my hair in more than two weeks.  I am quite friendly and open.  I get a lot of comments that I am authentic.  I guess I just have never even tried pretending to be something that I am not.  \n\nThere is no point in trying to make friends unless you are being yourself.  The right people won't find you and the wrong people will ostracize you.  \n\nMy cousin sounds a lot like you.  She is an ENTP and she tries constantly to do things or act a certain way to make people like her.  It only drives them away.  \n\nEdit: just reread your whole post and it really came off that you were quite condescending of most people, especially girls like me who dress "like shit" and still get all the guys (and I don't have to show off my "hourglass figure" or boobs either).  Maybe you are just a bitchy and rude person with an air of superiority, idk.  
8	If you are getting bullied and ostracized, it's generally an indication of THEIR character. \n\n1. Don't wear make-up because you think it'll make you likeable. It won't. If you wear it, make sure you wear it because you enjoy it.\n\n2. How do you know that they hate you? You may FEEL that (and feeling hated sucks) but are you 100% sure?  \n\n3. Want to come to school looking like a mess? Go for it! Just please use proper hygiene. \n\n4. This might hurt... Are you rude (knowingly or unknowingly)? NTs really struggle with this. NTs also struggle with superiority complexes. Time for some introspection.\n\n5. Sometimes you don't make friends at school. Other activities might help. Pack a bunch of hormonal kids trying to find themselves in school, structure their environment so it's stifling and non-engaging. Sound fun? \n\nIf you truly feel you cannot connect, consider talking to someone. Maybe you'll get labeled non-neurotypical. That's okay if it helps you understand yourself. Maybe you  are neurotypical? You're learning to be a person.
6	39 yo (F) here.\n \n\n1. Don't look pretty for other people. Its contrived and not real. Look good for you.\n\n\n2. Get some counseling re: self worth, a need for attention and people pleasing (because women and girls are socialized to do that)\n\n\n3. Learn to understand what kind of people live in "your tribe" (especially if you are an entp). You aren't going to appeal to most sensors period. And that's what most of the world is full of.\n\n\n4. Look at your interests and hobbies and see that they are likely eccentric. Look for the eccentrics, and come to terms that introverts aren't gong to chase you or reach out often, but they can still love you from over there. \n\nBe you. Love yourself, be true and honest with yourself.\n\n\nBut that's just my opinion.
5	If you want someone to talk to, feel free to message me.  I learned a long time ago that I had to be the one to put myself out there.  If I waited for others to come to me, I would be waiting in my bedroom the rest of my life.  Eventually, I found out how to be myself rather than who I thought others wanted me to be.  Once I was comfortable with who I was and confident enough to put myself out there to make friendships and interactions possible, I was able to find a group of friends that was consistent and loyal whom I wouldn't trade for the world.  When you try to be someone you're not, someone you think other people will like, you come across as desperate and fake.  Even if people don't consciously grasp that's the problem, they can tell something is off.  Rather than allow you to assimilate, they will see you as abrasive.  Stop trying to please them and start pleasing yourself.  Amuse yourself, love yourself, be a joy to be around yourself.  Once you legitimately enjoy just being you, others will gravitate to you in order to share in that joy.
5	Idk you kinda just sound like a condescending bitch tbh. Are you heaps young? I'm a 23 F ENTP and I was probably a huge bitch up til I was about 15-16.\n\nTBH people can always tell when you have a superiority complex. Being nice to ppl you don't actually respect inside WILL come of as fake. It's just a vibe people get. \n\nOne thing I noticed was the more I started liking other people, the more people started liking me back. When you actually see the good in other people and when you actually respect them, you don't need to be fake to want to be nice to them. 
5	Here's the key: if you want to be loved, you have to be lovable. \n\nNo one's gonna hate you for not brushing your hair. They might ask if you have a permit for housing small rodents in there. That's okay, you can laugh with them. They *will* hate you for the way that you talk to them. Don't say the fuck-word so much. Don't call people idiots. Be kind to people, and *don't take yourself so seriously*. 
3	I think youve thought of this but,  \nHow outspoken we are with whatever comes to mind tends to polarize people who are less used to that amount of energy. Which can be good because it selects for people you are more compatible with but also fucks with small talk.  \n  \nMe and my mom will be loudly talking with a fast pace because we are excited about an idea, and my ISFP grandma will think we are fighting lol.  \n  \nTrying to suppress my impulsiveness doesnt feel nice so i guess ill have to get noticed some other way  \n  \nAlso consider that N and S are the only trait axis that is not 50%/50% split in the population. N is 30% and S is 70, so the norms might be weird to us.
2	Fuck people and do your own thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was also really bad at the social game when I was young, and I fled into my hobbies instead. If people pisses you off, then use that as your fuel to get better at the stuff you love to do. I learned everything from programming to DJ'ing, professional dancing and martial arts ... Eventually I became really good at several things and had no problem attracting people with my skills. \n\n  \nLooks is for sensors or insecure (and sorry, stupid) people. It's a tool if you have it, but it will also deteriorate with age. Work on being a cool/skilled/competent person (for real) instead.\n\n&#x200B;
2	I’m a guy, was very poor with girls as a hyper ENTP teenager, even with epic dress sense and good looks. I couldn’t work it out but now think I was just in love with myself a bit too much and prob loved the idea of being in love. I gradually became more ESFP (although I didn’t know these terms at the time), more receptive to others and basically became notoriously successful. Now a bit older and more mature I slip back into my natural ENTP with a few bows under my hat and all is good.\n\nBasically try to tweak ur personality a bit even if it is uncomfortable at first. Fake it to make it. Your prob are on the extreme somewhere and need to temper ur traits. 
2	Sounds like you're looking for and not finding external acknowledgement and validation. It's ok to need a bit of that especially at your age (teen?), but you're going to require less and less as you get older, especially as an ENTP woman. \n\nIf you want to "look pretty" or look however you want, go for it. But I'd suggest thinking about what *you* like, not what you think other people will like. As a woman you're going to be barraged with other people's ideas of how you should look until the day you die. Trust me, the best armor against that crap is deciding what makes you feel comfortable and confident so you can put your attention and energy into whatever excites your mind. Friends, and acceptance, will naturally follow.

4	What an advantage having Te provides over Ti?	I'm ENFP, and was browsing this sub since I mistyped as ENTP once. So we have Te and you have Ti. Since Te is described as "cut the bullshit, efficiency is the king" function, does it mean ENFP type can have some advantage over ENTP?\n\nI definitely don't fully understand Ti. "Creating patterns? Models?" If I ever make a model, it's more like "oh, I see this company does this, I recognize this model from scammy companies" or when playing new game "If devs are not idiots, there will be an option to do this, and oh yes, it's just there. (Hell, it helps when browsing foreign websites, however isn't it just Si = memory at play?)".\n\nSo, would you sometimes wish you had Te instead? What are some cool things that Ne Te Si person can do over a Ne Ti Si person?
6	>What an advantage having Te provides over Ti?\n\nNot getting annoyed by all the stupid ways Te users have to explain simple stuff.\n\n&#x200B;
10	u/lightfive only needs one sentence to shut someone’s argument down. I need to set up at least 5 questions and 1 relative example to even begin the process of explaining to someone that they’re wrong. 
1	The big advantage of Te over Ti is that it allows you to “just do it” without first understanding what you’re doing.  SJs are good at following examples and following orders.  They get the understanding later, but they don’t require it for action. 
76	For fun: ENTP when deciding to try something new.	\nNi (Nemesis) - “are you sure that’s what you want?”\n\nNe (Hero) - “not really, but what could happen?”\n\nSi (inferior) - “could I die?”\n\nNeTi (pair)- *robot voice* “risk analysis: likelyhood of death 1.03% of 1000 simulations”\n\nSi (inferior) “wait, I could die?

You have a really bad track record of improvement\n\n(NeTe) bc of that mindset! You have nothing to lose, give it a shot!\n\n(Fe critic) I mean it might be kind of embarrassing if you do it wrong\n\n(Fi) Do you really care about that though?\n\n(Fe critic) I mean you don't want others to be misled by your example\n\n(TeSi) Usually someone who tries something out is pretty shitty at first, you're fine\n\n(NeFiTe) you're also conveying you might be wrong through meta-humor in your attempt, which is honest\n\n(FiTe) Ok great you're gonna do it\n\nEDIT: (NeTeFe) You should probably make edits to it after you post once you gain more insight so the post can be more informative to others\n\n(TeSi) Is this really a good use of your time?\n\n(NeFi) nah but it's fun and fulfilling\n\n(Fe) You're also doing a service to those who don't know as much about MBTI\n\n(TeSi) but dude you haven't had lunch yet\n\n(FiSi) you're also kind of hungry\n\n(NeFi) Wait more thoughts are popping up, put them down first and then go\n\n(TeSi) Ok you're done, now go
2	You observed 10.3 failures in 1000 simulations? I think you have a bug
3	I have no idea what this means I'm still kinda new in the mbti thing could someone plz explain or point me towards an explanation ?
1	Oof
1	I find myself to be pretty adventurous, albeit in bursts. 
1	How do you know all of it...\nToo accurate 😅 Expecially the inf Si *sigh*
2	CMV: People who substitute science-based medicine for things like essential oils deserve no sympathy when it doesn't work	
4	I'm inclined to agree. It's called "alternative medicine" for a reason. \n\nI have no sympathy for people choosing alternative medicine over actual medical treatments but I absolutely despise "alternative doctors" that peddle that shit to people that are desperate to survive. 
3	I knew a little boy that died from the complications of strep throat. Strep fucking throat. Because his shit head mother decided oil of oregano would cure it. \n\nWoman was brazen enough to tell me not to vaccinate my twins while I was pregnant AFTER her son died. I'm glad she's in jail. \n
1	What's up with such a large percentage of people thinking that "natural"  things are better than manufactured things? \n\nWhen it comes to medicine, it's like thinking a random seed on minecraft will make you a house; if anything, the manufactured medicine is more curated for our needs than the random evolutionarily generated things lying around our planet.\n\nI've never felt the need to be more "natural". I literally live in a man-made house, eating man-made food, and am encapsulated by a protective, persistent man-made society. Nothing in our lives is "natural" (in the way they use that word) and they enthusiastically take part in these unnatural parts. Why is food and medicine magically different?
1	Antipathy for people rarely will get you anything. It is difficult to live without being annoyed, angry or dismissive of people. At times it might even be warranted to some degree, but I think rejoicing at death is something that hardly ever benefits people.
1	Marijuana is a miracle drug, and CBD oil has shown benefits for patients suffering from mental disorders, HIV\AIDS, and Cancer.\n\nYou are an idiot for believing that natural substances don't reduce people's suffering from diseases or cure them.\n\nI am sending light, peace, and blessings your way in the hope that you become less of an ignorant fuck.
2	If you had social anxiety.. how would you get over it?	Therapy? Social clubs? Public speaking? Get so paralyzed by your thoughts you get too scared to do anything?\n\nI wanna know!
6	Just speak up more in groups then move on from there\n\n&#x200B;
3	i read books about social behaviour and then try to act normal, took me 2 to 4 years but im pretty good at it now
3	In college I smiled more and that helped, after Iraq it got worse and I got cognitive therapy.  In my job I’m a trial lawyer, so I gotta push past anxiety.\n\nEssentially I just have to keep it beaten down and bruised.
2	Face it and move toward it. Start off small, then gradually to bigger challenges. Read up on exposure therapy and CBT and apply what you learn.
1	One thing that's helped me a surprising amount with finding something to say in a conversation is trying to constantly give compliments. \n\nTo give a decent compliment you need to come out with it in the  first 10-ish seconds of an interaction, don't wait until 5 minutes of silence have passed before you blurt out something vaguely nice; it can seem out of place or like you didn't pay any attention to the other person for the majority of the time you were together. Or just creepy.\n\nSpecific and unique is best. Don't compliment something you don't actually like, but if you do, it needs to be something they are obviously proud of.\n\nSometimes your compliments will be terrible and you'll just have to endure a few minutes of awkward, especially in the beginning. But you're probably an awkward fuck like me already, so what is there to lose? \n\nOther times, you'll hit the jackpot and your comment or their response will make a natural segue past "small talk" and into actual conversation that is otherwise hard to find. \n\nGiven this sub's collective butthurt regarding small talk, I thought it was worth a mention.\n
1	The only thing that helped me get over it was repeatedly putting myself out there.  It was always terrifying, and sometimes still is, but the more I did it, the more I learned that there was nothing to be afraid of.  For me, I was so terrified of people judging me.  I was scared of saying the wrong thing, not being able to read people, not being able to relate to them.  So, I just started copying the mannerisms of film and tv characters.  I observed what they said and how they said it.  I watched a lot of comedians and learned the cadence, trying to understand why they were funny.  When I started to apply what I learned in human conversations, it all made so much sense.  I sounded confident, so people assumed I was.  The fact that they thought I was confident made me confident.  I don't speak only in movie quotes these days, though I still sound a bit like Shawn Spencer from Psych in real life (you know that's right), but I'm now extremely social.
1	Homie what-chu-mean /if/?
7	What are some categorical NOs for ENTPs?	It seems ENTPs are one of the most open-minded folk in the MBTI-universe. And I've seen many on here mention that, given proper reasoning, they are ready to change their view on any matter, and give anything a try.\n\nOr even two tries. Or several. Think acquired tastes in food for example. \n\nNothing more boring than someone who never orders a new dish at a restaurant.\n\n\nSo, aside from anything that hurts others physically or mentally or restricts their freedom, what are things that you would not even give **a single try** ?\n\n\nFor me, the absolute NOs are probably restricted to activites that have a non-neglectable chance of having permanent negative consequences. I don't think I would try bungee-jumping, for example, because the thrill can never outweigh the however small chance of winding up paralyzed and having no one else to blame but my foolish self - a fate worse than death, in my opinion.
5	Non ENTP here - it seems many great open people are strangely not very open on accepting emotions as a valid "argument". "It feels wrong" is as good of an argument as "is this efficient?"
5	I don't hang around cakes, and people who make choices through blind faith.

2	Basically play right into someones plan/game in-which the long term ramification's are uncertain. I'll always go 95% of the way and then bail if I detect any questionable motives/ego driven manipulation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven if it's a reasonably attractive women trying to manipulate me into seducing her/having sex with her while shes in a relationship. I troll those who think they can control me. 
1	Drugs. I have health anxiety and those things would only make it worse. Even alcohol makes me feel worse, so drugs would take it to the extreme
1	I take a pretty hard stance against unnecessary medicines that make me drowsy (like allergy meds or cold remedy), hard drugs, being tattooed, being peed/pooped on, and anything going into my butt.
1	For me:\n\n- Tolerating illogical bullshit from people\n- Having other people control me in any way, shape, or form\n- Having people place me into a box\n- Having people place my ideas into a box\n- Non open-minded people\n- Small-minded people (Yes, I believe xSTJs are idiots)\n\nThese are pretty central to the Ne-Ti thought process.
1	Something that is a absolute NO, for me is something that I am certain will be a complete waste of time for me.   \nEg. reading the Twilight books, or visiting a mosque / church. 
1	I think your bungee jumping logic is a bit flawed, we need to take risks to fully enjoy life.   \n[https://www.spencergreenberg.com/2013/10/which-risks-of-dying-are-worth-taking/](https://www.spencergreenberg.com/2013/10/which-risks-of-dying-are-worth-taking/)  \n\n\nI take quite a few risks in my life, definitely far more dangerous than bungee jumping, but I get a thrill out of it, and it makes for cool experiences and stories.   \n\n\nId rather live an semi exciting life, taking calculated risks. Than live a boring life avoiding risks.

11	Valentine's Day Is Stupid	It's an overrated and stupid way for capitalist coorporations to make money.
33	Shh, it's ok to be single. 
14	It is actually a smart way for capitalistic corporations to make money.\n\nGive them a flower before you deflower them.
8	It's only stupid if you make it stupid. In the past my girlfriends expected something special on Valentine's day. So I'd explain to them ahead of time that, if she wants it to he special, then it's her choice entirely on how to spend the day — and she has to treat me when we're out. Why? Because ordinarily I'm expected to treat her when out, and I usually make the plans. \n\nThat's the deal. I carry my canonical gender roles most days of the year. However, on holidays we make it special by her treating me. Sometimes this was in the form of hone cooked meals, other times it was her picking really nice places to go out to.\n\nThis really establishes a multifaceted end goal. One, it deconstructs gender roles, if only a little bit. Two, these special holidays are only as good/bad as she plans (I've even gotten flowers before, which was oddly endearing). Three, I don't have to worry about planning special shit for holidays. Four, it gives us a little unique "us-ness" to explore for the holidays. Five, if I really wanna sweep her off her feet, I do it on an unexpected, random date. \n\nLastly, it actually makes us *both* look forward to the holidays. It also makes her more appreciative of the thought I put into making date nights. 
6	Along with Christmas, and Thanksgiving, and the Super Bowl, etc...\n\nSolution: don’t do what the TV says.\n\nYou can still participate in the holiday without the tropes.\n\nIf you want to do something *really* special that she’ll never forget, dump her on the 14th. \n
5	True, true.\n\nLet's not forget, however, that there are many people to whom Valentine's day (or X-Mas or what have you) and the expected attention from their partner associated with it means ***a lot***.\n\nThere's people out there (...*shudder* SJ-types) who would assert that big-picture, out-of-the-box thinking is useless and unquestioned subordination to authority is key to the prosperity of humankind. I like to imagine that the way that sort of statment would trigger me is akin to the way a tender soul would be triggered by their partner uttering that Valentine's Day is corporate bullshit. \n\nIn short: Use your Fe, not just Ne-Ti.
5	I don't partake int valentines day.\n\nEven the misses thinks it is stupid. \n\nLeave it for the F types to waste their money.
3	It's just a day to celebrate romantic love. You have the choice to not spend money, you know.
3	This holiday is bullshit because I'm single, maybe it won't be next year if I'm not. No, I'm not being sarcastic.
2	If it's stupid then don't partake in it, and leave others be.   \n\n\nThere are many things that I think is stupid(Like buying a horse), but I don't criticise others for not thinking the same, if they want to buy a horse they can go for it, it's not bothering me. 
2	You sound bitter. Not that I like valentines day but still
2	I think that applies to every holiday nowadays.\nYou can always choose to not let the date of the calendar change your state of mind :)
1	Gotta "*love*" the evil fiends of the capitalist corporations, **RIGHT**??   \n\n&#x200B;
3	How do you start a discussion?	In particular about something you've a clear opinion about. Do you go in nicely "what is your opinion regarding ...?" or do you just go in brutally "This is my opinion" and just expect it to become a discussion?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel I'm definitely the latter. My INTJ partner thinks it's attacking him (I don't feel it that way), whereas for me the "what is your opinion regarding ...?" feels inauthentic when I've formed an opinion long before the initiation. For any INTJ lurkers here, does it really bother you when the other person boldly states their opinion? I believe my bluntness drew him in initially but now seems to annoy him.
12	I make a statement relevant to the conversation that is guaranteed to get a harsh response.\n\nThen I wing it.
4	Depends on the people I am debating.\n\nBut in general, I feel super phony when I'm going down the "What is your opinion...?" route. \n\nMost times I tend to just drop something controversial and see where it goes, kind of like /u/Autistic_Reeeeeeeeee suggested. 50:50 chance of blowing someone's mind or having to adjust my own world view - which means I win anyway :D\n\nWhat I hate, however, is when I challenge some bullshit traditionalist-notion that has no claim to the truth (think religion, gender norms or homeopathy) and then have to face Hewey, Dewey and Louie screaming at me in unison and getting their pants in a knot about how wrong I am. No matter how good you argue, if you're trying to convince 2+ people that are circlejerking their own (typically unvalidated) opinion down your throat, things can get nasty.
4	I start off all conversations with "Hello, my name is /u/The_White_Baron. Do you have a moment to talk about your lord and savior Carl Jung?" Works great on telemarketers and exes.
3	you have not heard about Socrates ...? first you have to agree with the interlocutor and then start creating chaos ...
2	INTJ has tertiary Fi, which makes them extremely sensitive when you are close to them, and even more so in emotionally-charged scenarios. In this situation, your Ti realistic /practical scalpel was simply too harsh a tool for what was a very touchy topic: money, criticism of how he is spending it, criticism of his competency in managing his affairs, etc.\n\nWhen relating with people you care for, ostensibly love even, it's probably best to apply as much Fe as you can realistically generate without feeling fake. It's the only thing that make us palatable in the long run, tbh.\n\nFor everything else, feel free to be blunt.
1	Abruptly
1	My ex partner is a ENFP, she hated debating, I loved it and would argue just for the sake of arguing.   \nThis frustrated us both endlessly.   \n\n\nI don't really have a answer for you, but maybe try to be "nice" as ENTP's we like to argue and challenge each others ideas etc. Other personality types don't enjoy it as much, or maybe hate it.   \n\n\nI think try and bring your opinion across very subtly, and in a non condescending or attacking way.   \nA lot if times the other person doesn't agree but also doesn't have the required knowledge to really form an opinion yet.   \n\n\ntl;dr try not to come across as a dick/bitch, a lot of people just don't like having these kinds of conversations 
1	Interview them about shit youre interested in that you also have sensed they might be into to.
3	Questions for ENTPs who are parents or who have SOs that have children from another relationship	How do you handle being a parent? Are you involved in the lives of your children or are you more absent? Is being a parent something you enjoy or is it something you regret?\n\nI'm asking because one of my ENTP best friends got involved with a woman who has at least two kids that I know of and lives the suburban family lifestyle. Knowing my friend the way that I do, I feel like he'd have a hard time adapting to any lifestyle where his freedom is more restricted. He can't just up and decide to go on a road trip across state lines on one of his many whims lol. So I'm curious if other ENTPs experience this similarly or if there are some who do adapt well to parenthood. I'd like to hear your stories on the matter if you have any you'd like to share. 
6	I have three daughters (4, 2, and newborn).  I love being a father.  I always wanted to be a father.  So some of the more restrictive aspects of parenting I just take in stride.  Selfishly, unlike your friend, I think it's easier when they're yours.  I have little chaos knights that look like me that I can mold in my image.\n\nI'm very involved.  At least more so than my dad ever was.  I make them chocolate milk in the morning.  I do bath time and bed time.  I'll take them to the park or the children's museum from time to time.  At least with the older two.  The newborn likes me more than her sisters did at that age, but all newborns want to be velcroed to mama at all times.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  Kids are a shit-ton of work.  And sometimes it really sucks when I can't pick up and drive to a concert on a whim like I did in my twenties or even get out of the house more than one or two nights a week.  And believe me, they are the world's most adorable little cockblocks.  But nothing is more rewarding than the smile on their faces when you walk in the door or the way they completely trust and believe in you.  I wouldn't trade it for the world.
2	There are too many variables to say, IMHO: kids' ages, personalities, whether mom has them full time, whether he can travel without her ...
2	I feel like parenthood opened up a new world of variety for me. New experiences, and I get to see my child's joy when I share things with her. It was my choice to become a mother, and I think that plays a role in it - my baby wasn't an accident, and she wasn't conceived via pressure from my partner. She's my new adventure. And while the monotony of parenting wears on me sometimes, I am lucky because I'm surrounded by family members who are happy to keep my girl when I need a non-child-friendly excursion. My daughter is 7 months old, and I've been out of state three times, and have slept over at a party twice. And she was with people who loved her, cherished the time with her. And I was overjoyed to come home to her once my fun was done. 
1	Are most ENTP’s Alpha Males/females?	How much of y’all fall under the ALPHA section of the popular ideology of the social hierarchy? \nAfter researching about the alpha male and what it means to be one I’ve realized that a lot of those qualities correlate with my personality, and btw I’ve taken several MB tests and all have claimed I am a ENTP. I hadn’t even really noticed I was an alpha male until I actually looked into, and started seeing connections in how I behave and how others react to it, like even in class (senior in high school 😬) I’ll call out the teacher if something isn’t making sense or if I’m not fully convinced that what the teacher is talking about is true or asking/answering questions when no one else is and giving my opinion, I guess just always challenging people of authority... even like getting girls, like sometimes even I get confused on how I can land myself a 10/10 bitty without even trying (low key boasting, but just telling it how it is) haha don’t get me wrong I think I’m good-looking but I don’t think I’m above average, whatever average is, like what’d I do? Haha like I’m just being me I’m not doing anything I wouldn’t do, but at the same time when I talk to girls I’m just a natural flirt and don’t really realize I’m flirting. And just always inclined to stepping up and taking the lead or leadership roles and even being elected team captain of my hockey, football, or baseball teams for as long as I can remember, by now I believe I’m pretty good at it too mainly because I’ve always done it and just simply got used to it. \nHaving a kind of set of egalitarian morals like treating everyone as equal even though we can all agree that everyone is not at all equal, like tbh couldn’t give a fuck who u are, if you treat me with respect then expect the same from me, simple as that, even if people think ur a weirdo, if I think u alright then fuck what they say u my dawg hahaha... \nanyways what I’m trying to say is since like ENTP’s are all, well, a well-developed ENTP, is a strong-minded, confident, and logical-thinker and ALPHA’s are as well, then is a large majority of us alphas? \nWhat do you think? Are you an alpha male/female? Does any of what I just talked about relate to you and if so how? \n
17	Reading is one hell of a drug
14	tl;dr: /r/iamverybadass \n\nI feel the whole alpha-beta categorization is ... kind of cringy, but for the sake of argumentation, let's stick to it.\n\nENTPs, in my view, tend not to be your stereotypical alpha-jocks. That I'd associate more with ENTJs or ESTPs. \n\nIf anything, I would think of ENTPs more as substitute leaders. The guys and gals who step up when regular leadership is failing. Think Sigma-males/females, if you wish. \n\nI, for one, sort of feel like Fe gets in the way of me making decisions that affect other people besides me. Which at best makes you a compassionate leader, but at worst makes you indecisive and hesitant.\n\nWith leadership and "being alpha" comes responsibility (which can be nice) and in certain contexts a lot of red-tape (booo.). So many time when I wind up in that kind of position, I pull a Rick-Sanchez-burning-everything-because-he-got-bored-by-it move.

7	Reddit does not take kindly to the term Alpha friend.\n\nThis website is full of soy boys with no sense of masculinity and girls with basic bitch opinions who lie to themselves about everything.\n\nYou are unlikely to get a meaningful response even in an ENTP sub.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo answer your question. It has to do with wether you are Assertive or Turbulent.\n\nWe are over represented int he assertive category so the answer is yes.
2	I think this depends on how confident we are in our abilities.   \n[https://www.16personalities.com/articles/identity-assertive-vs-turbulent](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/identity-assertive-vs-turbulent)  \n\n\nWhen I was younger I was very shy and wasn't very confident or Alpha at all !!   \n\n\nBut as I got older and realised, hey I'm pretty fucking awesome, I got a lot more Alpha, I don't take shit, I challenge authority, I'm quite fearless and I like taking the lead.   \n\n\nI think as ENTP's it's in our nature to be like this, but we have to find confidence in our abilities. 
2	My gawd. 
1	Idk but i an an entp and i am one of the most beta males
1	I know a few entp and we tend to be successful at what we do, or at least try hard to be. I reckon focus on that rather than being alpha/beta because that sounds like a flimsy diagnostic
1	It has to do with confidence, if an entp has a problem with confidence they have to prove themselves to themselves. They should also check out Stoicism (Seneca). That really helps to make most humans fearless (in a rational way not a destructive way)
1	I am no alpha girl lmao
1	ENTPs in general are aligned with the trickter/wise old guy archetype and not the hero/alpha. Looking back, I used to behave, in a way, back in High school that fits with the typical alpha male stereotype. Intimidating intensity in speech and action (I'm an 8w7 entp by the way) , won't take shit from people especially from authority, felt responsible for making sure everyone around me gets what they want, felt the need to stick to my word always etc etc. However, as I grew up, I realized I just enjoyed the control that comes with power and not the responsibility. This is not to imply that I'm an immature adult who wants to run away from all sorts if responsibility. It has just got to do with a better understanding of the accountability that comes with responsibility and how one is not contributing anything useful to any situation/context by taking up more responsibility that one can handle. Identify more as an "idea" guy now and it just doesn't work out positively for me to be both an "idea" guy & alpha/leader at the same time. Feel that ENTJs are more natural for that sort of role. 
1	How hard did your dad hit you OP
1	We could be alphas if we wanted to, but it's more interesting (and less work!) to be the underdog who pokes fun at the ExTJs who think they run the show. That's always been my experience, at least.
1	Yes.\n\nI am an Alpha Male, and the major thing I need to work on is getting the muscles to physically prove it.\n\nThis is an ongoing project for me; I want to maintain a weight of 180LBs at 5'8".\n\nI'm currently maintaining a weight of 140LBs, which is skinny as fuck, weak as fuck, and makes me look like an underdeveloped teenager.
24	Views on sex? On a scale of hoe to mormon where are you and why?	Personally after a couple one night stands and a particularly hedonistic three-way I've come to have a much greater respect and value for sex. Those experiences consistently left me feeling empty and shitty the following day. \n\nI have a # of thoughts why, but succinctly that kind of behavior is primitive and animalistic. When both of us just lust at each other driven  by hormones and instinct, disregarding principles and/or not engaging in any level of thought higher than instincts - it feels like we're just a couple of animals. I feel like irrespective of gender/sex, if you have done it countless times with others who see you for no more than a hot piece of meat - in a way that's all you are (and why doing it in that context I believe makes me feel shitty - empty sex without appreciation of me as a complex human being). \n\nIt's really intent that matters imo. If you want to see the person again, or it's a good first date and willing to move faster I have no issue with that. I really only take issue when its some primal scenario where you're not even thinking and just doing, like dancing with someone in the club, start making out, take them back, do the deed... but then realize you know nothing about them, don't have their #, won't see them again, and aren't even too sure what their name is. \n\nLet me draw another hedonistic parallel: smoking/drinking/doing drugs on a free open evening with no obligations - 100% ok vs doing that before & jeopardizing important test/interview/presentation/etc. - like that's irresponsible and pretty degenerate (not that i haven't...). \n\n**TL;DR:** on a scale of **black out orgy** to **no sex til marriage**, I believe being somewhere in the middle is likely the healthiest combination of experiencing life and having principles/applying higher meaning or value to sex. \n\nThoughts? 
56	> no sex till the marriage\n\nYour scale is too narrow. Who says I want sex after marriage
27	Sex in a committed relationship is as far as I will go. If you've dated someone for 3 months, probably good enough.\n\nI did the hookup circuit for a year, it's not rewarding, psychologically damaging, and incredibly unfulfilling. I found it be basically a dick measuring constant between other dudes on who can slay the most chicks. \n\nWhat did it for me was I fucked 2 different chicks that asked me to drop them off at their boyfriends. I felt like I was contributing to a system of degeneracy and worse, cheating.\n\nTl;dr give it some time before u put it in.
21	I'm a hoe trapped inside a morman's body
14	I'm someone who can only have sex in a monogamous relationship. When I've been single I've had offers but somehow I weaselled out of them awkwardly because I just had no interest. Get me in love with someone and I am DTF multiple times a day and open to trying most kinks.
7	I think it very much depends on you as a person.\n\nDon't let what society or other think hold you back from anything, or try and push you towards anything.\n\nIf you want to wait till marriage go for it, if you want to have orgies go for it. And be proud of your choices.\n\nI do think the best option is somewhere in the middle though, waiting will marriage can have a lot of complications, and obviously having orgies can also. 
7	I'm extremely sexual. There are two problems however.\n\nOne is am considered quite weird by society standards, which also includes weird in the sexual sense. The things I enjoy the most are not something you tell someone you don't know because if they are not into it they will be scared.\n\nThe other problem is doing everything I have to do to have sex with someone is usually boring as fuck. For my age it would be going to clubs, parties, etc. Then playing the game with the girls, which involves searching for a girl that I find attractive, finding out if she is receptive, flirting with her hinting that I want to fuck her brains out without showing it too much because that comes off as desperate, escalating physical contact, arranging logistics, texting her, meeting up with her, and finding a way to make her go away after the fun has ended. Sometimes these moments are really enjoyable, but most of the time it just feels like too much work for a night of plain vanilla sex.\n\nI guess finding a girlfriend and slowly showing her my kinkier side would be the best solution, but my standarts for a relationship are way too high and I don't really see myself going into one for the next 4-5 years, mostly because I will probably be moving to different cities, maybe countries, and investing into a relationship that will last a few months is not worth it.\n\nSo for now, even if I am a perverted motherfucker, I will keep doing non-sexual things I enjoy most of the time and having an occassional session with my FWBs from time to time when the opportunity presents itself.
10	I was a discerning slut in high school. Lost my virginity at 15 and have had a voracious sexual appetite since. Then at 16 I discovered fan fiction and I discovered all the kinks and shit I’m into. So many.... so many....\n\nI think every consenting adult who wants to have sex, should be able to have safe, sane, and consensual. 
3	I know that sex is ultimately the means for procreation, and that's important, so I *try* to act in accordance with that fact. It's not a toy. In practice, that means I have a woman who I am faithful to, and I always cum inside of her, and I'm pretty sure she is pregnant *right now*.
4	I base sex more on an attraction and moral scale.\n\nAs a male, having experience is a trait a lot of women find desirable.\n\nHowever as a male I know a women having experience is less desirable for most men. \n\nThere are exceptions to the rule and you can disagree with it all you want but it is just true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReally you should be basing your actions and sex life upon how you want to be desired by your preferred future partner and if you intend on lying about your sexual history and past actions. \n\nRegardless of what anybody says, Every person has a jealous side, some more than others and your actions now affect how your future partner sees and feels about you. If you were to care deeply for that future partner you should probably avoid doing anything to hinder the prospect of that relationship.\n\nThis includes but is not limited to, promiscuity, crime, neglecting family, large debts, dependency on alcohol or drugs and so on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not suggesting you live your life as if everything you do is subject to your potential, future or current partner. I am just saying these considerations should be made before you regret them and can't take them back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you age this gets less important because let's all be honest, just by ageing your standards drop because your options decrease. (exponentially)\n\nThese days people are more liberal with their sexuality. Mostly because of a lack of respect for themselves. This goes for both males and females.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think if you are well adjusted. Make decisions in the best interest of yourself and your future partner as well as have a clear set rules and morals by which you live your life you will probably be less inclined to have sex with various people and more inclined to find someone and build a relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause relationships do not just fall into place. They require work and selflessness. When we neglect our relationships or hinder them with past, present and potentially future actions we further diminish the value each party sees in the relationship. Like so many people do.\n\nWe live in a sort of detached throw away culture where instead of fixing and maintaining our valued possessions we throw them away and replace them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually all those throwaways add up and litter your history and become baggage for your future relationships.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnless your an exception to the rule (Your probably not) you wont be very happy living alone from your 50s and 60s onwards. You should be actively changing your life to attract that someone you want to share it with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd back to the question. I think being on the more conservative side of the whole sex debate is probably best for yourself and your partner. (depending on your gender)\n\nWomen and men desire differently and those considerations should be made. \n\nHence women will always be worse off in the dating scene when trying to find a quality male if their sexual and dating history is longer than desired. This is all relative though, Some people want to date a porn star, Nobody wants to have children with them.\n\nFor men we generally want to avoid debt and dependencies. Sexual and dating history is not as important to women.
3	I’ll get back to you on that when I get there. 
3	Hoe-hoe-hoe! Now i have a machine-gun.
5	Yiup I'm literally a Mormon. so guess which one of the options I am.
2	ITT: A bunch of degenerates.\n\nI'm a kinky degenerate myself so no judge though ;)
2	I raged pretty hard in my youth against the seemingly arbitrary rules around sex. I challenged the concept of monogamy, the concept of the  pristine and virginal female being ideal, etc. I concluded that some of these rules are valuable (monogamy for sure *personally, no judgement*) and some don't apply, but have pretty strong antecdotal evidence as to why.\n\nThis kind of gets more complicated because the cause and effects of these rules are highly influenced by "society" (whatever that means, using it here to describe an ambiguous amorphous set of rules). For example, I'm a single mom, never been married. No one gives a fuck. However like 100 years ago, I'd be begging on the streets or forced into prostitution because I would have no means by which to support myself and my child. So the rule of "Don't have sex until your married" subcontext "or you will get pregnant and then you and your child will die horrible deaths" makes a lot of sense. Now? It's an old rule that some people follow just because it's a rule. Or because they're afraid to offend, or they are a part of, certain segments of society that are really into rules, however antiquated they may be.
2	Mormhoe
2	I’ve been both so yes
2	I had to deal with a sexual trauma in the past and because of that I’m a little fucked up, but I have only ever had sex while in a relationship. I’m not one to judge anybody’s choices, though. Whether you’re waiting til marriage or lost your virginity at 15, I’ll respect you. 
2	ENTPs are highly sexual beings due to Si-Inferior. Types with Sensing functions in the Inferior position all have sex linked with some kind of fear. With Se-Inferior, it is performance anxiety. The fear that they will give the other person a horrible experience and with Si-Inferior, it is that they will have a horrible experience. \n\nConsequently only once they get over this fear, can the mentioned types start engaging in much sexual activity. Due to the nature of sex in our modern world, I find that female INxJs, and ENxPs get over the Sx Inferior fear much earlier. This is most likely due to the increased opportunities for experiences.\n\nHowever, being intuitives at heart, I would expect that most ExNPs and INxJs only see sex as kinda of as a mechanism for further growth in an already developed relationship. Depending on the ease of access to sex, I doubt that many of us would value hook ups very highly. ExNPs, I would also think have a sadistic streak due to Se-Demon whilst INxJs have a masochistic streak due to Si-Demon. The demon sensing functions will also result in quite “kinky” behaviour from these types.
2	Hoe....\n\nSelf reflective... But a kinky fucking hoe.\n\nWell aware of my proclivities. \nAt one point This spring I was juggling 6 women. It was stressful as hell... No thank you.. Never again..I let them all know I was dating others... And was able to get rid of 3... Now I work hard to sleep alone... Ugh..\nThis is not bragging... It's a warning...\nDon't date more than 2-3 at a time.
3	I believe a lot of ENTPs are smart and lean towards sapiosexuality which usually requires time. \n\n&#x200B;
2	I’m 18 and my body count is 80+  complete whore. (Been having sex since 16 (live in the uk)) 
1	I think that society molds your sexual proclivities more than MBTI necessarily does. That being said, I love fucking, I have one-night stands, I have had in the past had more than one long term partner at the same time. Do what feel right, but for the love all use condoms!!!
1	Idk what kind of phase I'm going through but people in general gross me out right now. I'd need some serious emotional connection to want to touch anyone. But I have a feeling it's going to be pretty intense when the time comes. 
1	I hope it's okay if I post here - I tend to ride the line between I- and E-NTP.\n\nI'm fairly new at the whole sex thing (held back by self consciousness which I thrust (ha) myself out of) and so my relationship with it is still developing. My attraction to people seems to develop more out of a discerning taste for someone I can have a good conversation with, not necessarily deep but more intellectual. Thus, my sexual interactions - so far - haven't been out of deep intimacy but rather in situations where we're somewhere between platonic and romantic affection.\n\nHaving held out for so long, I'm afraid that I'm beginning to conflate sexual interest with genuine interest, and while I'm not necessarily ashamed of my enjoyment of receiving that attention, I'm not sure it's the best set up for me in the long run. The world of sex and romance is a very strange place for someone who is simultaneously idealistic and pragmatic.\n\n/sorry for the semi-coherent rambles
1	Meaningless sex was wonderful for a while, then a short relationship was great, now a ltr is wonderful. Different mindsets left me in different areas. But im happy where i am now and my SO is amazing
1	I'm a big ol hoe. 100000%
1	I want to try the poly thing, but with a very conventional husband it probably won't happen. That's ok! I'll find a way to shake it up! \n\nAside from my curious tendencies, I have no desire to sleep with a bunch of people. In fact, I've only ever had sex with my husband (not for religious reasons, at all). 
1	Honestly, sex bores me. At least vanilla sex does, which is all you're gonna get through a hookup. I have no problem hooking up with people at all, but I pretty much get no real satisfaction out of it, much less sex sometimes. It just feels dull to me. It's not very exciting. I can't wait for someone to come along and change that though lol, because I feel like that might happen
55	Schrödinger's confidence: fruitlessly trying to be more confident? Maybe this can point you in a different direction.	This is gonna be a bit confusing at first, but I'll try and tie it together! Essentially, I have found what for lack of a catchy word I will call **Schrödinger's confidence**: \n\nit seemed, at first, paradoxic that while I tend to bitterly pour a lot of hate on myself, I still feel a deep sense of self-reliance somewhere inside me. I imagine most of you do. The kind of feeling that if push came to shove, you could trust in yourself to find a way to handle it, because you always do. \n\nI believe this has to do with how I view myself when on my own vs. in group-settings. The latter have, throughout my whole life, been a *challenge* to put it mildly. I wouldn't be surprised if some of you shared my experiences.\n\nAt the end of this post I hope to **provide some starting-points for solving some of the issues** that you may or may not share with me.\n\nMy reason for tying these problems to ENTPs is that I imagine most of us will find it hard to find **a place within a group**. Usually because in my experience, the majority of people you'll meet will not be link-minded. SJ-Traditionalists are probably the cornerstone of society and it is not an easy task to gain the recognition of down-to-earth type boys and girls who live in the here and now. \n\nSome of you may not care about that. \n\nI **believed** I didn't care. Turns out I do.\n\n\nSo, story-time:\n\nI've been in the gutter these past days and thought a lot about various toxic tendencies of mine which some of you may or may not relate to:\n\n\n* **Self-deprecation**: though I can be arrogant at times, I often wind up bashing myself and negatively comparing the achievements and qualities of others to my own. This happens in group-settings most of the time and is painfully obvious to me when some other member is praised by the group, while I am not.\n* **Inevitably sabotaging myself in groups**: this may be a quirk that is caused by my individual circumstances and past, but bear with me for a second. I reflected on how all of my experiences with trying to interact with groups inevitably lead to the same conclusion. Whether the initial group-experiences prove horrible or delightful: over the course of, say, half a year, give or take, I will slowly\ncement my position as a loner and (sub)consciously try to establish that *I am different/don't fit in*. Which obviously gives off narcissistic vibes. This is then followed by me being butthurt because now I am sitting at the sidelines and watching everyone else get along fine, while I am still desperately trying to pull off the ol' *Oooh look at me, I am mysterious and edgy.* shtick. \nIn the end I just end up being more bitter about how *I just don't get group life* and how it's not for me. Even though no long-term effort (however charming I may have been initially) was made to just be a member of said group.\n* **No feeling of belonging**: Probably a direct consequence of what I described above - I am utterly clueless about my place in the world, society, or even small groups of friends. Whenever I am with more than two people, I lose sight of how/where I fit into the dynamic. As a substitute for a *proper* place within a group (i.e. one that is not entirely passive), I have a strong tendency to just don the observer-hat and, safe for a few quips and jests, retreat from any meaningful interaction. \n* (On that note: I also often feel *trapped* in my ways, when I only interact with folks within the sphere of clever humor and cockiness. But that's a topic for a different time)\n\nBeing passive and distant in groups will get you exactly what you should expect, and I know that. Yet it still seems I can't break this cycle. \nIn the end, I will leave the group, and wind up hurt, because I wasn't shown the attention I needed, nor were any of my qualities validated or reaffirmed by the group.\n___\n**tl;dr:** Sooner or later I will feel very worthless when interacting within the framework of a group. Be that work, uni, family or bigger-picture things like society. Rage-quitting usually ensues.\n___\n\n\n\nAs I stated in the beginning, I do however have *some* semblance of confidence etched into my being. This I have often seen mentioned in the context of ENTP-ness: \n\n* **I am capable**: I have proven to myself more often than not that I am able to save the day, if need be. And I feel like I can turn everything around at any moment. \n* **I have got some qualities going for me**: or at least I can think of some ideals that I truly give my best to live up to. \n* **I can help people**: weird and peculiar as my (or any ENTPs) stances on various topics may be (and how much it weirds me out to be around crying people), often times I feel like we are a powerhouse at helping and caring when the need arises.\n\n**In a nutshell**, when I am in a situation where my fate is entirely decided by my own actions - such as when traveling abroad alone - I **know** I can trust and rely on myself.\n \n___\n\n**What I make of these observations**\n\nI find inability to fit in and not receiving the external validation I oh so desperately crave on the one side. *Classic insecurity.*\n\nOn the other hand there's a deeply-rooted feeling of self-confidence were I to rely entirely on myself. *Maverick-style*.\n\n**Schrödinger's confidence?**\n\nSeems to me the problem - at least in my situation and I hope some of you can relate - is **not a sheer lack of confidence**.\n\n**What needs fixing** is how I engage with groups. \n\nMost of my life I thought that I craved straight external validation. Which every armchair psychologist will tell you is not the road to eventually become confident, but merely a quick-fix.\n\nPerhaps another thing can be gained by healthily living in and interacting with groups of people: \n\n**A sense of belonging**. Knowing, feeling what role it is you are fulfilling within a given unit. And perhaps gaining that same sort of **I can trust myself** confidence in group-settings, i.e. **They can trust and rely on me and they know it.**\n\nI have started the NeTi-machine in search of an answer to how to achieve this. Any input is of course appreciated. And I hope you gained some perspective from reading this. That'll be all.
10	Holy shit, this is me and has summed up my entire life. This is the answer I’ve been searching for.
6	I can sorta relate to this. This has -for the most part- been me throughout my highschool years. After extensive reading on the myers briggs principle, I am fairly certain (I am not basing my entire life on this doctrine, mind you, just appreciate the research behind the test), that I just don't get along with S-types. I mean I keep an open mind, but when I look at me now, I am pretty certain that almost all of my friends are N-types and those, who may consider me a friend, but are acquaintance to me, are probably also S. Don't get me wrong.I did not run around and cut ties with everyone I know, who so happens to be an S-type. I just tried to type "my people", once I felt I had enough knowledge to adequately do so..And most of them are probably INTP. At least my closest friends. (I did nag a couple of those to do the test to confirm my suspicions--->I was right.) And I do feel that those friends understand me much better than anyone previously did. It's one of the reasons why I think that the MBTI-classification holds some truth to it. However I still do not feel completely understood. It's why I came here. In hopes that my fellow ENTPs may finally get all of me. Or not. Maybe you'll just disprove my theory that the myers briggs is - at least partially (given that you are not mistyped)- valid. Either way that's my story.xD\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the advice: I truly feel like the right kind of people will always make you feel welcome and give you a place in the group. Naturally. You'll know. Finding those may be tricky, but I feel like diving into an interactive hobby is a great start.
10	Want to win the respect of the STJs who rule the world? I’m gonna tell you the secret — know what the fuck you’re talking about, and when you say you know how to do something and can do it, you had better be able to produce it in a timely way.\n\nOtherwise they will see you as an incompetent big-mouth who does a lot of talking and little actual doing.  \n\nAnd, like with most practical day to day things, the STJs will be right. \n\nAs a side bonus, knowing what the fuck your doing, and being able to do it are great confidence builders.   They help you to get the respect of your peers and have other useful benefits, like helping to advance in a job, or even to keep it. 
7	tl;dr: Do your positive affirmations, fam.
3	Enfp, and - same here. My two observations: just the halo effect can make anyone accepted. It's the halo effect that makes the same action brave, vs creepy. Dr House was a weirdo yet people were drawn to him.\n\n\nWhat I hate about "normies" is how their choose their battles. Imagine being a player in "Who wants to be a millionaire" and failing badly. But months later, when rewatching your failure, you notice questions in YOUR episode were all useless trivia and gossip related, while in other episodes there are more of a science questions you'd love. They have this power of denying existence of any area of knowledge that they dont know anything about. Its like being the great Seljuk, excellent desert and steppe general, but forced to fight only in Forests, Swamps or Arctic areas where he sucks.
2	Great post! When I deal with others I feel like I need to at least try to out people in the different personality groups before I decide to deal with them or not
2	Huh. I don't know if it's life experience or what... but I have not remotely faced the issue of not being capable or confident enough in groups. I don't relate at all to the initial problems you've stated.
2	Very relatable post.\n\n\nI would love the insight of some older ENTPs here and see if the answer is anything more simple than "stop being a fucking asshole and let yourself live in the moment"
2	I can relate in some ways, but not in others. The vast majority of my friends are intuitives. I really don’t talk to many sensors, so I don’t feel like I don’t belong. I’m relatively secure with myself so I don’t usually get jealous when others are praised either. I am extremely hard on myself though, and ultimately I think that I don’t matter as I don’t impact enough people. This is a continuous struggle I have. I find work unfulfilling and feel like the only way I can be complete is by impacting people enough to gain their loyalty. It’s weird. I have to remind myself that I am enough, even if I don’t think I am. So can’t relate to some aspects, but I can relate to others. Nice post either way. 
2	I'm still trying to obtain that big dick energy, but the more I consciencly act confident, the more tryhard I look a.k.a. the damn opposite of big dick energy.
1	!remindme
1	I have never related to anything more in my life.\nThis is exactly how Ive felt my entire life, and I still to this day feel like this. I just recently enrolled at a college... I am getting my grade 10 after dropping out of school in Grade. 9. \nI hate school. I absoutly despise it. But not because I think im just "too cool for school". No, my whole childhood revolved around moving. Around being the new kid. I was always the outcast. Either living with my dad who was a truck driver and nevrr home or with my alcoholic mom, auntie, moms boyfriend his 2 boys and my 2 brothers, half the time I never went to school. I never belonged anywhere, I never got to keep my friends. This has forever affected my life and self esteem. \nI am 3 years sober and recently got out of an abusive relationship. Im considering therapy as well. Maybe that will help... \nThis post is what I needed to read right now. 
8	Any ENTP's love what they do? What would you recommend?	Hey guys. It's been asked **thousands** of times on here but like most I just haven't fully connected with what I have read.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL/DR: Want to dive into a career that won't over bore me and that pays, ehh, alright. Tried quite a few online ventures, spent a lot of time in the service industry. Currently in insurance. Could consider real estate. Looking for fellow happy ENTP's career paths.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\*I am looking for advice for a next career but am totally paralyzed.\*\n\nBackstory\n\n\-Did not finish college, was studying psychology, dropped out to pursue a high paycheck( in restaurant mgmt).\n\n\-Worked in the restaurant industry for 10yrs. Got totally burned out\n\n\-Quit the industry to pursue **anything** else, but tried my hand at online sales. For example\n\n\--Started and ran a successful candle business for 3 years. Day to day was making and shipping candles(got burnt   \nout not enough money). Sold locally, on amazon and Shopify.\n\n\-Studied(on my own and bootcamp) web design and front end development(HTML CSS JS JS frameworks/libraries).\n\n\--Applied to most if not all the tech companies in my area, probably don't have the strongest portfolio, but did not   \nfind a job. Only really pursued this career so far for the possibility of the supposed salaries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Currently work** part time at an insurance brokerage, doing basic customer service, out bound cold call(lead generation), script writing. But it's a very small brokerage and they need more time from me, and to possibly get licensed to help with quoting. I'm hesitating in moving forward with this industry since it is very boring/repetitive and the money doesn't seem great(According to google).\n\nAlso I work with my mom as her marketing consultant for her real estate business. She is almost to the point of retirement has always said I would enjoy being a realtor. Any ENTP's out there that enjoy their work in real estate?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Does any of my back story sound similar to yours and if so where did you land happily or at least are content with?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks all\n\n  *Edit: Thank you for all the input, I’ve got a lot to think about/try!
9	Sales manager. I love it. Get new projects to obsess over, get to talk to people all day, and every day is a competition.
10	Software Engineering.\n\n- Really not that hard for Thinkers\n- Probably the best industry to be in\n- Very high demand\n- Lots of options\n- Really well paying\n- Great hours\n- Can get a job with only a certificate and build from there 
4	I've loved everything that I've done, just not longer than a few years at a time. 
3	I’m a marketing manager. I basically get to oversee multiple teams and their marketing efforts. I love being in a leadership position and controlling the guidelines that people work with. It’s all a system I’ve created myself through experimentation. I get to strictly focus on the bigger picture decisions through analytics and I have the final word on 95% of what I do. I get to travel and learn how to navigate my leadership style through many different egos. All of it is a game to me. From the leadership to the experimentation to the conceptualizing. The only bad part is I have to spend half my time at a desk, but I’d do that either way regardless. I have mentors who have made millions in their fields. One is a INTJ and he constantly spits wisdom on me.  Overall here is why it’s ideal: \n\n1. Autonomy \n2. Intelligent/competent superiors I can respect \n3. General oversight/decision making where other people execute while I tell them what and how to execute/ \n4. Lots of analytics and experimentation I can get lost in. \n5. Flexibility in where/how I spend my time. I am free to get things done on my own time (within reason) \n\nCons: \n1. Lots of desk work \n2. Lots of useless meetings and lunches when I have more useful and urgent things to do\n3. A few idiot subordinates I have to expend time and energy on \n4. Small talk in the office \n5. Networking events when I’m tired/not in the mood \n6. I love 40 minutes away and have to commute/wake up super early every morning \n\nWhatever you do, pick something that lets you come up with ideas or let’s you make your own decisions. Being micromanaged is the biggest employment evil I’ve ever experienced. Next to incompetent superiors- these 2 things will always make you unhappy. I’m sure that’s true for most people, but it’s intolerable from the moment it starts for me. I’ll drop a job in a second if that’s the setup. 
3	I love what I do! I have the smartest and most flexible boss. Also, I’m my boss. :)\n\nI have jumped around in my career as well. It’s one of the curses and blessings of ENTPs being capable of just about anything and getting bored of just about everything. So yes, sounds familiar. This has made my résumé look odd to most companies, and I will never fit the mold of what those businesses are hiring for again. But the awesome part is that what I do now is paid better by those same companies than their FTEs get.\n\nI’ve been consulting for many years now. ENTPs who can be self-motivated can be amazing consultants. Projects are always new, challenges are always new, and often clients are new. I am constantly inventing ways of solving problems and helping my clients innovate and succeed. There are lots of types of consulting, just like what you are currently doing in real estate. I am in business technology and marketing. I spend some of my time (because I’m my boss) learning new stuff and writing articles for online publication, and this is part of what brings me new business.\n\nOdds are that you have figured out some of the primary pain points and resolutions for some organizations in both the restaurant business and real estate. You could make a career out of being their problem solver rather than having to stay in the boring daily details of running those types of businesses yourself. 
3	I do freelance film and writing at the moment. I am also writing a short film screenplay for a competition coming up in March. I decided a few months ago that I was never going back to a 9-5 office job again and luckily I’m able to do this because of the free time online college courses allow. We’ll see how things look around September.
3	Programming definitely. Feeds the Ti, I’m never bored cause I’m always problem solving:)
2	Digital marketing. It’s awesome, you can make good money and the job is always changing
2	Sales, marketing 
2	Forensic Psychiatrist but it’s very niche.
2	I'm an air traffic controller. Love it. It's new every day, there's always a puzzle to solve, and people do what I tell them to. 
2	Psychotherapist- it’s awesome to work with people and help them turn their problems into puzzles. 
1	Emergency medicine. So much novelty for us ENTP's. \n\nYou could be a paramedic, doctor, nurse, respiratory tech... Those would all be good roles within emergency medicine to practice if you're ENTP. All of those roles work reasonably autonomously, and while you obviously do still have managers, you barely ever see or hear from them.\n\nYou all know the fun stuff we get to see, some of them make it to the news!
2	Monthly Mentoring Thread - February 13, 2019	**The purpose of this thread is to help /r/ENTP participants to self organize into mentor/mentees, masters/apprentices.**\n\nPost a bio or check out the bios to see if there is someone who is a good fit for you, and send them a PM or reply right in the comments. Mentors, you can edit or delete your comment after you've found what you're looking for.\n\n**In the comments, post a short bio with:**\n\n* Your life story, but not too detailed for your stalkers,\n\n* The stage you are in your life,\n\n* The type mentor you are looking for,\n\n* The type of mentees you feel comfortable mentoring.\n
2	Life story. Grew up in the country. Explored forests and didn't have friends. Proceed to move to a small town. Explored woods to stay entertained. Built forts out in the woods for fun. School was always something I hated throughout my entire childhood. Never could get along with anyone my age. I enjoyed the company of adults throughout school. Never put any effort into school. Moved again to where I currently reside. It's an area with not much woods. Got into playing video games. Finished High School with a handful of friends . Now I'm working basic jobs trying to figure out if I want college or not. I keep getting frustrated with the schools waste of my money for pathetic classes that hardly teaches anything.\nMy state of life is struggling to choose something and work on it. I enjoy doing business sales and working with computers .  I need someone who will help me stay on track with life goals .
0	Since this patriot revealed to us what tech companies are doing, i mostly stopped using google products. Also quit Facebook. Not easy tasks. Doing something out of principle, even at the cost of convenience, is core to who I am. Anyone here who claims to be ENTP that doesn’t adhere to these ideals?	
9	Da, tovarish.  When patriot gospodin Snowden reveal treachery of US Deep State, he open my eyes wide.   I made *incredible* sacrifice to no use Facebook.  I am very proud.  Some even say I am the proudest.  No one prouder than me. \n\nMany people give up life for country.  Dulce et decorum est.   Many others live whole life in service to humanity.  Me?  I give up shitposts, dank memes, and antivaxers.   Is big sacrifice.  The biggest.   But what can one say?  Must live by one's principles as genuine 100% American ENTP.
4	Lol purity testing ENTP’s?  You sound like an ENTJ
7	I don't. The only way to get actual privacy would be to quit the Internet, leave society and spend the rest of your life living in a mountain.\n\nI choose to embrace technology with its good and bad parts. Adhering to ideals is stupid. Ideals are called ideals for a reason. The world is not ideal and will never be. Of course I'm not saying give away your rights, but don't expect them to be always respected.
3	Think you're looking for the Fi types. 
3	Snowden is an idiot and traitor-adjacent.  He released thousands and thousands of documents that he didn't even read or skim for source data, putting the lives of people who give intelligence to the U.S. in danger.  It's not just some government trope, it's true.  It is now much more difficult to convince human sources that the U.S. can be trusted to guard their identities, which results in less intelligence being gathered, and ultimately, in the loss of lives.\n\nHe also let our adversaries know what capabilities we have, and other countries have since used this information to attack us.  \n\nPersonally, I don't believe we should give up liberty for security, but that's essentially the decision a majority of Americans have made, and there are much better ways to go about fighting our security establishment than dumping unread TS/SCI intelligence information to the exact same website that used said information to undermine our democracy.  \n\n\nEdit: apparently Snowden stole over 1.7 million documents.  My bad.
3	I’m an ENTP. I don’t have any ideals.
3	All sites mine your data, including reddit. Better delete that next. 
21	Just wanted to share this YouTube channel I love	The content is smart and funny and not limited to any one subject and really holds your attention (I can literally never focus on a video for more than 5 minutes unless it gets me interested and this channel always manages to). Just putting it here cause I think ENTP's would be likely to like it!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCimiUgDLbi6P17BdaCZpVbg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCimiUgDLbi6P17BdaCZpVbg)
5	I used to watch him many moons ago but his content started to feel exhaustingly pessimistic and repetitive. I was a little younger tho, maybe a too much as I get now how exaggerated pessimism could be comedy gold while I might've took it seriously. Also I don't remember if it was on his main channel but the running video has stuck with me ever since. I don't yet run every day or even every week but over the years it has started to slowly accumulate so. I want to *need* it too. 
6	If you like his YouTube, he writes science fictions books too! They’re pretty fucking good! 
2	Yeah definetely one of my favourite youtubers
2	I LOVE that guy
2	I couldn’t stand watching it for more than 30 seconds.
3	>Just putting it here cause I think ENTP's would be likely to like it!\n\nBy ENTP, you mean ADHD riddled ENFP troglodytes who can't pay attention to anything educational for more than 5 seconds without being sidetracked.\n\nI've watched some of the videos he's posted on physics and while the content is *somewhat* correct (and the parts it does get correct are just cited common knowledge - anything deeper is actually misconstrued), it's poorly communicated (which is *totally* an ENTP trait...) and totally derailed by childish nonsense. How anyone can watch this drivel and actually extract (read as: remember) anything educational about it is absolutely beyond me. \n\nLet me put it like this. As an actual instructor of physics, I would *never* share these videos with students, and if any of them told me they watched it, I'd tell them to cut it out immediately and start watching educational videos instead. I honestly can't get deeper than a couple minutes in. \n\nDo yourself a favor and stop watching this mind numbing garbage and find a proper educational video instead. Thank you for sharing some of the stupidest content I've ever seen. Please don't do it again. 
52	Write those crazy ideas down!	I get all kinds of crazy ideas, but I either had no confidence in them OR I forgot about them because I didn't record it. I don't know if this applies to anyone else but I first got over this by sending these ideas to a friend, and then more friends until they all realized the merit and helped me develop them. Now I maintain a journal of my thoughts, I also use it for my class notes so it's easily accessible. Doing this also got me all kinds of crazy opportunities and meetings with fascinating people, who also thought my ideas were impressive. \nSomething inside us is speaking to us, make sure the world gets to hear it!
26	"Almost everyone has at least one book in them. For most of us, that's also where it should stay." -- origin unknown
4	My desk at work and at home is littered with sticky notes lol. It's just how my brain works. Might also be my add / adhd. 
3	Absolutely. One of the most common pieces of advice for greater success is to journal your thoughts. 
3	Carrying a pocket notebook has helped me out a lot! Of course, you can write your crazy ideas down in your phone's notes app, but there's just something about the entire "yellow pocket notebook full of seemingly incoherent thoughts scribbled in it" aesthetic which really appeals to me. \n\nMore than anything else, it has helped me not forget stuff, and prioritise things better. \n\nIt helps me keep a track of my procrastination as well. That way I know when to stop procrastinating when it goes beyond the normal levels. 
2	I am going to try this!
2	I do that with poetry now and I enjoy it a lot! 
2	Your phone is a great resource for note taking 
2	It isn't possible for me to record the ridiculous analysis I come up with for just about everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSure, the few that keep coming back up have been recorded, but that's far from everything...
2	This is a good idea, I used to do this but I stopped for no apparent reason other than I probably saw something shiny or some other generic bullshit. I can do better than that. Good advice! 
2	Cannot tell my friends, they‘re already so sick of them. That‘s why I‘m on reddit. And I also write them down in notes on my phone, but not that detailed.\n\nAlso I love sharing ideas on reddit because some people are ready to shred them into pieces. Only to make me strengthen my ideas. My friends usually don‘t have any critique for them.
1	Yeah I started jotting down my ideas after I started hearing "that's a really good idea" when talking to people. All of it is related to creative stuff like songs and stories but I guess that's what I love the most. Eventually I'll have made so many notes on that stuff that I'll make something out of them. I also organize the hell out of my notes too which helps a lot in remembering what I was thinking about
1	As a musician it’s voice memos , notes, and an app called every day looper 
1	Love it!! This is such a good idea\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been doing the editing, but definitely incorporating the sharing!\n\n&#x200B;
1	I go get children’s bathtub crayons because I get so many ideas in the shower lol. My shower walls look crazy. 
1	I do! That's why I have so many short stories!
1	I started with paper notebooks and word, changed to evernote, came back to paper and evernote and have stuck with those two since. I organize my whole life in them and it's a superb way to learn writing and keeping procrastination, habits and overall life goals and yourself in check.
1	I got some a few answers on their test... (But assume that there will be a required essay question)	
9	Hey, uhm... am I hurting anyone?	Being an ENTP, especially a neurotic one, means I am the master of discord and ever flaunt ugly truths to escape people of order. I do what I want, I act infantile and I always find an easier way whilst laughing at people using word salad. But now that I think of it, despite bringing a lot of pragmatic value to the world, I must've hurt hella' lot of feelings. Imagine an ISFJ that keeps at it in hope and restraint thinking they have it all figured out and I come in and shatter their altruistic philosophies. Is that, perhaps, not the right thing to do?
39	This is just immaturity, don’t blame your personality type indicator for being a dick to people. Grow up and learn when to shut your mouth or it’ll bite you in the ass in your personal and professional lives. 
14	The fact that you posted this means you know the answer. :)
11	It sounds like you need to grow up. 
11	Lmao pretty sure this is a shit post but if not- people who bash R/ENTP can eat my ass. Everyone coming together to rightfully roast this guy hahahaha 
5	Utilitarianism makes just as much sense as nihilism, you’re just lazy so you act upon your nihilistic inclinations. You haven’t argued anyone out of shit, though.
4	Depends, if you're doing it with some twisted happiness that you're 'hurting' someone then yeah it's wrong. Sounds like you're bound to prove that the world is dark and horrible and you're the hero that is ...exposing it?
6	You should change your name to "Douche Quixote." 
2	Of course it's not the right thing to do.  Are ye daft?!
3	Chill out lol
1	# [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-p-l8pYQH0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-p-l8pYQH0)\n\nThis is my solid advice. Take it or leave it HIPPIE! \n\n&#x200B;
199	Just a feel good love letter to all the ENTPs	From an INFP who fell in love with one of you guys, you ENTPs are the most genuine, fascinating brains I have ever met, the way your thoughts jump around at erratic and lightning speeds, bouncing from A to D to B, C, X, Y and back to A, it gives me mental whiplash to try and keep up with you. You force me to bring my A game whenever we dive into deep discussions, where I’m used to giving 20% effort to the majority of the population and having them be satisfied with me, you make me want to be 100% of my most interesting, unique self when I’m around you. \n\nYou push me to levels of weirdness I’ve only known how to suppress, and encourage me to go further. When I’m with you I feel like I can be as honest, open, dark and twisted as my deepest desires and you would accept me unblinkingly. Nothing shocks an ENTP!\n\nBeing around an ENTP is honestly, intoxicating. I get high off our completely uninhibited and just downright dirty fun conversations, the matching levels of spontaneity, the crazy ideas and speculations that you blurt out that I want to always be around to catch before they disappear into thin air. The simultaneously playful, warm, and detached attitude you bring to sex.\n\nYou all make yourselves out to be such evil assholes, and openly, gleefully embrace this side of you, but despite all of the sarcastic talk I can see such a goodness and love of humanity shining through. Despite any past mistakes or fuckups I believe you’re all just giant puppies deep down that want to be loved and want those you love and care about to be happy, and that unconditional love is the purest form of love I know.\n\nSincerely, lovingly, admiringly, \n\nFrom an INFP :)
72	" You all make yourselves out to be such evil assholes "\n\nAlways seems the world views us this way and people find out the truth if they bother to get to know me at least lol. But I will say that I really do appreciate what you have to say about us fellow ENTP. We generally do not receive a sense of affirmation from people so when it does happen it is nothing short of completely authentic. Your ENTP is lucky to have you and your appreciation for who he is. 
64	Wow. A simple, “you aren’t a sociopath like everyone else thinks” could have done the trick. But I like this a lot better. Thank you :)
50	*[cries in Fe]*
23	As an ENTP who has been dating an INFP for seven years, this made my heart really happy. 
18	Just when I didn't think I could love myself more!....;)  Thx
12	Wow -- thank you so much for that dear!!\n\n-\n\n(Spot on btw, I couldn't have said it better myself.)
11	Could this be the love and understanding I missed when I was a child? \n\nVery cute! 
10	I love you 
9	Thanks, no homo though.
7	Thanks. I totally get the giving 20% but wanting to give a 100% thing. Unfortunately most INFPs I know just get stuck wanting and then become stubborn and unresponsive even with offers of help to actually do more. It can be pretty exhausting. Maybe this is related to maturity though. 
6	I needed to hear this, thank u x
6	It's amazing when someone appreciates you for who you are. Nothing better than that. I think it happens very rarely, and when it does then you know that this person is a keeper.\n\n\nKnowing that you can be yourself without judgement from the other person, with all your flaws, all the thoughts and things that people may deem as awful and would never want to hear about, is really intoxicating.
5	[deleted]
5	You know, I got very close with a girl who was an INFP not too long ago. I hope she felt some of the same things you wrote here. I think she did. 
3	If all INFPs are like this, then I can't wait to meet one of you in person! :D
5	Having just met a really close friend and -might I say- potential love interest, who happens to be an INFP, this really speaks to me. I am the most honest around him and he has -in turn- shown me some of his darkest sides. It's refreshing, really, as is this "loveletter". But you INFPs better not underestimate our asshole tendencies. Don't hurt yourselves.
3	thank you . for someone who is lately getting the "fuck off you are annoying" this is very heartwarming.
5	>Open\n\nCool.\n\n>Dark and twisted\n\nAwwwwhhhh Yeaahhhh\n\n>Deepest desires\n\nLet's hear em\n\n> Nothing shocks an ENTP!\n\nTruth.
2	As an ENFP who has a bestie ENTP, I agree so much! \n\nWonderful write up! :)
2	I’m gonna pretend this is from my INFP boyfriend. ❤️
2	Awwww. This is so cute!!! And accurate imo xD
2	You just send a love letter to a whole bunch of people you don't know. For all we know I might kick puppies in my free time and candy bars from orphans. On top of that, there is also the fact that Hitler was most likely an ENTP. You just said that you like the *Playful, warm, and detached attitude* Hitler brings to sex. I'm not saying someone can't have a kink however this is kinda pushing it.
2	Where were you in my life? \nA puppy is a great description. 
2	Fellow INFP that loves an ENTP! This about sums up my feelings :)
2	Thanks for sharing this, I’m an INFP in love with an ENTP. \n\nI’ve been emotional lately and I came here to try and understand him more. Your post has helped me remember why I fell in love with him. \n\nIf you have any advice please share :)
1	I like to act as the answer of life. Which is more so a question. A question that can only be answered by the viewer of said question.
1	Feel free to slide into my DMs ;)
1	I AM NOT A PUPPY! As you will see as denoted by my flair, I am a dragon - wha-DONOTPETMYSCALESURDOINGITWRONG! Rawr. -.-  \n\n\nAm I the only one the intimacy defense trigger switched on with?
12	Religious ENTP's why are you still religious?	We are one of the least religious groups according to this study:\nhttps://www.16personalities.com/articles/religion-and-personality-type\n\nWhat religion do you believe in? And as Analysts and Thinkers how do you get around the contradictions in holy books and the rediculousness of most religions 
10	I wouldn't be surprised if this is an NT friendly discipline, at least historically. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apologetics
13	> the rediculousness of most religions\n\nWell, gee, you're not biased.
7	I believe in myself.
3	I’d consider myself a theist for sure. I was raised Christian so in terms of religion I lean that way and attend church sometimes. I think religion is good for those who want to use it properly and bad for those who don’t ya know? 
3	I believe it’s the most consistent and most explanatory worldview (Christianity).\n\nI’ve had many doubts through many different discussions and I still have doubts every now and then, but I’m consistently brought back to Christ.\n\nI’ll say this, even if you guys don’t believe me: If I’m wrong then I want to know that I’m wrong; if I’m right then I want to know that I’m right. I don’t believe in Jesus Christ because my family does or because my friends do, I believe in it because I see it as the correct worldview.\n\nConcerning errors in the Bible, I don’t believe there are any in the original manuscripts. I do believe that some English translations are flawed because of mistranslations or omitted/added verses, but I believe the original writings of the apostles, prophets, Paul, etc are all inspired and infallible. We do not have the original manuscripts nowadays for direct comparison, but we do have a plethora of New Testament manuscripts to compare and contrast. The main point is that the core of the Gospel is consistent and without error; the Gospel writers all agree that Jesus lives, died, and was resurrected. Even if the Bible wasn’t infallible then all that matters is that the Gospel is still true; the rest of the Bible could be false, but if that Gospel is true then Christianity is true, and I believe it’s true.\n\nSo to answer your question directly again: I’m still religious because Christianity has held true through every objection, scrutiny, and question that I have come across.
3	Catholic but many would call me out on this one. I don't see the big deal, so what if god doesn't exist does that really change that much? It's still comforting to think that there could be someone looking out for you for the big questions (What is life/death etc).\n\nNot only that but the church can help a lot with emotional/moral issues etc and socially if people are new to a place helps socialise. \n\nThis is really weird to say for me as a STEM student but I think with religion people are too caught up on the truth and not the message that's trying to be said. Like the bible is a book with the general gist of "pls dont be a dick"\n\nAnd i think everyone can agree with that message\n\nAlso fun thing to do is if you ever pray think of jesus as a mate/bro makes it actually entertaining to subvert everything you've been told about this all powerful guy
4	Pascal's Wager says I should believe, just in case. But why only Christianity? I've extended the wager to include all religions, just in case. like [this guy](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PqJpZOljjG8)
2	I practice paganism. I was raised that way, never felt like I wanted to leave. We have no holy book (well at least most of us do not).
2	I was raised without religion. Since then, I've had experiences during psychedelic trips and meditation which are perfectly described in traditional Hindu and Buddhist texts, so I figured there's likely some truth to these religions. 
2	Neo said it better than us, we don't like the idea that we're not in control of our lives
2	I planned to explain my view but your replies here show an inability to think openly about the topic. 
2	But most NTPs I know are agnostics and not atheists, due to the fact that they're never sure of anything 
1	I find it very interesting that people are so quick to shut down the idea of God just appearing one day and creating the universe but are more accepting of the idea that a singular point appeared and expanded into what the universe is today. \n\n\n*Although, some combine the two and say God set off the Big Bang.*\n\n\nOP is dismissing Christians as a whole because "the only way we can defend ourselves is through our faith". While failing to realize that most people have the same type of "faith" in science. \n\nWhy is it so insane for me to believe in Christianity because I can't 100% prove it but you're arguing that you shouldn't believe in it even though you can't 100% prove it's *not* true? So with that being said, I'm going to put my faith into my religion.
1	I would make an argument for spirituality as opposed to religion. Religions are incredibly flawed. End of Story. Spirituality however is a practice of knowing that has more to do with intuitive awareness than intellect. As existing beings we need to understand that all the secrets of the universe flow through us. We might not be able to understand it, we nonetheless can be aware of it.  
0	Because secular atheism breeds degeneracy. 
4	How to make my extraversion efficient	You know, I spend a lot of time talking to people and I feel like it's a waste of time. But if I spend all this time on a hobby just by myself, I really get drained and tired.\n\nSo, how can I be efficient and productive while being in contact with people? Consider that I'm a high school student, in addition.
6	I'm assuming you're talking about social extraversion. It only becomes useful when you start college. In high school friendships basically maintain themselves, but once every person of the group leaves to a different university/city/country it all starts fading away. At first you won't really feel it, but after a semester or two you will start noticing changes in your friends. Some will be more mature, some will suddenly have different interests, some will get into drugs, some will drop out, some will become idiots, and you will start feeling as if they are different people. Maybe a few of them will stay in touch with you and the friendship will stay strong (these are the real ones).\n\nAt that moment your extraversion becomes useful. Most people won't really bother to stay in touch with most of their "friends" (me included to an extent), so if you want to have contacts in the future you will have to make the effort, which is easier if you're a social person. You don't know if a friend of Mike will be searching for someone with your exact skillset 5-10 years from now, and if you still talk with Mike from time to time he will probably mention you to his friend. Maybe something in your car breaks and you don't know shit about cars, but you regularly drink coffee with Sam and his brother is a mechanic who won't overcharge you for a small fix.\n\nHaving regular contact with a wide web of people is one of the best investments you will ever make, and most of the time it will only cost you some time and a little bit of effort.
2	Trade in the Ne for the Te. Delegate all your tasks, enjoy world domination. 
6	How interested are you in changing a person's mind?	While disagreeing, what are your priorities?\n\nAre you concerned with their feelings, having them change their minds, just handing them new information, etc etc.\n\nI understand, that for most it's a mixed bag. Specifically I am interested in hearing about how you rank things.
17	I mainly want them to acknowledge that they were wrong and I was right
12	I care more about correcting your blatant flaws in reasoning or facts or assumptions (especially those) than about your opinion.  \n\n“It’s OK not to vaccinate your children.”\n\nWe’re gonna have an argument, because that’s just reckless nonsense.  \n\n“God helps me in my life.”\n\nI think you’re delusional, and I might tell you that if pressed, but that’s just my opinion.  And I’m not going to try to insist on that point of view because there’s nothing that can be proven.  It just comes down to not fooling yourself and the rationality of consistency.\n\n
4	I don't really care most of the time. I usually argue against positions I consider wrong or faulty to put out an alternative for anyone who stumbles across the thread in the future. \n\nIt's hard to truly change someone's mind, especially when there's an emotional attachment/involvement. So unless I'm getting paid for it, why bother?
3	It really depends on the person.  Is this someone I care about?  If that's the case, I want to give them more information and let them decide for themselves.  If it's something that really conflicts with my values (I do have some, haha) then my intent is to change their minds.  But ultimately, I'm not willing to destroy relationships with friends and family over little things.  Blatant racism?  Yeah, I'll probably never stop arguing with you about something like that, because not only does it upset me emotionally if it's someone I care about, but it's so illogical and stupid that I can't help but keep arguing.  I find this especially to be true if said individual has kids, or some other strong influence on other people that I know they will do their best to exploit to further their "evil" ideals.\n\nNow, if we're talking strangers, I tend to be much more inclined to just offer a bit of conflicting information and see how they react.  Do they seem completely intractable, or willing to listen to different perspectives?  In the work place, I'm much more inclined to "respect" the wrong opinions of people who I have to work with every day.  But I hold my friends and family to a much higher standard.
2	Depends massively on the person. Is this my younger sister or my elderly grandmother? One opinion I can change forever, the other for a few years max. 
2	It depends on the situation, but most of the time i dont care about changing anyones mind,why would i care? To feel like i was right or to feel superior to them because i was right? I pick my battles,is hard to me to find fucks to give about most people specially to the point of wanting them to think diferently.
2	Firstly, I make sure if it's even possible to change their mind and how much energy it'd cost me. \nIf I see that this is lost cause then I just let go, I have better things to do than waste energy.\n\nMain reason for it is when I see that someone is wrong and I can't stand when someone is clearly wrong and doesn't want to acknowledge what is right and goes into the world thinking that they're right and spreading the word and then others hear it from them and repeat and also think they're right.. oh man
2	Hmm I generally don't usually go for "changing their mind". Mostly I am just genuinely interested in their point of view. Unless it contradicts my morals. But otherwise I just want them to acknowledge my opinion and realize that, although they may still disagree, "I have a point".
2	I‘m interested in justifying my point and making the other person understand it. When I argue with others I‘m not actually arguing with them, but more like arguing with myself and use their arguments to see the flaws in my logic, to test whether the position I take is worthy of defense and if I‘m not able to protect and justify my point than I consider the opposing parties point. A point that cannot be defended is not a good point.
76	No one poops properly	There's are a million people who just walk into the bathroom, shit for a minute, and then wipe like once and pull their pants back up and leave. That is disgusting, wrong, and I will no longer stand idly by without condemnation of this practice. \n\n* you can't do a full poop in a minute. they must be wrapping up 75% of it at the cost of multiple visits later\n\n* I refuse to believe one can wipe with one pull of toilet paper for less than 20 seconds and be clean. no way, disgusting, they are doing a cursory wipe without any regard to its efficacy. Why not do at least a second wipe to be sure?? \n\n* I mean I do this too, but, you can't poop in full comfort with your pants around your ankles. You need the full spread in order to enable maximum pooping force & efficacy. \n\n* This is more of a personal pleasure, but why are you rushing your poop? Take your time, reach a state of zen, scroll reddit and finish your poop. \n\nthis is the 99 theses for the bathroom reformation. be the change you want to see. \n\n 
57	7/10 shitpost
21	Haven’t you ever done a ghost poo before? Sometimes even one wipe seems like overkill 
10	Except if you’re sitting on the toilet that long after your first main push, the residual poop is hardening itself and making it much harder to wipe off.\n\nSource, am parent. I didn’t ever realize this till I had kids and found out the importance of a quick poop otherwise there’s this little poop ring that hardens around the butthole. \n\nSit down, shoot it out, wipe till there’s nothing left, and get on with your day. Pooping shouldn’t take longer than a minute unless you eat a crappy diet.
9	Taking the "Post good shit" rule a different route, eh?  Let's see how it plays out...
8	I think you should eat more fiber
5	Sounds like your diet or digestive system is trash if you think messy poops are supposed to be the norm.
5	>Take your time, reach a state of zen, scroll reddit and finish your poop.\n\nr/BrandNewSentence
5	I exercise, eat a healthy diet with pre-biotics, fiber and water, and regularly poop under a minute. Including wiping and proper hand-washing.\n\nIt slides right off. Forearm-sized logs. Sloop-pop done. Doesn't dirty up my ass cheeks one bit. 90% of the wiping is making sure the exit ring is still pretty neat. Usually is.\n\nTry lifting your knees, femurs well above parallel like a deep squat with good form. Also, try being more awesome.
3	Consume lots of bitter substance (i.e. lemon / grapefruit water) on an empty stomach and 1 wipe will be enough. 
3	I agree about wiping, you gotta be sure... But honestly if your digestion is good it shouldn't take that long.  And if you're not fat there's no need to take off your pants and spread your legs, I can reach everything thanks.  I think using your phone while shitting is disgusting. \n\nSide note though, most white people are shitting all wrong.  It's much healthier for the bowel to be in a squatting position rather than sitting but whatevs. 
3	I agree with this I take at least 5 mins
2	You must commit to, "The Big Poop" ! \n\nOnly absolute mAd LaDs can achieve the form : "The Big Poop"! \nIn this form, you only use 1% of your power! \n\nChange your ways and unlock your true potential !
2	Funny how eating ass is all the rage yet Americans have terrible ass wiping habits.  \n\nDon’t eat booty unless she takes a shower first.  Not worth it.  
2	>you can't poop in full comfort with your pants around your ankles.\n\n\n\nI actually feel more comfortable with my pants around my ankles. I have no need to spread wider, and the pants on make me feel as though I could quickly leave the bathroom, should an emergency present itself. 
2	You had me at no one poops properly 🤣. Not spending my Monday afternoon reading a literal shitpost.
2	I literally read this while taking a shit on the toilet. I love eating, and then shitting within 15 minutes afterwards. I feel soooooooo healthy!
2	Next time don't bring your phone. Boredom alone gets you out (with proper form) in less than a minute.
2	So there's multiple hacks to make shitting a better experience. \n\n1) Shave your ass. All that hair is grabbing that shit and holding onto it. That's fucking gross, and makes wiping take way longer. You also can't possibly wipe them completely clean, being round and all. \n\n2) Use a bidet. I don't actually do this one because I'm American and all the aftermarket ones I've seen don't look that great to me. \n\n3) Stop eating plants. No wait, I'm serious. Check out /r/zerocarb, the carnivore subreddit. We shit very little, and only once every few days. I'm talking three to four. Seriously search the posts. The sub is littered with people asking about the drastically decreased dump frequency, and us telling them it's perfectly normal. 
2	How funny, considering that the actually pooping only takes a few seconds to complete. Max. 10 seconds. The rest is just waiting for it. Unless you actually have digestion problems.
2	* If you're eating a good diet, you should be able to poop in under a minute without issue. \n* Flushable wipes, I never feel completely clean without them\n* A footstool placed in front of the toilet helps you get into more of a squatting position, which [helps](http://www.futureofpersonalhealth.com/nutrition-and-diet/why-squatting-is-a-better-position-for-bowel-movements).\n* If you spread your asscheeks a bit and use the toilet seat to hold them apart, it results in less mess\n\nWelp, that's all the poop related tips I can come up with atm. 
1	The proper way to shit is to squat. When you sit on an elevated seat your bowels get squeezed and you cant shit everything out.\n\nAlso smoking cigarettes or weed while shitting helps get EVERYTHING out and feels good af.
1	Wow that's a shit post
1	What about water instead of some dry paper? :/
1	I have perfected what I call a shit-split. So I am more than capable of taking a one minute shit if I am in a crunch. I will just have to go back for another one minute shit later. Darwinism
1	The thought that you can actually clean your butt efficiently using toilet paper itself is ridiculous and disgusting I mean if u happen to grab shit with your hand by accident would you be satisfied by merely grabbing a piece of toilet paper and rubbing your hand with it for 20 seconds? I seriously seriously doubt that but if you did feel satisfied and clean I just have to tell you your disgusting and dirty! 
1	XXI century, how good that I live in those times and can discuss pooping techniques with anyone who has internet access (so most of the population) 
1	Sorry but this is so damn hilarious to me, a post about shitting... I would make one as a joke, but you seem to be serious about it haha
1	I only use my own bathroom and use a handheld bidet, the paper itself can't fully clean anyone. 
0	Fucking entps arguing about pooping... smh. hahaha jk i love yall my brother is entp
10	The Battle of Procrastination	It's ironic that it's 22:43 and I have 2 homeworks left to do tonight yet here I am writing a post about procrastination..\n\nRegardless, do any of you have any tactics that work for you?\n\nRecently I've been experimenting with trying to go out at least one day on the weekends on the basis that work often takes as long as you allocate time for it.
8	Stop waiting until you feel like it. Rid your environment of distractions (turn off the TV or go to the library). If it helps, turn on music. Then set a timer for 25-60 minutes and git 'er done. Take a 5-10 min break and then work for another 25-60 minutes. Keep going until you're done. Take longer breaks every couple of hours. But no longer than 30 minutes or you'll lose your flow state.\n\nI don't always take my own advice. But when I do, it works.
3	I beat this shit after years of many useless life "hacks" and productivity systems. The key is to reduce dopamine-related stimulation, resensitize those receptors by quitting caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, shitty food, porn/fapping, mindless internet surfing and Netflix binging and other such dopamine flooding events. Then start meditating half an hour a day and hit the gym regularly.\n\nDo this and you'll become a driven productivity monster.
3	Simply schedule time during your day for homework and go to the library.  Treat it just like any other class.   Then do the homework.  Don’t wait.  You’ll learn better and cause less last minute deadline rush stress.\n\nI realize this isn’t a habit hat comes naturally to TPs, but it’s a good habit you can learn, just like brushing your teeth.\n\nI mean, that’s really the “secret” to doing well in school...treat it like it’s important. 
2	Drink Water.
2	There's this web extension for Chrome called Strict Pomodoro which I find incredibly useful. That'll help if you tend to spend a lot of time horsing around on the web like I do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/strict-workflow/cgmnfnmlficgeijcalkgnnkigkefkbhd?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/strict-workflow/cgmnfnmlficgeijcalkgnnkigkefkbhd?hl=en) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, try turning on some music or listening to a podcast or  simultaneously if the work is something of a chore not requiring any mental effort\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	Ever wasted 30 days only to study a whole term of medical school in 1.5 days?🙂 or perhaps study for a whole year's worth of material for the first time the night before the final exam until 5 am in the morning?🤣
1	Here are two of my methods to fight procrastination :   \n\n\n1. Procrastinate, you are smart and quick so as soon as you got no time left you will do it.  \n\n2. Stop saying :" nah i got time i will do it tomorrow ", but instead : "nah i got time, i will do it \[Specific date\]". With that method you will mindfuck yourself
1	Start somewhere, do something useful but easy to start. Don’t put pressure, make it interesting for you, if it flows I find I can work longer than most people - laser concentration.
7	Is it disrespectful to take advice as a suggestion??	
3	Having conflict with others due to you not being instantly receptive to their advice screams Ti to me. I know you could argue that I could be Fi if it “conflicts with their values” but nah 
1	How does not being receptive to advice screams Ti? \n\nPeope of all tipes get advice and dont do nothing of all the advice they collect, People of all tipes read self help books and know how to solve their problems and espend their entire lifes without addresing them\n\nCertainly most of the feelers of my life, even thoug they value my input to solve their problems only do a quarter of what they have to do.\n\nHow does it screams Ti and not Fi or Te or Fe? \n\nThat video may resonate with u, because u have lived that situation but people getting mad at u not listenning to their advice is something 99% of humanity have experienced, taking the advice of others and actually applying it is the rare action.And knowing how to reject the advice of someone without hurting their feelings or creating an upsetting situation is a high social ability talent.
11	Welcoming our future robot overlords	The year is 2030, and sex robots are finally viable. They have synthetic skin, and will speak to you in Scarlett Johansson voice, or Morgan Freeman's voice, or any other voice you enjoy. Their body/face will shape to whomever you want, whether it's Jordan Capri or Peter North, or even your mother's. \n\nHow do you predict this will influence relationships? How about marriage rates? Divorce rates? Will domestic violence rates change? How will the notion of a family change? Will little Johnny get a sex robot at age 16 instead of a Confirmation? \n\nWhat about family pets? Will we also be making sex robots for them? Why (not)?\n\nAnd because I'm me, and i have to be controversial: should we allow pedophiles to have sex robots in the shape of children? \n\nDiscuss. 
3	Tbh I wouldn’t mind. I personally wouldn’t, but if it keeps rapists away from women, and incels off of reddit, I’m all for it. My main concern though is the actual design, how would they be able to hold all of those technologies as still be the weight of an average human? Also, cleanup?
5	Sex bots is 2010 thinking. What I want is full body VR. Then I can have tentacle sex with 40 year old dudes pretending to be 20 year old girls.
2	Im not gonna participate on the debate because i just had similar debate not so long ago and i dont wanna put the effort here in reddit , but i see now, estereotypes come true with u aswell i guess all my effort of opening Paint was to find a more apt way to describe the Entps:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/UokiUTM](https://imgur.com/a/UokiUTM)\n\n&#x200B;
2	> And because I'm me, and i have to be controversial: should we allow pedophiles to have sex robots in the shape of children?\n\nTo bring this down to earth, I believe even the depiction of child porn is illegal at least in the States.  That is, you can’t even *draw* a kid getting fucked.  So sex robot children would certainly be out.   \n\nI think it’s a stretch to logically justify that law and it’s easy to slippery slope it — what if I draw aliens with Spock ears who just *look* like children but are really adults. \n\n(And because we’re being ridiculous) What if aliens who look identical to earth children came to earth.  Would it be illegal to film them having  sex with each other? \n\nI think it’s hard to justify any argument involving things like “consent” for pen and ink.  But it makes me curious as to how they justify it.  \n\nSeems like it’s just that people think it “should” be wrong, much like how sodomy was historically viewed or bigamy still is (but I can see logical arguments for that one).\n\nPerhaps our new Constitutionalist minded Supreme Court will strike down these “activist” laws.
4	So you're saying Donald Trump finally gets to see Nancy Pelosi in a dominatrix outfit? I can see it: PelosiBot whips the crap out of him for fucking up America's prestige on the international stage while Melania sleeps in the next room, lol.\n\nI don't think marriage/divorce rates will be affected in a meaningful way. First and foremost, sexbots will be seen as a viable alternative to prostitution by those that can't get sex otherwise. Maybe the male user base on apps like Tinder will drop a bit because a sexbot is a convenient alternative to competing with other males over a limited amount of female users. I don't think it will completely replace prostitution but I could see sexbots replacing sex workers that specialize in more outlandish and dangerous practices. Also, given the mistreatment and abuse of some sex workers, I could see sexbots being advertised as the "ethical alternative", since you can't really abuse a robot.\n\n>should we allow pedophiles to have sex robots in the shape of children?\n\nI don't see any reason why not. We condemn sexual acts with minors because they're considered unable to consent. Roleplaying as a minor (ageplay) on the other hand is a somewhat controversial but perfectly legal fetish. \n\nRobots aren't considered persons, unless there's a Robot Rights Movement and some sexbot proclaims that it "has a dream" on Twitter, so whether they consent (or even whether they *can* consent in any meaningful way in the first place) is irrelevant. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
1	We shouldn‘t. Because eventually their greed will increase and once they‘ve gotten a taste of their darkest fantasies they‘ll crave the real thing. \n\nTo further elaborate, compare it to murder. If you would make robots which you can *legally* torture in any way you want, testing all kinds of ancient torture methods on them, it would increase the abnormality in those people. I‘m not sure how to describe it, but the more you do something the more you resemble it. It would probably make people (that do it) more aggressive (or less) and eventually lead to psychological issues, *which* then again could pave them the way to be more prone and open to do psychopathic things. 
1	Or earlier, how will we deal with this exact issue but with synthetic videos of people
1	Idk but Johnny should definitely get a sex bot instead of getting confirmed.
90	Quarter life crisis or something?	Right, yeah so quarter life crisis and stuff.\n\nDude what the fuck, I'm as lost as a Malaysian airline flight right now.\n\nKnow idea where the fuck what I hope to achieve from this, but will string together some convoluted thoughts and see what you fellas have to say.\n\nBit of background?: In typical millennial entp fashion, grew up constantly being told I'm really smart and stuff. In further entp fashion, never really tried throughout school, breezed through, finished end of year 12 and worked/travelled for a year (was a fucking blast), then all of the sudden I'm 19, at uni, and dealt with an existential, quarter life, identity crisis in one slap.\n\nAftermath? Procrastinating everything like fucccck, realizing my lack of discipline has me falling behind, losing friends through an overall don't give a fuck about anything (but secretly really do) attitude, taking way too much time to just lie in bed and research pointless shit and think.\n\nBecome a bit of a loser, but don't really care because nothing really matters, no body belongs here on purpose, we're all gonna die. \n\nNow I'm like, do I just say fuck it, and go travelling because fuck this superficial, consumerist, ego-rewarding, identity-based socially constructed piece of shit we call Western society? Or do I treat the system like a game, play the game, make money in some elitist, mass-dumbing career like marketing (which I'm studying), then buy a house, a car, a lass, a fam, and all that shit that we apparently need to be happy? Or just say fuck it, drop everything and pursue some creative field like acting or film scripting or freelance writing or fuck man I don't know.\n\nSide note: pretty sure I have some kind of social anxiety now too, struggle to talk to a lot of people, almost turn into some kind of infp, ruining my social life, need new friends, fuck me sideways backwards and forwards how do I find my purpose/meaning.\n\nTldr: fuck you, read it
55	Holy fuck. Are you me? 
28	I understand exactly where you are coming from as well. I'm also 19 years old, didn't take a break from school though, wish I had. Going to a community college to get an associates degree in something that I'm not sure I really enjoy, finishing that up this semester. I have a good group of friends, or at least I like to think I do. \n\nNothing really makes me happy honestly, the only happiness I ever experience anymore is fleeting and in the moment.  I'm just trying to take it one day at a time, there's a lot of growing up I'm trying to do, and that's mostly just because I crave independence so much ( due to living with parents that are a little controlling and disapproving of my own personal beliefs). \n\nI feel (life is emotional not logical)  like life is nothing more than a wild chase after these fleeting happy moments, and it's never going to change. I don't know if it's just people don't want to accept that and fool themselves into believing that isn't what's going on, or perhaps they just don't ever think about it.\n\nDon't even get me started on how shitty trying to date is, everyone is as lost as I am, and not to say I'm better than anyone, but it seems that my self awareness is much higher than others ( that or I just overthink and analyze each situation to death). Maybe I'm just to much of a romantic, because I really just want life long love and kids, but I view it as selfish because I have a disease that has a 50% chance of being passed on to any offspring. Therefore consciously I object to having kids, even though I feel it would make ME happier. Is that self-less or just stupid? I'm not sure, everyone has said it's stupid, but I don't want to make a choice for a future child before they are born that impacts their life so greatly, especially as they would be MY children.\n\nSo the conclusion I have come to in my short time on this planet is that life IS pointless, the only option you have to find purpose and meaning is through trial and error. It sucks I know, but what other option is there? Life is what you make of it and you have decided brings value, the problem is that we see all things as inherently containing value or not being worth our time of day (if you catch my drift, it's hard to put this thought into a sentence that makes sense). \n\nSociety does suck, the good news is that you have the ability to change that, mostly through your own interactions with the world. The cheesy line be the change that you want to see in this world honestly does ring true, as you have a domino effect going on with everyone that interacts with you on a daily basis. \n\nWhat does it take to succeed though? Discipline? Drive? Will it all really make you happy? I don't know man and it drives me nuts too.  Just know you aren't alone in how you think and view things in this world. It really is comforting once you realize everyone is just as lost as yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: fuck you, I read yours\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
22	Two things I’ll share, since I have a very similar story, but am now a few years removed from where you currently are. \n\nI wrote this in my notes the other day. “I’ll spend my life becoming wealthy and successful by capitalistic standards just to establish my credibility, so that I can then use it as a platform to tell everybody how fucking stupid our system is.”\n\nMy view, while not necessarily correct or applicable to you, is to play the game and win as quickly as possible. Then go around and pursue the existential/creative stuff for the second half of the game.\n\nAlso this Dan Harmon quote might serve you well. "The knowledge that nothing matters, while accurate, gets you nowhere. The planet is dying. The sun is exploding. The universe is cooling. Nothing's going to matter. The further back you pull, the more that truth will endure. But, when you zoom in on earth, when you zoom in to a family, when you zoom into a human brain and a childhood and experience, you see all these things that matter.\nWe have this fleeting chance to participate in an illusion called: I love my girlfriend, I love my dog. How is that not better?\nKnowing the truth that nothing matters can actually save you in those moments. Once you get through that terrifying treshold of accepting that, then every place is the center of the universe. And every moment is the most important moment. And everything is the meaning of life."\n
13	Aight, time to dump.\n\nYour background is super similar to mine, except I travelled all throughout Uni and will be graduating this autumn (a year late, oopsies, but that summer in Romania was a blast).\n\nI have a job lined up in a call center (I know right) for some financial stability, but I'm still pursuing my more creative interests that seem to change from day to day. My girlfriend is very career oriented and wants me to continue in Uni until Masters, just as she does. I, on the other hand, want to chase after my interests and become a (writer | director | filmmaker | politician | graphic designer | copywriter | messenger | hot chocolate connoisseur). My preferred career depends on time of day, weather, and how many cats in my town are currently asleep.\n\nA very important lesson I learned in ignoring my INTJ "stay in school" mother and INFP "just be safe" father is to do whatever you want to do. The "want to do" is different from "feel like doing" because yes, beating the world record in Google page loading failed dinosaur jump is something you might "feel like doing", but it's super counterproductive. If you want to travel tho, spend your downtime researching places you can go affordably, when planes are cheap, or something related. I hope you got the point.\n\nWe are blessed and cursed with having a trillion interests per minute and that's just something you will have to live with. I don't claim to have mastered it (I'm 21 ffs), but I've had plenty of experience in experimenting with what I want to do in life. Try to focus on a few (10 is not a few!) passions you have and hone your skills in them.\n\nI keep my bike well maintained and have hundreds upon hundreds of pages of unpublished stories and screenplays, but neither of those are my focus in life right now. I'm gonna do my best to jump to R&D in my current company (my major is ITC, haven't mentioned it yet) while maintaining a regular income and some sanity. This might all change in a year when I'm, for example, delivering pizzas in a town where my dear is doing her Masters, but all in all, I'll be happy.\n\nBottom line: be happy with your current situation, be happy with whatever life might throw at you, and always strive to improve. My current motto in life is: "As long as total happiness in the world increases." If you make someone happy, even if it's yourself, consider it a job well done and move on to bigger goals.\n\nDon't consider "a house, a car, a lass, a fam, and all that shit" as tools to become happy -- you will attain those when you will already be happy. Happiness doesn't turn on with a ring on your finger or keys to a Lambo, it's a thing you build, day by day. Be yourself, get out, do things to make yourself and other people happy. Consider that your purpose in life.\n\nTL;DR: You're a wonderful person because you just are, but also a total piece of trash for not wanting to read 7 measley paragraphs.\n\n
8	Just wrote something extremely similar in my notes a couple of hours ago to get the frustration out. \n\nIf you figure it out, let me know man
9	Thank you, I needed this today. I needed to know someone else understood this feeling right now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish I had something helpful to say, but thank you for your honesty. Hopefully we both find an answer one of these days. 
7	I've been there.\n\nHonestly, the only thing that worked for me was realizing that I wasn't nearly as smart as I thought I was, and needed to work hard just like (or perhaps even more than) everybody else. So, I tried to do things honestly instead of exploiting every loophole I could possibly fathom, like I had doing for my entire life prior to that breaking point. It was a long and arduous process. It's still ongoing, tbh. But I didn't want to be a cautionary tale of wasted potential. \n\nObviously, you can choose to do what you like. I don't know about treating the system like a "game". I just set concrete, generally short-term goals that felt right for me and tried my best to achieve them. (Yes, this included reaching a certain salary.) I focused hard on developing my professional skills. In terms of searching for "meaning", I tried to be less selfish. I made efforts to be kinder to the people around me and provide help when asked. I volunteered.\n\nAnything worth doing is going to be hard, tbh. Doesn't matter whether you're an investment banker or a writer or a self-employed florist. You can't out-run it. You also won't get everything you want at once. I run into so many people who lose their shit because the first they they ever really do in the "real world" doesn't work out. The ones who own up to their own shortcomings and mistakes, rather than blame the system or society for their failures, are the ones who make it out five years down the line.

Maybe give a read of 'mastery' by Robert Greene and '4 hour work week'.\n\nHelped me find a short term goal which can atleast resonate for a week to do something rather than brood over and get 20 kill pubg games.\n\nAnd fuck you too.\n\nCheers

Those are pretty much the only paths a lot of people recognize in our society, but there's more stuff that you can do since those are mostly kinda dumb and won't be fulfilling. \n\n\nIt's not how this stuff is usually presented, but we have a pretty cool opportunity right now in that we're alive in what is almost certainly the most important decision-making period in human history. Like, this is the first time where we (as a species) really have full influence over the entire planet, we're kinda at a threshold in a lot of areas- land use, resource consumption, population growth, biodiversity loss, and obviously the big ones like global warming that everyone talks about.\n\n\nBut basically these are big, fixable problems... and we get to decide if we're gonna solve em or not. I mean we're literally the tip of the spear, basically everything in human history has build up to this, like have access to all the shit Aristotle discovered and Newton and the fukin Romans and Einstein... and we're the gen that gets to use those tools to decide what the future is our species. Like the planet is gonna be fine... the worst-case scenario is something that has already happened 5 times, but it's literally about our own species.\n\n\n\nSO ya, rah rah bullshit, but it's honestly pretty dope and there's a lot you can do that's gonna have real, tangible impacts on the near and far future. So just find some shit you kinda dig (product design? fishing? energy development? alternative ag to stop deforestation? who cares), and just figure out how to make it better and change the way the world works. It's kinda like candy for an ENTP if you like figuring shit out and beating problems that actually matter and arent some dumbass societal construct
4	Dude, relax. Sure life doesn’t mean much we’re gonna die at the end. But you don’t know what the fuck happens after your die. For all we know it’s just nothing. So you might as well make your the most out of life and do something that betters yourself or helps other people or both. Don’t become useless 
4	As an INTP I can say this much. My favorite decision to make is deciding not to decide. You're 19. You have all the time in the world. Decide your future one step at a time, not in it's entirety. 
3	You need a meaningful long-term goal and a short-term goal.
4	Fuck you, I didn't read it. My advice is to pick a career you think is fun and have some kind of natural aptitude for and just force yourself to stick to it. Worked for me and I'm a professional designer. Have fun!
2	This is literally me rn lmao
2	Fuck, I didn't expect this. Massive thanks to everyone, genuinely made my day.
2	Existential crisis, how typically ENTP. Haha. I go through one almost once every month.😂 \n\nAnyways, coincidentally or not - I’m doing the exact same thing with my life which you and another person here mentioned. Playing the game and making enough money, most of which is going to go into my savings so that I have just enough to sustain me and I can spend almost half or at least one quarter of my life pursuing creative endeavours, maybe I’ll be a freelance writer or I’ll open my own restaurant? Both are options at this point. One thing I’ll mention though, I’m also pretty good at what I do currently and I like it enough. I don’t hate or resent my current profession. I think liking your money-making job (lol) is pretty important even though personally I could not care less about the so called prestige or honour associated with it. That shit just makes my skin crawl.🙄\n\nSo definitely, play the game but make sure that you are not blasé about what you do right now and definitely hone your skills. Complacency will not get you anywhere. At the same time, continue practicing whatever your other talent or creative passion is. If it is writing, try and write almost everyday. If it is music related, practice that almost everyday. Don’t become complacent because I have learned in a painful way that even if you have a natural aptitude or talent for something, you can quickly fall behind and become mediocre if you don’t practice often!! \n\nDefinitely weigh your options and decide. For example, if I had super wealthy parents who would leave me tons of money & inheritance, I would not bother with getting into a profession purely to earn enough money for my early retirement plan, lol! Unless I was absolutely passionate about it - then that’s a different matter. So I would just keep trying everything to see what makes me happy! But if that’s not you, then you have to make a different contingency plan. \n\nI don’t see why the world shames the wealthy who are leisurely - I mean why would they grind their loins everyday to make money when they already have enough to last a lifetime? Me thinks it’s just another way to get more people to become economic slaves so half their pay checks can also be taxed, lol. I mean when your fore fathers have worked so hard at establishing themselves and making their fortune, someone should be there to enjoy the fruits of their labour right?😜 Anyways, I digress. \n\nTL;DR (since everyone’s doing it) - Either play the game and earn enough money for an early retirement plan OR if you have the resources already, go after your passion and never look back!
2	ENTPs are one of the hardest groups to put through institutionalized learning - personal opinion, of course.  \n\n\nENTPs are prone to entrepreneurial ventures. It's just better suited to who we are and does not require a standardized measure of 'did you learn this thing that isn't relevant to your job?'. About your age, I decided that I wanted to do landscape design and open a company doing that. A year later, I was horribly mangled by an inattentive motorist, so that never happened and it took me another 5 years to figure out what I wanted to do instead. Then, I allowed anxiety and life excuses to let it take almost 10 more years to take serious steps toward starting a business.  \n\n\nIn hindsight, I recommend that you look 'up' from your current situation and try to see where you want to go in life. What's fun for you? What do you want in your life in general? What would you enjoy enough to actually work at succeeding? Does it mean enough to you to sacrifice from time to time to make it happen? Is it worth enough to work hard even tho you're not used to that right now? As an older-than-you ENTP, my advice is to get a really clear vision of what you truly want your life to be like later and take active steps to get there. It's your life and other people don't have to approve of your choices. You're the only one who has to live with where you are in 20 years - and maybe your spouse and kiddos if you have them.  \n\n\nAfterthought: isn't it interesting how both my generation and yours are called 'millennial'? \*insert obligatory eye-roll regarding condescending attitudes about generations of people/agism\*
2	Don't know how much you want to hear from a more "seasoned" ENTP (ENTP 8w7sx 35f, mom to 4 kids, married, etc), but perhaps perspective won't hurt.\n\nAt any point in time, you are exactly who you are \*in that moment\*, but you are ALSO yourself where you were a year ago, 5 years ago, 10 minutes ago, etc.  You are all of those "selves" and all of the memories and experiences that come along with it.  So INSTEAD of wallowing in your ENTP need to see all the possibilities and play out all endings, which, let's be honest, can be exhausting and devastatingly overwhelming, driving you into procrastination and need for constantly changing stimuli - you know, to drown it all out - TRY to stand still in the moment.  What got you HERE?  Because what got you into it is likely NOT the best way to get out of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA healthy ENTP develops their other functions.  It's unlikely that "deciding what you really want" and setting that "goal" is going to make you happy. We (ENTPs) get distracted, we need variety, we don't like to conform to a timeline, we work in fits and bursts of energy.  You'll feel angsty and disappointed if you set goals and then don't like the constant grind of getting there or realize that the goal is no longer of interest.  Sometimes the goal loses interest BECAUSE of the work to get there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead, invest in small changes.  Learn self discipline even if you have to start by making it "a game you can beat".  Approach tasks that you are procrastinating on by identifying FIRST the greatest area of need that can be impacted or corrected the fastest.  Instead of focusing on the minutia of things or of ALL the things at once, do the 3 easiest, fastest, and most impactful.  That can give you enough momentum to get out of a rut.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're in Uni worrying about what to do with your life and you're looking top-down, as a whole, trying to sort and chart a path while under duress and it's stressing you out, making you feel like you're lost when you're not.  What are the 3 things you're failing at RIGHT NOW that could help you get out of the rut if you correct them?  Think actual things (finishing a paper, cleaning up your space, reconnecting with someone you care about that you've ostracized with your unfeeling bluntness, etc) not theoretical (procrastination, laziness, social manipulation).  Do them as quickly and efficiently as you can, even if it's outside your comfort zone.  Do it like ripping off a band-aid.  Skip a night out and buckle the fuck down and do your paper.  You'll feel better when it's done.  Set a timer on your phone and clean it 5-minute intervals - it forces you to tackle the most obvious space offenders first.  You'll feel better when it's done.  Text that person:  tell them you care and you value them.  You'll feel better when it's done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL, DR:  Do the small shit that's holding you back and giving you anxiety.  It's not as big a problem as you think, and you'll feel better when you're back in a state of movement.\n\n&#x200B;
1	What really worked for me was to take time away from everything and spend time in introspective thought to figure out who you want to be and what your day to day life would look like.\n\n\nSo I went from an alcoholic partying sales and entrepreneur guy who drank copious amounts of alcohol and basically chased pleasure and instant gratification to quitting all my vices(cigs, drugs, meat, coffee, alcohol, cigars, etc) and taking an interest in gardening, food processing, fermentation, health, and many more business ideas I am working on.\n\n\nI went down a path of changing everything in my life and it was hard ass work. I even disengaged myself from my manipulative family and was homeless for 8 months while figuring out what was important to me.\n\nNow I'm back with a fire I cant explain... everyday I build my business structure and marketing structures in my head while I picture how my day to day life would look like. What type of people I want in my life.\n\nFor context... I make my bed every morning ever since I got my goals on lock. I used to make my bed MAYBE once a year... usually during spring cleaning lol.\n\n\nI feel more and more like a fully developed entp and I am grateful for all the hardships I endured that made me who I am.\n\n\nAlso my joke was that I was going through a midlife crisis and people would correct me by saying quarter life to which I would reply "omg no one told me you can have more than one quarterlife crisis how many more do I got?" :p\n\nGoodluck
1	Hi, do you like planners? Digital or paper ones. You can always put stickers on it to make it more familiar. xD It helps through tasks, goals. You can travel and produce stories to contests on the meanwhiles, but is good to pick a solid ground finishing your uni as it's very competitive nowadays. I find that to pray to God is helpful to keep going.
1	The thing you said about society is fucking true, man. When I went out into the world because of circumstance...\n\n(like I guess that's how it works, you are born, abandoned, and left to figure this life shit out for yourself. What a life, eh? I still think people shouldn't have kids, because why would you create a life just to subject them to this bullshit?)\n\n...I seriously thought everyone and everything these idiots invented was fucking stupid. The quality of life was much lower, dirty, and basic than I imagined. Later on when I found out what these fuckers really think about things, what goes through their minds, their logic, I was just fucking dumbfounded. I am constantly shocked at people's stupidity, meme culture, and the issues the world values as important. Like really? Jesus Christ, are you all stupid? I mean, evidently.\n\nBut ok, I'm 26 and I've been doing this dumb life shit for a while, skipped college, because like everything else I thought it was stupid, and I just could not bring myself to do it. I still think it's stupid, and I just can't bring myself to conform to that crap. I'm pretty behind in life though, and that kinda feels bad, but at the same time I don't care.\n\nI recently figure this shit is normal, because of the hero's journey that's basically built in our unconscious. Now I'm just trying to take it one step at a time, because I can't be like this forever. Gotta move on in life a bit. Like I guess life beats you down enough where you'll wanna change. That's the death/rebirth in the hero's journey. Very normal. You have to go through the hell, everyone does, to change. \n\nAnd I'm more or less over the everything sucks thing. Like they say, it's you that sucks, not everything else (you'll come to this realization at some point, even though objectively other things suck too), but the point is, life won't hand you anything, even though you're smart, you just have to do the same shit as everyone else does, but the best part is you'll probably do it better, with more tact, and be kind of a revolutionary in whatever you do, and that's pretty cool in itself. Don't mind the drones if you decide to go through with school, I guess. Show them on paper you're smarter than them. That's pretty cool. If you don't, you'll be stuck with a crappy job that won't be able to afford you anything important when you're older, even though you don't care now, you'll care more and more as life brings you down.\n\nAnd things only seem stupid because you have so much knowledge to give to the world, and that's a gift and realization you'll come to at some point. Your mind is way ahead of its time, so you can change a lot, but first you have to be brought down to their level, because that's where the change happens.\n\nSo yeah, life sucks but you gotta do it basically. There's literally no other choice. You can waste time for a bit, if you want, refusing the "call to action," but eventually you'll want to and have to. You can do it at whatever pace you want to though. ENTPs and some other types, take a longer time to mature and figure this all out, but at the end they come out doing everything in pretty much the best way possible. 
1	Here's what I think man. I don't know if this helps but many times we grow up and believe we are going to do something grand or become something grand. When it doesn't work out to that expectation like we all seem to be programmed to believe as a child we slip into a crisis of "Are we failing as people?!"\n\nNow I knew that a lot of things like this were bs when I was about 17 (I'm 23 now for reference.) and the advice I have right now that has worked for me up to now is to dial back your expectations. Rather than having something grand that you have to do or experience like having a soul-mate, being a successful businessman, travelling the world, etc. What ever it is that you personally believed growing up, instead think about the little things that you get to do and appreciate those. \n\nAs stupid as it sounds, for me it seems to work. Having fun with friends, making them laugh, getting to go on drives, jamming out to music, and other little things like that are really what make me happy. I don't have this urge to get married and have kids the same way everyone else does, or to go to college, or to be an astronaut, those big grand adventures. Instead I enjoy life for what it is.\n\nAnd not to push any religion or spiritual beliefs, but I personally believe the universe puts you wherever you need to be at any given time for what you need to do or experience as part of a bigger picture. Many times I have noticed that lessons are to be learned everywhere as long as we are looking for them. Something that happened before helps make you who you are now and lead you to this moment. 
1	Stay curious. You cannot know if the universe is objectively meaningless or meaningful. \n\nIf it's "meaningless" (whatever that means) objectively, at our scale it's all that means anything. You're feeling every bit of it, and so are the people around you. It's our job to quest for happiness and purpose and to try and help other people do the same.\n\nYou don't have to go full "rat race", "starving artist", or totally "drop out". But everyone is playing chess with the universe whether they realize it or not.\n\nYou want to productively explore. Start and finish a project. Write down what you learn. If you can, try and gain resources during the process so the next goal is easier to achieve. And then start another project and finish that one too. Eventually you'll end up with enough stuff so you can change the rules of the game (hopefully benignly) to make it more *whatever you want*.
1	Used to be like this mate and it takes a Fucking long time to get out of it if you don't do it right.\n\nStudy,  make something of yourself busy Arse and Save,  get a house or 2 while working and then say fuck it all.  Build a life for post 30-40. I'm almost 30 now and I've realised my lack of motivation has put me massively behind the 8 ball.  I've got 2 kids a fucked hand and no savings to fall back on.  
1	21 ENTP female here! Went straight to a great four year college but i couldn’t decide what I want to major in. I began working full time as a manager and school got on the back burner. I’m currently taking a year off, I feel you on that quarter life crisis. I know i’m going to finish school though, I can’t not. 
1	Hey man I'm 23 had a quarter life crisis after dropping out of college.. my whole life changed . It took me a few years to get back on my feet again. Only now I've found out that you need one thing to get a head in life . Money. So I'm working towards doing something I like doing, driving . Haha . But yeah once I get the paychecks I get to do holidays, work done on my beauty(I like to maintain) and spend time on my girl. Something I never really had at ,19 I was a drug fucked homosexual.(ask)  but yeh.moral of the story is... Find something you want to do for the rest of your life and make money. Your whole quality of life will change. It's the real world now mate good luck
1	I was in this kind of predicament not too long ago. It really takes a lot of inward searching rather than looking at your environment. If there's something you love and has a lot of meaning to you think about it super hard. For me, I would notice that for some reason I always felt the need to go back to music or things based off of evoking emotion in people/making people happy. I thought everything was pointless, and honestly you're right; that is until you give yourself one. For me, I went back to music because there's somewhat of an emotional/euphoric connection I have that is unlike any other. It's always evolving so I could never get bored really and since it's an art you can never really be the best. There's always something to improve on. That, and how it's effected me in times of darkness makes me want to make those times a little bit more bearable with music for other people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: find meaning in your own life and do something you think is fulfilling. It's found in the constant things you do, then you use that thing and find a way to make a career around it.
1	I really got into philosophy when I was a similar age. Once it quelled my existential anxiety I stopped it.
0	Reticent to come off as giving a simple solution to a complex problem, several of the things you said made me think 'man, would be great if this kid read The Purpose Driven Life'. Some people find it trite and/or simplistic, and I get that, but me and like 100 million other people found it profound and helpful.\n\nA distant second suggestion might be to dive into Jordan Peterson videos for a couple a couple weeks. I like his videos more than I liked Twelves Rules for Life, but there's obviously lots of overlap. Anyway as an ENTP who really zeroed in on my sweet spot in terms of vocation/life purpose a decade ago, these are my friendly suggestions.
1	Since you were born after 1995, you are not a millennial, you are gen z. So that’s something to be pumped about
5	Have a favorite show? See how it fares over time.	
3	Community Season 4... yup, seems about right. \n\nhttps://www.ratingraph.com/serie/community-10858/
2	Interesting website,  but holy shit how annoying that the color of the trend line is the color of the previous series, at least in my browser.
1	Um, that’s really none of your business and how dare you for demanding I do that like what the fuck is wrong with you 
1	[https://www.ratingraph.com/assets/images/graphs/series/firefly\_episodes\_ratings\_graph-3621.png](https://www.ratingraph.com/assets/images/graphs/series/firefly_episodes_ratings_graph-3621.png)\n\nIt just made me sad.
1	The logo makes the website look like a scamming site or a porno scamming site 
3	Isfp dating an entp pleases help! I’m so lost and clueless when it come to entps	Okay so this is my first post on here so don’t judge me I don’t really know how this works, I’m a 25 year old female and he’s a 30 year old entp male we’ve been together for around 8 months and I feel like we get along well but our relationship is kind of shallow like we almost never open up about our feelings and things like that we just discuss things like we’re in a business meeting, I don’t know how I can take the relationship to another level emotionally I feel like after 8 months it’s still kind of shallow what do you guys think? 
9	Is he ticklish? If he is, then lightly grazing the soles of his feet with a feather could get him to really open up. Wear a hockey goalie mask in case he tries to donkey kick you in the face. Also, if you open up about your feelings first, he will probably respond better to that than if you are constantly on him to express his own feelings. I'm *serious* about the mask.
4	ENTPs don't think about "feelings" the same way you do.\n\nI (ENTP female) have feelings, but I believe they are secondary (if not irrelevant) to facts and what is practical. I will have an initial, gut-level reaction to something, but delay responding until I've processed and analyzed it. I make a point to not make decisions based on how I feel as, in my mind, feelings are unreliable and often inaccurate. Feelings are symptomatic of something, yes; they are guides to finding the underlying truth... but they are not THE truth. I prefer to deal in what is true.\n\nWhile you may perceive your relationship to be shallow, you're ENTP may not agree. If you're agreeing on belief systems and share a world view, that's likely depth your ENTP appreciates a lot. Any perspective that can be backed up by observation and repeatable results is valuable to us... while feelings and emotions that are not somehow vetted are simply frustrating.\n\nFind a way to articulate your feelings and why they're important to you. How and why do *you* talk about feelings? What is the end goal of sharing? Is there a purpose beyond just saying, "I feel this thing"? Is sharing your feelings meant to be productive in some way? I only share if I have a reason to; if I'm trying to accomplish something. I won't share how I feel if it causes unnecessary drama.\n\nI will say... my ex was ISFP. We're good friends now, but communication for us was really, really difficult as romantic partners. We definitely spoke different languages. I didn't understand MBTI then, which might've helped, but... I'm not sure we could've ever really aligned his FiSe with my NeTi. You guys are SO in your feels... both physical and emotional... and it is so, so hard to get in that headspace for us. Honestly, it's hard for me to even imagine. I am all abstract, detached thought... and struggle to be present, both mentally and physically, most of the time. To me, I have lots of depth... but it was rarely depth my ex ISFP appreciated, and vice versa.
2	ENTP\n\nFeelings\n\nPick one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe don't share them lightly.
4	First off, this is a conversation you should have with your SO not us. You should sit down and talk to him about it instead of asking a bunch of redditors who know nothing about your relationship. \n\nSecond, if you choose not to talk to him, why are you with him if you never got to know him more emotionally initially? It confuses me how people just stay together so long without know how the other person is deep down. \n\nI was the same way as your boyfriend with my previous partners. However my current girlfriend and I are very open with each other and do not hesitate to share how we feel and get to know each other on a much deeper level. Mostly because I don’t see myself with anyone but her in the future, so I figured it was worth it to show her my demons, my goals, my passions, what makes me happy etc.
1	> I don’t know how I can take the relationship to another level emotionally I feel like after 8 months it’s still kind of shallow what do you guys think?\n\nUh, my mom (ISFP) - which I'm not dating btw - also says the same thing about me or my ISTP grandad. That's how TPs appear in general, so uh - just try to figure out how he communicates, we're just not that expressive and vocal. 
1	Tell him about this post you wrote.
1	Be honest about how you feel and ask him for help.
1	Tell him what you want, if he doesn’t try to make an effort... move on. 
3	Musicians who are ENTPs	OK since Grammys was last night. Gonna be open this up in asking which Musicians you all think are ENTPs?
12	Or better yet, which Grammy stars are actually musicians
3	Bruce Dickinson, Matt Bellamy, and Ezra Koenig 
3	Ski mask the slump god
2	Les Claypool, Bruce Dickinson
1	Dave Mustaine may be ENTP but probably ESTP
1	I reckon Igorrr might be, just judging by his music.
1	Reggie Watts . Biggest ento on the planet
1	Rich Brian is the first that comes to mind for me,\n\nalso mellow fellow 
26	The insects are dying and nobody is panicking	How do you guys cope with the fact there is more and more signs that nature is dying around us? I find myself getting depressed about it..
18	I mean....have you not seen Mad Max?   Because I’ve seen Mad Max.  I’m ready.
6	Xeriscape and permaculture are really good places to start studying and practicing. Give the small thing a home and food source, and they do the rest provided we cut them pesticides down.\n\nI used to joke when I was a teen that when I grew up I was going to be a shit dealer. Sell shit, buy shit, make shit etc.\n\nAnd really, if you can tend mycelium in the ground (which loves shit and compost) and add some indigenous plant life, mother nature happily takes over.\n\n 
6	Well, you know, nothing actually matters. If all of society, all over the world, were to fall into chaos, well then maybe I wouldn’t be so bored. 
5	Biology Twitter is panicking. Sadly, unless major corporations make changes it’s likely unavoidable. However, there are many things you can do if you want to impact the world that way, particularly insects. Here are three simple ones:\n\n-reduce plastic and one time consumables\n\n-plant wildflowers, etc. some companies and organizations make mixes for bees and other insects and give them out for free. ((We get my fav humming bee / humming bird moth near my butterfly bush.)) \n\n-place an insect home in your yard. They can kind of look cool too but they have different burrow sizes etc. \n
2	Less bugs on my windshield and grille.\n\nSee, we ENTP's are rockstars when it comes to seeing a problem from different angles :) 
2	I routinely leave my yard unmowed most of the year. I mean, I get warnings from the city, but I trim it just a wee bit and we're good again. I plan to soon have a privacy fence so I can have a bee hive - our city outlawed them many years ago - and meanwhile am looking into a bee hotel for non-hiving bees.
4	It will never directly affect you nor can you do anything about it\n\nso dont worry about it
1	[deleted]
1	I love bugs. I think most people like them too, at least bees and dragonflies. But we already heard the news about losing insects so no reason to panic. As for emotional VS efficient you know how we are, humans: we won't change our set up unless forced to. Personally I feel like surviving in a state of crisis. I've gotten paralyzed by fears and can't hold onto anything anymore (values, habits, people, goals...)\n\nFrom a larger perspective climate variation is a problem only for us. Nature doesn't care about changes, Nature adapts. Plants and animals also will adapt. The order of reigns might shift a little but heh, Life will go on. The only thing we are fucking is our own actual fate. A bit of change could do good. I find the idea of chaos comforting.
1	I won‘t live long enough to see it coming to the *ultimate end*, so I don‘t care much. But it makes me sad and I feel like we should do sth about it, believe it or not I‘m contributing to a better planet even if I don‘t care so much I care enough to do something slightly different to be of some help which won‘t hurt me 
1	I really can't be bothered to care. Things die, new things pop up. Isn't that how it's always been? So what if x y and z creature go extinct? Won't evolution make new ones? \n\nI mean personally I don't think it will because I think speciation is mostly bullshit but I know most of you probably do, so I'll argue as if it's true. \n\nOn the flipside if you're religious, this whole planet is going to get wiped out and re-created in the most popular religions so again, who gives a shit?\n\nNo mater what system you subscribe to, there's a cycle. The top of the wheel will fall and become the bottom, then rise to the top again. 
1	We deserve it.
-1	Being worked up about bugs screams Feeler. Are you sure you're on the right board?
-1	I hate insects so I don't stress about it. And even if it means that nature is slowly dying then what? You can't tell me that you didn't expect that we,as humans, will be the end to this planet.
9	I see many people talk about more 'mental' stuff here, so let's mess things up a little-	Tell me more about your physical life! Do you go outdoors often? Can you dress yourself up well? Do you tend to not fit well into your clothes, like the [Socionics description](http://www.socionics.com/prof/entp.htm) says? Do you have a sports-oriented life?\n\nDo you have _aaaaamazing_ sex? Or are you very, very single?\n\n
8	My plan to post stuff ESFPs find boring is finally starting to show results...
11	Are you kidding? I wish this sub would be more focused on "mental" stuff.\n\n>Tell me more about your physical life! Do you go outdoors often?\n\nI try to take a walk once a day.\n\n> Can you dress yourself up well? \n\nYes.\n\n>Do you tend to not fit well into your clothes, like the [Socionics description](http://www.socionics.com/prof/entp.htm) says? \n\nWhy would a system that's supposed to describe cognition have anything to say about physical features?\n\n>Do you have a sports-oriented life?\n>\n\nLol no.\n\n>Do you have _aaaaamazing_ sex? Or are you very, very single?\n\n\nAccording to my dog I'm a sex god.\n>\n>\n\n
6	Why are people even downvoting lol 
4	I do not fit the socionics description at all, not sure how one’s cognitive functions relate to their physical appearance. I’m very active and go to the gym most days or do something sporty with friends. I dress well and try to get as much time outside as possible. \n\nSide note: I feel like the socionics description is just saying ENTPs are ugly \n\nEdit: I have great sex
1	\n> Tell me more about your physical life! Do you go outdoors often?\n\nOnly to mess things up in the city and to disturb people and break or burn stuff\n\n> Can you dress yourself up well?\n\nNo but my mom does it anyway\n\n> Do you tend to not fit well into your clothes, like the Socionics description says?\n\nActually my clothes fit into me\n\n> Do you have a sports-oriented life?\n\nI do martial arts to feel like an anime protagonist \n\n> Do you have aaaaamazing sex? Or are you very, very single?\n\nFSK 18+ cannot answer i‘m still 16\n
1	You guys are depressing me into laughter I swear. By no means am I someone who is passionate about the outdoors, but as I get older (27) me appreciation for nature and doing physical things has grown. I work out regularly to maintain my physique but only 3 times a week (that rhymed and I didn't intend it too). In the last year I've gotten into hiking and I make sure to enjoy a walk in the park when the weather gives me the chance. Yes, this sounds like a profile description on match.com but it has brought much needed balance to my mental life. I fucking hate running, but when I was jobless and on the search, running every other morning provided respite from my more toxic thoughts in that period. For me, it's a way of thinking without really thinking. Furthermore, it's amazing for you! We as ENTPs tend to value our mental faculties and ignore the physical ones. You ever hurt your back, research that shit, and stumble upon an actual solution? Or understand how your body responds to certain exercises or workout regiments? Not to mention the results! See, I let body knowledge become a hobby of mine and it's a net positive for my life as long as I don't over do it ;-) okay that's my sermon, thanks for having me, goodnight! 
1	I’m not outdoorsy at all. I really love fashion. I have a lot of fun putting outfits together because I’ve got an artistic eye. My clothes fit very well I think. I don’t do sports, but I do a fair bit of dancing on the weekends. And I’m very single haha
1	I put on some weight (college stress), but I'm mostly okay with my image. I finally styled my hair how I've been wanting it, and I really want to change up my aesthetic.   I can dress really nicely, and I enjoy make-up ( I consider it my armor).   I dress appropriately for the situation. Current aesthetic college student or classic, but I'm working to be more athletic, and a tad more androgynous..\n\nIt's winter so I'm not super active outside except going to class, but when I have energy I like to dance.
40	i'm sick and tired of mbti/socionics and the rest of pseudosciences	besides the obvious mistyping and other unrelated labels everyone tries to apply to themselves to feel less insecure, im more sick of this fandom mob like mentality that this community has become. it's all the "we" this and "we" that all the damn time like some sort of super hivemind roleplaying server, it makes it sound like instead of being yourself you just applied personality tag and now pushing your own bullshit to everyone else with the 'we x type do x and y' type bullshit and justifying your own miserable life instead of fixing it. it reminds of these kids who tries to find non-existent psychology traits or self-diagnose with some edgy disorder and shove them everywhere. and now people even try to date based on this flawed system that's just baffles me that someone is willing to tie their life with someone based on some stupid letters combinations, it become horoscope for hipsters with iamverysmart vibe, nothing more
51	I'm not a fan of NBA basketball,  so i didn't subscribe to the NBA subreddit.
34	This reeks of “hey guys, I’m deleting my Facebook at the end of the week! .... don’t try to stop me. I’m way too cool for social media and I’m going to go r/outside and do real stuff with real people! You know how to reach me if you want to actually hang out.” .....Ok guy. 
66	You probably take these tests too seriously and blame others for your own obsession towards them
21	I agree some people take MBTI way too seriously, but who cares? You’re on the Internet. You can choose who you engage with. Stick to the posts that appeal to you or just leave, if you’re really that tired of MBTI. 
7	Sounds like you need to grab some pitch forks and go burn something in the company of like-minded individuals! \nFlame on m8!
16	Maybe unsubscribe?
7	No, you're sick and tired of people using these things as scapegoats for their faults. You know what? I really dislike that as well. And it's something I see a lot in mbti communities. However, that is not to say that studying cognitive functions has no potential for personal benefit.\n\nI see where you're coming from, and I want you to know that there are many people who think similarly who were able to use their knowledge of cognitive functions to better themselves.\n\nThank you for posting this. 
5	I partly agree, but on the other hand : "just letter combination" that's not what this is? If we do agree with theory (emphasis on a word "theory" as it's not proven) that people actually do use those cognitive functions, then letters only represent how your brain is wired, and that's why some people take it into account while dating - because they want to find someone whose mind is wired in the way that suits them.\n\nBut from a bit different point of view - even if every person were born with those inborn traits then life experiences, surroundings, interests etc. shape individual, and that's what you get when you're dating someone.
4	This is a more poorly expressed version of an opinion that's existed for as long as the mbti community. You're definitely trying to be the third party voice of reason, floating above it all with a superior perspective. The fact that you're not remotely insightful ironically makes it seem like you're the one "roleplaying". What's more is that this is a really easy target to begin with. You have the tone of someone saying something controversial, but the content really isn't. No one is going to defend mbti with much energy, they don't assent to it that deeply and they generally don't really care. You're roasting nothing and no one. I'm glad you made the clearly deliberate decision of not capitalizing letters and fragmenting your sentences as to seem more casual and uncaring, because if you had made any attempt to sound intelligent you would have fallen on your face.
4	I would love to know what you planned to achieve with this post.
3	You’re getting downvoted but I agree so hard. People put WAY too much value in this stuff. Ironic, since ENTPs are supposedly more intellectual than a lot of other groups, but I’d find it hard to take someone seriously as an adult if they made fucking internet posts about “ENTP dating a ISTJ with Te/XyZ4 tendencies help plz”. People genuinely apply an MBTI-tinted pair of glasses to every aspect of their life and it’s sad. You’re lying to yourself if you see 40% of the posts in this sub and don’t just see an angsts teenager basically saying “ugh why doesn’t the world understand our wittiness?” There’s a reason that this stuff isn’t that highly regarded amongst actual scientists.\n\nYes, this stuff is more evidence-based than astrology, and there is some value in some of the stuff in these subs, but by-and-large it’s people exhibiting the same craving for some contrived self-understanding that makes others read their horoscopes in the morning.
3	I get where you're coming from. But as far as the language when discussing types... how would you like us to speak?\n\nInstead of 'The ENTP is a dick' we say 'the ENTP tends to be a dick'?\n\n\nSeems like semantics to me
5	Then don't read it?
2	Just ignore lol. Why bother spending any energy on low effort stuff. If you're bother by it and following it then you're just feeding your negativity loop.\n\nWho cares. They're always gonna be there since newbies love that type of stuff.
2	This actually doesn't happen in the Socionics community so much, just saying. I blame 16personalities.
6	>it's all the "we" this and "we" that all the damn time\n\nBingo. It's usually "as an ENTP.." "fellow ENTPs.." "I'm an ENTP and..." then followed by a spiel of FP garbage. This way, when you call out that their post/comment is FP-esque you get slapped with "I said I'm an ENTP" "I didn't ask for function analysis" "what I can't prefer FP-trait without being FP?"\n\nIt's bullshit copout by the FP types who treat this like Google/group therapy. Then when you point out that this is a common theme, you get slapped with idiotic comments like \n\n>You probably take these tests too seriously and blame others for your own obsession towards them\n\nWhich is textbook projection. Because by pointing out that users are attaching their identity too much to MBTI somehow you're the one with am obsession over it, and are taking it too seriously. Lol. Because calling out shit like Si-grip, or dating by type is dating MBTI too seriously. 
2	Feelers be feelers.
1	MBTI was meant to be nothing more than used for fundamentals. So in that regards I agree with you whole-heartedly. 
1	You're right. Some people need to focus more on being individuals than letting 4 letters define them. Not everyone is like that, but enough for OP to be validated in his frustration. 
1	That's definitely what it's been reduced to, especially on reddit. Few know enough to have an intelligent, informed opinion on mbti without resorting to shit like "fellow INTJs, have you ever cried?" \n(bonus intj answer: no, my preferred method of drawing attention as a baby was meowing. I could speak cat by 4m old) 
1	Sweet opinion bro
1	You need to find your own identity.  \n\nI am not going to let you discredit or inbalidate what I habe discobered.\n\nYou are shit out of luck if you expect me to help you if you are going to be like "OMFG YOU GUIYS ARE IDIOTS AND YOU DONT SEE THINGS AS CLEAR AS ME AND YOU ARE STUPID."\n\nhAHAHAHAHAHAHA
1	When this popped up on my notifications I didn't dare dream it would be so beautifully cringey.
1	I got uuuu bro  \n  \nThis guy ties brain scans to MBTI  \n  \nhttps://youtu.be/MGfhQTbcqmA  \n  \nLeave the horoscope theory-abyss!\n
1	Yes fuck mbti! Fuck everything.
1	MBTI: providing a personality to latch on to, for people who don't have one since it became popular on the internet. 
1	Then unsubscribe, this kind of attitude won’t be missed
-1	We can always burn the fucking place down and build a new one. This place is sexy, from the Aesthetics and Azdahak's rhetoric, but if it ain't rolling, then it ain't rolling and I'm tired of all the F jizz here all the time for past several years. \n\nThe only babe that can rape me is mother nature and if you have a problem with that, write a sad poem that inspires a world war. I just DGAF.
10	INFJ (F) interested in an ENTP (M). What do I need to know?	I've read soooo many posts in both subs about communication being key, but noticed that in INFJ subs people tend to glorify this partnership whereas in ENTP they seem sick of us. Does it really work well if you're both mature and looking to grow and be challenged? Thoughts? Thanks!
13	My wife and I have been married for ten years, despite a lot of things being stacked against our relationship (age gap, being apart for two full years while I was in Iraq, ect.)  \n\nI think one thing INFJs tend to really appreciate about ENTPs is our willingness to change if you present us with a good argument for doing so.  Many other types are very stuck in their ways, but an ENTP does tend to become a better partner the longer a relationship goes on, at least with what I've been able to observe.  \n\nMy wife would probably tell you that she appreciates my ability to just "get" her without having to explain everything in such vivid detail.  We still spend hours every day talking politics in front of the T.V. or watching documentaries with each other.  Whenever we have time off together, we find something fun to do, and I really mean it when I say we never run out of things to talk about.  \n\nIn social situations, I get to soak up all the attention (that she doesn't even want) and she can find one person to sit with and have a good conversation.  She knows that above all else, I will defend her, and that I place nobody else above her, family or friends.  Oh, and if people need advice, EVERYONE comes to us.  We're great at that when we put our heads together.\n\nBelieve it or not, in my experience, I have found that once an ENTP commits to someone, they are among the most loyal friends/partners you can have.  My wife and I spend zero amount of time worrying about betrayal.  \n\nNow, that doesn't mean our relationship is perfect.  She would tell you that she's sick of having to tell me how long to microwave something, and that she wishes I would be able to find things without running around the place yelling questions to her.  I can be really bad at some of the more domestic things, but again, with time I have improved.  She would also say that sometimes I can be too cold when it comes to dealing with other's emotions, and that it upsets her.  Not necessarily to her, because I have this inexplicable soft spot that won't allow me to hurt her emotionally, at least on purpose.  \n\nMy main complaint would be that she needs to communicate problems to me earlier.  She has this tendency to let things bubble under the surface until she just bursts into tears, or starts slamming dishes around in the kitchen.  We don't fight very often at all, and rarely raise our voices to each other, but I think a lot of this could be completely avoided if she would just make herself more emotionally available earlier.  She seems to think it's her job to keep the peace even if it's hurting her inside.  \n\nSo I'd say give it a shot.  There are a lot more factors that go into compatibility than just purely personality type, but I wouldn't trade my INFJ for anything. \n\n
9	So.. I just got dumbed by my INFJ girlfriend of 3+ years... So... I don't know how relevant this is.  I don't think I  grew tired of her.. I think I was considerably emotionally intimate with her, she made me feel like It was okay to give my emotions influence over my thoughts and decisions. \n\nI would often hurt her when I would spoke my mind about issues that I thought were just theoretical, or inconsequential. Things that she would mention in passing, and not in a setting that seemed to necessitiate tactful thought.  (two real example questions that have happened to me were, who is better at sex? (Which I know is just a shit show of a question) and what would you do if I joined the peace Corps for 2-10 years.) It is never my intention to hurt someone when they ask me for my honest opinion, but truth and concise expression take priority when answering questions under normal circumstances.\n\nAbsolutely cannot tell you more to TELL US when we say/do something that you do not like, absolutely anything that makes your heart feel ugly TELL US. use correct communication techniques (when you do ____ I feel ____. Could you do _____ instead?) Do not silently compromise in order to spare our feelings, I promise any feelings that you hurt will grow back.  Chances are if we care about you we won't want to do that thing again. \n\nNothing may be as obvious to you as it is to us when it comes to correct behavior, or thought process. We are similar in many ways but this is not one of those ways. \n\nDo not tell us something you don't mean/ answer our questions honestly. (would you like some help with this? What do you want to do for your birthday? What's on your mind? Would you mind if I did this?) \n\nHelp me be a better terrible human bean... \n
8	\[F ENTP\] No BS- just be up front about everything. 
12	You both would need to be pretty emotionally mature, imo. The INFJ would need to be very respectful of the ENTP's boundaries, and the ENTP would need to be very in touch with his emotions. From what I've seen on here, INFJs get frustrated with ENTPs' lack of emotional openness, and ENTPs get frustrated with INFJs' insistence on emotional intimacy beyond what the ENTP is comfortable with.
7	I think the biggest challenge for INFJs is to resist the temptation to read into all the emotional holes they see in ENTPs.  While INFJs don’t usually read in motivations like Fi types, they can be pretty obtuse when they “just know” something is wrong or there is more to the story.  A lot of times, there is no more to the story and your Ni is just making shit up out of the noise. ENTPs are generally pretty open emotionally...far more so than INFJs for sure.  But ENTPs don’t have this vast emotional depth.  There’s really not much to plumb or to figure out — it’s mostly WYSIWYG with ENTPs \n\nI think INFJs can also be attracted to ENTP charisma like a moth to flame. They see a certain *confidence* in the ways ENTPs put themselves out there.  But that doesn’t really stem from confidence as much as it stems from not really caring if their idea is wrong.  The other side of that is that entps also don’t really care about *your* feelings when they tell you you’re wrong...so they will cut you short because you’re struggling to explain yourself and they’ve already intuited where you’re going and want to get to the 5 other ancillary points they’ve thought of waiting for you to stop speaking.  \n\nThat said, worrying about if you have an mbti “match” is really just stupid in my opinion.  And two mature reasonable people can make a relationship work and there are so many other factors far more important than personality that both make and break relationships.\n\nUse mbti to understand your partners perspective on things.  It can give you a framework to use to put yourself into another’s mindset — one you wouldn’t naturally adopt yourself.   It can be a helpful tool for helping you to understand someone else’s point of view, especially when you disagree with them.\n\nUsing it for anything else is like expecting the treasure map on the back of a Cap’n Crunch box to lead you to gold in your backyard.  I mean, I’ve *heard* of kids doing that.  *cough*\n\n
2	We are messy as fuck, get used to it
2	Make sure you actions match your words and we see it, or you will be another INFJoke, well as far I'm concerned.. I really don't want to trick myself into idealizing and expecting to fix another INFJ. Ni doesn't change apparently, as much as it longs for the potential perfection in everything. If you don't know who you are yet, don't expect a ENTP to self actualize you and cater to your needs of growth, if only >.< ... hah
1	Marry me?
1	Prepare to be challenged!
1	I need alone time everyday. Usually about an hour to unwind and think. I might YouTube, read, game, etc. But I need to do it alone. Even if I am chatting up people on Skype/discord or typing responses in a forum post.\n\nI expect honest, upfront communication from a partner. The rest of the world can lie or hold things in. My partner needs to be open and honest. I lose a bit of respect for a partner who won't express themselves.\n\nFinally, expect a few bumps in the road when trying out a new solution to resolve a problem we are having. You may have to remind me of a commitment but the acknowledgement that I have also been trying should be considered.

I find most relationship things and what not can stem back to the Enneagram, so just curious of any possible connections because I find it to be duper super cool. But yeah, was it a test, or the description fit you? I'm familiar with an ENTP 3w4 but was unaware of a 3w2.\n\n&#x200B;

52	Typical INFJ post about the big bad scary ENTP	  \nThis ENTP at work intimidates me. Scares me even. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a person who’s very reserved and shy. I’ve been told I’m really hard to get to know because I rarely divulge anything of a personal nature, or a strong opinion. I basically just try to blend in and don’t evoke strong emotions from people. The end result is having good rapport with everyone has caused me to be extremely well liked at work.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI’ve never realized just how much I turn on the charm as a defense mechanism until this ENTP made me aware. He just gave me a look. Just one look to basically indicate he could smell how fake and inauthentic I am. Now when men are talking to me and the ENTP sees us in conversation, I get the same look… like disgust, as if he thinks I am manipulating all these people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe truth is, being a people-pleaser is second nature to me, it’s almost become a coping mechanism. Because if people are pleased, then I can go skip the anxiety and skip losing sleep over why they are upset, or whether I should have done that or not. Believe me if i could grow some balls and just give everyone the finger (and live with myself after) I probably would have done that now. But being in conflict with anyone tears me apart and this is the easiest way I’ve known how to deal with it.\n\n \n\nRecently I organized a get together for people after work. I personally invited this ENTP, despite feeling so anxious stepping into his space, our interactions have always, always been awkward. I held out an olive branch, so to speak. ENTP’s response? A very direct “NO.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI honestly don’t think anyone has ever said NO to me in such a direct fashion before, believe it or not. Kind of took me aback.  It feels as if I've suddenly been laid transparent. Like this person has seen me and my motivations and pronounced me not worth the time. And to be honest, it has made me upset. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do probably come off as selfish and inauthentic to a lot of people, it's just the ENTP who's made me aware of it. So I guess the bright side of it is... it's causing me to think about my interactions from here on out. To be more authentic to myself. To figure out my motivations on why I say what I say or do what I do. And it's caused me to also observe this man more. He is not very well liked. In fact, people can't stand him at work. But he doesn't seem the least bit affected by it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWere I more brave I would ask him for tips on how to just not give a fuck and be happy with yourself and standing your ground instead of striving to be more agreeable. But now I'm also stuck in this negative (and you could probably say, overly dramatic) thinking of, "the person who possibly can see your real self didn't like what he saw in there."\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Signed, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAn INFJ
106	> "the person who possibly can see your real self didn't like what he saw in there."\n\nWow, I wouldn't frame it that way. Here's how I would phrase it:\n\n> "the person who possibly can see your real self didn't like that you're hiding it."
38	Idk, I really wouldn't put too much stock into what this ENTP thinks. I get it; I have a love/hate relationship with INFJs. I tend to see you guys as a little fawning over authority, but that's because I'm a bit rabble-rousing at heart. There's a fundamental disconnect wrt our types insofar as we (as ENTPs) would prefer to disrupt the system in favour of making something better. With INFJs, I *know* they see the same problems I do - they're just usually not shit-stirrers and would prefer to keep the status quo. That tends to annoy me at times, but I don't dislike you guys. \n\nI will note, though, that INFJs are also one of the most approval-seeking types, which tends to frustrate ENTPs. In my mind, the person *everyone* has to answer to at the end of the day is themselves. If you're happy with who you are, then who gives a fuck what I think. [NB: There are also problems with this approach, I do acknowledge. However, a better topic for another time.] \n\nThe fact that you're so bothered by this ENTP's opinion of you indicates you're probably not so happy with yourself, and (subconsciously) think he holds the key to unlocking your self-actualization, or whatever. I can tell you now; you'll be running a fool's errand if you make his approval your benchmark. 
37	INFJ: omg he's looking right into my soul!!\n\nENTP: vacantly staring, thinking about everything except the INFJ. 
17	Behold! You have encountered the Ultra Mega Super Extra Supreme Assended Being ! \nThe very existence you hold so dear has been shattered instantly! The strong facade you built subconsciously has fallen into a deep sleep...\nThe anxiety and pressure of reality closes in as the reality shifts, you begin to realize your situation in the universe was not as you concluded! \n-To Be Continued!\n
36	Honestly as an ENTP, I do sense fakeness from people pretty fast. To me it’s more of a warning sign, that something isn’t quite right and I’m a lot more wary. That may come off as a look, since I can’t hide my emotions no matter how hard I try. (Trust me I don’t like having people either love me or hate me at work but I can’t help it). \n\nA lot of it is a curiosity of what you’re hiding in there than I see what’s in there and I don’t like it. More of a “why are they hiding something and can it be potentially harmful?”
10	IDK why but this doesnt sound super ENTP to me; the part where he can see through INFJs bs/or mask is very accurate but I havent encountered ENTPs being very judgy in that regard. If we were to compare the master of tricking and charm I think by far and beyond ENTPs are better than INFJs.\n\nI know how it feels from your perspectiev though; I was not so concious of it until I interacted with INTJs myself; its the Fe that takes over. 
6	I’m an ENTP and though I don’t think about when I’m doing it, I 100% recongnize the look he is giving you. It’s not that I ”see the inner personality of someone and don’t like it”, it’s more a typical Ne-curiosity thing, like ”what are you hiding in there and WHY are you hiding it”.\n\nEdit: Don’t feel scared of this guy, he means you no harm. He is probably drawn towards people like you, people who form large scale social bonds and so on
7	I would be blunt and direct right back at the ENTP. Be like "You're tearing me apart"\n\nTbh, I bluntly say no all the time. I'm a people pleaser, but I'm not fake about it. If I'm tryna make someone feel better, it's cause I want to. If they're rude or awkward or just plain hurtful, I'll say it. Maybe that makes me weird, but for the most part, people are respectful of it. Granted, I will  try to 'eloquently' word it to cause the least amount of offense. 
7	Sound like you just have to own up who you are. If all it takes is a look to make you realize that you’re not hiding very well, then you either try harder so that even their look can’t catch you off guard, or just own it and adapt to a new social behavior that you weren’t prepared for.\n\n
5	Everything is a mirror, regardless of type. 
15	Authentic or Inauthentic.. still yet to meet a mentally/emotionally stable INFJ.. well maybe theres one, but shes in her 60’s.  We see through you like a snowglobe.. those snow flakes and pretty picture isn’t real. This is coming from a crazy yet sane person mind you :) 
8	So when are you two gonna fuck?
7	That doesn't sound like an ENTP at all. What makes you classify him as ENTP?
3	I can sniff fake people a mile away. Don’t want anything to do with you if I can tell you’re hiding, sorry. It’s okay to be disliked. My question is why do you even give a shit what he thinks in the first place?
4	I'm an ENTP and a lot of my favorite people are INFJs. We're usually a pretty popular pairing. I imagine this person just doesn't like that they see you as fake. I know INFJs aren't known for letting it all hang out, but you may want to let your guard down a little. Personally, I value authenticity and admire people who I think are more their true selves. And I get shit for being direct too... But what else would I do. 
2	At first glance, this seems like a Wattpad story
2	Hahaha!  I've *given* that look before.  Good for him.  Sounds like you've found someone who won't let you hide.  The way to him?  Take off the mask.
2	Idk if you approached me from a place of vulnerability and told me this...I'd probably be a little confused at first like "seriously?" then when I realized you were serious I'd laugh my ass off because I probably give everybody those looks and it's nothing personal. Then I think a genuine lighthearted conversation might ensue about how people present themselves, how most of it's bullshit etc. Then he might like you.
2	Sounds like he wants you or he really hates you! thats the only reason I can think of an ENTP going out of his way to show disgust at  your insincerity towards colleagues. I'm leading towards wants you, but if you really want an answer and he's actually an ENTP just go ask him in private he'll tell you...
2	Yes the general consensus depending on the skill-set of this ENTP will include the tendency of not giving a solid fuck about anything that anyone else thinks about him, his mission, his motivations, his flaws, etc.... Most of MBTI's analysis on ENTP relates to our natural ease in debating but I think there is a gross misrepresentation into the overall development direction with ENTP in particular. \n\nThere are two reasons why he told you "no" as profoundly as you claim he has.  \n1. If he is like I am, he has already come to conclusions on every single person in your office. The longer we have to internally analyze what someone's behavior is the more we can either prove or redetermine our opinion on someone. Mentioning "He can smell how inauthentic and fake I am" to me is the same thing that I perceive stereotypical "hot girls" as being. Completely inauthentic and lacking in any sort of depth. If this is the case then he has completely discredited you because he can smell ulterior motives to your actions and views any interactions with you as a bad idea because you do not fit his mold as anything but a co-worker.\n\n2. If there was more hesitation with his answer I would suggest based on how I behave in that situation that he is reluctant of a situation he has not been put into yet. From my history I will deny new experiences on my own because I do not have the capacity to know what is going to happen. The way around this is usually light peer pressure or an even stronger extroverted personality who can sway his decisions;\n\n\-----\n\nBack to ENTP development because it is actually quite fascinating to me. As stated before Most of MBTI's analysis on ENTP relates to our natural ease in debating but I think there is a gross misrepresentation into the overall development direction with ENTP in particular. \n\nWe are probably the best when it comes to not giving a fuck about anything that anyone says. For me a lot of times my interest comes initially in understanding something new until I can arbitrarily determine whether it is something I will invest in or associate as a part of my being. You almost cannot sway an ENTP to change their direction when it comes to what they want and what they believe. They say ENTP are devil's advocates and to a degree this is true. However I can honestly say that as a whole I am going to do what ever I want to do. If someone doesn't like it and their little feelings get hurt, they can fuck off. I will not be manipulated based on someone else's motives. \n\nENTP are also master negotiators, influences and manipulators. I can't tell you how easy it is when I am talking to someone to completely destroy a 3rd party (person)'s reputation. Younger ENTP are downright destructive in social settings if they do not understand what their natural abilities are capable of doing. With negotiations it's very easy to completely decimate the other side of a negotiation because I see most people as absolutely spineless when push gets to shove. This doesn't just go for verbal and mental mind games because very recently I have been working on adjusting my entire approach to the outside world. Recently I had a confrontation with a neighbor at a property we are working with where the neighbor saw my co-worker as the "alpha male" and my co-worker choked. So I stepped up (I am not a physically intimidating guy in all honesty" and this guy peeled off because someone had the balls to call his bullshit. \n\nLastly in the ENTP traits that I can personally say I am good at is the effortless breakdown and analysis of anything and everything I fixate onto. I think it's typically more discussed with INTP and other T's in general. But with their specialization (Mine just so happens to be in real estate, investing, and psychology) they will learn very quickly to break down every little thing which now becomes evidence or explanations. This is why I mentioned "The longer we have to internally analyze what someone's behavior is the more we can either prove or redetermine our opinion on someone." because we do it to EVERYONE and it is immediate. Whether you speak or not we are figuring you out if we are interested at all or have any kind of stake in what it is. Be it co-workers, situations, potential outcomes, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n"He could smell how X" - I say that literally any time when in analyzing someones actions.\n\n"Authentic" and it's derivatives are literally a word blend I have incorporated into my vocabulary profusely in the last couple of months so it is very interesting that,\n\n&#x200B;
5	My wife is an INFJ, and we're a pretty damn good pair. I remember [this article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/ilincavalentina/eight-reasons-infjs-and-entps-are-a-match-made-in-nf6k?utm_term=.pp1m56rj1#.wrbgxAoZ4) that explained why ENTPs and INFJs make really good couples. Too bad it doesn't work out more often. 
4	I think his reaction was really rude. Don’t beat yourself up for it.
2	INFJs are the only ones that (1) will sleep with me and (2) that I can otherwise tolerate well.\n\nSo there’s that.
2	If he's not liked at work and he seems to know that and just doesn't care a bit, then I would argue that he's one cold hearted ESTP. \n\nENTPs don't attack nice people because that's illogical for an ENTP. An ENTP seeks tranquility in their environment because otherwise that will drive them crazy. \n\nIf the person you are describing is in fact an ENTP then either he's NOT  a  healthy person OR he's trying to get your attention by simply being different from how others are treating you. \n\nAlso if this ENTP thinks that INFJs are not sincere and are full of it then he's not mature enough. Maybe you are the first INFJ he's met so far. \nBecause I have had this issue with INFJs earlier in my life. I couldn't believe that anyone can be that selfless or altruistic or so damn good that all others pale in comparison. I refused to believe that healthy INFJs were that good, but I was sooooo wrong hahaha. \n\nI am still shocked sometimes by the amount of awesomeness I get from the healthy INFJs in my life. \n\nCarry on and I know it's hard, but I thi k it's time for you to learn how to shun people who are morons. 
2	> as if he thinks I am manipulating all these people.\n\nWell you are, just passively.  You’re steering them into a position to like you by avoiding confrontation at all costs.  Like you said, it’s your coping mechanism. In this case it both benefits you my making you “well liked” but it also costs you because you lose some power of assertiveness.  \n\nBut we all manipulate other people.  Interaction is never neutral. Anything you do affects another in some way.  But if you take it too far you become a doormat.  And everyone loves a doormat because you can wipe the shit off your boots with it.\n\n> He is not very well liked. In fact, people can't stand him at work. But he doesn't seem the least bit affected by it.\n\nDoes that sound like a type with Fe to you?  That type of negative social pressure would bother an ENTP, deeply.  He would certainly be aware of it.  \n\n\nYou’re probably up against an ESFP, using their own FiNi again you.  They “just know” you’re up to something, and they read in malicious intent.  ESFPs are also less sensitive to social pressure than entps despite being Feelers, because they're Fi centered “fuck all these assholes.” types when they’re shitheads as individuals.\n
1	Yeah honestly fake people are the worst, sorry
1	I really don't think he hates you or something. I think it's def more of a "What are you hiding? Why are you hiding it?" Sometimes they could be wondering if you're actually someone who could cause some sorta harm to them. But ENTPs don't tend to hate many people...I personally like to say "You can hate so many things about a person and still not hate the person." Give them time, let them get to know the real you. He'll probably try to get to know the real you at some point anyway haha. We love getting people out of their shells.
1	Did you expect anything other than a direct answer, like it's an entp that's a literal trope/stereotype\n\nAlso give less of a shit and be happy with your self
1	I mean.... it's work. If you hide your real emotions for EVERYONE I feel sorry for you, but you gotta pick your battles, you know? Not every aspect of your life has to be a soapbox and I don't think there's anything wrong with just being kind to people and doing your job. Personally, as long as everyone gets their work done and tries to get along I really don't care how "authentic" they are. \n\n~~TBH caring more about "expressing the real self" than results seems a little more like an F quality anyway but w/e.~~
1	As an ENTP I can only confirm for myself that I get invited to go to parties, and it’s with all my best friends,and if I accept then I’ll usually ditch anyways. I dunno I like being alone. Even though I’m good at parties, I hate them. And if I ever give my INFJ co-worker a weird looks it’s because I’m awkward af, and or he’s being cringe. But yeah straight up. But just talk about stuff you think is funny, I fucking love his humor, it literally kills me😂
1	Honestly, I want to buy that ENTP a beer 🍺.\n\nI get so tired of the INFJ harmonious shy compliant geisha Kabuki theater act.\n\nYou don't want to show the authentic you, Fine. But don't waste my time by trying to introduce me to and give me experiences through the fake you.\n\nWhen I look in a mirror, I do it to brush my teeth, shave, and comb my hair. Not to pretend you don't exist as an individual human being.\n\nWhy should that ENTP like you? He knows he doesn't know you, well he does know you like to wear mask.\n\nENTPs are human BS detectors, if you want him to like you, be brave, be honest, and be yourself.\n\nYou can do this.\n\n
0	This person sounds absolutely like an INFP. I didn't think that INFJ's were people pleasers. ENTPS do not like INFPs (generally)
2	Help/Advice Please	So I've been really stressed - like out of my mind stressed. I'm 18 and in college, about to finish up my two year in business (I'm also a guy if that's helpful). I have two projects I'm working on right now (work, not school). One of those I am leading, the other one is entirely my own. I have this annoying wart that's been on my hand and won't go away (I've used medication and it still sucks - can't shake people's hands, so I've been hugging more than normal - being in business and not being able to shake hands is terrible).\n\nThere are flees in my room that won't stfu. I'm mostly sleeping during the day (except for classes, if I make them) and working/procrastinating during the night. I'm trying to stop playing video games (slow progress, but it's ending). Watching too much porn (I'd rather not be watching any, and I'm struggling to end that too).\n\nI have way too many friends, and I never see them. I love talking to people and I am VERY extroverted, but I always feel unprepared (and usually am), so I'll just avoid seeing my friends. I have been talking to a girl but she's in Florida (I'm in Washington). We like each other and decided we'd just be friends for 2019 and work on ourselves (it was mutual - our relationship isn't really sexual, we just really enjoy talking to each other on the phone - talking to her usually de-stresses me).\n\nBecause I am not seeing people (how I get my energy) - I don't really have any energy. I've been trying to find time to listen to books (currently Jordan Peterson's "12 Rules For Life"). Trying to maintain a workout schedule (I'm skinny but I'm good looking and good at basketball/baseball/track - it's not that I'm insecure about how I look, I just want to actually be healthier). I still think about this girl that dumped me over a year ago (not all the time or anything, but I'll get reminded and it's weird idk - I thought that'd be over in a year lol). I'm not eating that much, I never have (I'm NOT anorexic).\n\nI hate planning and scheduling. I'll check the news too often and have political conversations with my dad (I like politics - btw I'm a liberal conservative in case you were wondering). I love hip-hop/rap (old-school 90s - some R&B - Fugees, Eminem, The Roots, Mos Def) and I'm a very talented lyricist and writer. I know people in the Seattle rap scene that I've been wanting to record/perform with but I can't find the time. I like listening to that type of music but every time I listen to it I want to sit down and write or freestyle (or just dance), so it gets to the point where it's not enjoyable just to listen to because I want to apply it, and I can't because I don't have the time.\n\nMy current two projects are at the point where they are producing, but all the cash goes right back into the business (or needs) so I don't really have any extra cash and I'm very reliant on friends/family if we're hanging out - which I hate because it just makes me look like a dick - which I don't normally mind, unless I'm hanging out with real friends/family, which I try to, because why would I hang with fake friends/family? I'm also trying to study for my permit so I can somehow get my licence and somehow save up and get a car (or have a fellow mentor perhaps lend me one).\n\nWhen I am at school and nearly forced social interactions - I'm addicted to people and will make new friends that I don't have time for (which makes me feel stupid). Some grandparents are dying that I've been relatively close with (see what I did there?) and it's just hard having people that could just be gone tomorrow. Really amazing people. My grandpa was in WWII and escaped three enslavement camps (I'm 50% Polish).\n\nI just don't know what do. I'm in despair. I don't know what anxiety attacks look like, but I'll get to points where I just randomly start shaking and making the kind of noises one makes when they see they got a 27% on their math exam. I've had suicidal thoughts (not so much out of depression as they are out of just the sheer amount of stress on my brain, and how falling 300-400 feet headfirst onto concrete pavement could get rid of all that stress, and the stress that I don't even know about that would come in the future - I'm just 18 - I can't imagine what it will be like later on, or maybe I can).\n\nEvery single time I'm hanging out with people I just feel gray, and I see gray: "There are things I need to do. I could be improving myself. Why am I doing this right now?" Oh, and a couple realizations of "Hey, we're all going to die one day" - which is then immediately followed by thoughts of the future and anti-aging technology and what life will be like if I get to live longer but have to watch my parents die and a lot of my friends (because a lot of my friends are older 45-50+ - I'm weird like that I guess). I'm a Christian but I don't actually believe in an afterlife (I don't know how to literally believe in an afterlife). I'm a Jordan Peterson Christian. "Christian apologist," right? I don't drink and I've never done any drugs, I like having a clear mind - at least I think I do.\n\nAnyways, that's my situation. I know it was long but if you read this far I hope it was somewhat of an amusement for you and not just torture. Any help, personal testimony, experience, or advice that you have to give me would be very much appreciated. Thank you very much! I value your time and energy.
3	Reads honest which is nice  \n\n\n\>  I have way too many friends, and I never see them.   \n\n\nVery relateable also this  \n\n\n\>  When I am at school and nearly forced social interactions \[...\] and will make new friends that I don't have time for   \n\n\nI have the same issue, you meet a lot of people, hang out with them once or twice and then kinda get overwhelmed and retreat. Then people hit you up to do something and your timetable get cluttered with activities you dont really want to attend, but you'd feel bad for not going after having been so engaging before. At least thats how I feel\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\>  grandparents are dying \n\n&#x200B;\n\ngo visit your grandparents  \n\n\n\>  talking to her usually de-stresses me    \n\n\nNice that you have her  \n\n\n\>  Trying to maintain a workout schedule   \n\n\nI started recently, its a step in the right direction but it will be a challenge to stick with it (I guess thats part of the improvement to gain)  \n\n\n\>  I'm not eating that much, I never have    \n\n\nTackling this at the same time.   \n\n\n\>  I still think about this girl that dumped me over a year ago \[...\] - I thought that'd be over in a year lol \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI relate it really weird. Ultimately its just in your head and even if it isnt its time to move on, a step on the way.   \n\n\nI knew a guy that killed himself at young age. Its tragic because he could have been anything. You are so young you can still majorly fuck up (excluding health impairing things ) and still have enough time to change course and make something out of yourself. The younger you are the more potential you have, and the more time to realize it, for it is never too late. Plus generally you dont seem to be kilometers off the right track. Weed helps me relax. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n\n\n&#x200B;
4	Does anyone know what about are these weird rules on infj sub ? someone managed to create a new topic according to these rules?	check that https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/ak3k0k/daily_sticky_posts_and_rule_reminders/\n\nso, does anyone know what about are these weird rules on infj sub ? someone managed to create a new topic according to these rules?
3	🥃INFJ mods are bureaucrats Morty 😲🤤.....
3	Seems like they need to be a little stricter since the sub has grown so much. Looks great to me!
4	Hey Wigi,\n\nWhat we’re doing is instead of having a bunch of more not truly INFJ specific posts on the sub, we’re redirecting them to the daily topics automod is posting. There are different ones for each day, like mental health Monday, etc. \n\nBasically instead of your post having it’s own thread, you would post it as a comment on the daily topic. We think this will also allow people to more easily see related topics. \n\nAs stated in the post, this is a month long experiment we’re trying. A lot of posts don’t actually relate to being an INFJ, or are based more on stereotypes (and oftentimes incorrect ones). Others are vague relationship questions where the only MBTI aspect is their possible type. There’s also a ton of these repetitive posts constantly since we’re quite large as a sub. This is our compromise to move them to a designated spot. ((We also are one of the MBTI subs with a chat and that’s always a great place to talk as well about general things.)) \n\nI recommend asking the r/INFJ modmail about their rule changes rather than the ENTP sub though. We have separate mods, so you’ll be able to get more direct answers =) 
4	Commuting to work	Hey dear fellow ENTPS  \nmaybe someone else experiencing the same: When I travel to work early in the morning I read books, listen to my favourite podcasts etc. But quite often I have difficulties to concentrate at work as if my mind is already full with processing what I just read/heard. So I get frustrated, unproductive and can't stand this feeling. So I am caught between my passion of immersing myself into something fully ( a book for example) and then the desire to be a perfectionist at work.   \nSimilar in my way back- my head is just dizzy from concentration at wörk, so I can't bear any sounds as music r other people on the train, their meaningless conversations and chewing noises, just ugh. Even reading makes me aggressive, it feels so forced.   \nI hate commuting and will try to move closer to my workplace as soon as it is financially possible.   \nBut how can I make it more tolerable til then?   \n
5	Do something that engages a different part of your brain.  \n\nChoose one to try, and if it doesn't work try another: Bring a sketch book and sketch people's faces, write poetry, listen to Chopin/Listz/Bach, review notes before work and journal after work, meditate, bring a pillow and nap.
4	I've run into the same thing on my 50 minute train commute. I think it's about balancing sensory input and output. So I usually write/journal on the way to work... fiction, poetry, or even just an agenda for the day. This is a good way to get creative juices flowing and get ready for the day by engaging your brain and priming yourself for output rather than confusing yourself with input in the scenario you provided (reading/music). When I'm coming home if I'm feeling awake and attentive I'll read, otherwise I'll listen to music (sometimes music in another language that I'm working on picking up for some bonus passive learning points). Music without lyrics can also be relaxing. I looooove chilling on the train and listening to movie scores for example.
3	Well i relate to what you say except i am in college and i am not much of a perfectionist unless i am working on a project or an interesting assignment. Usually we entps are good at juggling activities but there are times when we need to focus and some part of a book or something someone said is constantly drawing our attention(and if it is interesting why not). In times like these i usually take a break spanning 20-30 minutes where i restrict the use of Ne and switch to Ti to address the topic and try to take it to a point where my brain wants to take a break from the topic due to lack of input which i promise to provide after the task at hand. If the amount processing done in this period is satisfactory then my brain accepts to take a break before approaching the problem from a new perspective or else I am screwed XD. Hope this may work for you. Also i really want to know how to deal with the aggression and anger i feel when things feel forced, if someone could help with that.
1	Am I really ENTP?	So a little bit of background context to this so you all can understand where I’m coming from: I’m 18 years old and a college student, and have retaken the test multiple times out of curiosity with regards to both how I’ve possibly changed over time and also because I wanted to see how consistent MBTI was (using the 16 personalities test which Ik is criticised quite a lot) but now I may’ve taken it too many times for my own good and have shifted across the NT spectrum from INTJ to ENTP. \n\nI also thought it was bs partially because I was into Jordan Peterson at the same time and he talked about it as having no utility (as well as the original developers lacking valid backgrounds for the purposes of creating a test like MBTI), so I approached it with arrogance but now I’ve become progressively more aware of its applications I feel as though I’ve muddied the waters for myself by taking the test so many times that I can’t tell what type of rational I am.\n\nI was hoping by this meta-analysis of my meta-analysis of MBTI’s analysis I could help people to help me sus out what MBTI I most convene to (by elongating this as much as possible I’d think it would help any audience to gauge me as accurately as possible, as mistyping for someone as turbulent as me (last measured at 65%) to solve this conundrum. \n\nI’ve also taken Enneagram and landed at INTJ (can’t remember the number) and done the Big 5 where I land at bottom 2% in terms of politeness but land at the 96th percentile in terms of openness to experience which strikes me as very ENTP from what I gather. \n\nPlease solve this with me, a very curious NT
4	> (using the 16 personalities test which Ik is criticised quite a lot)\n\nIt's actually not that bad, imo. Probably one of the better written tests/strengths and weaknesses for each type out there. \n\n> shifted across the NT spectrum from INTJ to ENTP.\n\nPretty big difference between the two types in terms of cognitive functions (J/P).\n\nThe test itself won't really do much for you because it's only as good as the answers you put in. So, the better your understanding of the cognitive functions, the more accurate your test results will be. \n\nFrom what I can gather, I see a Te approach in how you're evaluating your test results and MBTI in general. \n\n\n
2	> I’ve also taken Enneagram and landed at INTJ \n\nWhy would an Enneagram test give you a Myers-Briggs type as a result?
1	Take the Socionics test to see if you're a true ENTp/ILE.
1	I think you need to sit the test with a very intelligent person that knows you well to administer the test. I did it for someone who kept getting different results but it later transpired that they didn’t really understand the questions.
16	Any entrepreneurs here? What do you do?	I'm planning on opening my own financial services firm in the next few Year. What do you do? Any tips?
25	I’m a lawyer. I sell law. it’s lame. No advice. Good luck.
11	I am a farmer.\n\n When times get hard...remember how shitty it is to work for other people. \n\nIf you start hiring employees, remember that and try to make their workplace as positive as possible. Give them choice and treat them well. 
9	I’m a freelance filmmaker. I’m a movie extra. I’m a production assistant. I do a bit of client work. And I write and direct stuff whenever I find the strength to get up from playing Fortnite. I’m really good at Fortnite. 
6	I co-own biotechnology company. Its going well because I identified the thing I can do well and is valuable, developed the talent, and then learned enough about everything else to make decisions about who can contribute all the things I'm not top-notch at. 
7	Opening my private counseling practice. Woohoo! 
6	I own a medical clinic and have my hand in a few start ups 
5	I'm a freelance multimedia producer. Previously I created and sold ebooks, stock assets, and a few other digital items.
4	20M ENTrePreneur here.\n\nright now I'm selling Instagram Followers via my own online shop. Funniest shit ever, atleast if you have a fetish for seeing how fucked up the world is \^\^\n\nthis is business number 7 and so far I learned from every fail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthe only real advice I can give is this:\n\njust fucking start. you're going to fail anyways. then learn from that. and repeat.  \ndo this till you are where you want to be.
4	Yeah. I cofounded a recruiting business. No tips
4	I‘m selling car parts online. In the next few years I want to try out different businesses though.\n\nI would recommend you to follow entrepreneur accounts on instagram and reddit. It sounds stupid but that way you‘ll be updated about the latest trends, the best books to read, etc. \n\nAnd I also recommend you to first increase your knowledge if you haven‘t yet. You don‘t wanna learn things the hard way, so read many books about finance, business law, accounting, marketing, entrepreneurial books that teach you lessons and mindsets (don‘t adapt them fully, „read to lead“- elon musk)\n\nPersonally I think 1. is to have a solid knowledge base before you even start anything 2. raise a good amount of capital 3. start small and grow\n\nfor 2. I recommend dropshipping to raise capital. Look into it if you don‘t know what it is yet.\n\n1 is especially important because I can see that when people who don‘t know much about business want to start one, they make extremely unnecessary mistakes and don‘t think everything through. When my sister or mom told me that I had to tell them after every phrase why it doesn‘t make sense, whereas with my friends who also have studied business, when they‘re presenting an idea it‘s actually a solid one
4	I make  VR video games!!!!!currently working on the coolest VR game ever.
3	Trader. Don't work for a firm, I trade my own money with my trading partner. Wha  kind of financial services firm are you thinking of opening? 
4	I’m a twice failed entrepreneur. I won’t leave you any tips (you’re welcome for that!) 🙂
2	Go to r/entrepreneur 
2	I've started 2 mildly successful businesses (as in, made good $ but like, 5 figure not 6 figure listed on crunchbase money). \n\nI saw a good comment in this thread that i'm expounding on: \n\n* know your weaknesses, where you fall short in compared to others\n\n* recruit people strong in those areas \n\nfor me that's handling monotonous operational work. I hired some ESTx 'hustlers' for the implementation of my idea & business model such as customer service & sales/business development. 
2	I'm an Information Technology Consultant.\n\nI got tired of working with lazy Tier 1/2/3 IT people with no formal education who couldn't program or fix a computer to save their lives.\n\nI do a job that requires at least 3 different people if I wasn't doing it.\n\nI've even worked with self-proclaimed "Senior" titled I.T. people who don't know shit about computers.\n\nI will eventually make enough money to be free from these shitters permanently.\n\nI want a new house, a new car, and 100K in the bank to piss away on sex, drugs, and traveling.
1	If I may give you one tip, read The Fastlane Millionaire by MJ DeMarco. I'm pretty sure it's the best book on entrepreneurship ever. 
4	Layout	I used to think Ne was my dominant function, because I'm able to see situations in so many ways. I'll probably continue to think this from time-to-time.\n\nBut when I arrived at this subreddit, I thought, "This layout is too loud." \n\nI guess I prefer the INTP layout.

62	„In all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order.“ by Carl Jung	What are your interpretations of this quote by Carl Jung?
23	Any small quote by Jung in isolation is meaningless. You really have to go through his entire context (which unfortunately is his entire book..) to glean what he's trying to say. 
8	This is coming from the same person that believed in synchronicity. \n\nIf you want to be charitable, he's essentially saying that what appears as chaos to an external observer has an inner structure and that once you properly understand the sorting mechanism of said chaos, you'll come to the conclusion that it isn't chaotic at all.\n\nI think it's is a fancier way of saying "my desk isn't messy, I know where everything is. It's organized chaos." \n\nIf you want to be less charitable, he's saying that he doesn't understand what chaos is. \n\nAs already mentioned in the thread, we need more context about this quote. Jung was notorious for using his own definitions of terms. 
3	Jung's primary belief is that the purpose of the individual life is individuation ie becoming your true self by discovering your self. This is accomplished through making conscious the things in the shadows of your mind.\n\nSo it follows that when most of our selves are unconscious to us, hidden in the shadows, many phenomena of both internal and external origin often look like chaos.\n\nThis quote seems Jung is making the claim that true Chaos does not exist. In the sense that no events come without order. Nothing is truly random, but only random when the perciever has limited perception.\n\nThat said, this does speak directly to the comfort zones of the ENTP and Ne users in general. Particularly to the ENTP; they love discovering new patterns amongst seemingly random data (Ne) and codifying it as a logical and coherent ordered system (Ti). \n\nBut, simply because the innate preference of the ENTP aligns with the singular quote of a human being with limited insights and perceptions (and not being a user of Ne himself), we can't validate the sentence on its own. It feels nice others might validate the preferences for Ne Ti and can give motivation to explore the validity. Still, wise to be aware of what motivates us to like someone's argument. 
3	A fire can’t burn without the setting of a spark. \n\nPlain and simple. 
1	I haven't read Jung but I read philosophy. There's a problem in which logical skepticism leads you to realize that it might be the case that we shouldn't be able to know anything, and that all of our knowledge is just an act of self consoling imagination in defense against the force of an infinitely unknowable world. As such, any sense of order we have ought to be wrong in infinite degrees. And yet we somehow manage to get by, and science carries on unfazed by philosophy's insistence that it should be impossible. So what we're left with is the vague notion that there is some sort of order to it all - there has to be - we shouldn't be able to rely on a sense of order unless there actually is one, and if there were any true chaos in the system then the rest of it would unravel. It follows that there is a general, all encompassing order of some sort, but it's fundamentally "secret".\n\nNo idea what led Jung to say this, but it clicks with well established schools of thought.

1	My room.
1	Introverted intuition. That's my interpretation 
1	Well considering that Jung is an esotericist hes probably alluding to the 7 lords that are referred to in many esoteric works. I think the emerald tablets of thoth is one of those works. They all have rule over their own dominion and they work together to set a story for mankind and to us it seems chaotic but if you know about their roles and what mankind is on earth for then it all makes sense and the puzzle unlocks.\n\nI dont remember all the things the lords have dominion over but I know that two or three of the lords are in charge of the lives of men and one is in charge of the souls of men. Another in charge of the underworld and the souls of the dead. Sorry it's been awhile.\n\nI'm unsure of the accuracy of the second paragraph since it's been awhile but you can find the books online. There's a lot of psychological warfare in real life with shadow governments and globalist mainstream media and it's even worse in the esoteric world where the stakes are higher.\n\nSupposedly in the alchemical books of the rosicrucians there is only reference to ONE emerald tablet of thoth and the guy who claimed to have been allowed to copy the tablets might be a huge fraud. He has a huge esoteric library. So just like in real life you need to devour all knowledge and believe nothing but your own intuition.\n\nGoodluck :)
1	The psycho-babble for "fuck it".
14	The rhetoric of judging	In the theory of rhetoric, an argument is deemed *persuasive* if it can demonstrate a claim and/or change a listener's mind. As such, methods of rhetoric often have a foundation of *reason* behind them, insofar that the judging functions Fe, Fi, Te, Ti will all use certain rhetorical tools. \n\nAristotle suggested three [modes of persuasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion) (or, styles of rhetoric), and sometimes an oft-ignored 4th. They are Ethos, Pathos, Logos (and Kairos). \n\nEthos attempts to establish credibility to the orator. If the orator is credible, then what they're saying is likely to persuade an audience. This will often appear via an appeal to authority tactic, or attempting to use jargon that the audience may be unfamiliar with. This is a style of rhetoric often used by FP types, and less frequently by TJ types. Hence this is a rhetorical tool found along the FiTe axis. \n\nPathos attempts to appeal to the audience's emotions. It'll pull on your heartstrings to convince you that the orator's claims are worth believing. It can also be used as a way to downplay opposing rhetorical styles. This is a style of rhetoric you'll often find in feelers; this is a rhetorical tool along the F spectrum. So you expect to see Fe and Fi styled arguments relying on Pathos. \n\nLogos attempts to appeal to logical truths, alongside objective data. It'll cite figures, statistics, and rules. By itself, it's a rhetorical tool often found in thinkers; this is a style you'll of rhetoric you'll find along the T-spectrum. However, this will mostly be along the Te axis of thinking, and rarely with Ti. Because Ti is more concerned with an argument's consistency, not its truth value.\n\nWhat this implies is that Ethos+Pathos is usually an Fi argument, Logos is usually a Te argument, Logos+Ethos is usually a Te argument, and Pathos in isolation is usually an Fi or Fe argument (often an Fe argument since Fi can't help but to also invoke Ethos).\n\nI don't think Ti applies to any of these. Ti in contrast is a deconstructing tool - it doesn't attempt to persuade. It attempts to destroy arguments and strip them to their bare bones, and rebuild it without flaw. Ti will immediately reject Pathos as being meaningless (if not, harmful). Ethos and Logos will be put under a deeply critical eye, and all attempts at deconstructing it will be made. \n\nThis is partly what makes Ti doms stand out - they reject all methods of rhetoric, since persuasion isn't even their goal. They'll have a keen critical eye toward all styles of rhetoric, somewhat making Ti a decent lie-detector. To pass the Ti-detector, you have to be free from rhetorical tools, *and* maintain self-consistency. 
13	This is one of the most frustrating things about arguing with TPs.  They often don’t even have a counter argument,  they’re simply deconstructing yours.  It’s why an ENTP doesn’t even have to be an “expert”  to deflate run of the mill arguments, because the facts are irrelevant compared to the logical flaws.  \n(And that’s also why ENTP non-experts can be aggravating to anyone who knows what they’re talking about — getting nit picked on trivialities instead of salient points.)\n\nBut I would argue that ENTPs are also passively rhetorical.  We often appeal to people’s sense of logic and rationality, inviting them to see our perspective of their own argument as superior.  While one would like to believe that other people bow down to a superior argument, it’s just as often that they kowtow to ENTP charisma and passion.  It’s an emotional side effect.\n\nI think you see the same thing in ESFP word salad — a string of plausible sounding nonsense, obfuscated with dime-store jargon all wrapped up in a bow presented with enthusiasm and passion.  
3	Can you explain kairos ?
2	>This is partly what makes Ti doms stand out - they reject all methods of rhetoric, since persuasion isn't even their goal.\n\nMade me lol irl. Very true. \n\nI don't think Te or Ti have a goal per se, they are just the chosen mechanism to remember information. For Te, data is put into boxes so that it can be accessed quickly. I see Te kind of like a tree structure, with strong roots and branches. \n\nFor Ti, data can be stored anywhere, but is connected to related data. There are no solid categories to put data into, because a new Ti connection can just punch a hole right through any category you try to draw up. Ti is less like a tree and more like a graph. The clustering between nodes is not so structured. \n\nThat said, I actually think the motivating functions are Fe and Fi. They define in which direction a person directs their energy and attention. I reckon that the strength of these is what determines someone's ability to persuade. 
2	Kairos seems to be a superficial understanding of the argument; it almost can be interpreted as a method of deviating from the focal point of the original subject (or at least this is how I interpret it). \n\nIt's like when NeTi thinks of a referential joke to something being said (and it doesn't have to necessarily be about something said earlier in the convo, which is where Chronos comes into play I think). In fact, we all make jokes like that (I brought up NeTi because that's their bread and butter), and it really depends on timing, what's being said, audience, etc. That kind of sounds like the criteria for kairos, but in rhetoric form (trying to persuade, not make them laugh). \n\nAnyway, I found this really interesting because there doesn't seem to be a rhetoric that fits Ti. *But*, what I find even more interesting is that Aristotle theorized these modes of persuasion, yet isn't he the poster child of the ENTP archetype? One would think he would have noticed that none of these particular rhetorics fit his preferred method (assuming he is correctly typed as an ENTP of course).

2	I like how one of them cites stuff outside of traditional MBTI (e.g. like polr Fi...), while the other provides practically zero constructive input (he's essentially a yes man, and a pretty bad one at that if that's even possible). \n\nAnyway, she seems to use Si quite a bit when referencing topics/ideas/concepts (e.g. her past videos, Feminists and MGTOW). And her way of conversing has that long, drawn out style typical of Si-doms. Then, there's Fe where her initial response to the video about the "ugly" guy is a criticism of how society places an importance on attractiveness. It's *pretty* clear she's at least an SF, and I think she's an ESFJ.\n\nThat aside, she took *so* long to get to her point. I have no idea where they saw Ti-dom in this video. I was trying to look for her to discuss *why* attractiveness is such an important trait. What does it mean? Has it always been this way? What are the benefits? What are the cons? Where does society progress from here on out (will the bias for attractiveness change)? \n\nNothing of that kind was even remotely addressed, which is probably the strongest sign that she is a sensor, not an intuitive. 
2	Beauty and brains.
5	Do you guys believe in the concept of a soul?	Just putting the question out there
9	If it didn’t exist, why else would I bother paying the troll toll?
5	Yes. There’s a TED talk about how consciousness could be a fundamental force, like gravity. You can’t see it, only its effects. It was a fascinating concept. \n\nThere are enough out of body experiences recorded to give some solid credibility to the idea that we are more than the sum of our physical parts - call it what you will: energy, soul, consciousness...\n\nScience is finding ways to try and measure it, but it’s in the infancy stage. Neuroscientists and philosophers are finally joining together to explore whether our brains create consciousness, or just channel it. \n\nAm I right about our souls? Who knows. We’re all seekers at this point. The difficulty is in separating the religious/spiritual bias from the conversation. 
2	Define what you mean by "soul" first. It's one of those terms that's hardly ever clearly defined and usually comes with a lot of religious baggage. \n\nI don't believe there's anything non-material about us. What's commonly referred to as "soul" is better understood as mind or consciousness. 
2	Absolutely. 
2	The soul is an invention of the ego, that fears dying. We try to find something constant and everlasting within our selves because we have an evolutionary ingrained fear of death. The truth is that there is nothing constant and everlasting, not in ourselves or in the universe (the distinction between these is also illusionary). The experienced of even an hour ago is not the one that is reading this, nothing remains but an illusion of continuity spurred by the forming of memory. The cells that make up your consciousness are already different though, as millions have died or changed in the meantime. Can you really say that you are the same person as a year ago? Hell, every seven to ten years virtually all the cells of your body are completely renewed. \n\nOnce you start really diving into the nature of reality you can discover some really mind blowing shit. The consciousness behind every experience turns out not to be a lonely soul stuck in a body, but the universe (for lack of a better word) itself, experiencing itself through certain configurations of its matter. I wish I could put it into words in a way that wouldn't sound like cliched rambling but unfortunately I had to experience glimpses of this myself through meditation before I realized the magnitude of this rather than being able to reason my way through it as I naturally prefer.\n\nThe soul and all other human concepts and labels are arbitrary divisions that distract from the simple truth that the entire universe is one entity experiencing itself through evolved blobs of matter. 
2	Define soul.
1	There is a soul
1	If "soul" means consciousness, then yeah. If "soul" means "undying essence" or whatever, then we're going to get into a long conversation about terminology, because I don't think "soul" is the the right word for that. I'd use "spirit" instead (and yes, I believe that we have it). I'm kind of re-framing my understanding of this stuff at the moment. I'm Christian, for context. Trying to look at Greek, Hebrew, historical context, etc. \n\nBefore I wrote this comment I tried to figure out the difference between ruach and nishmat chayim, and kinda just gave up... breath and spirit are strongly associated in Hebrew, and I'm not sure what the distinction actually is (i.e. whether "nishmat chayim" in Genesis 2 implies ruach/spirit). And then there's nephesh, which is soul but not spirit, I think? \n\nI come at this question from a different angle than a lot of other people on the sub. I work within a Christian framework because it helps me get to the interesting questions more quickly. (Interesting to me, anyway.) The "Is God real?" argument has been rehashed a million times, and I think most people on here are pretty set in their view. \n\nAnyway, if you want a theist's view, there's mine.
1	Not reallyish.
1	I have yet to decide. Still doing experiential tests whenever I get the right minded people involved.\n
1	I'm a Christian, so it's sort of part of the package.
1	Yea, it's more believable that we have a soul than to believe that we just die and that's the end of it. 
1	There is absolutely no evidence of a "soul" existing. And no logical reason to think it exists

3	How to not be an asshole at work	Hey guys,\n\nI've discovered MBTI 6 months ago and I had become totally crazy about this as it has explained several question I've never being even close to answer.\n\nI've just left college and jumped in into managament consulting. A very tricky job for and ENTP due to constant change in projects subjects what helps to keep me interested in the job I do. But with very strict deadlines everyday, which is terrible due to the fact I just hate to do something when I didn't clearly understood the topic in my head. Because of that, I frequently get to a point in which I just need to do what my manager wants cause the client wants answer TODAY, even though, they are halfway answers.\n\nIn the beggining, I've been finding myself in troubles due to my very direct communication (if you are wrong, i just tell you so, i don't really care about if your are the partner or the lower level in the room).\n\nRecently, I've been trying to be more political and it has been helping me a lot with the relationships, however my performance has dropped to levels far away from my potential.\n\nDuring all my life I have always been a nice guy and used to not tell people they were wrong even though I knew it, but at work, when I just get posseed by the need to deep dive into the topics I just turn into an asshole.\n\nThat said, I would like to know if someone has some theory or tip or anything to help me use my strengths without destroying the relationships at work.\n\nTks\n\n
9	If you don't want to be an asshole at work, then get fired. This way, you don't have a job to be an asshole at. I heard harassment policies are getting stricter — maybe you should try touching your boss's thigh. 
5	No advice or anything from me. I decided to just embrace that. I don’t try to build relationships with anyone and I don’t care if anyone likes me or even think about what they think about me. If someone gives me instructions I don’t understand, I ask questions until I get the clarification I need to do what I’m supposed to do right. And if I truly think someone is wrong, regardless of position, I will let them know in the most polite way possible. When I interact with people I’m friendly and make jokes and then move on. I don’t do the whole politics stuff where being social at work respecting the chain of command and making sure certain people like you crap. Instead I like to discuss actual company policies, don’t consider anyone at work friends outside of work, and try to focus on being productive employee. And as an ENTP it’s great cause you already have tons of social skills, so being antisocial and trying to think Like an introvert at work is so easy and you’re not that much of an asshole because you can be good socially without caring about the social crap.
3	It doesn't really matter how great you are at your job if everyone at every level can't stand you.  Everybody makes mistakes, and you want people in your corner that have your back when you make those errors, not people who want to shove you over the edge of the cliff and see how hard you splat. \n\nI'd suggest building relationships with your coworkers.  Take accountability for the mistakes of people below you, and ensure that your managers see that part of you.  Leading by example and hard work is a great way of building relationships which will be beneficial for you later when you really need everyone pulling the same direction.  \n\nThis means when you know you're right, and another person is wrong, you need to start doing a cost-benefit analysis.  "Is doing something their way really that much worse than doing it my way, and will it have any tangible detrimental effect to the outcome?"  If the answer is yes, those are the times where you should (very diplomatically) step in and explain why they can't do it that way, or why the idea won't work.  Always helps if you offer some empty platitudes like "I see where you were coming from though, and I appreciate your input."\n\nLearn everyone's names.  Know how many kids they have.  Know what they do in their free time and talk to them about those subjects.  You can't influence someone unless you have some degree of rapport with them.  It doesn't always have to be positive rapport, but I've learned that you catch more flies with honey than vinegar (ugh, cliche, I know.)
2	You don't need people to like you at work, they need to respect you.\n\nIf you think something is wrong, prove it to them, and don't ask for permission. 
1	> During all my life I have always been a nice guy and used to not tell people they were wrong even though I knew it, but at work, when I just get posseed by the need to deep dive into the topics I just turn into an asshole.\n\nIf you didn't do this before, then shouldn't it be easy to stop it now?
1	I try to be a likeable asshole, i joke about shit that people find offensive don't really care if a step people on their toes. But when it comes down to it i can always be trusted and relied upon.\n\n&#x200B;
45	What are some of your NON-stereotypical ENTP traits?	For me, I like debate and discussion and controversial issues, but I don’t try to disagree just to get on someone’s nerves? I only do it if I actually disagree.\n\nAlso I’m not super charming or suave. I’m pretty lanky and tall and lowkey never know what to do with my hands. I get stage fright. That being said, I’m still an extrovert because I gain energy and momentum from being with other people, and in general preferring to be with others rather than alone.\n \nWhat are some of your traits that deviate from the ENTP stereotype?
47	With some gaps, I'm generally neat, organized, and on time for things.\n\nI care about security, stability, and try to have concrete goals.\n\nI'm very selective about getting into debates with people. Most of the time, it's not worth *my* time.\n\nI'm not a ~*~sUp3r rAnd0m edg3LOrD~ (in fact, most of that shit drives me up the wall).\n\nI *do* care about other people's feelings and take them into consideration when making decisions.\n\nI care about actively making the world a better place.\n\nI don't troll very often; trolls are super boring to me.\n\nI'm not a quick-talking, run-my-mouth kind of human; I prefer to choose my words carefully (although admittedly, I do often still mess up in this regard).\n\nAlthough I don't shy away from confrontation, my initial reaction to someone being wrong isn't to jump at them right away; I usually trust that their wrongness will become apparent as the conversation progresses, after we've debated the right questions.
73	When I know a person is obviously ignorant, I don't even bother communicating with him so I only discuss and debate with people who I like their communication.
32	Im very empathetic. More so than most people I know. 
40	I‘m quite sensitive and I do get hurt easily and I also get offended. But I barely act on it and nobody would notice. The most I‘d do would be distancing myself.
16	1. I cbb to argue with teachers. It wastes time and I just get in more trouble than its worth especially with my mum\n2. I have concrete goals in terms of getting or achieving something. \n3. I would consider myself loyal\n4. I am consistent in some aspects of my life\n5. I love helping others without any gain for myself\n6. I don't care what other people think of me at all\n7. I can be isolated for weeks and be perfectly happy
13	I have a lot of empathy, and I'm good at giving emotional support in the appropriate amounts.
10	I also don't disagree for funsies. I disagree because I legitimately do and try to have a discussion on it. Many topics, I'm open to new information to change or add to my position and others, I'm trying to actually \*help\* the other person by correcting their false information or incorrect views.  \n\n\nI sometimes get a little too caught up in Intuition when I'm talking to other people so I say something super awkward and no one knows what I mean. Explaining only gets more awkward.  \n\n\nI want the world to be a better place, but so many people are DOING IT WRONG! Wait...that's stereotypical to tell people they're doing it wrong, isn't it? Fuck! I'm doing it wrong!!  \n\n\nI totally own my mistakes and when I was wrong. I even apologize for that. :)  \n\n\nOh, I'm also sometimes not charming at all - I'm big heap skeery dragon, chase off villagers, burn huts, eet sheepz, stuff like that. Well, that's the analogy other people give me about when I get upset? Maybe that's a stereotype - you tell me!
19	I don’t spend my time looking at/making memes. Like, at all
16	I don't argue with teachers.  I mean, maybe once or twice a year, but not often.
8	I'm kinda shy, pretty emotionally aware, think about my feelings a lot as well as others, but in a Ti manner. This sounds pretty Feely, but I have more stereotypical traits than I'd like to make up for it... 
8	I’ve always been a very high achiever. From being top of my high school class to being top of my profession.\n\nI’m more than a jack of all trades. I’m actually the master of many. Like Polymath level.\n\nI have very strong empathy. It took me until college to focus it, but it’s strong. I hate the idea of hurting people for no good reason. Now if you cross me and it is a situation I give a damn about, I will bury you and not lose a minute of sleep about it. Otherwise, I’m very picky about my battles. I’m kind to strangers and try to pay it forward and all that.\n\nMy work environment is always superbly neat and tidy. My home environment is complete chaos though!\n\nI have faith in a higher power, a faith that I didn’t inherit from my parents but instead came to through my own study of science and reason. Specifically, I’m a Christ follower. Now as one, I certainly do a lot of typical ENTP things in terms of challenging the stupidity of pointless tradition that has no benefit. And the like.\n\nI’ve been able to develop my shadow functions pretty well. There are things I could never do as an ENTP 20-something that I can totally do now. For example, I have figured out how to see the big picture *and* the details. But the details do wear me out after a while.\n\nNote: this all happened before I even understood the functions or that I’m ENTP. I thought I was ENTJ for years based on the stupid online tests and descriptions and ignorance. Getting an expert’s help typing me (it helped that she’s also ENTP) and learning the cognitive functions is what opened my eyes. So as an executive I had forced myself to learn to use the ENTJ functions (our shadow functions), but it does wear me out.\n\nUnderstanding the functions—not the stereotypes—has helped me to acknowledge ways I’ve grown and to keep growing more. It also helps me to destress by spending time exploring and playing and forgetting about having to rule the world for a while.\n\nEdit: and I’m supremely humble. Lol
3	I can be very melancholic qnd can develop feelings quick.
4	I am very punctual and hate being late - it stresses me out to no end. Mind you this is a practiced adaptation though, used to be late to everything, yes even goddamn interviews. \n\nAlso I love fashion and all things artistic - drawing, painting, interior decoration, etc. It seems like this is stereotypically not what ENTPs are known for.
4	Listening to idiots drone on and just glare at the whole conversation while keeping my mouth shut. 
5	When no one else in the team is organized I become a control freak that pushes everyone to do their work and start crossing the checklists. I even try not to hurt their feelings...
3	As an ENTP I hate just about everyone and only really like roughly 3 people in this world.  \n\nBut sad to say that I am every god damn stereotype of an ENTP.... Life is pretty much all over the place most days....
3	I don't like debating in agressive manner - I prefer discussing things with people I know, with no pressure, but to exchange opinions and points of view.\n\n\n\nMy grades are not perfect with no effort &  I struggle to understand maths (I'm adding this because I've seen many ENTPs talking about themselves as "jacks of all trades" and well, that's not me) \n\n\n\nI will take feelings of others into account while making decisions, altough they are not the primary thing I look at\n\n\n\nIt's hard for me to start things (when I was younger it was easy, now it's just too much energy, but I'm not sure if it's not effect of mental illness) \n\n\n\nI like to have concrete decisions made not at the last moment (but I struggle with doing it because there's always so many possibilities. But I try.)\n\n\n\nMy surroundings are quite neat (after years of my parents telling me to clean up my room - and believe me, it was horrible mess - we made renovation and I projected it in a way where I could put anything into drawers and have no place for things outside. Now mess is I'm the drawers but overall look at the room is pretty clean 😅 )\n\n\n\nI cry a lot - it's like my main way of channeling emotions. I don't know how to talk about them and crying is always a way to let them out - no matter if it's sadness, happiness or dissapontment. And no, I don't feel like it makes me weaker, actually the other way around.\n\n\n\nI wasn't popular in school - I see ENTPs often mentioning their popularity but I'm not the one. I hated middle school, high school is bearable but that's all. 
2	I’m a very well rounded individual. It’s easy to connect with anyone because of my wide variety of interests over the years.

1	I don’t mind rules for the most part. They’re usually there for a reason and don’t truly irritate me. If there is an obviously asinine rule then I might let it be known that I don’t think it’s smart, but I’ve never truly rebelled against “the man”.\n\nThere’s a rule at my old high school right now that no one can have anything with peanuts or peanut butter because on girl has an allergy to them. My friend said that he got called into the office for having a peanut butter cracker or something and was told, “You’re not allowed to have that. Throw it away.” He straight up told the principal that it’s a stupid rule and he would not be following it.\n\nIf it were a rule like that and I got in trouble for it then I’d probably take it up a notch.
1	At work I keep things neat and organized.  Everything has a spot from my pencils to my inventory sheets. It is only at work, though. 
1	[deleted]
1	I have great ideas! But actually executing them is kind of a no go. I have to reach out to people and charm them to make my ideas come to life, then it can manifest after delegation. And I'm not shy about chiming in. I think the main reason is because I'm a big picture person, and the nitty-gritty is so difficult for me to focus on.\n\nBUT when push comes to shove, or a challenge is presented, I step up to the plate without hesitation!\n\n(I know this is an ENTP stereotype, but I put some sauce to it since I couldn't think of one.)
1	I grew up very athletic, still would be if I didn't get disabled from an injury. The athletic drive and mentality is still there. I like breaking down goals into smaller steps that I can follow. I have always liked organizing things and changing the layout of my room. Always been a hands on learner. Getting my hands dirty or working with physically tangible things is also something I enjoy. 
1	I don't know weather this is a stereotype but I hate hearing others get praised or for that matter even dislike praising someone.. Nor do I expect it in return
1	I'm an artist and am not good at maths. \n\nI don't argue for the sake of it. \n\nWhile I find debates to be fun and take them as a chance to learn about other people's perspectives I don't that as means to destroy other's world view. \n\nI like stability and loyalty.\n\nI don't mind making plans. They give security and make things easier. However I don't freak out when things don't go according to plan. 
1	This thread is going to weed out all the ENTP mistypes.
1	I guess I’m ‘boring’ in the stereotypical sense that I prefer to stay home on my day off rather than go out and engage with the world. I’m a bit of a homebody, which is not stereotypical ENTP behaviour I guess. My inner world is pretty vast though and I do have too many hobbies, I just prefer to do most things at home.\n\nI don’t like clubbing, partying or living on the ‘edge’, I prefer security and comfort in life. Maybe a little too much cuz I HATE change, lol! I used to think I was introverted for this reason, but turns out that I am energised by people. Just to paint the picture a little bit clearer, my ideal social activity would be me hosting a party at my house with close friends with jazz music in the background or electro-swing if we feel up for some crazy dancing. I’d cook a gourmet meal for them, while they sip on wine and relax. Then after eating we’d discuss books or play some instruments and chat. Just something cozy & even sensual. I’m not one of those wild party-going types, they are not intimate enough for me.\n\nI don’t like to talk that much in social situations until I become well acquainted with someone or I assess a person to be open-minded from early on. If I deem them ignorant, then I’ll probably not engage with them except for exchanging pleasantries. In that way, I might come across as reserved for some. \n\nI do like some form of order in my life even though I frequently procrastinate...I’m actively trying to do better. My room is pretty clean, and so is my working space. Everything is not perfectly organised but things are where they should be. \n\nI have clear cut goals and a self-development plan that I’m trying very hard to implement, sometimes I fail in doing that but I move on and keep trying. Turns out that I end up doing better and better everyday. So if another ENTP is reading this who’s in the same boat and trying to sort out their life, just keep persevering and you will achieve your goals for sure!

15	Discerning an Unreasonable Argument: A Brief Guide for the Mildly Confused ENTP	So it's 1 AM, you've been going back and forth with another self-proclaimed "ENTP" on the sub who's been giving you the runaround, and you're starting to wonder, "Should I really even bother composing *another* reply?"\n\nHere are some things to ask yourself before bothering to reply to this "ENTP", just in case you think you're not getting through and you'd rather catch some z's instead. \n\n**Inspired by recent thread* \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1 [Do ENTPs become emotionally volatile because they were asked to explain their statements?](https://old.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/aof2yh/what_is_the_source_for_morality/eg1ws2p/)\n\n> Here it is welcome ass hole I had to type up my idea so fucking read it.\n\n\n2  [(a.) Does NeTiFe enforce such strong ideologies (and without basis)? (b.) Do ENTPs attack others for their personal beliefs?](https://old.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/aof2yh/what_is_the_source_for_morality/eg1ws2p/)\n\n> And yes sexual promiscuity is bad perhaps if you weren't such an uncultured swine you would understand this\n\n3 [Does TiFe yearn to "win" an argument or feel superiority?](https://old.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/aof2yh/what_is_the_source_for_morality/eg24xak/)\n> Jee thanks bucko I guess this means you accepted me as your superior.\n\n4 [Do ENTPs resort to insults when they're unable to support their arguments?](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/aof2yh/what_is_the_source_for_morality/eg23qk1/)\n\n> You say all morals are subjective but act as if the more extreme "Evil" actions are somehow objective, and again the Golden rule is fucking nothing it is NOTHING it has no difference to any other moral subjectivity you are truly an imbecile with no proper capacity for thought.\n\n> It doesn't matter if a Church separated from state you imbecile\n\n> You are an imbecile\n\n>  You really are an imbecile, perhaps if you had read the bible and not just repeat what your faggoty Authority figure says than you would understand this.\n\n> this case it is rape you absolute imbecile.\n\n> you thick sculled ape.\n\n5 [Does TiFe care about small trivialities like such?](https://removeddit.com/r/entp/comments/aof2yh/what_is_the_source_for_morality/)\n\n> Hey guys could you up vote me since I made a post called "Jordan Peterson is an imbecile and/or a fake" an surprisingly r/JordanPeterson didn't take it too well and I got a ton of Karma. And yea I don't upvote anything, only reply but if it was someone asking for it and they seemed nice I would do so but we are united in being the GREATEST PERSONALITY TYPE THE ENTP so just up vote me.\n\n6 [Do ENTPs make broad generalizations and strong, personal judgements about groups of people?](https://old.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/aof2yh/what_is_the_source_for_morality/eg2alk9/)\n\n> I also hate Jews (on a collective level not necessarily individually) because of their damn scheming ways there is a reason they have been kicked out of like 100 country's.\n\n7 [Do NeTi users feel the need to assert their MBTI type repeatedly, almost as if it were a point in their argument?](https://old.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/aof2yh/what_is_the_source_for_morality/eg2alk9/)\n>Meh I am an ENTP through and through\n\n> I am just an ENTP \n\n> Also the insults are as well part of ENTP debate FE doesn't always mean "friendly" do you think I spewed out random insults? no I carefully selected those that would have the best result in my intent.\n\n>  I am an ENTP that's why I\n\n> with my superior NE.\n\n> YOU ARE ALL BELOW ME, FOR AN ENTP WITH INTELLIGENCE IS A GIFT TO SOCIETY BUT AN ENTP WHO LACKS PROPER THOUGHT IS AN ANNOYING HYENA... AND FOR THE MOST PART YOU ARE ALL HYENAS.\n\n>I am a ENTP insults are apart of certain argument styles I use but if someone is nice to me I will not insults.\n\n​\n\n
5	Decent guide. I thought you were taking a break from this dump?
3	Oh my. Another one. I'm finding this guys ilk all over my internet haunts. Frankly I'm sick of the endless and pointless pontificating of these guys.\n\nThere is a narcissistic bent that seems to hijack the reasonable person. And the discussion turns into a form of attention grabbing in order to maintain narcissistic supply. \n\nBest option, call them on it, and disengage.
2	I don't know if this person is an INTJ, but I *would* be surprised if they were over 16 years old. (Being generous there)
4	How do I stick to a plan?	I have a hard time sticking to plans I've made. However, I feel that I am exceptionally good at chalking things out but it's just that I never find the incessant need to stick and complete a plan/routine I've made and I end up procrastinating doing nothing that I've planned. \n\nHas anyone who has faced this problem come up with a concrete solution? 
8	Have systems rather than goals. Having a plan or routine is essentially setting a goal for what your day should look like. An equivalent system would be something like having a list of tasks that need to get done, and just checking them off as you go, not necessarily in the order they appear. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSay you want to get stronger at the gym. The goal setting, planned out approach would be something like laying out a linear progression of a body part split routine, training a different muscle group every day Monday through Friday, where you add 5 or 10 lbs to each exercise every session, and your goal is to hit those weights.  This can obviously be a great and effective approach, but if something gets in the way of you getting to the gym on Bench Press Monday, you might finish the week having never trained your juicy pecs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe systems based approach could be you going to the gym whenever it is convenient, and doing a full body routine every session, with the only objective being to train each muscle group to failure. Maybe you only get to the gym twice that week, but you will have trained each body part twice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you know that you have trouble sticking to plans, then I can recommend the second approach. 
3	So your plans are too hard. You need to start setting a lower bar for your plans. \n\nFor example: \n* Do this thing once I get to work? Failed. Got to work late and had to do other things.\n\nReduces to ->\n\n* Get to work on time? Failed. Got to work late.\n\nReduces to ->\n\n* Leave the house on time. Ok done. The problem is with my assumptions with the travel to work.\n\nSo you use this process to troubleshoot and build habits until you can just create a weekly schedule and complete everything!\n
3	I get rid of distractions, put on music, and set a timer.
2	i dont tell anyone about my plans or targets if i tell someone else what i think im gonna do, i usually end up not doing it, so being quiet and only able to tell after has proven to balance me into doing more.\n\nWich is hard when ur with an infj who has the need to know everything  wich makes my life much harder than it should.\n\nAlso i use rage, and strong emotions  like that to motivate me sometimes,i tell myself what would i think of myself in the future if i bitched out from this if i let this oportunity escape.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso i use possibilitys to force me to do stuff,for example im at home and being lazy thinking to skyp the gym and dont do excersizze, well i tell myself that i know if i stay home, ill read, ill watch something on netflix, ill go to sleep when im tired and thats it, but if i go to the gym theres a chance ill meet a girl there, tell her to take a drink on her place or whattever the truth is theres many many possibilitys that could happen if i go out there and very limtied if i stay home, so i go out there, i dont go for the activity itself but for the possibilitys im always chassing a possibility and thisis my greatest motivator.

9	Mental illness not to blame for gun violence - "Counter to a lot of public opinion, having a mental illness does not necessarily make a person more likely to commit gun violence. According to a new study, a better indicator of gun violence was access to firearms."	
5	It is connected to gun suicides though, which are another huge problem nobody talks about.\n\nNow, in terms of risk factors for gun violence, a history of domestic violence tends to be a huge one that I really think needs more public discussion. Personally, I think if you are willing to beat the people you (supposedly) care about the most, it demonstrates that you are a violent lunatic, and penalties should be dramatically higher than for regular assault. If you'll, say, punch your gf, I have no confidence in your ability to control yourself in public, in literally any capacity. I'm usually all for criminal justice reform and reducing prison populations, but in my opinion domestic abusers need to be separated from the rest of society.
8	Well duh, can't shoot up a school with silverware 
3	I live in Canada, we have more gun owners here than any industrialized nation but the US and Norway (between 22% and 30% of Canadians own a fire arm, that is on pace with the US, which is between 26% and 35%, but statistics are -- for a number a reasons -- not unified). The majority of gun related deaths here are suicides (about 60%). There are about 160-170 gun murders a year here, in the USA it is between 7500 and 11000, and  80-90 total guns deaths a year in Norway (that is about 10x more per-capita in the USA). \n\nAccess to firearms is certainly a factor, but if we compare to global statistics is certainly not the only factor, or the key factor. If we look at the total number of Guns in a country .... there is a gun for every 1 in 4 people in Canada, and 1 in 3 in Norway, and 1.2 guns for every American, so it does not explain why there is 10 times more murders in the US than either Norway or Canada. \n\nPersonally I am a gun owner, and in support of strong vetting process for gun ownership, but it seems like the money put into gun regulation could potentially stop more gun deaths if it was put into social programs (including mental health provisioning and education), which the US is statistically far behind Norway and Canada on.... Some thoughts.
2	Look at the biggest cities with the highest gun crime rates. Its not accessibility to guns legal or not. Its socioeconomic and mental health. \n\nPaddock\n\nLanza\n\nRoof\n\nAll of these were public suicides.\n\nAll of these could have been stopped by cops or the FBI as they had been reported\n\nAlong with this to show how incompetent the police system is. 21 Savage was convicted of a felony before he was famous or rich and he wasnt deported even though he wasnt a citizen and didnt own a visa at the time. \n\n&#x200B;
1	The number one cause of shootings are guns. Fun fact: knives are the number one cause of stabbings. \n\nStay  W Ö K E my brothers

323	You all are cringeworthy as fuck	The quality of posts on this subreddit is declining at an exponential rate. \n\nMost posts are just reinforcing/trying to fit into the stereotype of ENTPs being whackhead debaters who will argue for the heck of it. \n\nFFS guys, we're more than just that. \n\nBREAK FREE OF THE STEREOTYPES. \n\nPS: I rarely bother with downvoting but gosh, I'm on a downvote spree on this subreddit. 
120	“I get a thrill from debating others and breaking down their belief system”’give me a fuckin break
89	Yeah. Cringey is the best word to describe this subreddit. Mods should do a better job filtering the 10-year old nonsense. 
80	Ay, there we go. OP gets it. 
18	For real I’ve unsubbed and resubbed several times the past year or so. I test as an ENtP but good lord, most of the posts and comments here sound like tryhard edgy teenagers who are just looking to have their laziness and immaturity validated. \n\n“Man I hate having to do work, must be an entp thing.” \n\n\nNo. You’re not special. That’s just being lazy and everyone has the desire to not have to work hard, but part of being an adult is doing what you have to do. 
36	>FFS guys, we're more than just fat.\n\nDon't be silly. Not all of us are obese.
57	This is legit the most ENTP post on the subreddit 
10	As u/WhiteMale7152 said, be the change you want to see in the world.
23	I find that most people here are either here to inflate their ego or to feel better about themselves. I used to debate and participate here but maybe 10% of the people were people I related to.\n\nBut I agree this sub kinda sucks. I also think a lot of people here are close minded and ignorant or emotionally reactive and that just makes debates so tiring sometimes. I like to learn and practice my mind not be insulted from a place of ignorance.
5	>Controversial flair\n\n\nDon’t mind me, I’m just here to revel in the thick, sticky irony. 
5	I agree. I stopped using this subreddit almost entirely about a year ago when I started noticing how... Weird posts were becoming. I was also tired of being downvoted to oblivion and having semantics of my comment argued or contradicted for no real reason; that REALLY bothered me a lot. Hopefully this thread will start a change? 
5	Most people here aren’t even entp or Intp. “But i am an asshole so I have to be an XNTP”
4	Our own types generally make us cringe. I hate going on the ENFP sub most of the time. “Omg dae love unicorns and can’t concentrate and love INTJs bc I’m so sapiosexual omg lol.” Fucking christ, I hope I don’t behave like that and I just don’t know it. 
8	We got a live one
5	I haven't been on an entp forum that's terribly exciting. Exactly because the majority realizes it's cringey to keep talking about the same shit over and over (like on I dunno, every mbti type forum ever). Live chats are much, much better for ENTPs. And even those die out, but they're fun while they last. On the other hand, there are like INFP forums where the same people have been there for years posting daily. 
3	You know my girlfriend is in a sub for INFP. And it's really calm and chill and not like this one at all. I think our sub is just the natural order of freaks like us all in one place. On the other hand, yeah there are a ton of fucking children in this sub trying to brag about their sociopathic behavior or fat people trying to feel better because it's a product of their personality.\n\nLike we can have a productive sub, but it's going to require really filtering out the whiney bullshit or junior sociopath stuff. 
5	Lol i love how this hit the front page... cuz that technically means that the majority of users agree with you... which is weird considering that all of the posts disagree with you
4	Agree 100%. I want to see posts about growing as individuals. Maybe some good book recommendations. I saw a post not too long ago, but more on managing time and money and people. 
4	SO TRUE. I’m an ENTP (I think?) and it’s getting annoying how some people want to seem more ENTP-ish by being asshole-ish as fuck. Damn
11	Maybe it’s the age of the users here, seems to skew pretty young. Everyone is a fucking idiot in their youth. 
20	Why don't you post something thought provoking instead of complaining? Lead by example.\n\nThis sub has very few rules and most of them are not enforced that strictly. I would dare to say this is one of the few subs left in reddit where you have actual freedom of speech. That also means everyone else has freedom of speech, mistyped FPs included.
8	*log in*\n\n*check /r/entp*\n\n*read top post*\n\n*log out*
7	Probably just young entps. 
3	I mean, yeah, I've run into that on here, but the majority of people I encounter on this subreddit seem to contribute nicely enough. For the most part, I see something insightful or some ironic joke that's harmless and amusing enough.\n\nMaybe I'm not on here enough though? And I DO tend to go only for certain threads so that could be it, as well.
3	Legit saw a post here a month ago where a guy asks whether or not other ENTPs also don't follow rules because or how illogical they are. Apparently, one of those illogical rules to him is turing off your car while filling gas.
3	I just sub here for the occasional relatable and funny meme tbh. 
3	Nothing quite like an ENTP pissed off and on thee ole "I used to be cool cause this used to be cool" high horse. Literally do this all the time now I'm old, about everything.. especially the internet. 
2	Isn't the point of an MBTI subreddit to discuss the stereotype commonalities of the type? 
2	That's the reason that I've stopped to come here.
2	This might be one of the best things to happen on this sub.
2	Hell yeah brother 
2	> BREAK FREE OF THE STEREOTYPES \n\nthat itself is a stereotypical ENTP utterance, or at least that general thought.  
2	Circlejerk is just the new hip thing to bash on now evidently, being as 20yr old ENtP’s aren’t quite getting the ego stroke and interesting exchanges that they have become accustomed too, in this uni-corney sub that probably fluctuates in misfits and nooby hyperboles, depending on the seasons and trends. \n\nWhats wrong, suddenly your too lazy to discern between the silt from gold anymore.. with that Ne-Ti bullshit radar.. or can your Fe can no longer let it slide for the greater good of learning and growth? Si can’t be fucked calling out every poser or NFP like it allways has? 🙄\n\nAnyway sup guize Im new here. Im an edgey adhd adult whos on me second year of collage and hates circlejerking and copycats 🤜🤛
2	THIS POST IS NEEDED. \n\nSanity on reddit.  It's like internet gold.
2	I don't like debating, I like pretending I agree instead. Then again, I'm a more Socionics ENTp stereotype myself.
2	I honestly unsub and came back to see what’s new. I don’t like the direction this sub is going but I’m also too lazy to make a change... hmmm
2	I think what comes into play when one has an 'Entp' tag hanging around their necks is the need to conform to the stereotype. While Entps love to debate--as per standardisations, of course; human behavior is also governed by other factors. Take environmental factors for one. If you live in an environment or grew up with parents who contributed to the development of your Fe function then perhaps you would not find yourself jumping at every opportunity to tear apart a claim. I don't think having a type necessarily means that a trait is behaviourally manifested. There are degrees of variance in which a trait can manifest. And what is of importance is to understand that your situational factors can either enhance or hinder the manifestation of a trait- though, I doubt it can completely erase it. That's just not the case since these traits are universal. Those who view Mbti from a literal, absolutist mentality are bound to conform to these stereotypes and in the process, hamper their individuality. We must objectively detach ourselves from the concept and view it in a framework that allows us to accept our deficiencies but also- motivates us to better them. Personality is dynamic, and human nature complex. We can't possibly define our entire existence and behavioural inclination on the basis of Mbti. Its illogical. \n\nStop making your type larger than life.
2	what is it with internet ENTPs and trying way too hard to seem edgy/trolly/cool? real life ENTPs are usually so much better
3	This is so meta - an ENTP debating about the value of discussing ENTP debates on a sub... commented on by a bunch of people debating about it. Love it.
4	I don't think that your criticism holds much water, especially if you look at "hot" or "top x time".\n\n[Your opinion of the sub seems based on "new"](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/ao7njy/you_all_are_cringeworthy_as_fuck/efywce1?context=2) and that doesn't seem at all representative of what the sub agrees is good content.\n\nIf you're going to criticize, you should clarify the context of your criticism... I don't think most users default to "new".
2	Yep. I'm just trying to get work done, so I joined the sub thinking it'd help downregulate the less savory tendencies I have (\*ahem\* abandoning projects 80% of the way through), but the sub seems to be mostly "I am very  smart"s  jerking themselves off. It's embarrassing.
2	Your argument is invalid because *points to r/intp sub* they're even worse.\n\n\n\nIn all seriousness, I agree completely. The thing with broad systems of categorization like the mbti (dealing in breadth (different types of something, possessing equal value), is that they can make you lose sight of the vertical axis, self improvement within any given type. Thus, an unhealthy type often resorts to using stereotypes as a scapegoat.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. I get a chuckle out of humor derived from mbti stereotypes. But you have to remember that they are mostly all representative of the negative parts of our types, and thus they should serve as a reminder for what we have to work on, not excuses for a lack of self improvement. 
2	People define themselves by the guidelines of an entp and not there own individuality, it's a fucking disgrace. Be yourself, be an individual.

1	Yeah I was initially excited at the prospect of exploring these parts of my personality and was stoked that there was a sub for this, and then failed to find anything even remotely engaging posted here.
1	Break free? This is who we are for now. What makes you think we are disingenuous? 
1	Dude, this.. 
1	I thought breaking free of the stereotype was one of our hallmarks? I think following a stereotype means someone's mistyped themselves...
1	Let's face it, with entp's being competitive we are bound to compete with each other to see who can be more us, and thus the cringe begins, the only solution to this situation is to truly be who we are and not compete for the awesome title that is entp because we are awesome, it makes sense we would compete because even society agrees we are the coolest, just look at deadpool, but alas let this not be our downfall...

2	Participate in my MBTI Survey	[Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WMhQAkegNdJ-A3xJcFrW-nFWrr7GmA0hZas0JV9VNgo/edit#responses)
0	Not a great survey. I'm a 5w8 which wasn't included. No one knows what type they "seem" like when they're upset/happy. You should pick the actual traits you're trying to deduce. I always seem like an ENTP at those times because I *am* an ENTP, you know?
4	Is Bulma from Dragon Ball an ENTP?	Pretty much everyone types her as ENTP, but from what I can tell (aside from a few moments) she seems more like an ENFP, or possibly an ESTJ.
9	Haven't seen this show in years, but I can buy ENTP or ESTP for Bulma. She's a talented engineer who works well with her hands, as well as quite vain about her looks. Beyond that, I recall her having pretty good common sense, especially compared to the spaciness of some of the other characters. There's a general earthiness to her that isn't quite consistent with being an NT. So, ESTP in my book. I think she's more Se than Si, and besides, does not fit the overall profile of an ESTJ at all.
2	Real question is, what's Vegeta's type?
6	Generator of Ideas - Followup Hard	I'm great at generating story plots and ideas. I spent the last couple of days running with a concept about a futuristic crime and creating what I hoped was a very short story (under 1,000 words). People in my writing group loved it. They commented that it felt like a movie treatment or long short story. Naturally, it needs more thought and development. Naturally it may end up being longer than 1,000 words. One of my fellow group members said I have the ability to develop very interesting stories that should be longer. \n\nI've been struggling with a novel these last couple of years. I know I should be focusing all my attention on making it more cohesive. I wrote many novel scenes by jumping here and there (far from perfect). I recently turned to outlining the plot into a more coherent flow. I'm going scene by scene - sketching/outlining. I have an agent interested in seeing it one day -- but only if the manuscript is very polished.\n\nIt's more fun to forget about this hard work and turn to new stuff. I know there are no rules, but I want to publish at some point. Family and friends who are not writers ask me how my novel is going. I'm starting to wish I'd never mentioned it. \n\nAny advice, my fellow ENTPs? 
7	So, I have no background in writing but I'm an illustrator and sometimes do story related concept art - please don't take this to heart -  good world building/ideas are common, it's the execution that counts. From what I have experienced, the biggest stumbling block writers that I worked with had is the lack of theory. There are a lot of books on how to develop character arcs or build good 3/5 act stories (I think the theory is also inspiring when editing). Cool story is great but using methods that are proven to allow your audience to connect to characters or follow the plot are important. So is research. I don't usually correct my clients but some tech explanations or weapon choices were so wrong I had to voice my concerns, it was as if they were going on by a here-say on the subject.\n\nWell, I mean good luck finishing. Hope to read it someday.
5	Once upon a time I had some KILLER ideas. Ideas everybody was envious of. When I read my outlines in oral format, I had the audience at the edge of their seats... but I never FINISHED writing any of it.\n\nIt's not JUST an ENTP thing. It's an author thing. I just wasn't a developed enough writer, and I was afraid of MESSING UP this perfect vision. The ideas were too perfect and precious. I needed a break from fiction.\n\nWhile on hold, I wrote copy and advertisements, rock songs, rap songs. I wrote rules / regulations for websites. I developed a mod for a video game and created a board game based on puns. I did some pretty good videos and hosted a radio program.\n\nYears later I return to fiction. With all this experience under my belt I had INK flowing, not just ideas. I had secretly been developing my talents and I was no longer afraid of committing pen to paper.\n\n**My advice to you:**\n\n* Abandon your precious idea. It's more important to finish something, even if it's bad, than it is to perfect your grand vision.\n* If the idea means that much to you - write a short story that takes place in the same UNIVERSE. Something you won't feel the urge to get perfect.\n* Sometimes new ideas come to you and excite you. Write them down. You THINK they're new stories but they aren't. They're B and C stories you can use within this existing work. You can modulate the excitement of something new to amplify excitement about your existing work.\n* Getting started at the beginning of each day is the HARDEST PART. When you stop writing, try to stop mid-sentence & mid-paragraph. This way, getting started is easy - Just finish the paragraph!\n* Meh I've got my own writing to do. Feel free to fill out the rest of the bullets yourself.\n* \-\n* \-\n* \-\n* \-
2	Talk to a developmental editor. Most of them will give you a sample edit and quote for free. Only do this if you're prepared to pay for the full services, though. It's not like they give out free samples for fun. :)
3	Subreddit for TPs ?	1. From what I can see ENTPs, ISTPs, ESTPs, INTPs and also INTJs to some degree are minorities within r/XXXX communities.\n2. We also get banned a lot for stating our ideas freely\n\nI was thinking of creating a private subreddit for just TPs + INTJs, so that we can debate freely, boldly and actually build on top of each others ideas. Would you guys be interested in a debate subreddit for just TPs + INTJs ?\n\nEDIT: Created it. I will invite random peeps in. PM me if you are interested!
8	No, because I don't trust you to correctly find the TPs. 
2	Did you check to see if one already existed? \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/xxTP/
3	that's already this subreddit, INTJs & INTPs come here willingly because we got an uncut, unending supply of hot, fresh, dank, sticky icky engaging ideas/topics that we shit out of Ne every couple moments. 
1	I have not seen the mods ban anybody for speaking freely here. 
1	Ye
9	Arguments/Debates with INFJs	What do arguments with INFJs typically sound like? I kinda think this girl is an INFJ...not sure. But we sort of got into a debate on our date about avalanches in the Backcountry and what was and wasn't safe in the sidecountry of our local resort.\n\nIdk if it was an argument or just a very passionate discussion on her part...but basically she was telling me about all the people who's friends have died and that I should be careful in the Backcountry. Places nobody should go etc etc. I agree of course, pointed out some things she said that aren't technically true.\n\nAnyways, she seemed VERY emotionally invested in it, and I just hope I didn't hurt her feelings somehow? Like I think maybe i should apologize, but things never really boiled over or got out of hand. If anything I'm more attracted to her after it...weird. She seems like she could be an INTP but I don't think an INTP would react so emotionally. 
8	Honestly, I've found it hard to get into an argument with an INFJ, and I've known a few quite well - they tend to be somewhat conflict-averse. My experience is that they'll present their side, then immediately acknowledge all the points they agree with on your side. Then, several days later, you'll learn that they presented all their *disagreements* to some mutual friend/acquaintance instead. \n\nAlso, I have never seen people repress their emotions to keep the peace more than INFJs. They will outwardly say everything is okay and then fume inwardly for weeks on end. Much of the time, they won't even realize they're suppressing their emotions - they'll tell *themselves* it's all ~fine~ and then wonder why their stomach feels funny every time they are around you.\n\nThe best approach with INFJs, in my experience, is to be direct and proactive with them, but always respectful. I think your INFJ  friend/girlfriend/girl-interest would probably appreciate you apologizing for not being sufficiently sensitive to her feelings. Generally, you want to acknowledge that you see where they're coming from and don't think they're crazy (INFJs are always afraid that they come off as crazy), as well as that you're glad they're concerned for you because it's nice to feel like somebody cares. However, you stand by your perspective and you hope she can support that. With an INFJ, if you appeal to their emotional side and ask for their support, they will generally forgive you. \n\n...I think I have way too much experience with INFJs, help.
6	It helps if you constantly reinforce that you're not actually debating them, even if you are.  In my experience, INFJs find debates really tiring, especially with ENTPs, because we are very short and to the point (compared to an INFJ) and tend to cut the INFJ off before they've actually made their point, usually because we have found something relevant to what they just said that we know we are going to forget before the INFJ has finished their turn.  \n\nSource: married to INFJ for a decade.
4	I don’t think a healthy INFJ would mind a passionate discussion at all and so if you didn’t disrespect her while arguing I wouldn’t apologize or worry about it at all. It sounds like she is into you maybe since she got worked up about you not being safe.  Just a personal observation but I feel like INFJs want to protect ENTPs since they aren’t that careful with themselves lol. 💚 And INFJ might rely on passion and emotion to try to get the ENTP to care more about himself and his safety, all the while not realizing its probably not the most effective approach for influencing ENTPs hahaha. 
10	INFJs typically go into “I’m going to personally attack this individuals morals and principles for thinking logically” type attack modes. I’ve never once been offended by anything an INFJ has said that’s directed at me because they are so, so out of touch when trying to argue, debate, or insult. \n\nFor example, an INFJ will probably read this comment and since it’s a thought out, lengthy explanation that’s trying to expose to you their negative traits, tendencies, etc. they will probably think I’m a self hating, lonely, sad creature...for whatever reason. The fact that I just typed THAT previous sentence out will also be further affirmation to them about my self-hatred simply because I “connected the dots” which must mean I have “self awareness” of my “rudeness” which must mean I “hate myself” because “rudeness is bad” and since I’m rude I “must” also be bad, etc....\n\n...so they’ll try to insult me simply by saying I’m a bad person. Full stop, end of insult.\n\nUsually they just say things like “You’re self hating...you have no heart...etc.” as if these statements are somehow supposed to make you give a shit. When they actually try to pin down *actions* that you’ve done, they end up sounding like some nutjob who is begging the sun gods to guide them with prophecies.\n\nINFJs are honestly the worst type to debate with. It’s like trying to talk to the sound-waves in the air that are coming from a massive crowd of screaming, hungry babies.
2	Fact checked what we talked about later that night. Turns out I was wrong about one thing. I texted her and confessed that she was right. We're talking again
2	My wife is INFJ and when I get serious about something we’re talking about she ends up being super upset and we have to calm down.\n\nWe can pretty much only seriously discuss things upon which we have no substantial disagreement without her getting sullen.
1	Usually just going back and forth about social this-that’s, and just resulting in laughter by both parties. I mean yeah, INFJs can get passionate about something, especially out of concern for others. Maybe something happened in their backstory making them personally attached to that topic in particular?\n\nBut yeah, usually both parties just go back and forth with ensuing laughter..... well, if respect is given to the other. If respect isn’t given than we do tend to overdo things in order to prove ourselves so that change can happen, which we obsess about. Hope it works out with you two :)
1	You can just double check on her, how she felt about the conversation, if she had any follow up thoughts on the matter, and leave the door open basically. You don’t need to hold their hand (but low key hold my hand bb). You can go about each intense discussion this way until they feel safe enough with you to bring it up themselves.
1	I can debate with the best of them, but if a debate turns into an argument, I’ll have better things to do with my time.
11	If ENTPs wanted to deceive someone, how effectively could they do it?	I leaning towards pretty well. I personally think ENTPs can detach from their emotions and that would make it very easy for them to lie to someone. What do y’all think?
14	Some entps are extremely charming, if these people are detached morally and have the proper motivation, (that's really the key) they can lie and manipulate with truly terrifying proficiency.
6	I’d say I upvoted this post.\n\n;)
7	ENTP is the best liar. Yes, most of us don't actually want to & have deeply rooted principles against it, but you know, I know, everyone knows that we can come up with an elaborate 10 minute story chock full of details that didn't occur whatsoever. Get called out on it, having another 10 minute bullshit locked and loaded. Best liars.
5	It wouldn’t be difficult from a moral standpoint to decide to lie to someone IMO but the deception is only as effective as the follow through to cover all your tracks.  “Devil is in the details”
4	I lie very often, usually to tell a better story to people than what actually happened. It's pretty natural as long as you focus on convincing yourself first, and the bit about ability to detach from emotions is spot on imo. Obviously something to be careful with because there's "good" or at least "neutral" lying and then there's lying that morally compromises you.
3	I can lie very easily when I want to but I rarely want to, just believe something to be true and it's easy or like OP said detach from your emotions but that can be difficult in the flight of the moment.
3	Oh it’s easy in theory but actually doing it makes me feel so awful, I fucking hate it. But that’s what a journal full of “test subjects” who were all girls will teach you😎
3	Yes, but telling the truth is just so much easier, and I'm awfully lazy. 
2	I don’t outright lie often.  I don’t.  Just not something I like to do or feel the need to do.  But I can see how people are and how they wanna be treated and I can treat them\nHow they want vs how I AM naturally depending on how important time being myself is vs me being comfortable while in this person presence.  I don’t think it feels good to be fake or lie.  It just doesn’t feel good to do that 
2	Well, the DoD personality assessment essentially screens for ENTPs, ENFPs, ESTPs and INTPs to place as HUMINT collectors.  If that's any indication, I'd say we're decent at it.
2	Very easily.. but we are more likely to throw in a heaping handful of truth, disguise it in authentic musing, and get the other party to invest mentally/emotionally on the pre-loaded fallacy or rhetoric. We are confident because worse comes to worse we have back up plans we can use the very moment contingency beckons, and without haste. Then we use Fe and ignorance as a final exploit or appeal if all else fails
5	Career advice	Hello fellow ENTP’s I am here seeking career advice! \n\nLet me give you a little background info, I just recently graduated in January with my bachelors in neuroscience. I was planning on doing the whole medical school thing but decided against it because I don’t really care that much about helping people and it is wayyyyy too long of a commitment. \n\nSo now that I’ve recently decided not to go the doctor route I’ve been somewhat lost! I’ve been looking for jobs in the biotech industry but the idea of working as a laboratory technician makes me want to vomit and the pay is poor. I am now considering going back to school to do a one year computer science program that would earn me a bachelors in CS. \n\nWhile I am somewhat interested in biotechnology entrepreneurship, I worry that it is too much of an undertaking and it would take me multiple decades to make a product. \n\nI think that CS offers me an opportunity to get the salary I desire, along with a relaxed work environment. I am also attracted to the idea of being able to be a freelance software developer and “be my own boss”. As a freelancer I would have the opportunity to travel around as I please and see the world and experience a variety of Cultures and people while making excellent money. Finally I think that there is a much greater opportunity for entrepreneurship in the software industry than in the biotechnology industry because it is so much more cost effective and time efficient as compared to designing a new pharmaceutical drug. \n\nAny input on fellow ENTP’s who have gone into software engineering or other computer science related areas would be greatly appreciated! Do you like your job, do you find it monotonous, does it offer creative freedom/the opportunity to interact with others etc... thank you all if you read this far I’m super impressed. \n\n\nTLDR; Just graduated with degree in neuroscience, don’t want to be a lab tech or a salesman... is computer science/software engineering a good career choice for ENTP’s
3	> decided against it because I don’t really care that much about helping people and it is wayyyyy too long of a commitment.\n\nThat's a good call I think.\n\n> the idea of working as a laboratory technician makes me want to vomit\n\nYeah. Most of it is routine work (Si) and following procedures (Te) with very little little human element (Fe).\n\n> is computer science/software engineering a good career choice for ENTP’s\n\nI'm not in IT myself, but it's alright from what I heard. Definitely better then being physician. And as you have said, you can aim to be freelancer or work for smaller companies. From an ENTP perspective, these sound better than a corporate environment.
3	* your idea of being a freelance developer and 'traveling as you please' honestly isn't a realistic idea. Like it's possible but not likely, maybe 10 years ago. You also don't need a CS degree to start a software company, you can hire developer code monkeys to implement your ideas. \n\n* I think you SHOULD stay in biotech/pharma realm. I'm a business person, but I got some certifications & did enough research to be considered having a technical background in that realm. I think you should go into business, on the side of pharma (probably for like Merck or Eli Lilly, someone in neuro disorders). \n\nYou get to work with all the 'fun' & 'interesting' ideas, without doing the slave labor lab research, documentation, etc. You also don't get silo'd into just one field, being in business. My former boss was a BS in neuroscience and moved into business development (don't do sales/BD tho, ew). 
2	Haha, I think we should talk. Life scientist here and worked in the lab for 4 years - got tired of it. So I moved to computer science. IT is fine but beware of the tiny details and frustration when your code doesnt work. \n\nMy suggestion: Try consulting or something that goes less into the details...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry I am still figuring this out myself but I am right now thinking of either consulting or IT project management or some software conceptuals jobs... 
1	Have you thought of going into clinical ethics? It's a career perfectly in line with your bachelors and with ENTP traits. The only downsides are that it usually requires a masters, Ph.D, or M.D, and that it's nowhere near a doctor's salary; the average is around $75,000. \n\n*That's* honestly my dream job, but I'm still holding onto the idea of becoming a doctor because I like money.
20	No attraction lasts for more than 3 months	I cannot ever develop long-term feelings for people. As much as I want to experience the 'head over heels' kind of love, it just never happens to me. When I date people, they usually fall in love with me first which causes me to lose my interest right away. How do I fix this? 
21	DO NOT FIX THIS! It is a blessing, trust me. I was the same way, all my relationships lasted from a week to 2 months, never longer... until I met the man I married. We know right away whether or not our partner will last long term, and when we realize it won't, we get rid of em. Don't view this as a negative, it's a time saver.\n\nYou'll find someone who finally doesn't bore you and boom, you'll want to marry them.
12	>No attraction lasts for more than 3 months\n\nNewton's laws of attraction work for all of time, not just three months. Therefore, you're wrong. 
3	No idea but just know you're not alone. I have the same thing
3	When I was younger I secretly hated the women I dated. I resented being in a relationship but I was too chicken to break it off. I've had 7 year relationships that I was miserable in because I thought "relationships are supposed to be hard work."\n\nWhen I met my wife it was different. Same girl I was infatuated with in high school. We FIT. When I found out we were both single, things moved quick. On our 1 year anniversary I proposed and we got married just 4 months later.\n\nShe's an ISFJ, but she's a unicorn. Not just beautiful and caring, but also fun and spontaneous. I've always liked ISFJs but she was the first that didn't bore me.\n\nDefinitely the only person I've been with who I consider as smart as me... but smart in different ways. She catches the details, she's an organizational freak and can research in ways that make my head spin. I admire and look up to her just as much as she looks up to me.\n\nHold out for that. You'll know.
5	This is okay!! It just means you haven’t found the person you work with yet.
1	I relate to this post so much. Do you also have a fixation on your first love/the one that got away? \n\n\nAlso, any idea what types might be interesting/stimulating to date? Have dated the typically reccomended match (an INFJ) but found her kind of boring to be brutally honest. 
1	3 momths is the honeymoon period
1	How old are you mate? Female/male?
8	Discussion: To what extent is the progress of humanity controlled by its view on the world?	I have been reading Carl Jung's *Psychological Types* and at some point he states that (if I have understood correctly) ancient people believed in ghosts because they still had not advanced enough philosophically in the distinction between self and the world to understand that their thoughts only existed in their minds, so when they thought of their deceased parents they actually lived those thoughts and believed it was their actual parents talking to them from the afterlife.\n\nI am not going to write the full explanation of why that happened because it's a few pages long and it is related to collectivism and the lack of the idea of individualism in ancient times. I recommend you get a copy of the book and start reading it because it is quite interesting.\n\nIt made me think quite a bit, because under those circumstances not only the existence of ghosts could sound logical, but also the existence of gods and other spiritual beings; and the only reason we can reject this today is because someone thousands of years ago figured out he was a unique individual. Something which seems so easy to understand to us because we live in a culture that has accepted that concept of individuality and has evolved around it.\n\nSo, my question is, **to what extent do you believe we are controlled by our own view on the world?**\n\n**Do you think there can be a new revolutionary idea that could, like the concept of individuality, drastically change the course of humanity?**
2	Somewhat related is the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis, which suggests our language reflects our thoughts (and to an extent visa versa). For example, descriptions of the brain have all been metaphorical, and evolve with the times. In the past it was that the brain is a muscle. These days the brain is seen as a computer. These metaphorical intuitions may help verbal descriptions between parties, but in an academic sense it actually stifles you. 
1	I don’t really have an answer on that main question without triggering some kind of existential crisis that I really don’t need right now given that I’ve pushed all my responsibilities until later tonight.\n\nThat being said, I think the next game-changer for human order would be either the fall of our world, speaking socially and/or ecologically. In other words, I reckon if there was some cataclysmic event where human society stopped working or some natural disaster forced that, then we could see a shift to maybe that return of collectivism over the individual. The other event I see triggering an evolution in human world view is the introduction of external matters, so like aliens for example.\n\nExtraterrestrials are interesting, because I think we can all come to a consensus that given the magnitude of the universe and the way we came to being, there’s gotta be life elsewhere. But though we expect that result, it would shock us to hell if we actually came into contact with an “alien.” That jolt of realization would also change our view of humanity. We’re not unique. We’re not special, and we’re subject to the same condition as other beings in the universe.\n\nHaving fleshed that out, I’ll take a gander at that main inquiry here. I couldn’t resist. Since the concept of individualism spawned, we see ourselves as a species that is above everything. There is no limit for human ambition, innovation, or ability. Wanna conquer the stars? Given a perfect world in which we all came together to work on it, we would. Easily. The division of society, our organization into nation-states, cultures, ethnicities, etc., that’s our self-imposed limit I believe. \n\n\n\n
1	I like to view the progress of humanity like a game. Imagine the world being a game, and any progress is linked to the „next level“ which you have to unlock. In order to unlock it, you have to reach a certain level or have to gather enough coins (in this case knowledge) whatever. Which means for now we can just exploit the currently unlocked levels as much as we can, until we evolve enough to be able to unlock the next level. So I think once we‘ve ripened enough, a new level will be unlocked which will drastically influence the progress of the world. \n\nSo to answer your question, if our view of the world is limited to our „current level“, then our progress will also be limited to as much as going as far as you can in your current level. \n\nOnce you‘ve been exposed to the new level, a new view on the world, you‘ll be able to make progress in that level. \n\n**So yes I think our progress is controlled to a great extent by the view we have on our world. We can only make progress as far as our current view allows us to. Only if we unlock a new view we‘ll go to the next level of progress.**\n\nAnd the new revolutionary idea would be the key to unlock the next level of thinking and world view.\n\nOne example for this would be, imagine if our current sciences aren‘t complete. What if there was one more type of science which we haven‘t acknowledged yet. If we would make such a finding, we could *probably* make immense progress. But before we unlock that we wouldn‘t even know of the potential progress we could make. As we currently also don‘t know about all the potentials of the future and the progress it will allow us to take.
1	Individually, I suppose the influence depends on how seriously you take the particular view: If you truly believe in existential nihilism, why do you bother leaving your room? Or if you truly believe that heaven is real and you'll go there when you die, why don't you kill yourself now? I guess it’s needless to say, ultimately, individuals make choices depending on how they regard an idea.\n\nAnd we have those that are so grounded in their views, that they're unable to acknowledge any new sets of data or perceptions. For example, you'll see this often in religion throughout history and even the present in the field of science... the refutation of the Heliocentric Theory, evolution, the creation of the universe. Just look at the impact of the church had on discovery - they quoted the bible against Galileo and eventually locked him in his own house for attempting to prove a controversial idea lol. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs for the present, we rely on science to fill in the blanks of "meaning" and pave the way for humanity's future. Though it's not my department, I *think* we have philosophically matured in accordance with our current knowledge. New philosophical concepts, such as "individuality," *could* arise from scientific discovery, though I have no idea if whatever discovery would lead to a concept that hasn't already been pondered (i.e. finding other intelligent beings in the universe) \n\nThat said, *baby steps* in science have drastically changed the course of humanity and its outlooks thus far. Spontaneous Generation was proposed by the Greeks around ~380 BC, one of the first recorded attacks on the idea was initiated by Redi in the 1600s, and it wasn't officially disproved until 1859 - now, in relation, we understand the origins and preventions of bacterial growth, and have developments in sealants/refrigerants/antiseptics.  Putting it in perspective, we’ve gone from a species that thought that maggots just randomly grew on meat, to a species that can kill 99.99% of viruses and bacteria with a spray canister lol.\n\nEven in recent times, with the discovery of the double helix, we've been able to genetically alter foods and animals, develop vaccines, advance forensics, research the abilities of stem cells, + so much more - giving us a seemingly endless amount of questions.\n\nSo, who knows what we'll see. Perhaps in our lifetimes we'll experience the unfoldings of great scientific discoveries that will change our outlook on the universe. We have an abundance of unanswered questions and science is still hard at work. 
1	I was going to say 'always', and that in recent times one of the most revolutionary ideas might be that space is habitable, or that humans can have a large degree of control over nature. But then I remember that humanity does not just have one view (see politics), and on a related note, things may not get better when the paradigm shifts.
33	Does a snake have a short neck and an elongated bum, or a short bum and an elongated neck? Debate.	And how long is the snake? No sources permitted. 
30	Ah, I see you’ve come across the Snake Bum Conundrum. This question has stumped and perplexed philosophers and scientists alike for ages. Is it a bum? Is it a neck? Is it both? These are all important questions...\n\n...but honestly I think people are *completely* ignoring the bigger picture. After years of searching through works on the subject by the likes of Socrates, Plato, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and 4chan I’ve come to realize that even these geniuses haven’t thought of something else that is practically slapping them in the face: what if a snake has...neither?\n\nI believe I have found the solution to the Snake Bum Conundrum: it has neither an elongated bum/neck nor a short bum/neck...it is in fact...a long, slithering head. \n\nThink about it: When a rain drop drops do we call it snow? When a fruit fly flies do we call it a banana?? Ha! No, no, no.\n
20	Neither. Snakes have an elongated chest. vertebrae are identified by characteristics and location relative to other skeletal structures.\n\nMost of a snake's spine supports its rib cage, making those vertebrae thoracic. Thus, a snake had a short neck, very long chest, short belly and bum, and (relative to cats or dogs) a proportionally short tail.\n\n>And how long is the snake? No sources permitted.\n\nThe snake is precisely 8 long.
7	Snakes have three basic parts: head (and neck), body, and tail. The body is the long part. Snakes' tails are actually really short compared to their body. Their tails start after their cloaca. You can usually tell when their body turns into their tail by a sudden decrease in thickness. Their necks are also very short in comparison to their bodies.\n\nSource: I have snek.
6	*In My own experience it depends on whose hand it is*
6	I'm not an expert into snakery, but... Wouldn't most of the spine of a snake be constitued of thoracic vertebrae? \n\nSo, neither? Short neck, short tail, elongated torso.
4	It's where the throat ends and the esophagus begins
3	They call him a snek cause he’s 90% neck
3	SNAKE 🐍 \n\nVery big!!! L O N G snake! 🐍 \n\nOoooo no he’s comin to lick 👅 !!!\n\nNeck’d snake m’neck 🍑 \n\nNeck’d Becky butter snake (everything’s good but her snake)\n\nYou get it 🐍 snake <- - -\n\nHow fresh! How bum? How bum there’s a snake, hmm?  \n\nI’m putting you on the case:\n\n🐍 🔎\n\nWhat a twist 
6	Neither, snakes are just one big spine. It's completely irrelevant when you think about the fact that SNAKES HAVE TWO PENISES. (Peni? Penus? Penusi? Peniseseses?)
2	Elongated spine and everything followed
1	 Long bum 
1	Snake: begin from snake, end at snake.\n\nCharacteristics of snake: Long bum, short neck, elongated body. Big snake. Small snake. Medium snake (normal and proportional).\n\nHistory of snake: worm -> snaek -> snake\n\n\n
1	Neither the anatomy of a snake (bone structure) consists from top to bottom. Skull, neck, ribs, vertebrae, and tail. 
1	I'm going to need you to define long, short, neck, and bum. Then I'd be willing to debate
0	What is the source for Morality?	1. What does Morality originate in and\n2. What sustains it?\n\nI know but I just want to see how my fellow ENTP's go at it or if they have pondered it before.
5	Morality is tough.  I'd say morality probably originates from humanity evolving into what we would call society today, as opposed to the early hunter-gathering humans.  If we're all to live in close quarters with each other, we have to have a set of loosely based rules to stop each other from just killing everyone and taking their shit.  \n\nMorality in it's macro sense probably came from the first people who accumulated their equivalent of wealth and sought to protect it by controlling others. You see examples like this all throughout religious scripture.  I find it difficult to believe that the first large communities came together purely for the common good.  It was probably more like "If you behave in this sort of way, while it may cause suffering for you and your family in this life, you will be rewarded when you die."\n\nPersonally, I take a very utilitarian approach to morality and try to live by the golden rule, since unless explicitly told what another individual values, that's all I really have to go on.  I try not to cause unnecessary suffering, and as long as I'm not hurting anyone, I feel free to do whatever I want without being bound by some moral judgement from a being up in the sky.\n\n
5	Morality is a necessary side effect of human civilisation. Any civilisation or even primitive society requires some kind of trust in your fellow human being before anything can work. Thus, we create rules for ourselves and others to abide by.
2	Logic
2	1. I think it originates from a human’s need to bring order to their system to function properly. Order which cannot be determined by laws and are not clearly measurable thus cannot be punished by law, need a moral code of conduct to stick to. **„(unspoken) Laws which cannot be enforced but are necessary in order to have a harmonious civilization.“**\n\nI think morality is one of the only things that should be universal. Everyone should stick to the one same principle of morality. Which should be, in my opinion, that **anything that doesn‘t hurt or harm anyone else in any way, is proper moral and anything that would hurt others in any way, is morally improper.**\n\n2. What sustains it („it“ as in good moral) would be the cooperation of everyone to stick to this morality.\n\n
1	There's no such thing as morality.  It was invented by philosophers in the olden times to give themselves something to do. 
1	Eh, no need for morals. Ya know that quote by the joker? "You see, people are only as good as the world allows them to be"
1	The same entity that is the source of all existence. What we call this entity is of lesser importance.

-4	YOU ARE ALL BELOW ME, FOR AN ENTP WITH INTELLIGENCE IS A GIFT TO SOCIETY BUT AN ENTP WHO LACKS PROPER THOUGHT IS AN ANNOYING HYENA... AND FOR THE MOST PART YOU ARE ALL HYENAS.
3	What it means to be stupid?	In your opinion? What stupidity even is? \nAlso, do you think that there are many types of intelligence? Similar question ; what it even mean to be intelligent? \n
9	The inability to process information, acquire knowledge, or adapt to novel situations due to cognitive or neural limitations. 
10	I've always thought of stupidity as a form of stubbornness - refusing to come to the logical conclusion despite all the facts being right there in front of you, due to your own internal biases.
5	For me being stupid means, not realizing that you can learn *anything*.\n\nAnd as a contrast being intelligent means, **knowing that you can learn anything**. I would also add that for me intelligence means **to think for yourself**. This includes being able to think beyond what everyone else has already thought of and of course also thinking critically. \n\nI think there are definitely many types of intelligence.\n\nUsually the lack of acknowledgement of that fact makes people think of themselves as superior (and „more intelligent“) in the first place, they fail to realize that they‘re just superior in *one particular thing*, not superior as a whole.\n\nI would say some examples are, and MBTI is a great tool to show intelligence can be distinguished, for NT types to have intellectual/academical intelligence. ST types have practical/hands-on intelligence. SF types have sensory/emotional intelligence, and NF types have creative/abstract intelligence.\n\nThese were just generalizations and some spontaneous thoughts, but I think I got my point across. If you would compare me to an ISTP, the ISTP would think I‘m dumb because I‘m so clumsy, but in brainstorming and generating ideas I would probably have the upper hand.
3	I think being stupid means lacking self-awareness,  not being aware of one’s own limitations and weaknesses. Not being able to rise above instinct.
2	Being content with one's current level of knowledge makes someone stupid.  It's like being frozen in time.  So basically, lack of intellectual curiosity is what does it.\n\nThink of it like this:  If after graduation from high-school, you choose to learn only things that are basically forced on you (like work-related information, those sorts of things) you are probably closer to average intelligence for your age group than you will be for the rest of your life.  As time goes on, if you lack the same level of intellectual curiosity as your graduating class, you begin to lose the knowledge you gained in school due to distance in time to said information, and you fail to acquire new knowledge.  \n\nThis eventually results in life just sort of happenning to you.  You have no idea what the fuck is going on, or any idea what the consequences of your choices might be.  That's how you end up a knuckle-dragging potato.
5	On a related note- do you understand how to use a question mark properly?  I'm not sure you do.  You can't just say something and then slap a question mark on it to make it become a question.  \n  \nHere, I'll give an example:  \n  \nYou are an idiot.  <--- statement  \n  \nYou are an idiot? <--- still just a statement, but now with a random question mark at the end  \n  \nPerhaps you could ask, "Are you an idiot?"  \n  \nAnd we might say, "Yes"
2	>In your opinion? What stupidity even is?\n\nIn opinion of mine OP stupidity even is. ?\n\n[Related](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/475/HasANyone.jpg)
1	Intelligence is capability with a certain cognitive function, and yes there are multiple types of intelligence that includes memory, emotional, creativity ect. But there are many more types we most likely haven't categorised yet... hell we don't even understand the examples I just gave properly.
33	How do INTP and ENTP humor differ?	How does Ti supported by Ne humor compare to Ne supported by Ti?
80	I have no idea, but I can answer it with a short story that always makes me laugh that may or may not actually answer your question very well\n\nMy brother (an INTP) and sister were once talking behind my back as I stepped out of an ice cream shop line about how easy it was to make me laugh. He spent some time really carefully thinking about/crafting a joke in his head. When I got back into line, my brother said to me "Why is it always chocolate flavors that are labelled "dangerous" and "lethal"? Why don't you ever see, I dunno, Death By Strawberry on a menu?"\n\nAnd I immediately was like "oh... ...huh. That's a great question. No, wait— it's because of connotation and marketing, right? Because people connotate fruit to being healthy, and chocolate is unhealthy, so if you want to sell someone chocolate you call it *indulgence*, because they wanna be sinful right, they wanna die by the sin of it, while fruit ice cream people are more likely to get if they think it's a healthier choice... right? What d'you think?"\n\nHe was so heartbroken that I'd actually tried to turn his joke into a conversation about marketing and hadn't just laughed lmao, and then I actually laughed so hard I couldn't get my ice cream order out when I found out it was supposed to be this really careful and precise observational joke, especially after a convo about how easy I was to make laugh
29	i think we both get labeled as the annoying smartass when we're trying to have fun
21	I have a theory based on my observation of the many INTPs in my life. Those INTPs tend to find truly funny things that go against social conventions in some way. Maybe not nessecarily off-colour humour, but sometimes. Sometimes surreal, absurdist humour, grim-dark, anything that gives a mild shock to conventions of taste. That's what will give them a real belly laugh.\n\nSo if that theory holds, ENTPs should find funny things that appeal to Si, maybe anecdote humor, stand up, funny memories, or maybe something that defies that, revisionist history sketches? You'd have to tell me, I don't know if I know many ENTPs 😌\n\nI'm sure it's not exclusive or.
13	INTP Overengineered their jokes.
34	Well, my sense of humor is kind of like this.\n\nThe other day some guy was like "hey how much do you think a plane ticket is to Canada"\n\nI responded, "Probably depends, for example if you live in Canada it probably won't cost much"\n\nStupid humor, basically. It's how I amuse myself, but whether the other person laughs or not is a different story lol
12	I think you guys (INTPs) quietly contemplate the absurdity and stupidity of those around you and derive humour from quietly satirising society.\n\nI think we (ENTP) also see that absurdity, but we knowingly wind people up by confronting them with the reality that much of what they care about is a load of bollocks.\n\nYou guys inwardly satirise, we outwardly take the piss
7	i have an extremely sexual humour
5	My younger brother (intp) and I (entp) have one side of humour we share and another that we are on polar opposites about. \n\nWe both like scenario-based humour, where build stories or ideas starting from one crazy idea. \n\nHe likes dry puns, and I hate them\n\nI like random stupid noises, and he hates them\n\nBut that's just my brother and I, and everyone hates us when we are together cuz we take EVERYTHING to the extreme, you will either be on the floor pissin yourself, or want to leave because how badly that joke horse can be beaten. 
4	My humor is quite similar to the one this guy  have :\n\n[https://www.netflix.com/es/title/80223685](https://www.netflix.com/es/title/80223685) and also the humor from jake peralta, is just too similar.\n\nAnd the delivery is similar aswell i cant help but smile at my own jokes.\n\nWhile as with intps they deliver humor dead serious and very crafted well if we go on joks, if we go with goofyness theyre  very similar except for the dead face, im too expresive compare to them except if i focus on being dead pan for comedic porpuse but i seldom do.\n\nAlso they tease nd probe people quite a lot with their humor, checking if people will fall for their antics, thats something i have seen only mostly istps and intps do.
4	> How do INTP and ENTP humor differ?\n\nENTPs are actually funny.
9	I reckon they're almost identical.
3	I know for me being an entp and my best friend being an Intp the biggest difference is delivery. He can make me laugh because I can appreciate his cleverness and detail to his joke, but it's usually dry and hit or miss with most people. While I seem to have a little more enthusiasm and energy when delivering the joke, i.e loud noises and lots of gesticulation. In conclusion intp can usually make other nt types laugh but seem almost uncomfortable taking the floor while entp can usually get a laugh out of anyone regardless of the context of the joke due to there social capabilities. 
3	I'd say very similar humour and on top of that nothing I can really say freaks my ENTP girlfriend out, as long as I don't put violent or disgusting images in her mind because she visualises everything I say immediately. 
3	INTP humor is them being a jackass and not really feeling bad about it for the first time because it *actually works.* They're reeeaally funny when they're confident but a lot of the time they either sound angry, anxious, or just constipated. This is from MY experience with several of them, they come off like INTJs when they're funny but it eventually gets hampered by that  Ti/Fe. They get detached and don't follow up with more humor or commentary (like INTJ). The problem seems to be Ti is over time but they can't grasp the matching Ne because it's *Ne*. And also they're afraid of coming off as douchey or self absorbed or just sticking out.\n\nENTP humor is more of a circle jerk kind of endeavor. Try to out wit me or I will keep talking but don't actually out wit me just let me win but don't let me win make it look like you took damage when you lost to me. This may not be how we come off but this is the UNDERLYING ESSENCE of all our humor. We're generally an affectionate ENFJ minus the actual investment; we're not that interested. Our issue is most likely too much processing the Ne and so we incessantly 'keep trying' until we find something that's the right measure of funny for whatever thing we were talking about. (This can get annoying and obnoxious as you can imagine and I think the average ENTP is fully aware).
2	My boyfriend is an INTP & I'm ENTP generally we have almost the same humor.. except he can take things litteraly or get fixated on details, so he sometimes misses the point. \nI showed him a screenshot of a girl who made a joke about her Wifi and sexism combined, where a man explains her joke, by mansplaining why it makes sense. When clearly she mad the joke in the first place. \nMy boyfriend doesn't understand what's funny about it, because he is fixated on their choice of words, which for an CTO(programmer) is incorrect.\nI end up explaining it multiple times and then he gets it, but can't get over the incorrectnes and uses so much time to explain me why they're both wrong. 
2	I find INTPs to be a lil more ludicrous and a lil less deadpan.  \n\n\nI have three INTPs in my life and they're always cracking the silliest of jokes at me. On the bright side, they totally work. Sometimes, they won't understand my joking back at them, but usually they get it when I play-argue about their joke. \^\_\^
2	All the intps I know and am close to are really funny and absurdist. They both rely on shock value but deliver it completely deadpan. I think the reason it's so funny is that they're completely monotone and there's a disconnect to how wild what they're saying is. As far as I know, my humor is more sarcastic. I've been told I'm really good at telling stories, like for instance, if my friend and I saw something crazy, they'd tell me to tell the story bc I'd be able to make it funny. You'd think entps would be more absurdist in their humor but from what I've observed both in myself and professors (I get so many entp profs) is that we tend to use more fe with our humor. We watch for reactions and adapt. If it's off-kilter, it's less for pure shock value and more bc we noticed we can get a laugh from it.
2	Personally most of my jokes are just random sarcastic and snappy one liners that fit and gentle or sometimes not ao gentle jabs at friends. \nOther than that, puns. Puns are always good. The worse the better. 
1	INTPs' is more dad joke style but not always. There's the spontaneous Ne fireback one liner, also characteristic infps'. ENTPs' humor is more demonstrative and physical, similar to other EPs. They also love non sequiturs and do them well. 
1	I think INTP humor is more dry. (My best friend is an INTP). She keeps such a straight face when telling jokes :o I also think that her sense of humor is more intelligent than mine. It really doesn't take much to make me laugh. For example, the other day one of my friends, (who has a trampoline), said, "I wonder how many trampolines are spring free these days", to which I responded "well, all trampolines are spring free... except the ones that have springs." I laughed at my own joke for like 5 minutes while my friend just shook her head 😂\n\nAdditionally, I think INTPs tend to be more selective when it comes to telling/sharing jokes. I'll just tell a bunch of jokes and see what works 💁🏼‍♀️
1	I'm an intp and my best friend growing up was an entp. We are both people others would describe as very funny and we make each other laugh a lot. \n\nMy humor: is very clever and witty, often anecdotal, often involves me acting and embodying other personas directly (like possessed, it's imitation of life). Often my humor is also very dark. I have a unique ability to laugh at forbidden topics, but also to do or say forbidden things in a comedic context and get a laugh. For example, I can get away with telling a black guy a racist joke and the two of us will not experience any relational tension. \nMy humor is rebellious and defiant and doesn't care if you're offended because I'm usually speaking from a place of both flow and precision. My charm IS how fucking weird I am, and how fully comfortable being an outlier I am. \nBecause much of my humor is "what if..." "don't you think..." or "this one time..." and anecdotal, it is very honest. I don't lie for a joke, I just tell the truth because to me, nothing is funnier than an inconvenient or startlingly obvious  truth or parable.\n\nMy best friend is also very witty and good with word play. His jokes often contain references anybody with a rudimentary knowledge of pop culture would laugh along with. He sees patterns and communicates them in such a way that is non threatening. He can also approach topics like race in a safe way, but he's safe because he feels like he genuinely embraces mainstream values. He can build bridges between two dissimilar people with his humor, and a lot of his jokes involve pointing out the obvious, making analogies, saying things in a very funny way (for example, if he admired another guy, he might say something with the sentiment of "I would go gay for that guy he's so great," but he would actually say "I'm ski-poles for Obama." If you didn't get it, he would make a motion like he was giving a guy on his left a hand job while he did the same to a guy on his right, so it looked like he was SO gay for Obama he'd have sex with two of them, using their penises like ski-poles. Sorry. It's hard to explain without gesturing and context). He teases people a lot and engaged in verbal horseplay. His humor respects and manipulates social hierarchies in a way mine does not. \n\nHis humor is potent for a different reason than mine: it is potent because it is good at figuring out what the people around him will actually be receptive to, and delivering exactly that. He doesn't mimic life or act things out so much as he tries to appear as cool and funny to the people he's to whom he is speaking.  He will lie for a joke, or tell a fake anecdote.  \n\nHis humor is much better for people who don't like to think too hard to appreciate a joke\nMy humor is much better for anybody with a good gearbox in their brain. \nBoth of us have "smart humor" I feel, but his feels like lower hanging fruit. \n\nWe are both good chameleons comedically in that we don't tend to ever embarrass ourselves in front of our crowds. That is, we can both adapt to be funny in any context with any person, but our skill sets are very different. \n\nIt's nickleback vs nirvana. \n\nHis humor feels refined but maybe too perfect at times. It is motivating and builds comraderie. My humor feels raw and dirty but real and refreshing. It's perceptive and builds intimacy.\n\nAside from those differences, we both tend to have similar topical ranges. 
1	Ya'll must meet the most undeveloped INTP's possible. Nothing straight-faced or dry about my humor... I'm goofy as fuck, make random noises/faces/performances, and take constant risks for immediate pay-off.
1	My humor is Ne, so usually some absurd scenario that starts with "What if...", a silly comparison that starts with "It's as if..." or turning someone's words back at them.
19	How Do You Experience​ Music?	Music is a huge part of my life. I have a few reasons I listen to music and I would love to hear other ENTP's relationship to music. Here is mine:\n\nThe first way: I love enjoying well thought out music cerbrally; enjoying the compisition or musicianship in a piece. Secondly I love listening to music from a much more emotional place; for lyrics, my own attached meanings, ect. Nostalgia plays a big piart in this.  Lastly I use music as a social tool to set an upbeat vibe or desired mood amongst a gathering of friends. How does this relate to your own expirience?
16	I like the lyrics. I always used to say they speak my heart for me. Because i can not. And i love to attach my own emotional meaning to it
9	I relate to pretty much all of what you just said 
8	>How Do You Experience​ Music?\n\nThrough my ear holes.
4	With Molly.
3	Idk why but I can't just listen I have to be doing something mindless like walking or driving to listen to music, but I usually first just enjoy the music, then if I develop an interest I will dig into the lyrics and decyper the true meaning of it, lastly fallowed by learning to play the song and memorizing the lyrycs.
2	Hmm... how do I experience music? I listen to it.\n\nBut what is music to me? How important is it? I go through waves of listening to a lot of music and the periods where I barely listen to any at all. I get bored with music quickly, so I’m always trying to find new things to listen to, but I can be quite nostalgic about music from the past or my childhood that meant something to me or reminds me of a certain feeling, and I’ll often listen to that.\n\nI have a habit of finding a new song and listening to it on repeat until it’s ruined.\n\nSometimes I prefer music without lyrics because I am not hampered by someone else’s experience and truth that I can’t relate to since music can be very personal. \n\nI have strange/eclectic taste in music. I have several xSTP and xSFP friends, and I’d say music seems a more important thing for them than the xNTPs I know, almost to the point of compulsion. They like to go wild at a concert or party. They always have to have music on. Where for me it’s less about wanting to dance or let loose and more a personal, reflective experience where I want to be alone with my thoughts, listening to a good song, and letting my mind go where it will. I for this reason tend to enjoy more... I guess you could call it cerebral music, with abstract lyrics, and enjoy less things like pop or R&B... at the same time I hate Indie that takes itself too seriously, or is being overly ironic in an attempt to be cute or clever without actually adding anything of value. Authenticity I guess is important to me. 
2	Depends:\n\nI ike to either disect what's in the recording.\n\nOr in the case of mainstream repepetitive simple songs(not all mainstream are boring but i mean those that are)\n\nI'd loop them for a few days then forget they ever existed(some stick somehow , but very few).\n\n&#x200B;
2	Got two modes really, Intricate or heartbreakingly sad.\n\nAs for intricate the lyrics, tune or the likes needs to be complicated, for lack of a better term. A great jazz or blues does this very well usually. I'm also a big fan of old school rappers and some of the new folk (Eminem's lyrics are amazing) or in general lyrics or tune that relays and underlying message (metaphorical lyrics which mean something entirely different from what is being said, or the dissonance of a happy tune to fucked up lyrics, like Pumped Up Kicks)\n\nAs for heartbreakingly sad, I'm usually intoxicated by one substance or the other, and just let go. I recently found myself capable of crying again, which was really bloody odd as it'd been near 15 years since gramps funeral, but now if i'm fucked up and listen to "In the arms of the angel" or "What are words" or any of those super sappy ones I'm bawling. Feels real good.\n\nPs. Guilty pleasure is various The Voice/Talent/Whatever auditions, not the over-the-top emotional ones, but that deaf lady who kills it for instance, dayum.
2	I like to listen to music while doing another activity such as studying, working out, reading, cleaning, cooking, etc. In terms of the music itself, the lyrics are equally as important as the instrumentals in my opinion. If I don't like the lyrics, I'll find an instrumental cover of the song instead.\n\nI also really love how universal music is. I can get music recommendations from people on the other side of the world, and I can listen to the exact same song that they've listened to. It's crazy how much music can connect people. When I relate to a song super hard and find someone else who also relates, I feel emotionally closer to that person... (if this makes sense). Someone else mentioned how they were poor at speaking their emotions so they let music do it for them, and I completely relate to this!\n\nAnother ENTP music trend I've noticed is our tendency to wear songs out... (I personally blame it on my obsessive personality). For example, I'll memorize an entire Eminem song, and then drop it in a couple of weeks. The only good thing about obsessing over singular songs is the nostalgia they can induce when hearing the songs years later. By loving a song/album/artist so much, you can begin to associate their music with a certain time period in your life which I find absolutely fascinating :D
2	I play a play in my head when I listen to music. It's never just the song itself that makes me love a song, it's the daydream I can act out in my head while listening.
1	I’m a musician lol also write my bands lyrics 
1	The way I have been experiencing music is by DJ different genres. I learned that ENTP'S could use audio Attentiveness to listen for beats to do beat matching into a sequence of sounds. I have a hypothesis that Ne helps with the variation of music, Ti correlates the progression of the rhythm,. Fe allows for the emotional relations between people i.e harmony.\n\n\n"Musical training is a more potent instrument than any other, because rhythm amd harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten, imparting grace, and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful, or of him who is ill-educated ungraceful." - Socrates\n\n
1	I'm a professional composer and a pianist, so music is everything to me
1	I'm a litzomaniac, so it's essentially a drug. 
1	My favorite kind of music is the kind where a musician or group of musicians plays something *impossible.* It can either be due to the technical skills of the musicians or because the musical compositions are completely novel. I want to hear a band play so goddamn good that I start laughing. 
1	Do you like edm?
1	If I like the tune then I'll listen. Simple
1	yeah for me the actual "sound" of the song can be really shit as long as there are some dope lyrics. 
1	I hear the sound. I see the colors. I taste the notes. I smell the harmony of the chords. And finally I take in the experience. 
9	Theory about Atlantis being located in the Eye Of The Sahara. Thoughts?	
18	I think Aristotle got it right. It's a place Plato made up to serve as a contrast to his perfect state.
2	I saw this a few weeks ago. Looks promising. Although would need full on proper evidence to actually prove it.
39	I HAVE A THEORY! On how to explain how ideologies work in the brain. And I NEED YOUR HELP!	Been working on this analogy/metaphor for a while. Just want to see ya guys opinion on how to make it sound so epic that it will catch anyone's attention. \n\nLet's get started. \n\nThink of your mind as a plot of land, and upon that land, you (your conscience) are on that land. When you are young, your parents, family and/or friends come to your land and try plant seeds ( seeds are ideas/ideologies ), which is then up to you to decide to let them plant them/take them from them and you will further research into it/throw them away cause they are bad. \nNow the seeds that you kept on your land will grow, some need nourishment (go out and finding knowledge on the ideologue), some will grow on their own (being taught constantly about it) and some will wither ( the knowledge that was formerly learned was either false or has faded).\nThe ground is your life, all the energy (information) that flows through it is what you receive everyday knowingly or unknowingly. So ideas that are planted in fertile ground, grow big, and expanding roots that can reach all across your land. \nThe way we view that outside world is through the plants, they are the filter/lens we see the (outside) world. Not to worry though, you can make your own plants too. \nSo what's the catch?\nWhat is all this suppose to explain?\nIt's a good general idea but there already are other ways to explain this. \n\nWhat type of seeds were planted?\nWho planted those seeds?\nWhat if I told you that some of those seeds will grow into a parasitic plant?\nWith vastly expanding roots that can latch onto other roots. \nWhich to you above ground look like beautiful flowers, that show the world in a gorgeous way. Would you tear it out?\nBut why would those be bad? \nIs it because it relies on other viewpoints to stay alive?\nThat it's roots aren't strong enough?\nThat it's stock is weak and fragile, since it has very little to stand on? \nBig trees with strong roots need not be taken care of, they stand on their own. There view may not be pretty, but I need not water them. Nor do I need to be afraid of anyone tearing them out, they are strong enough to withstand anyone's test. \nBut my flowers... so weak, but so beautiful, I am the one who has to protect them... from the dangers of the world. I've built walls for them, and they call them excuses... they don't understand. Must build more walls. They do not see the joy the flowers bring, they just want to tear them out. They say it will help me... I must keep them away from my land, and destroy any seeds they try to give me. That's what will help me protect my flowers.\nI'll grow more flowers and share it with others who's lands lay barren, and they will see the beauty I see, and prove those who think I'm wrong that they are the ones who are wrong. \nAcross the way, on a different land dwells a forest. You will never be able to see my flowers in that ugly forest. Must find a way to get rid of that forest, or should I build more walls?\n Should I built a fortress and close off everything?\nCan I teach the world to see why this fragile flower is better than any stupid tree?\nThey say the trees are truth, but what do they know?\nWhat kind of delusion must one suffer if given bad seeds? From their very own parents? From the ones they loved?\nThe disconnect from the world or from themselves? 
9	What‘s sad is that once you‘ve built all those walls to protect your flowers nobody will be able to see the beauty of the flower anymore except you. And the sacrifice you have to make to protect your fragile flower will be that it‘s beauty will be forgotten. So if we think of those walls as defense mechanisms, is it really the right approach to protect the flowers with walls? Because a defensive approach will just make the walls between your idea and the opposing ideas bigger. And the opposing party won‘t stop to think about the beauty of the flower, it will just see the defense wall. So maybe a better approach to keep your flowers alive is to show everyone how beautiful they are, and make them appreciate them too. To do that you cannot rip off the flower and let it die in order to go to someone else‘s land and show them, because the beauty will be temporary and it will be quick to die for good. But if you can make others visit your land and watch it in person, then they might be able to see the beauty. Which means that to make your ideas be appealing to someone, don‘t go to others territories with your idea and expose your ideas with the risk of it dying, but make sure that the ones open-minded enough to give it a shot will step in your territory and try to see it from your point of view, only then the effort to make them see the beauty will be worth it.\n\nI think you did not make it too straight forward. Since it is all metaphors, one can further elaborate on these metaphors. Like I just did. But if you want to learn more about an open-ended approach to present someone an idea, read a bit about Socrates I‘d say. He was known for having open-ended discussion where the other person needs to come up with the ultimate answer themselves, because if you told them what to believe it would all lose its purpose. In your case it would be inviting a stranger to plant seeds in your yard. Make people understand through your metaphors maybe the pros and cons and make it open-ended like that. Now this is long but I‘ll continue\n\nYou could say explain things like you did and make them understand the consequences. Like should some stranger plant seeds, or should we just take the seeds and contemplate whether to seed them. Should we accept any seeds at all? Should we deliberately search for seeds. Give some real life examples. Maybe people will understand that what they‘ve been doing had this and that effect on them. And you might make them reconsider on how to handle such seeds in the first place. But the choice should be up to them. Sorry this advice wasn‘t so good, but I tried.
5	I don't think ideologies actually work that way tbh but I'm too lazy to reconstruct my argument so i'l just copy paste what I said in another thread:\n\nIMO the reason we have ideologies in the first place is because people are lazy and need a way to save time and effort thinking about stuff. Having a consistent theoretical framework immediately gives you some way to process whatever information you receive, regardless of how far off the mark that ends up taking you.\n\nI think ideologies also exist as a self-protection mechanism to serve the psychological needs of whoever subscribes to them. If you can figure out some way to rationalize your values/personality into a theoretical framework, you now have something to do with information that threatens your identity as a person, and possibly even a way to rationalize your own bad behavior. You could probably go so far to say that an ideology is really just an externalized map of the mind or a personality profile of whoever created it, and that nobody is immune from thinking in ideological terms because we all have inherent "ideologies" of our own, even if we don't know how to articulate them. This could also be why philosophers still debate and why no perfect ideology has ever existed, since we are all doomed to processing the external world through our own personal framework.\n\nCould this mean that all debate is futile since if the above is true it necessarily comes down to who is better prepared \[regardless of who has more facts on their side\]?
2	So we know these seeds can be stolen -extracted from the subject, so could one be planted?\nWe have to go deeper.
1	I believe making it too straight-forward won't allow people to think for themselves, because most ideas that you believe are ones "you came up with yourself", you spent the most time figuring out why it made sense, so it would only make sense if you were the one to make sense of all of it, right?
1	Yea it's good a bit simplistic but over all good (I mean simplistic in the way of the actual idea not presentation). Although the best metaphors are short or if they are long they cannot be presented as a metaphor but only through a metaphor.
1	Whoah Adderall
1	Yeah, sounds clever. ever since my brother talked to me about the love for my country and being a patriot i've been a nationalist.
27	How do other ENTPs react to cheating in a relationship and/or betrayal?	A while back (about 6 months ago) I was involved in a seemingly intimate relationship. Being an entp it’s already hard to trust others, and believe me when I say I trust almost no one. This girl earned my trust, and completely had me head over heels and I thought it was the same way, thought it might lead to something life long. Well that is, until I found out that she had been cheating on me with her “best friend.” Anywho, long story short, I kicked her out of my life completely without so much as an explanation. It’s been awhile but even so, I still get enraged by the thought of her and feel immense emotional pain on bad days. I’ve even went so much as to do a check on my current friends and kicked some of them out of my life out of fear of being betrayed again. \n\nWhat are some of your experiences and thoughts on the matter? 
29	Kicking her out of your life was fine, but if your friends hadn’t done anything and you just dropped them...that’s not good. 
12	This sucks, sorry to hear that. But kicking some of your friends out of your life simply because of your trust issues isn't doing justice to them. Perhaps next time you could be more careful with what you reveal around them and maintain some kind of distance instead of cutting contact altogether.\n\n
6	I think clarity is something very important.\n\nI've "categorized" my friends, there are 3 that I simply assume they would never betray me, and live by that.\n\nThis relieved me a lot.
5	If someone treats me like shit I cut them off or ghost them. Ain't nobody got time for that shit. I'm sorry to hear about your scenario. It's easier said than done but forgiving/forgetting (not saying you ever have to talk to her again) will improve your mental health immensely. 
3	I've never been cheated on, but I have felt betrayed by a friend in the past. I'm sorry to hear about your situation, OP.\n\nPersonally, I'd say the costs of cutting people out of your life as a reaction to being cheated on significantly outweigh the benefits of such action. However, I don't know your personal circumstances. As you stated elsewhere in this thread, these friendships may be otherwise toxic, in which case it may very well be beneficial to cut off ties.\n\nThat being said, to assume that because one person betrayed you, most others will betray you as well is irrational. It's coming to a big conclusion with very little data. You are allowing your emotional pain to guide you rather than your rationality. Of course, one must deal with emotional pain. However, while you may experience some short-term relief from cutting people people whom you think *may* betray you in the future, there may be a long-term cost of losing out on social interactions and feeling lonely.\n\nMy general advice is to hold people at arm's length until they prove otherwise. I have some "friends" (third tier, I guess) who I don't really trust with anything, but they're fun and smart and interesting and I always learn a lot from them when we hang out. I have friends who I sort-of trust, because they're generally good people who have been faithful to their promises in the past. Then I have friends whom I can really trust, because I've known them for years and because they've never let me down. Of course, it's always nice to have a failsafe just in case. But, for most intents and purposes, it'd be a complete waste of my mental and emotional resources to assume everybody is going to stab me in the back all the time. 
3	I drop the person and act like we were never friends, so extremely cold. I enjoy hurting these people and can easily see it written all over their faces.
3	I Know I had a girl really push for me to be open and vulnerable way to much and I just kept moving around it. One day I had made her dinner and we stayed up all night talking and cuddling on the couch, she proceeded to tell me that she had been raped and open up to me emotionally "like she had never done" (her own words). I later found out she had been dating two other guys and told them different stories i.e abortion and abuse, but one line remained the same " I've never opened up to anyone like this". I Never spoke to her again even though she texted me maybe 15 times a day for a while. Ghosted her. The bummer was her brother was a good friend but to this day I haven't spoken to him. I had to cut everything she was connected to out of my life in one quick cut. Mainly because I didn't trust myself to not crush her. If I had seen her again I would have dated her and made her Happy, lied to her and make her feel like I was opening up, and then when the time was right expose that I had been cheating all along and destroy her. But hey that's just me.

7	The others are saying it‘s unhealthy and it might be. But I‘ve done the same. Kicking someone out of my life without explaining much, and when 2 out of 5 of my friends betrayed me, I was this close to cut off contact with the rest of those 3 too. I‘m glad I didn‘t. It was just the fear of being abandoned. But if you‘ve had a reason to get rid of some of your friends then that‘s good. 
2	Oh man only time I got cheated on I was so pissed. Like walking around the streets at night at 2am punching shit, pissed. I was so angry with her, had to cut her out too. On the other hand, you cutting off your friends is a no no. I mean, if you got a feeling they would betray you then you were just saving yourself the heart ache. Do you believe cutting them off was irrational and unhealthy or do you feel better after doing so? 
2	byeeeeeee
1	same as you, I cut them off and never speak to them again or acknowledge their presence (I never speak about them either).
1	Meh, I just lowered my expectations and abandoned most rules. Hard to cheat if there are few rules ;) 
1	In relationships I think about how I can make the most out of a situation. I identify the nature of my relationships and determine if I want to cultivate long term or short term relations depending on who the person is, their values, beliefs and usefulness to me.\nRelationships are pretty straight foward, you give people what they want in order for you to get what you want from them. Successful relationships are successful trades.\nIf they don't do what you expected then you change the nature of the relationship.\nIf she cheats then the contract is violated, either you continue the relationship on new terms (for instance sex friends while you find a new girlfriend if that's what you want) or discontinue altogether and focus your time on more productive things. If she is still useful to you somehow like for instance if she has something else you need than love then you can fake it and take it. Time to think things through 
1	I deal with it exactly the same. Also, after situation like that, i'd think of a person so low, that i'd completely train my brain no to think / block all thoughts about that person, because that person is worthless and doesn't deserve a privilege to be in my thoughts
174	What people think ENTP arguing is vs what it actually is	As a response to the thread from earlier.\n\nThe former:\n\n>ENTP: Hey dipshit poptarts are ravioli, prove me wrong  \n>  \n>Some guy: Err well uh ravioli isn't made of graham cracker cr--  \n>  \n>ENTP: Lmao who said ravioli can't be made of graham cracker crust? Who said poptarts are made of graham cracker crust in the first place anyway?  \n>  \n>Some guy: Get away from me before I call the cops\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe latter:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Dude: These new uniforms suck  \n>  \n>ENTP: Yeah, I wonder why the boss gave us hand-stitched tuxedos as uniforms anyway. I mean, this is a Burger King.  \n>  \n>Dude: I dunno I guess the boss thought it'd raise customer satisfaction  \n>  \n>ENTP: That's weird though. I mean, customers don't come in expecting anything fancy and even if they were, food stained tuxedos look way worse than a food stained fast food uniform so it completely defeats the purpose. If they want a classier look why not some kind of fitted polo shirt?  \n>  \n>Dude: I think they said the tuxedos are more durable than the regular uniforms we wear so it drives down the cost of getting them replaced  \n>  \n>ENTP: Yeah but it costs me more to get this thing dry cleaned after every shift than I even make in a day here.  \n>  \n>Dude: Whatever, I'm not having this argument anymore.  \n>  \n>ENTP: Wait hold on I wasn't--  \n>  \n>ENTP: fuck
87	Wait, so you're saying my attempt to reason through something out loud is seen as argueing by others?\n\nWoah (Self awareness+100)
71	First off I think this is on point. I can see some immature ENTPs behaving like the first example tho. 
45	This is case in point! My ex-wife would constantly tell me to quit arguing. I'd be like, I'm just poking holes in your theory until there are no more holes. I'm doing you a favor!
17	Lol I definitely do both of these (more so the second example).  I honestly never knew this was considered arguing.  I just thought it was logical thought process.  \n\nIt pisses my INFP friends off to no end though.  I can logically discuss political topics and not get emotional.  My INFP guy friends on the other hand will get really upset (I almost accidentally made my boyfriend cry with the topic of abortion when I was playing devil's advocate and I actually agreed with him).  
7	I’m ashamed to admit that I have done both
4	I mean.. can't they make uniforms that look like tuxedos?\n \nedit: op you're missing the bigger picture here: https://www.apronwarehouse.com/products/black-pinstripe-vneck-bib-apron?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpPqJmOWl4AIVhCNpCh3dLA98EAQYASABEgLK2fD_BwE
5	You're "arguing" with the wrong kind of person.
2	But I do the first one with my friends. Gets a good chuckle out of everyone honestly. Even it's just bullshit lol
2	Maybe it's just my ENTJ-ness or some shit but I don't really see either one of these as "arguing". \n\nThe first example I just see as really funny, I've had a lot of absolutely hilarious exchanges like that with ENTPs. \n\nThe second example? I see that as a damn discussion and usually discussions like that are quite productive! I don't think of that kind of an exchange as being argumentative at all. 
2	The amount of times I had to explain to a third party overhearing me taking with friends that "were just having a conversation" instead of arguing is uncountable. 
2	This is my favourite reddit post ever.
1	Accurate
1	“Ok that’s it, I’m not arguing with you about this anymore!!!😡😡😡”\n\nWait what
1	Lol this whole time I was like wow entp is making some good points lol. I was waiting for the argument and realized what entp argument is is reasoning. 
1	In general I open my mouth to talk and discuss ideas or thoughts and then everyone hates me. 
10	I don’t think I’m fit to ever get married.	I’m an ENTP and I’m in a serious relationship with an INFJ and we are planning to get married in the upcoming years. \nThe idea of marriage never appealed to me ever since I was a kid and it has not gotten better within the years. I doubt I’m capable to stick to one person for the rest of my life (not the I love my significant other any less), the sole idea frightens me for some reason. Not forgetting the restrictions that come along marriage, and then shared responsibilities that can stir horrible problems. There are other factors that could affect our choice of lifestyle and the way we raise our kids. Adding more elements in our relationship will purely result in disagreements and hardships on plenty of matters. \nI don’t think I’ve seen enough of the world, and I absolutely haven’t experienced much to be filled to the brim, or to an extent where I’m content to settle in.\nThe biggest problem is, we come from an extremely religious and conservative background, so I can’t even live with him and test the waters if we will manage our lives together.
8	I understand your reservations and that spending the rest of your life with one person seems frightening, and perhaps boring. \n\nAt the same time I think it's vastly about communication with your partner. Your marriage can be what you make it, if you communicate your needs clearly and your partner respects them. It can become a gate to more adventures in your life, rather than confining cell. Marriage doesn't have to be about "settling in", you just have to re-define its meaning for you and your partner.\n\nAlso, is it a possibility for you to move to different country, perhaps go study at university in Europe/USA together? That way you can escape your religious background and try out the relationship without having to marry each other.
5	You sound young.  As an ENTP woman, I know exactly what you mean when you say that marriage has never appealed to you.  Me neither.  It has FINALLY become something I'm ready to seriously consider in the past few months and I'm 27.  Even so, I am not hanging on the thought like many of my peers.  My advice: wait.  Have some adventures.  Enjoy life a little bit before settling.  Your INFJ will either understand and be patient or will decide it's too much and move on.  Either way DO NOT marry someone or settle down with someone before you're ready.
4	Yeah, you definitely shouldn't get married. You do sound young, OP, but it's not worth it to jump into something that appeases your parents (or general cultural framework) just in order to "be together", which I assume means "get laid". You have so many misgivings, which to me sound legitimate. Personally, I think people should never get married unless they truly want to.\n\nThis may be the wrong subreddit for you to discuss these matters, tbh. Most of us here come from a Western democratic background and therefore have very different values/ideals. The advice we provide will likely not speak to your particular context and therefore be of little use. 
2	As you present it I don't think that's nearly worth it. It seems like a bad plan. \n\nDoes your partner know about your doubts and your overall inhability to project into marriage ? Because to me, he should already know and also know that you will freak out eventually. His best chance is waiting for it to come from you. The fact that marriage never appealed to you is not surprising but also not a red flag, I mean, all kind of people get married for all kind of reasons. What seems to be a red flag to me is that "I don't think i've seen enough of the world" stuff. If you feel that way don't go. I mean, as an ENTP, even if you feel ready, you will not REALLY settle and you will not stick to one person. So you should at least feel positive positive now. \n\nMaybe the idea of marriage and not having seen enough are not that related though. Like marriage just epitomizes that absence of future possibilities and discoveries. If so, it is now that you have a problem in your relationship and that you don't feel free. \n\nAnyway, bring that up, if you go along and try to erase your doubts you will freak out 2 months after moving together. His respect of rules will tire you.\n\nTo me, it seems clear that you already know what you wanna do : study abroad with your friends. You'll miss him for a while, find comfort in your not negotiable freedom, then meet someone new, exciting, with the possibility of living the love story at a comfortable rythm. It won't be as hard as you think, promise.
2	Has anybody else been in a situation where you date someone for a while, then they want deeper commitment but you obviously don't give it to them, they constantly ask when will you propose or move in, or why are you so afraid to commit. Finally you reveal why you don't want to get married, they get scared of wasting there time and break up with you. Or as I like to call it the N.T cycle of love 
1	> we are planning to get married\n\nAnd yet:\n\n> The idea of marriage never appealed to me\n\n> I doubt I’m capable to stick to one person for the rest of my life\n\n> restrictions that come along marriage\n\n> shared responsibilities that can stir horrible problems\n\n> more elements in our relationship will purely result in disagreements and hardships on plenty of matters\n\n> I don’t think I’ve seen enough of the world\n\nYou don't seem like you **want** to get married. Why are you forcing yourself?
1	Why get married? What's the point? 
14	[ENTP] ~ Completely Ignored.... by society?	I've been thinking recently about how many people just completely stop talking to me entirely. I have no issue talking to people and getting people's phone numbers into my phone, but then people just fade out and quit responding altogether no matter what's said. This is also after having tons of great conversations over the span of months to even years. (I been reading about Nicola Tesla recently, and he is supposedly also ENTP. Seems he got the cold shoulder a ton as well.  ) [ You all should look up his Autobiography, it's amazing!]\n\nI've noticed this more and more frequently and it's honestly low-key frustrating and depressing. I've gotten to the point in which my phone is completely quiet. \n\nMy point is, \n\nWHAT'S GOING ON HERE?!?! ;_; 
13	Sending text messages is just a shitty medium through which to have a conversation. I only use text to arrange face to face meets.\n\nHaving conversations over text is slow and boring. Don't let people associate slow and boring with you. 
12	Ah, this sounds sucky, sorry man. \n\nI think for a lot of people, having interesting conversations over text just... isn't enough. I get bored myself. I'd prefer to make plans to catch up over drinks than send long, sprawling text message to each other. Therefore, I'm one of those people who just stops responding after a while. I will probably text back weeks later to see if you want to go to a show, though, so you'll know I still like you that way.
6	Entp here. \n\nFollow this guide-line:\n\nPeople you know irl = only text to answer a question or to ask if they want to hang out. \n\nPeople you know online = texting is needed, but if closer online friendships video chat is really good. \n\nRemember, sometimes people move on, and you are attached (in their mind, not yours) to old ideas, so to get rid of that and start anew they let go of everything. Which includes you. \n\nDon't over-think it, cuz you will. \n\nMake new friends, irl, online, and also take a look at some websites that have group outing stuff if needed. \n\n\n(Also Satan loves you as much as he loves me ;)
3	I feel like a lone society reject unless I have someone really close to me I can relate to. Normally that other person is also an outcast in some way. \n\nJust like, 1 close friend who understands me and will always be there ;-; 
3	Texting (to meet) or not texting to talk it doesn't matter for me. I also feel just like you, alone and without any friends (or people to talk) at all.\n\nMy mind decided that no one is my friend (just a few selected ones) and everyone else is either a colleague (from uni or work) or an acquitance. Maybe my personality is too strong for many... 
3	I have no problem meeting people and getting along but finding real friends that I have a real connection with? Well almost never. That and apparently no one wants to "argue with me anytime they say something" 
4	Texting is just wrapping your interesting conversation in a punishment.
2	I'd be one of the offenders so sorry cant help \n\nnote: its not probably not society as a whole, check the ne fe loops
0	I used to think they were great conversations as well and for the most part they were but sometimes we can ramble and the other person is bored throughout it.
2	Marriage is stupid	Discounting religion playing any factor, nor legal/financial benefits... Why do people get married?\n\nIf my SO was going to leave me, I would certainly hope the inconvenience of divorce wouldn't be the thing stopping them.
35	>Discounting religion playing any factor, nor legal/financial benefits... Why do people get married?\n\nDiscounting all the benefits of X, why do people X? 🤦🏾
14	So don’t get married. Easy. 
11	It has less to do with “marriage” than it has to do with a long term relationship. Any long term relationship requires both sides to communicate, solve issues, and be engaged *in* the actual relationship on a constant basis. \n\nThat’s a lot of work. And some people can’t do it for the long haul for whatever reason so when one side stops pulling their weight the whole thing falls apart. It’s a delicate balance and all marriage does is attach a label onto a long term relationship implying that the couple will actually invest the effort. \n\nIt’s kind of like a crutch because the idea of marriage still holds some sort of prestige in the minds of general society. Also, you didn’t mention the social factor. Marriage carries a certain social benefit primarily because it can be a social expectation and therefore a kind of litmus test people check for. 
10	It's a celebration of the relationship. It's publically announcing to everyone that you have found the love of your life. It's the chance for both families to meet each other and celebrate the expansion of the family.\n\nDo you also think birthday parties are stupid? Holidays? It's just a chance to celebrate but marriage is particularly special because you're celebrating a life long commitment which takes a lot of confidence to be able to admit to publically. 
6	It's a signal to each other and people around you, that you take the relationship very seriously and are planning for the long term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt also gives financial security to the spouse that will take care of the children more. (Because he/she will not build their career for quite a long time, so they will need it in case of a divorce, the other party dying, etc.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	Let’s not forget that it also has a lot to do with the rewards of commitment, emotional connection and caring. It’s a testament that you’ll always be there.  \n\nVow to live, learn, communicate,\nCompromise, love, grow together.\n\nThere is nothing I have experienced so far more meaningful than to care for someone. \n\nSo many adventures to be had, experiences, loss, challenges and most importantly growth. Someone who makes me better in ways I don’t currently know.
1	In addition to the good points already made, I'll add that in common law jurisdictions, the inconvenience of divorce is (for the most part) equally present. Being married may also help you if you ever wish to immigrate, depending on your intended country of destination, as most countries look more favourably upon a husband or wife compared to a domestic partner. \n\nI always think that the real "stupidity" is not signing a marriage or relationship contract (e.g., prenup) if either of you has any assets to protect. Even then, I wouldn't call it a stupidity, just a calculated risk. However, some people are more sentimental about such things.\n\nPersonally, I view getting married as an excuse to throw a big party for my and my partner's loved ones. Neither of us are big party people, but it'll probably make our parents happy. Given that we're both motivated to make our parents happy, we'll probably have a small wedding at some point.
1	I for one love the idea of signing a legal contract which penalties shall be determined at its dissolution.\n\nPeople get married for a lot of reasons that ignore what a marriage license actually is. Not to say that it's wrong for everyone but it's also not right for everyone.
1	Agreed. Marriage is a man-made institution. Why can't two people who love each other just be together without some contract?\n\nGuess if people decide to have kids, then there needs to be something binding so one person doesn't just walk away without a penalty.
1	Then don’t marry 
1	It's a commitment that has a psychological effect.    Agreeing to commit to each other for the rest of your life creates a level of trust to share those legal/financial benefits and burdens.     \n\n\nSure, you can have a long term relationship without the commitment and socially it's not even a big deal anymore.   For most people, those arrangements usually don't have the gravitas that standing before witnesses and reciting vows do.   It's largely ceremonial and ritualistic, but that doesn't mean there's no value in it.
1	Ive been curious to know about ENTP'S opinions on marriages as well and supposition served me right. I personally thru experience have grown weary of the politics of relationships. The statistics show more than 50% of marriages end in divorce. Yet that is not counting on the amount of couples that are miserable in their marriage. People have become oversexualized in this day in age that it affects the psyche of humans to desensitize their desires into addiction. Scientificly speaking MRIs do show an affect the brain has to someone they love. It allows a big stream of Dopamine, Serotonin. Making a nerve growth factor (NGF). The hypothalamus makes the Hormones for pitutary gland which contain oxytocin and vasopressin. This all corraltes to the connection and commitment of love. Marriage perhaps can have a role allowing these chemical components in the brain to rewards on its  security in the relationship. Historically marriage was suppose to help among families and gain/ respect amongst their community. Many factor still become at play to resonate the rationality of marriages. I for one could not be in a serious relationship with someone that i couldn't take a bullet for personally. I find the repercussions of morden day gynocentric state run marriage to not be worth it. I would propose myself a sort of contract for a relationship with my partner as more relable with op-out options at last resort. Its sorta necessary for having children. Plus companionship is healthy for people psychologically. 
1	There is another reason.   \n\n\nMarriage basically makes separating harder.  In some cases, that can be a rational choice, if you like the person so much that you are confident that if you were to make the choice to separate from them in the moment, it would be incorrect.  Marriage is basically a safeguard against the potential future fuckup of dumping your loved one without good reason (divorce is a possibility, but the fact that it has a higher barrier to entry means you're less likely to do it for a stupid reason).
1	I don't get it either, I don't plan on getting married.
7	Have you ever been interested in an INTJ female?	Hi fellow ENTP!! It's the first time I noticed an ENTP. I kind of AM sure that the guy is an ENTP. Just want to ask your opinion about what signals you send to a girl when you are sure you would want to date. He sends me many signals but I'm not sure how to take it from there. The signs are mostly subtle like appearing out of nowhere which seems like he has been tracking me??!! Sudden texts that are nothing but friendly. Suddenly showing me their presence..\n\nI think it would be much easier if there are more verbal expressions than non verbal. I don't like guessing. I wish things were more clear. I could approach him directly but I'm just curious as to why such technique??
17	Approach directly and make intentions known. 
8	I try to spend time with someone I am interested in. Try to gauge how they might view me in return.\n\nINTJs can be tough to read.\n\nIf you like this guy, ask him out on a date and use the word "date". He will probably be joyed that his efforts of showing interest in you has revealed similar affection.
3	INTJ here. My experience with ENTP: I had to tell him very clearly that I am interested in more than friendship. He later said he refuses to assume anything based on "signs" or "hints" and that he probably missed several opportunities to date someone before, because the girl didn't clearly state what she wanted.\n\nHowever, I still think that starting to date an ENTP takes some subtlety... I think being direct and open about my feelings worked, but I tried to avoid being too intense because I thought it could spook him.\n\nGood luck with your ENTP! I think it's one of the best matches for an INTJ :)
2	I tried to date an INTJ (may have been infj)but the moment was fairly wrong. Anyway, personally, I make my intentions known from the get go verbally, and see where she’s at with that. 
1	Ask Him, or f-it just kiss him.   It's you he can't read  INTJ's  SMH.   Can you tell I'm frustrated with one?
0	I haven't took the time to research much in regards to other types besides their basic traits....why do why people ask about stuff like this anyways...
41	Avoidant-like behavior	One of my mistakes was that for many years I misclassified myself as an introvert - despite having no inner world, being energized by people and consistently trying to externalize my introspection. My reasoning back then was that I had very few friends, among others.\n\nOnly after a while after my mind grew more mature I realized this is exactly the behavior of an ENTP, they aren't extremely sociable all the time. I remember someone saying that the ENTP is essentially an introvert but with rerouted energy levels of the inner mind, making Ne dominant - at least that's how I understood it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, from the last 2 years on I'm definitely acting "debater" in a group. For instance at seminars or meetings I'm really talkative, if we have someone that leads the conversation even among tens of other people I'm immediately second bringing constant arguments and not becoming tired (I only shut up when I run out of arguments, when that happens I step way down from the group). If I have an energetic mood I instantly chase opportunities to bring an argument anywhere, even when I'm alone. I always try to bring some diversity or some joke to even the most usual subject, looking towards the "outside".\n\nAssuming these I must be an ENTP, plus or minus a few things here and there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut one major problem... I also act avoidant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI noticed on multiple occasions: Let's say I participated in a meeting as a stranger. I got to meet all the people in there, I got along very well with like 4 or 5 out of the 50 people, I got their contacts, I formally said goodbye and left.\n\n**Next day... I only call one or two at most.**\n\nEven worse, despite definitely going along well with those people initially, I always interact with different parts of that group so that I don't come across them. **I seem to deliberately want to detach from 50% of friends I've made.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Also, with my existing long-term friends, sometimes I don't interact with them for about a week, then I return normally as like nothing happened. Although they never considered that to be strange, I do.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimple question will be: Why do I do that?
24	I'm kinda the same, one day I'll have the urge to reach out to my friends, text, make plans etc., and then literally the next day when I wake up to a bunch of texts I instantly regret it. For me it's the effort and energy that it takes to maintain friendships.
18	You're confusing extraversion in pop-sci/Big-5 typing with extraverted functions in MBTI. The 'E' in ENTP doesn't have anything to do with being sociable with other people. ENTPs get their 'E' from extroverted intuition, which has a lot less to do with *people* and a lot more to do with *ideas*.\n\nNow, there *are* MBTI 'E's that get *their* E from Fe (ESFJs, for instance), which *is* people-focused; and we *have* Fe, but it's not our dominant function.\n\nAll that to say we're not generally going to start reaching out with Fe until Ne and Ti have been satisfied. That means after a big event like a meeting, where we've been introduced to a lot of new ideas already, Ne has been satiated and now we're running on Ti - *introverted* thinking. We want time to 'percolate', to mentally explore all those fresh, new ideas without being disrupted. The archetypical mad scientist working feverishly through the night. We're probably not going to get around to Fe again until *both* Ne and Ti have been satiated. Which usually looks like wanting to share the brilliant conclusion we came to - running through the streets shouting 'eureka!'.\n\nSo it's pretty normal behavior for an ENTP to be done with the outside world for a while once they've plucked a handful of new ideas from it. It's also normal for us to get bored with people that don't consistently provide us with new things to think about - just engaging our Fe, our desire for social interaction, isn't usually enough for us like it is for a Fe-dom; potential companions have got to keep Ne fed. Just enjoying someone's company usually isn't enough to build lasting bonds, in fact, Ne-driven social behavior means sometimes we'll choose to spend time with people we don't even *like*, if their perspectives are different enough from our own to keep our gears turning.
3	My ENTP is the same exact way. Could be the tertiary Fe and the indirect relationship Ne and Ti have with the enviornment. 
5	> Assuming these I must be an ENTP\n\nI wouldn't jump to that conclusion too quickly. Typing yourself is hard.
4	I‘m not sure if this connects to ENTP, it’s probably just a personal condition. But I do the same. Not even 50%, when I meet someone I don‘t really want to see them a second time *especially* when we got along well. It feels like a burden so I avoid them. On the other hand I was once told by my therapist that I lean towards Avpd (avoidant personality disorder) even though it was not a certain diagnose, it might be influenced by that.
1	I'm the same way. I literally have 3 friends, talk to one of them (infp) once or twice every week, another one(esfp) once or twice every month and, my intj I literally channel a good 95% of my energy into and talk to her every day all throughout the day. Two of these are long-distance, though, so it feels like I'm alone most of the time. my enfp brother is almost exactly the same too. He still doesn't believe he's an enfp but only bc he's not really into mbti and is looking at it purely on an introvert/extrovert basis
7	What would you say to the younger version of yourself?	What age ENTP are you and why would you say this to yourself? 
20	Don’t date that guy - you know the one.\n\nTry to pay attention in school. \n\nFocus on the people who actually give a shit about you.\n\nWhen did you decide your hate math? You’re actually very good at math. It’s not “cool” to hate math. FFS. \n\nYou think you’re more interesting stoned... but honey, I got news for you! \n\nFind that thing you love and don’t give up making it your life’s work.\n\nOne day all the dramas of your teens will seem so insignificant you’ll be embarrassed you spent so much time focused on them. \n\nOne day you’ll be going through old pictures and realize you were really hot, and you’ll regret spending so much time being insecure. \n\nEdit: Oh, I’m 35. I hear that’s like 97 in reddit years. 
13	I don't think she'd listen to me, so I wouldn't even bother. :P
7	Don't coast. Challenge yourself. You may think you're clever, but you're a small fish in a big pond and you *will* regret your lack of study skills in the future.\n\n(Also: I'm sensing a pattern to these answers...)
3	"Chill the fuck out and stop being self destructive towards to the people around you." - Matured version of my ENTP self. 
4	"Dear lord, please pay attention in class and study, improvising doesn't bring you far in college." 
5	* get a grip and start taking care of yourself\n* you’ll figure it out, don’t worry so much\n* learn to study and properly apply yourself you lazy fucker\n* talent only gets you so far\n* stand up for yourself\n* tell your brother he can tell you anything and you can help
4	HELP!!! HOW DO I GET BACK TO THE FUTURE!??!?!\n\nlol\nBut really I wouldn't say shit, probably sit back in awe and watch my younger self fuck up whatever I was doing at the moment. I see myself as the best I could ever be in the present, and doing what I can to be the best for my future, which means making those mistakes. Mistakes are bad but also good if you learn from them, so don't hate yourself or be angry at yourself for making them. Being smart is an ability, being charming is a talent, but being wise is a skill. Wisdom requires experience, whether it be yours or learned from someone else. \n\nBig side note: \nDo you really think happiness is the only important emotion you should feel?\nYou have how many more emotions and They are either not important or bad to have?\nWhen someone replies with; "hey HATE is a strong word!" Wouldn't you reply with; "so is love." ?\nJoy and love aren't always good, and hate can be good (someone who loves to torture kittens and they are happy when they kill them. Hating a genocidal maniac. obviously extreme cases but points need proving)\n\nI do agree with having a moment of self reflection, to see what you would say to your younger self. But remember your memories and emotions shouldn't control you (reason why I mentioned emotions earlier), you should learn to feel them, to know them, and to harness them to your will. To put yourself at your helm, instead of just taking the back seat in your own body. \n\nPeople say love is a driving force for making a difference, and I agree but I think we are forgetting most of what makes that force so strong. We say that love is the happiness and joy people bring to us and we give to them (true), but the other parts are the hate to see them suffer or being hurt, or the sadness to see them leave or be taken away. Don't forget all the parts that make love powerful, and don't forget the memories that help drive you to create more love for the world and yourself. ^w^\n\nWow. Got a little carried away...\nSo yeah, probably would de-pants my younger self as a joke, so he would get more comfortable with being embarrassed lol
3	Don't overthink and just let yourself be who you wanna be, maybe they don't understand but you will be better in your way than worrying too much on how "extra" you are. Just be.\n\nBe sincere with your feelings when you have them.\n\nStart to learn to control the emotional outbursts.\n\nI know you are kinda insecure about wanting to learn new stuff because of how nerdish you will be seen, but I assure you these things will only make you cooler when you grow up. \n\nTry to learn discipline, improvisation is like our super power but there will come a time when you need to plan things out. \n\n22 yo ENTP
2	Dont have too much fun. The consequences comes sooner than you thought. \nAnd also, you are not so fucking indestructible as you think you are. Use that great mind of yours because you are smarter than you think.
2	Give up on trying to make friends, it was never ment to happen... Focus your efforts on learning. It's not your fault that people ignored you, they just didn't understand your view of the world. Become content with being alone, you are your best friend. Don't react to your teachers being angery at you for not following their orders. Just ignore them instead of asking why you should do something. The empty feeling you have isn't caused by being bad at life, it's because you realized at an early age how pointless public school was and got fed up with it all. Perhaps there's something else I haven't yet discovered...\n\nIf only I hadn't thought it was my fault... maybe I wouldn't have wasted all my time trying to find ways to make myself feel better by playing videogames and reading.... trying to ignore how boring reality was...\n\nMaybe I could have been my own time paradox friend....
2	Don‘t trust anyone. Nobody‘s your friend. Do not go near friend xyz. Never start a project with friend x. \n\nDon‘t listen to your mother, try liking your dad too. \n\nTake things a bit more seriously. It does matter. \n\nDon‘t build close relationships with anyone.\n\nDon‘t try out being everything you‘re not for the excitement. This is not a game you‘ll lose everything.\n\nDo not conform to social standards. You don‘t really need to be liked or accepted.\n\nDon‘t stop playing piano.\n\n\nI‘m 20
2	You are in complete control of your own actions and emotions. Learn that there is not a single person to live for other than yourself, it will take effort to gain independence. To find true meaning in life you must find what makes you happy. Be a master of your conscience, it’s important to learn, and it’s important to read. Good things don’t come to you and you shouldn’t wait for them to “happen”. If you want something to happen, make it happen. Never fixate on the past or future. Live in the now. Don’t take life too seriously don’t be excessive about anything. Learn to breath and relax; be kind. 
1	So much... 
1	Live it up while you can B! You are going to run out of excuses one day soon. 
1	Not sure I would.  Not sure I would listen either. \n\nBut if there was anything, I'd confirm the one thing that's a lesson now that I always suspected: you learn best through failure
1	Step 1) here's information only you could know, but I know also. Here's proof I'm future you. \n\nStep 2) get rich. Buy lottery ticket on specific day to win millions.\n\nStep 3) teach modern Nobel prize winning research, so younger self can recreate it\n\nStep 4) ?????\n\nStep 5) PROFIT
1	"Jelqing doesn't work."
1	Stop trying to impress people.... You are too fucken awesome for half of them.... You are way to inconsistent...it matters what you look like.....I know you know what to do but the world sucks you will never be good enough so stop fucking thinking anyone will care....They do care about you open up a bit...
16	ENTP but not a debater?	I really don't relate to this "constantly arguing" thing. How do you even have energy for that? I'm usually so wore out that I'll agree with anything just to get the other person shut up and have some peace and silence. \n\n\nI love discussions in we-are-thinking-about-it-and-exchanging-opinions-and-ideas-like-civilised-people-and-actually-consider-the-arguments-and-point-of-view-of-the-other-peron way.\n\nBut arguing for the sake of arguing with a person that doesn't really care for what I say cause they won't give it a chance anyway, or arguing so I'd come on top but have gained no other perspectives or any interesting input, isn't really my thing. It makes me more tired than I already am.\n\nAnd since ENTP is known as the Debater then does it mean I may have gone wrong with typing? 
17	I think the argumentative stereotype comes from type descriptions written by non-ENTPs.\n\nGenerally what happens is I begin speculating about stuff and thinking out loud during a conversation and people think that I'm trying to argue with them which has led to some people getting pissed and me sitting there having no idea what just happened. \n\nI do have a tendency to get argumentative, but when I do it, it's in response to someone making so little sense that it's inexcusable -- and I do that because I think people have a responsibility to not just arbitrarily pull shit out of their ass whenever they feel like it, not because I'm trying to one up them.\n\nAnd I only go into full-blown "POPTARTS ARE RAVIOLI, PROVE ME WRONG" mode for laughs and when I do it's because I'm pretty confident that everyone else is in on the joke.\n\nThe only ENTP I know that actually matches the hyper-argumentative stereotype a lot of people have in their heads is an insufferable bastard that everyone else hates being around.
8	because entp is not about debate but feedback...
7	> discussions in we-are-thinking-about-it-and-exchanging-opinions-and-ideas-like-civilised-people-and-actually-consider-the-arguments-and-point-of-view-of-the-other-peron way.\n\nDude, that is what debate is. 
7	> I really don't relate to this "constantly arguing" thing\n\nOk, definitions really are important here. "Arguing" can mean:\n\n> to contend or disagree in words : DISPUTE\n\nor\n\n> : to give reasons for or against something : REASON\n\n(Thanks, Merriam-Webster.)\n\nI normally use the second definition, which could be restated as\n\n> we-are-thinking-about-it-and-exchanging-opinions-and-ideas-like-civilised-people-and-actually-consider-the-arguments-and-point-of-view-of-the-other-peron\n\n...in your words.\n\nArguing/debating doesn't have to be SAVAGE, or whatever the kids say these days. You don't have to TOTALLY CRUSH your opponent. It can just be an intellectually stimulating discussion about two+ competing ideas.\n\n> But arguing for the sake of arguing with a person that doesn't really care for what I say cause they won't give it a chance anyway, or arguing so I'd come on top but have gained no other perspectives or any interesting input, isn't really my thing.\n\nYeah, me neither. If you're arguing for the excitement of it, you might be an ESTP. Se seeks sensory experiences. I think the adrenaline rush of a controversial debate qualifies. If you're ENTP, you want *mental* stimulation. "Other perspectives" and "interesting input" are exactly what Ne is after.\n\n> then does it mean I may have gone wrong with typing?\n\nQuite the opposite, I'd say.
3	It’s a common misconception that a certain type must adhere to their stereotypes. In the MBTI community, many types are put in boxes according to their common traits and stereotypes (thanks 16personalities.) What we tend to forget is that every type is extremely multidimensional, and every person, regardless of type, is a unique individual. Just because you are an ENTP and not necessarily a debater does not make you any less of an ENTP. Maybe research enneagram, it can contribute to the way we act and vary within our types.
2	Honestly, I heard other ENTPs saying the same thing. 
8	Does Si work in the ENTP as a pseudo-Fi?	With pseudo-Fi I mean the part of Fi that handles the sense of self. Ti is too objective and while it is guided by internal principles, those principles are still drawn from a logical interpretation of the external world, so nothing that comes out of it is really personal. Ne and Fe are both extroverted functions. Si is the only funtion left in an ENTP that can actually create an idea of "self" that differentiates us from the rest of the population.\n\nFor example, personally every time I think of who is "me" what comes to my mind is things I like, but the only reason I know I like them is because a long time ago I tried them and found them more enjoyable than the rest of the options I had. Now, after years of repeatedly choosing these options I feel as if somehow they have shaped who I am today, so I can say they are part of me. And it actually is a quite strong connection the one I have built with those choices, because every time I choose something different I feel as if I am trying to be someone else. When I try to forcibly go against this I find myself trying to rationalize it by telling myself I initially wanted to choose this instead of that but got confused and just continued with that choice for years because I had already invested in it, and sometimes it works, but most of the time it doesn't. Then I come back to the old choice and it feels like home.\n\nWhat do you think?
3	Si is about personal history as well.  An ISTJ who grew up in an unorthodox artsy family, assuming they have had a good upbringing will have "unorthodox artsy" in their personal history and will hence be unorthodox. \n\nYou need Si to maintain some identity but in the end, identity is just a drowning person gasping for air.
15	Applications asking for weaknesses are fucking annoying	Im applying for the army as an officer and I got sent a form to talk about my strengths and weaknesses. I wrote like 10 points for my strengths without sounding too boastful i.e 'out of the box thinking' and 'being decisive'.\n\nFor weaknesses, I got one - ' low work ethic' and 'can be brash'. Other than that - nothing. Every weakness every one pointed out - I managed to successfully make it a positive. Things like - very high self esteem and argumentative.  So I decided to google 'Entp weaknesses' and I plan to use those instead because 1. fuck it and 2. fuck these self assessments\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any that could work, hmu 
7	I wouldn't put argumentative on your army application, and I'd be iffy about putting "high self esteem" as a weakness. The implication of those as weaknesses sounds worse than the positive connotation you're trying to imply, I think. You gotta pick and choose a little bit and curate your image.\n\nThe whole "my weakness is my strength" angle is almost overdone these days. These application offices see this angle played so much, they tend to be kinda blown away when you put an actual weakness but one that you're really invested in fixing. Pick an actual weakness but one that you can point to your successes in overcoming. Like "I don't test well in school," but you can point to high test scores and show that you studied really hard and overcame it. \n\nI'd suggest more, but I don't know you well enough to know what kinds of things you can prove, so maybe just think about it from this angle for a bit.
9	I think they’re looking mainly for self-awareness.   People who can admit to weaknesses are more likely to deal positively with mistakes and criticism.\n\nI think the practical thing is to admit to things that don’t impact the job directly.   “I suck at following orders” is likely not a good one to list for you, lol.  \n\nBut, “I’m not the best at finding a solution that makes everyone happy” is  something that can be claimed to be a weakness, but isn’t particularly damaging. \n\nFind genuine weaknesses that are also irrelevant to the job.
4	As an employer I honestly will say that we put those sorts of things on there for reason, if people try to spin it into a positive I honestly ignore the application. they did not answer the question... \n\n"I care too much", "I am a perfectionist", are not weaknesses. I want to know why you suck at life sometimes so I can establish the more important part of how you go about working on your shortcomings, and how you will be at employee review. People are not perfect that is okay, and to be expected but if people can't smell their own BS they are not going to take criticism well, self-awareness is essential to building a good team.
2	yeah i agree if feel like it's better that other people point out my weakness than i. and if i really thought i had any big weaknesses if would probably try to change that part of me...
2	Yeah I agree. I have an interview in about a month's time and I'm trying to prepare myself now for that question and I still can't find a weakness that can't be a strength. Maybe we're just too 'out of the box thinking' to find anything.\n\nEdit: Maybe that's one then; we're too out of the box hehe
1	My weaknesses are that I work too hard and I'm never sick.
1	Just had a job interview today and said stubborn, stuck in my head, and blunt.  
1	I really hope you didn't put on an Army application that you have a low work ethic.  It's like, probably worse than putting that you enjoyed stabbing and skinning small animals as a child.  Absolute anathema to the Army.  \n\nSource: Used to be in the Army.
1	Argumentative is not a weakness but Insensitive & Intolerant are.
1	Wow, an ENTP in their forces. That’s not something I could see us doing well in. 
0	Do any ENTPs out there believe in astrology?	Why or why not?\n\nJust a curious E/INFP looking for perspective!
11	No.\n\nWhy would Mars' Jupiters and Uranus' position hold any effect on me as a person? If it's about celestial bodies reacting to carbon based life we should already be inoculated or have other influence repelled simply from existing on the surface on one.\n\nAstrology scratches the same itch that religion does, a belief system that generates purpose. Its inception is to combat apathy and despair upon realizing that there's no meaning to anything, consequently making the only meaningful thing in this life be what you decide to be meaningful. Astrology skips the crucial introspection stage and goes straight to deception to keep the illusion up.\n\nSo yes, I don't believe in Astrology because to me it reads as a comforting lie.
11	Lol nope. No logical basis. How does one interpret the movements, alignments and patterns of the stars while translating them to what you should do with your life to the point it could eventually dictate how one should live their lives?\n\nSure do it for fun all you want but it’s cringy to see some people rely on astrology like it’s full proof.
8	It doesn't make any sense. Let's say a Sagittarius is influenced by Mercury in the northern hemisphere on earth. Why should this influence be the same for a Sagittarius on the southern hemisphere on earth, especially if the northern and southern hemisphere individuals were born on the same day? \n\nIt's a completely different environment, which means all the astrology should be present exclusively in the external planets. So if that's true, why doesn't discovering a new planet influence this? Pluto recently got demoted to a dwarf planet and we know there are now 4 other dwarf planets. Do these influence horoscopes? Should there be a new astrological type to account for this? \n\nIf so, that would completely invalidate all of previous astrology. Let's say we make a new astrological type, call it a Jungerian. It spans from March 5th — April 3rd and we subsequently alter all the other astrological types date ranges accordingly. That means if you were canonically a Pisces, you're now a Jungerian. But they're two independent types, so that can't be true. \n\nEven worse, let's say you were a Leo at the tail end of the date range. Now, after modifications of date ranges to include Jungerian types, we now have this Leo is a Virgo. But all the previous Virgo information didn't match this individual, whereas Leo did. Now, suddenly, Virgo will match him but not Leo? \n\nThat can't be because there will still be some Leos for whom the Leo description is valid (they were born in the middle of the Leo range). How can that be? What separates the True Leos from the Virgo-esque Leos?\n\nHere's a hypothetical scenario. Lets say mercury gets completely wiped out by asteroid. Absolutely obliterated and it hurls into the sun. Will Astrologers alter their natal charts? If yes, why haven't they altered their charts for the inclusion of new planets discovered? If no, how can they claim their charts have any reliability?\n\nLet's say we discover another habitable solar system. It has four planets in the solar system and is in a totally different galaxy (let's call it the Milfy Way). By this time, we've invented warp speed travel. So let's say I'm born on Earth and am a Gemini. I move at the age of 3 to the Milfy Way galaxy on planet Bukkard. Are Earthian horoscopes still valid for me? Should i instead use Bukkardian horoscopes based on the four planets of this solar system in a totally different galaxy, not even influenced by our Milky Way galaxy (let alone the planets in our current solar system)? Are *both* Earthian and Bukkardian horoscopes valid? Neither?\n\nLet's say we colonize Mars. If I'm born on Mars, I should have a different natal chart, yes? Does this mean the Mars influenced astrological type will be replaced with an Earthian type, Gaian? Will a Sagittarius on Mars have the same horoscope as a Sagittarius on Earth?\n\nAstrology is an archaic, primitive, static model that can't incorporate change without dissolving the entire model. Which is self defeating because the cosmos is in a constant flux of change, so that means astrology should have to be a constantly updating model. But it isn't, because it's still founded on the same primitive natal charts it always has been. \n\nIn summary: astrology is bullshit. 
3	I don't believe in it. But I like it for the memes.\n\nHonestly though, if you take your own zodiac and compare yourself to 5 other people with the same zodiac you'll quickly see how invalid it is.\n\nI was hoping that these zodiac houses are more accurate, but they were bs too.
3	I don’t believe in it per say but it’s interesting to read about.  horoscopes are garbage but things like birth charts that look at the alignment of every planet are fun to read for the sake of curiosity 
2	Not really, but there's this one book called "The Secret Language of Birthdays" that shows horoscopes for each day and that one is surprisingly accurate because the author interviewed a helluva lot of people for each birthdays and wrote similarities. 
2	Yes, strongly. WHEN it’s based on knowledge and not some random teenager making a zodiac meme or whatever else. \nHalf the people here are just throwing around terms that they don’t even know what they mean.  People who know nothing about true astrology are NOT qualified to comment on its validity. Fuck. \n\n(and now we wait for someone to try and invalidate my ENTP-ness! YIPPEE) 
2	I do it for fun. Same approach I take with Tarot.\nIs it divinely inspired? No.\nIs it generic? Yes.\nIf my thoughts "stick" on a topic, or when I see a card and am reminded of some facet of my life, I know it's pressing enough that my brain brings it up when I look at the concept. \n\nIt's like a Rorschach test with cooler art. Sometimes I need an outside "opinion" to force myself to acknowledge something. 
3	I think its mostly because of curosity, just like the MBTI, which a friend called "horoscope for nerds" , I like to read about myself, check its accuracy and also its a topic where you can engage on meme sharing or further discussions about the way the planets affect **or not** a person, so yea its interesting.  The more you know. \n\n&#x200B;
3	When I was a kid I looked into astrology.  I studied it and even drew up my own chart.  That how I know for sure it’s completely retarded.  
2	I did for 2 and half months. \n\nI forced my self to believe it, letting my natural curiosity delve into it as far as I can go, which allowed my skepticism to pierce through the other side rapidly since how shallow of an idea it was. \n\nTo be blunt about it and many other things that work in a similar fashion;\n\nFixed standards never worked and never will. 
1	Astrology is sports for women. Check the box score in the Sunday newspaper. Root for your team assigned to you based on when (instead of where) you were born. It’s all silly, but if people get fun out of it, whatever. Doesn’t hurt anyone. 
1	[See this](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/ajwyq5/help_me_rip_astrology_to_shreds/efmpjr6).
1	Sure but i dont think its benevolent
1	No.
1	Kinda, but not really. I think at best it's 1% of the picture (picture being, you) and I think much of that 1% is correlational rather than causation (i.e., everyone born in Aquarius shares similar attributes due to influences associated with that time of year, cold, cold distant people). \n\nI wouldn't fully reject the notion of 'astrological/planetary influences', but I do reject the notion of relying on it for any insight or divination. \n\n
1	No
-1	Are you by any chance anti-vaxxer or flat earther?
-1	It is utter bullshit.
5	ENTP-ISTJ friendship	Hello boys and girls, \n\nI've just now noticed how well balanced is my friendship with an ISTJ. When I get distracted by the big picture of things my friend brings me back to the details and how they are in that specific instance. \nI love how we are in many levels the opposite and can push each other in some areas. For example his careful organization sometimes makes him exausted and prevents him from enjoying the moment, while my "on the go" approach shatters his rigid regime and makes him go "maybe I should just chill". i have countless examples like this.\n\nDo you have similar stories? What's your take on ISTJs? 
5	I love ISTJs! One of favourite types, despite them being so different from us.\n\nI think one of the things I really appreciate about (healthy) ISTJs is that they tend to be really self-disciplined, yet are pretty chill wrt others. ISTJs are good role models for ENTPs, I think. We clash too much with ESTJs (who want to control us) and ISFJs (who think we're selfish pricks). ISTJs don't always get us, but they set a good standard for us to strive to, especially wrt developing our Si. Conversely, I think we can help them with Ne, although most ISTJs I know do not care much about Ne.
3	My best friends is enfp and istj. The istj friendship is really good and healthy we are really different but thats what makes it fun! Took some time to actualy become friends though 
2	My little brother is one.  \n\nSometimes we can act like friends and sometimes we want to kill each other.  Depends on the day.  This might just be a sibling thing though.  \n\nWe do work well together and can have fun together.  We both can be pretty blunt and not offend each other.  We can share a sense of inappropriate humor as well.  We surprisingly can get shit done when we are both in a productive mood.  
1	I once had an ISFJ girlfriend. I didn't liked it because she was literally the stereotype of a girlfriend in movies. But I see the interaction between an ENTP and an ISFJ very interesting. The world is created for ISXJ people, and that's why us, being the opposite of them, are so criticized and fit bad in majority of scenarios. Just think about it, how us, interact with the world, with the ISXJ world. Also, be careful with being too honest about yourself with ISXJ, I once did it and got called paranoid, crazy and mentally ill.
1	I honestly can't stand ISTJs I'm sorry :( The ones I've known have had 0 social etiquette (telling me how I look tired in front a group of prominent strangers I was just meeting) and tried to control me / things I had planned. My last straw was getting a group of friends together to go to a Dave & Busters. The one located in the city is disgusting & dangerous so I said we should go to the new one at the upscale mall for that reason.\n\nSo we all meet up before hand and I was telling them which location it was as we walked out the door.\n\nThe ISTJ: "No, we'll go to the one in the city, it's closer."\n\nMe: "It's a 3 mile difference though and the other one is much nicer, bigger, and safer so it makes up for it."\n\nISTJ: "Ya okay, so (turning to everyone) we'll go to the one in the city!"\n\nSo everyone goes to the one in the city and I went home lol. The ISTJ later asked me why I didn't come. I swear she's got it out for me but everyone says that's just how she is. How clueless can you be?!

4	Clarification on cognitive function of ENTP	Hello, \n\nQuick question for everyone out there. I’m trying to understand MBTI and cognitive functions are super interesting but also super confusing sometimes. \n\n\nLet’s say an ENTP is making a decision. \n\n1st Ne - what the ENTP is making a decision on/where the problem is. If Ne, then would be based on an assumed pattern.\n\n2nd Ti - What is the logical thing to do about this assumed pattern. \n\n3rd Fe - How will others feel about this decision. Usually outweighed by Ti, and usually a “retrospective” function.\n\n4th Si - How things should be done, the “what am I supposed to do”. I usually like to refer to this as “the safe approach”  relied on when unconfident\n\nAm I getting this right? 
4	Your description of NeTi is closer to NiTe actually.\n\nBasically the introverted Perceptions, Ni and Si, work by seeing assumed patterns **unconsciously**.  They have expectations about how things should look.  Ti and Fi on the other hand have unconscious expectations about how things should work, fit together and function.  All these functions are essentially internalized biased representations of the real world — internal models.\n\nThe extroverted ones on the other hand use the world as it is.  So Se/Ne use the raw information they see in front of them and Te/Fe use the “rules of the world” to help make decisions.\n\nOf course it’s impossible to really separate Perception from Judgement as individual thoughts or to have a truly biased or unbiased Perception, but those are the limitations of the model and a way of separating the gestalt of human consciousness unto decipherable but nevertheless abstract pieces.  They don’t have to correspond to the way the brain actually works.  At least this is the way I conceptualize things.  \n\nSo NeTi is more like searching for a consistent and rational (Ti) fit to a myriad of open-ended, unbiased conceptual observations.\n\nThat means NeTi likes to evaluate a lot of possible combinations of ideas, chew through them, and spit out the ones that aren’t internally consistent with themselves and with the logical system that Ti has distilled from the way the world seems to logically function (Te perspective).   \n\nNeFi on the other hand is less likely to pare down the possibilities because they don’t use the strict criteria of Ti.  Instead they search for patterns that are consistent with the rules they’ve adopted, but ones which don’t necessarily line up with universal principles like cause and effect.  So this can be seem as being guided strongly by internal principles which are unique to the individual.  Ne/Fi types will often develop personal spiritualities or moral codes for instance, often divorced from the mainstream for instance. \n\nNi on the other hand, instead of consciously and constantly churning through possibilities of how things *could be seen*, decides on a certain way that something *should be seen*.  That’s your assumed pattern.   But this is *unconscious* which is why it is a bias to their perception. \n\nAn analogy is the ticking clock that you tune out and no longer hear.  It is an *expected* pattern, so the mind puts it on the back burner and consciously discounts it.  It belong to the unconscious,  but, if the pattern changes ... like it stops ticking....The unconscious will flag it as an anomaly and it arises to the attention of the conscious.   (Likewise Ti only tends to notice logical inconsistencies and not the validity of every single logical thought.)\n\nSo then what happens when Ni flags an inconsistency?  Then Te decides (consciously) what to do about it.   It compares and contrasts different possibilities, perhaps predicting a few consequences, and deciding upon an outcome that makes the most sense. \n\nSo to sum up, Ne/Ti is consciously finding patterns in the conceptual landscape biased by a set of internal rational principles (like cause and effect) about the way things must work.\n\nNi/Te is about consciously extrapolating rational possibilities from the various patterns in the conceptual landscape that come to their attention.\n\nNeTi starts with inchoate ideas and narrows it down to a conclusion.  In this way, NeTi looks like Ni.\nNiTe starts with an assumption and extrapolates it into a new possibility.  In this way, NiTe looks like Ne.\n\nThis is why some people say ENTPs and INTJs are each other’s shadow types.   What one does as a conscious process, the other does as an unconscious one. \n
1	ahhhhhh\n\n&#x200B;\n\nN and S are the perceiving functions, while T and F are the deciding functions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the ENTPs it's mostly logic that they're basing their decisions on (Ti), other than eg the ENFP, because their first decider function is Fi.
4	How much Ne does your job require?	It only seems natural that as Ne doms we will gravitate towards the new and exciting, novel careers with variation. Similarly, you wouldn't expect to find an ENTP in a strict routine.\n\nSo, how much does your job let you use your Ne? Have you risen up the ranks with your brilliance, or are you stuck in Si mode hating life.\n\nI'm having a hard time finding a nice Ne career to choose!
3	I was a sales consultant for retail. Not a great Job for Ne. However, once I got a little more invested I started looking for ways to improve the business. By finding new ways to look at reporting, better practices etc. \n\nEvery couple of weeks there was a new project. After a couple months I got promoted to assistant manager. A few months after that I found myself in management. \n\nNormally people get promoted because their numbers are good. My numbers weren’t amazing, I think it mostly had to do with showing initiative and being creative. \n\nSo I think, if you are in a job that is restricting and duty based. Find a way to change it. 
3	I work in an art store. I feel like I get to use my Ne fairly often between helping customers find new tools or solutions to a problem their having. I also make a lot of handmade signage and displays and stuff which allow me to be pretty creative. It's also a pretty casual job without too many rules or whatever and my coworkers and I always have wild conversations about random stuff. It's pretty great lol. 
2	I mostly use Ti and Fe, but with a healthy dose of Ne for that creative spin. ;)\n\nedit: still workin' on that Si... organization is *so fun*.
2	I do freelance film work as a PA right now. It requires a lot of Ne.
2	Nurse, lot of Ne (and Ti) here, but it depends on specialization... ICU and surgical requires strong Si. Long term care more Fe (I largely dislike working in these settings, as you might guess).
1	>It only seems natural that as Ne doms we will gravitate towards the new and exciting, novel careers with variation.\n\nAs opposed to other types, that will gravitate toward old and boring, dull careers with no variation? \n\n>Similarly, you wouldn't expect to find an ENTP in a strict routine.\n\nHumans are creatures of habit (read as: routine) *regardless* of their Mbti box. \n\n>I'm having a hard time finding a nice Ne career to choose!\n\nHmm, why don't you use some of that "brilliance" from your Ne to find a career yourself?
5	Bioethics Debate: Should Public Health Be Given Sweeping Powers Over Individual Liberty During a Bioterrorist Threat?	Okay, so a little time has passed since our last bioethics debate. And by a little time, I mean five months. Oopsies. Well, here's another one. \n\nToday, the focus will be on bioterrorism and how we respond to it in the United States. Out of all the weapons of mass destruction, biological weapons have the potential to do the most harm. There are some systems in place such as the [Strategic National Stockpile](https://www.phe.gov/about/sns/Pages/default.aspx), part of the [Cities Readiness Initiative](https://www.cdc.gov/cpr/readiness/mcm/cri.html), and [BARDA](https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/barda.aspx). However, when our hospitals are [struggling with capacity issues on a normal day](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0716864017300354), how well would we manage in a bioterrorism event? During the Amerithrax 2001 attacks, [the public health and laboratory resources were strained to the point where they would've become unsustainable for any longer](https://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04152.pdf). \n\nIn these extreme events, should federal public health agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, be given powers that overshadow civil liberties in order to protect Americans? For example, being able to take over a private hospital or laboratory in order to increase capacity. Or being able to forcibly treat or vaccinate in the name of immediate public safety. What powers should be available in a biological crisis situation? Should personal liberties be upheld regardless of imminent danger?\n\n**As always, the side you take doesn't have to be your own. Please use logical arguments and not opinions. If you really want to be awesome, link the sources you use.** \n\nIn case you missed the last debates, here are the links (These topics are from the book "Taking Sides: Clashing Views on Controversial Bioethical Issues" by Carol Levine.):\n\n[Should Doctors Be Able to Refuse Demands for "Futile" Treatment?](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/8mdq9v/should_doctors_be_able_to_refuse_demands_for/)\n\n[Should There Be a Market in Body Parts?](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/8mq40i/bioethics_debate_should_there_be_a_market_in_body/)\n\n[Should Pregnant Women Be Punished for Exposing Fetuses to Risk?](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/8nknqx/bioethics_debate_should_pregnant_women_be/)\n\n[Should Adolescents Make Their Own Life-and-Death Decisions?](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/8oif3w/bioethics_debate_should_adolescents_make_their/)\n\n[Should Health Insurance Be Based on Employment?](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/8udxae/bioethics_debate_should_health_insurance_be_based/)\n\n[Should Animal Experimentation Be Permitted?](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/96gdcl/bioethics_debate_should_animal_experimentation_be/)
2	It depends on whether you view the existence of humanity as some exceptional goal. If you find nothing particularly special about it, then it doesn't make much sense to sacrifice personal liberties in service of a "greater good" that you don't think is that great.\n\nIf, however, you view humanity's existence as something very valuable, it might certainly outweigh individual liberties, especially on a temporary basis.\n\nAnother way to look at it is by aggregate suffering. If we view "good" as the least amount of suffering, then the calculus is also different. Killing one person to stop the spread of an incurable disease induces suffering, but also prevents the suffering of millions (if we assume a reasonably infectious disease), and so would be a simple decision. The rub is you need to extrapolate and make assumptions about the future to account for future suffering, and since the consequences of decisions in complicated systems are difficult to determine with any certainty, now it's muddy again.\n\nOr we could take a very individualist approach, where *my* survival is more important than anyone else's. If killing another person preserves my life, then I should take that action.  And if I can justifying killing to save my life, I can justify anything else, as well, including quarantine, forced vaccination, forced treatment, etc. Further, if I had the power to implement these things on a large scale, I should do that. Which means if I am either in charge of a government body or can vote to influence the actions of a government body, I should act in a way consistent with my own survival. The consequences to society for everyone acting this way, of course, is generally offset with consequences that deter people from acting in a way that negatively affects others, based on social values. This, we justify with the idea that "no man is an island" and those who benefit from society should have to abide by certain rules that maintain the viability and stability of that society.\n\nI don't think there's any purely philosophical basis on which to judge the question - it just comes down to where you draw the line and how you draw it. Once that basis is set, you should be able to extrapolate the logically consistent conclusion of one's point of view.\n\nPersonally, I would advocate for involuntary quarantine but would consider involuntary vaccination or treatment a step too far since it violates the integrity of a person's body, unless physical quarantine was not sufficient to halt the spread of the disease, in which case my calculus would change to favor involuntary treatment to halt the spread. No necessarily because I value the survival of humanity as a whole, but because I value the survival of more individuals over the few.
1	The most important aspect of this issue is not the powers that are given to the public health organizations. It is the trigger for when these powers become available. Without a precise definition of what triggers the use of these powers, the system could easily be abused. Say that an event must be declared a "Public Health Critical Emergency" (this is a made up term to serve as an example) by the CDC. What defines that? Emerging or re-emerging infectious disease? Could a measles outbreak be declared a Public Health Critical Emergency so that the children of anti-vaxxers could be forcibly vaccinated? Where is the line of emergency drawn? \n\nGiving the public health system a way to draw more resources and being in control of the treatment of citizens during an epidemic or bioterrorism event would be extremely beneficial in the mitigation of the event. In fact, there is actually legal precedent for forced vaccination for the good of public health. [Jacobson v. Massachusetts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1449224/) confirmed the legal power of states to forcibly vaccinate during epidemics for the good of the community. \n\nSay an operational vaccine production facility is closed due to staff limits caused by a major outbreak. Shouldn't the government be able to seize this facility to make more vaccines? Or what if a company is stockpiling their vaccines and not using them during an outbreak (this could be to wait for a scarcity and sell at inflated prices). Shouldn't the government be able to step in and seize the vaccines to help the outbreak response?\n\nHonestly, I think that if a large-scale epidemic or bioterrorism event happened today, these things would still happen. The government is not going to abandon a response because they are out of resources or because people aren't cooperating. They will take the resources and make people cooperate when the country is threatened. By laying out a legal framework for these actions, the rights of citizens will be protected. A legal framework could ensure the compensation of citizens and outline the specific scope of what is allowed. If the country were to face a major epidemic without these guidelines, the resulting mess could be much more detrimental to citizens. 
1	The survival of the species is more important than any individual right. It sucks and it might end up being unfair for many people, but a bioterrorist attack is also unfair. \n\nIf your arm gets stuck under a rock in a river and the water level is rising do you chop off your arm while you still have time or do you wait to see if the water level stops rising?\n\nLife will suck without an arm, but it still beats drowning.
1	No, but the right to self defense and self-preservation should be massively expanded in such an event.
1	No. The individual is the most important aspect of civilization, and destruction of individual property rights destabilizes any civilization. If anything, the government's control of individual liberties should be dramatically reduced, not just in this scenario but in all situations. 
2	Does the Ne-Si function pair act like the Se function?	I was wondering this because, as an ENTP, I am quite well aware of my surroundings and how they can affect me. I''ve been told that I have some pretty sharp reflexes. I read about Si on the socionics webpage that Si can give an awareness of the environment and new possibilities for ENTP's. If anyone can explain to me how this works, thanks in advance!
3	Socionics is bullshit.
3	No, INxPs, such as my self, often lose touch with their environment completely. If I rarely objectively observe my environment, and I have higher sensing, it's unlikely that there is a correlation. I find my NP friend to be lofty, and hard to stay in touch with. They practically ignore their surroundings, finding abstractions far more interesting. This includes my ENTP older brother
1	So I never really see the big difference in Ne users and Se users you guys are crazy all the time.\n\nSo Ne is the *hundreds of possibilities* thing\nand Se is the *tries all of them* thing\nand Si is the *records data?* thing\n\nSo all in all Ne-Si is a more cautious Se. Does that make sense?
1	I usually score rather high on Se myself though. Though I believe it's because I'm an artist so I try to scan what I see as best as I can to learn from it in order to improve my skills. \n\nAlthough it got to the point where I was unsure whether or not I'm and ENTP or ESTP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlus, generally... I don't think it's too hard to learn to stay aware of ones surroundings. 
4	How do you know you can trust someone?	I’m terrified of putting my trust in someone and telling them stuff just to have them repeat those things to someone else. I would rather have those things kept secret than to feel whatever feeling comes along with being able to put all your trust in someone if at the end I’ll just be betrayed. \n\nIt’s never happened to me (severe betrayal) and though movies/shows aren’t real life, I’ve learned that most of the time you’re better off just not trusting people. I’ve been able to live like that pretty comfortably. Only letting people  know me on the surface but I am now considering telling this INFJ girl more about me. She’s clearly in love with me and I think there is potential. \n\n\nWhat I’m asking is how do you know you can trust someone? Do I just take a leap of faith and hope for the best or should I just play it safe (which is not a problem for me) I’m just looking to have a different experience of life. 
10	There are only two kinds of secrets you can tell other people. The ones that won't hurt you and the ones nobody will believe. 
5	> Do I just take a leap of faith and hope for the best or should I just play it safe (which is not a problem for me)\n\nTrust is not an on-off switch. There are different levels of trust. \n\nYou can think of it like a medieval castle. You've got a moat and a drawbridge, you've got outer walls, and you've got inner walls. Ideally, you're situated on a hill so your archers can see people coming.\n\nSome people you shouldn't even allow to make it up the hill. They set off your alarms and red flags. These are the people to shoot down before they even make it to your castle.\n\nAnyone who doesn't set off alarm bells in your head can be allowed to cross your moat via the drawbridge. But that doesn't mean they can get into the castle. They need to prove a) that they won't attack you, and b) that they'll add value to your kingdom. If they start chipping away at your walls (i.e. violating your boundaries) before you open the next gate for them, exile them. \n\nIf they prove that they're not a threat and they're someone you want in your kingdom, let them through the outer walls. They can mill around with the peasants and the soldiers. You can be friendly with them, and hang out with them, but they don't have access to your castle yet. Most people will stay in this outer courtyard. They're friendly, and they're not a threat, but that doesn't mean you should let them into the castle.\n\nOnly really special people make it into the inner walls. These are your Round Table knights. The people who you trust completely. There are no more walls between you and them. By letting them into the heart of the castle, you have given them the opportunity to assassinate you, but also to advise and assist you. The people you let in here should be the people you really value. They've run the gauntlet. They've proven themselves in battle. They have proven their value and trustworthiness.\n\nThat's really metaphorical, but I hope it helps. The point is that you don't have to decide whether to trust someone all at once. It's a process. 
4	I have learned that trust isn't accepting to get hurt again (like what most people believe it is).  \n\nTrust is truly believing that something is going to happen a certain way.  \n\nWith emotions and relationships, it is believing wholeheartedly that the person you are trusting is not going to harm you.  \n\nIt is completely detaching from any past experiences of being hurt and believing that it won't happen again.  \n\nIt isn't about knowing you can trust someone.  If that were the case, it would never happen because logically there is always a possibility of being hurt, no matter how small it is in the circumstance.  \n\nIt is about believing without proof.  It is about just having faith that someone is going to love you and have the best intentions towards you.  \n\nI mean, what is there really to lose?  When you don't trust someone, you are in more pain than if you do trust someone and they do end up hurting you.  You can heal from being hurt but you cannot escape the pain of being in fear all the time and being lonely.  And, the chance of them hurting you is less the more you actually trust them.  \n\nLack of trust is what destroys most relationships.  It isn't lack of affection or interest that does that.  It is letting fear creep into your expectations that ruins your perspective and makes you expect something bad to happen which will then lead it to actually happen.  \n\nThe truth is what we expect is what we notice and what we notice is our physical reality.  \n\nExpect to get hurt and that exactly will happen to you.  \n\nIf you have complete faith and trust (which is expecting not to get hurt; yes, it does defy common sense but if it didn't exist, we wouldn't be talking about it right now), you will never get hurt.  \n\nBelieve me, I was terrified too.  I had always built walls up around me and was living in pain from being so lonely.  And then one day, this nerdy INFP started "bothering" me by talking to me and trying to make me laugh.  I was so used to being alone and unloved that it was weird having someone care about me, much less acknowledge that I even existed.  He became endearing.  We started hanging out and it became obvious he was in love with me.  \n\nI had no idea what to do.  I liked him back but was too scared of getting hurt again so I rejected him.  It nearly killed him emotionally.  He had put so much unconditional trust in me that he was absolutely devastated.  He wouldn't talk to me for the longest time, even after I told him my true feelings.  He couldn't even look at me.  When we had to work together, he would sit there and wouldn't even move and would just stare at his hands (he didn't even have the motivation to play on his phone... shows you how serious it was).  \n\nThe thing was I loved him.  And I still do.  It sent me on a journey to discover some things inside of me.  To learn about trust and unconditional love and commitment.  \n\nTrust is a strong bond.  Perhaps even the strongest bond in the world.  You don't really know the power of it until it is taken away.  It defies complete logic.  It is pure faith.  Faith in a person, idea, or outcome.  Or even most importantly in yourself.  Most people don't even trust themselves and it makes them miserable.  \n\nIt took me quite a long time to learn all this.  It goes against our entire nature as ENTPs.  It is perhaps the most fear filled thing we can partake in.  It doesn't matter that the risk isn't even that bad.  Our brains, the way they are wired, contradict the whole process.  The logic that whatever possible hurt can be fixed just doesn't seem to get past the fear.  But when you manage to take that leap of faith, anything is possible.  \n\nMy INFP gave me a second chance.  Not everyone is that understanding.  He took a leap of faith on his part by risking getting hurt like that again.  And it paid off.  For both of us.  \n\nI know this is a long novel of a response.  Take my advice or leave it, that is up to you.  But if I were you, I would face your fears and take that first chance.  Not everyone gets a second one.  Hope everything turns out for you and wish you the best of luck
3	I think you should only tell information which cannot be used against you in your profession/career. A sort of emotional manipulation always occurs in every relationship. You just can’t avoid from that.
3	Personally, I take me some sweet time to get comfortable with someone. I tend to be pretty impersonal for a while and keep conversations very lighthearted and only start sharing my stuff with them when they share it with me. \n\n&#x200B;
5	This is me being absoluto honestidad: i usually only start trusting people after fucking them, that way atleast ill have fucked them first so if They fuck me over theyre just fucking me back.
1	Once someone has got past the initial barrier, I trust them until they prove otherwise -- lost trust never comes back
1	It‘s easy, you just don‘t trust someone.
1	I trust no one really unless I'm fine having it told to others or if I don't care. There's this one phrase in German (or maybe another language? I'm not sure) for \n\n"one you tell secrets to on a bus because you'll never see them again". 
1	You never really can.
69	What is the worst thing about being an ENTP?	For me, it’s not really standing for much. I can make a case for and against everything and find beauty in it too.
108	The difficulty of disciplining yourself when you realize you actually have bombass ideas and you want to see one succeed. 
24	Every so often I want to divorce myself but there are no laws that cover that.
17	Not getting anything done!🌚 Having so many goals but having zero willpower or drive to actually put in the work to achieve them. I wish I were an ENTJ at this point. What’s the use of having ideas and plans if you can’t implement them?☹️
38	Not sure if ENTP or just me, but nonstop rapid thinking - especially when it’s keeping me awake. I have a tendency to overthink/overcomplicate matters just because of that. \n\nOverthinking has made me wise, but also can afflict me with temporary anxiety/depression from troubling nihilistic ideas, grievances about the state of society, etc. Others can find these ideas hard to relate to and often can’t provide reassuring input. \n\nKinda a double edged sword, both a blessing and a curse
11	not pulling through with shit
34	That I can attract a million women to me like a fly to sugar but I cant get any of them to sleep with me 
8	Starting a hobby only to realize halfway through I’m bored of it. 
8	Hurting people's feelings by accident when I am just trying to understand their point of view on things.
21	Trying to focus on one thing! Also, you’ll procrastinate more than you breathe. 
19	Logging on to a sub for my type and finding myself neck-deep in FP content.

5	Existential boredom \~.\~ I'm having trouble with it now--people really underestimate what incurable boredom with life really does to one's spirit \*sigh\*
7	naive arrogance leading to lack of willingness to apply diligent effort
6	Staying up too late. Every night. 
8	Getting too carried away with how hyper/argumentative I am
5	The world does not take too kindly to impermanence or lack of structure. I’m all about it.
8	Being blind to my motives and then running through a bunch of justifications as to why i do something/why i don't care about what others think while someone who sees my motives is looking at me with a judging eye and accepting smile just waiting for me to realize that I'm  doing it again. 
3	Being smarter than everyone /s\n\nFollowing through with goals I want to achieve. I think other ENTPs can relate with this. We know our abilities, but sometimes we just go ehhhh I know how to do it, I can pick that up later.
3	The worst thing is being able to bend and manifest reality to my will, with incredible discernment, foresight and adapting + thinking on feet(out maneuvering all).. but lack the discipline and care-factor in everything to take advantage of that.\n\nAnd even once I have people on side/position like how a ENTJ would, my principles wont allow me to make that final push or assert my will over there future by making an important decision on there behalf. I can’t help but follow these universal laws of freedom and awareness, even when it’s not  necessary or even beneficial to cause or my tribe. The dissapointment I percieve others to have when they figure out Im not the ENTJ or ESTP or ENFP they presumed I was because situationally I might appear as any of those.  Also not being able to juggle people as well as other E types and/or follow up with them so pretend I like living in on the edge in the obscure shadows. 
3	Starting 1000 things but finishing none of them
5	Honestly probably seeing what gets posted on this subreddit
2	Let me answer this on behalf on ENTPs everywhere. You guys really need to learn how to be more patient and empathetic when dealing with people. Developing your people skills will help your ideas come to fruition because you will be able to convince other people to do the grunt work for you. Why don't you understand that being nice will actually benefit you in the long run??
2	Getting stereotyped as lazy, and then everyone being pissed off at you, or using it to criticise you.\n\nAlso, not preserving people's dignity during debates can cause them to abandon / avoid you. 
2	Apart from the inability to plow through work and discipline, I think maintaining good health is the worst thing. I dont eat enough, I dont sleep properly, I smoke, I dont exercise and my hygiene goes down the drain if im not anticipating social contact.   \n\n\nIt doesnt seem like a major issue now, but it does take its toll and it will only take a greater toll the older you grow
2	Constantly thinking, by far. My brain seriously just doesn’t stop, I think about a million things at once then go through them one more time. Also adds to the starting so many projects and not finishing most. 
3	Being a confident charmer and a flirt but then a pussy when it comes to committing to a person.
1	This resonates this me. Even the values I lean on the most, like skepticism/open-mindedness, I can form a case against. At some extreme point, it can just be counter-productive to constantly reevaluate everything.
1	realizing the burden of fulfilling your potential, because you know you could be great 
1	OP described me perfectly. But I don’t want to stand for anything in particular. Standing for something is just an idea, belief or perception. \n\nIf you can argue for and against everything, then that likely means you can ingest multiple perspectives. And if you can do that then you can use them to your advantage. \n\nPlus, standing for stuff is boring :P

5	Have any of you ever tried traveling alone?	I have a period of fun-employment between my last day at my current work and my first day at my next job. Friends have been encouraging me to take a cheap flight somewhere and trying solo-travel, but it doesn't seem very appealing to me. I think as an extrovert (most of the time), I enjoy sharing experiences with people and haven't ever really considered traveling solo in my life. On the other hand, I'm curious that it could be a huge growth experience for me.\n\nAny of you guys try it before? If so, where would you recommend?
7	Former train hopping crust punk here, I buddied up a bunch, but essentially was alone. I would not necessarily recommend it to anyone, but hitchhiking from Detroit to New Orleans was the cheapest, craziest, hardest but best vacation ever I have ever been one.
5	I take random trips all the time. Especially when I come across cheap plane tickets. Doesn't matter where. But I can't stay somewhere for too long. I'll go for a couple days, do random shit, and come back. It's fun. 
7	Your post is strange to me. I do pretty much everything alone. It sounds sad when I type that but I love it. I go out to eat alone, movies, travel, ect. I do what I want, when I want and at what pace I want. I find things interesting that others wouldn't even notice so sometimes I will just wander around for hours from thing to thing.\n\nNow, I don't mind (usually) doing those things with another person or rarely a small group. I typically prefer just to hang with one person when I do have someone along. It just sucks when the person you pick ruins your thing. I went to Vegas for the first time this last year and I was so excited because it was new, I love gambling and I knew there were a lot of other entertainment options. Well, the girl I went with ruined the whole trip...THE WHOLE TRIP! Sure we did a few fun things but overall it was a waste of my time, money and energy. \n\nTravel, explore and enjoy yourself, by yourself!
3	I made a longer post but figured I'd condense what I wrote. \n\nI'm an xNTP and have traveled to dozens of countries by myself. Don't think that taking a solo trip means that you'll constantly be alone. If you're more than a little social, you can always make new friends in hostels, bars or on the round. Oftentimes going without company is a choice. \n\nGoing abroad by myself helped me explore a lot of new interests. 
2	Ill rather travel alone as an extrovert i can just Meet new people on the road.And It Will solve the adapting problem that happens when u mix people
2	I love travelling by myself, it's the only way to do it unless you have a submissive friend who is willing to go along with whatever you want to do. I travelled with a friend for a while and although it was fun, I felt limited by having him with me. \n\nNow for travelling alone - it can get lonely -- REALLY lonely. I was not prepared for how lonely I was going to feel after just 1 week by myself in Japan. This loneliness came from not speaking to anyone in the country, and fellow travellers. It took me a while to understand that I am in direct control of my interactions, so I just started offering food to people in hostels and the final 2 weeks of my trip were fantastic! Being alone when I wanted it, and making plans with strangers when I needed to be around people. \n\n\nI can attest to the huge growth. You are under no obligations to your past self by having friends with you, so you really can just be yourself in its truest form. You can share experiences with people you meet, and yes you will make friends if you open yourself up to that.\n\n\nAs for recommendations, where is a place you have always wanted to go? For me, this was Japan. Yes it gets pricey over there, but it was the best holiday I've ever had. Think of a similar place or culture for you which inspires intrigue and you think you will enjoy. 
2	I usually go concerts alone because I've got few metalhead friends. I always wanted to attend a huge metal music festival like Wacken. Last summer, some friend asked me to attend Wacken occasionally, I answered him "It's always sold out from one year ago.". I researched and found there's a festival that is great and cheap at the same time, and decided to go suddenly. I asked my friend whether he's coming with me or not. He told me that time interval was not suitable for him. So, I did buy festival and plane tickets anyway! I asked other metalhead friends, but got no fella with me in the end.\n\nIt was my first foreign country travel experience. Just bought necessary intercity transportation tickets, no more plans. Everyday, I drank at least 10 beers. I attended the concerts of my favorite bands at the festival. I interacted with many different people. I lost my cellphone charger at some Starbucks. I did run into citizens from our country and had weird conversations. I visited a strip club for the first time. I asked potheads to smoke joints together. I trusted strangers and asked help from them. It was my best holiday ever! 
2	You're never really alone when you travel alone. If you're an extrovert, you'll meet plenty of people, so no worries there. I'm more of an introvert, and I met plenty of people, but I also had alone time too. A lot of people travel alone too, and they are not all doing stuff alone.
1	Yes I did last year, just be prepared for a lot of walking around at times just to pass the time...\n(Intp btw)
1	I love travelling alone. I mostly go to concerts and music festivals since that's what I like to do in my spare time. It's really easy to meet people at an event. Usually I just find someone else who is there alone or talk to the people I'm in line with. It's not like you'll be traveling to a desolate place with no one to talk to (unless that's your thing lol). There will be people all around you that you can share experiences with; you just have to introduce yourself. \n\nSometimes travelling with other people can keep you in your comfort zone. Travelling alone is a very freeing experience. I think that it helps you get to know yourself a little more. Personally, I like driving places instead of taking planes. I love blasting my music with an open road ahead of me. If something is within 12 hours or so and I have the time, I'd rather drive than fly.\n\nIf you are not convinced, you could test the waters by taking a one or two night trip somewhere within a few hours of you. You could possibly find a good concert or event to go to and drive to it. I recommend getting a room in an AirBnb. If you get a room in one instead of the whole place, it'll be cheaper and you can get to know the host. I've had some amazing AirBnb hosts all over the US and in Canada (assuming you live in the US, my bad if you don't). I think travelling by yourself is easier if you are doing it for a purpose, like going to a concert. Then you have something to look forward to and keep you from feeling lonely. \n\nAs for places to go, I'd pick based on what you want to do. A major city like Chicago can be very fun and will make it easy to find events. However, there are some smaller cities that can be cool depending on your interests. I absolutely love St. Louis. They have a great indie and alt rock music scene IMO, and have some really awesome restaurants. Staying in St. Louis is super cheap too. Maybe figure out what you want to do, and then find a city that fits that.
1	I travel literally all the time. I went to 8 countries last year and took over 100 flights for pleasure (including connections). I think solo traveling is a blast. If you’re looking to meet people or have someone to go with, stay in hostels and get to know the people staying there. Most of them are probably solo travelers as well. If you’re looking for some ideas on places to go, or easy solo places message me and I can give suggestions. 
1	I've traveled internationally both with people and solo. In both cases there are trade-offs and benedirs. With people, you enjoy the fun of having friends around, cheaper everything bc split costs, maybe more adventurous. Solo, you get to do whatever you want, set your own schedule, have chance to fully absorb and reflect on your new experiences and perceptions so that you are more immersed in to your surroundings, and probably get more content out of the trip
1	Start small and attend a local event in your city and learn how to fit in and meet new people this will ease the transition into larger things then I suggest contiki. Cheap travel, lots of new places and meeting new people is as easy as showing up and saying hi 
1	Bring a gold digger with you. Think about it: pay for her plane ticket and you can have sex with her every day of your trip. That comes out to like $100/day for a week. Truly a great deal. And you're not alone — she'll plan the trip for you! Let's be honest.. girlfriends are probably more expensive, and more stressful. \n\nHaving that in mind, I recommend Paris. Bitches love Paris. 
14	Trouble Connecting With Others?	As I was watching the superbowl with some new acquaintances I had met recently, it dawned on me again just how difficult it is for me to connect with others. Before I begin, I want to make it clear that this post isn't about me being "better" than anyone, and it's not about me being "stubborn" and trying to create arguments like a lot of other posts are about on here.\n\nWith that being said, I've realized just how hard it is for me to connect with you average person. I'm nowhere near perfect, so I again I want to stress there is no feeling of superiority here, but I can't help but find the faults of a lot of people in a way that makes me almost completely disinterested in them. It feels like a lot of people are seeing the eyes through the "typical" lens of life, whereas I am perpetually stuck viewing things from a different angle. I wish that I could see eye-to-eye with others but it's just not in my blood.\n\nLike I had mentioned above, when I was younger I could definitely be a contrarian and a bit abrasive toward people, and as I've gotten older I've definitely learned how to wrangle in those feelings and impulses. With a lot of time and experience I've become an adept conversationalist, but the problem I find myself in is that I'm just not that interested in most of the conversations I encounter. This is especially true in the past few years where (forgive me for offending anyone) man-hating and feminism has become the norm. As soon as one of these topics come up I just check out.\n\nDoes anyone else have similar experiences? How have you learned to deal with this? I just want to connect with people. I have some really great friends and I continue to meet amazing people throughout my life, but the scarcity of these connections is troubling to me. Thanks a lot for your input.
8	You don't necessarily have to see eye-to-eye with someone to create a genuine connection to them.  I've learned over time that with a lot of people, the conversations aren't going to be as "out there" as they are with some of my more open-minded friends.  Yes, the conversations about the weather, or the baseball game, or the (insert boring subject here) don't mean much in a vacuum, but you can use these little conversations in their totality to build a pretty good picture of what makes the individual tick.  \n\nHaving a real understanding of what is important to someone makes it much easier for people like us to scratch our more abstract itches even within a group of people who hold vastly different values.  Like, I probably wouldn't debate religion with a lot of my more religious acquaintances, but they might be great at giving different perspectives about how to get good at woodworking. \n\nI guess the crux of my advice is just to be less dismissive of people.  Find personalities with a least some degree of open-mindedness in subjects that are of mutual interest, and spend more time focusing on those things.  It's fucking awesome meeting an INFJ who just gets you.  Or a fellow ENTP who can debate for years without getting butthurt.  But there are a lot of different people out there, and many of them are absolute experts at one or two things, whereas a lot of us tend to be more generalists not concerned with details.  \n\nI'm sort of rambling now, but as I've grown older, I've found it way easier to connect with a wider array of people.
7	Can agree, as soon as a conversation is boring I'll check out. Although if it's important to my friend then I'll listen to them regardless of whether I'm interested.\n\nAlso\n\nFeminism is the idea that men and women are equals. \n\nI know it needs a name change to stop people from believing that's it's for women's superiority coz that fits their preconceptions.\n\nBut yeah you really shouldn't be annoyed by equality
5	No advice here. I've got the same problem, it's just usually topics they're interested in don't interest me. My way of being doesn't suit them - they think me weird, random etc. I have yet to meet like-minded individuals 
4	Why [connect with others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA) when you can instead [connect with nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca)?
2	As soon as I start talking about my thoughts my friends go „there she goes again...“ and shut me off as if I was crazy. That‘s how much I connect with people
2	It's okay if you don't connect with everybody, or even most people. The older you get, the less time you have to spend on "making (deep) connections" anyway. I generally try to use that energy/effort for other endeavours instead, like connecting better with my existing social circle or improving my professional skill-set, or even improving myself generally. \n\nI think I'm on the more "introverted" side for an ENTP, so I actually prefer having only a small circle of people with whom to really connect. Based on your post, OP, it sounds like you do have some of those people (i.e., your "great friends" and the fact that you continue to meet "amazing people"). If you want to meet more of those people, my suggestion is to look into some classes or meet-ups for people with similar interests. \n\nIn any case, I can relate to your feelings. I actually have gotten more "dismissive" of people as I've gotten older, by which I mean I've gotten quicker at filtering which personalities I'm likely to get along with (or learn something cool from) and which I'm not. Obviously, it is best to keep an open mind, but it does help to expedite the process of human interactions.
3	At least we can connect over not connecting.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Same. I’ve learned to just accept this and enjoy my time with the people I do connect well with. My parents are similar though, so maybe it is a learned behavior of distancing/non-interest. 
1	I can’t connect with most people. And not caring has made it a lot easier to find people I can connect with. I’m completely myself all the time and I know who and what I am and I know what I want. It’s lonely as shit but it’s better to be alone than with the wrong company. 
1	Relatable. My parents pointed out to me that I always have "such weird" friends and they wondered why I liked all these "strange" people...lol. Later in life I realized that I have an ability (ENTP thing?) to instantly spot people that are going to give unpredictable responses. You know those people that you talk to where you can predict everything they're going to say? Boring! \n\nIf you relate to that, just view your lack of connections as your intuition saving you time; if you're not interested in these people, building a friendship for the sake of connection isn't worth it imo. Your patience should pay off and you'll find your "strange" people that you relate better to :)
1	Everyone's way of looking at the world is equally meaningless in my opinion, so why not try to understand to the best of your ability what someone else's life is like? Everyone has a truley unique perspective, if you're persistent/perceptive enough to notice the nuansces. 
-1	I try not to connect with sheep, just manipulate them into doing stuff I like. The manipulation tactics are simple and easy to see through if you're open minded, so it acts as a filter. People who resist the manipulation usually end up being someone worth talking to.

6	Help me try and woo an INFP ples	There's this INFP I have a huge crush on. I think I'm doing well on being friends with her, however, it's quite hard for me to chat her or do anything romantic with her. And don't get me started with trying to chat with her, I don't want to push myself too much towards her when chatting but I also really want to talk to her, but when she chats I get this vibe that she doesn't want to talk to me at all, sometimes it's the opposite where we have these long and meaningful talks but most of the time it feels like I just come off as annoying and she's fed up with me chatting her. If there are good tips in which I can use on trying to woo this INFP female I would really appreciate it and also some tips on chatting with her would be greatly appreciated. I thought maybe giving her letters everyday reminder her how special she is or how I wish her a good day but I FEEL LIKE IT'S TOO CORNY? I don't know if she'll like such things, any advice on that department?  
8	1. Learn when you're hogging the microphone. Entps talk too much, it's facts. After a while you wonder whether they even understand the basic concept of a conversation being between two people. That will irritate anyone regardless of type\n2. Ask questions like what their favorite song/movie is and continue it with more quesions of how that film relates to them and what aspects of it they felt expressed deep truths about the human condition, etc. she'll eat that shit up.\n3. Dont give her letters that's too weird\n4. Try to actually learn about her and make it obvious that's what you're doing\n5. Do this all as casually as possible, as if it's effortless try to emulate aloof interest if that makes sense\n6. make sure she actually likes you back and wants to put the same effort at some point otherwise this whole endeavor is a waste\n\nAll in all this beginning stage of the relationship is a dance of lies and manipulation so enjoy that and when this honeymoon fades I hope you still like what you've got
2	Yo don't do the letters, you gotta esp remember the introverted part of INFP. We're probably the shyest type. Plus it's awkward.\n\nI think your best bet is like MasterPew said: casual, don't over think it and let her talk in exchange. If INFP's are idealists then generally they'd like sincerity, honesty and being valued for who they are (ie, their ideas, like most people). You want someone you feel comfortable enough to express yourself around. Plus you're both N so get those creative ideas flowing.
2	Run. Damn INFPs. So attractive and interesting but so hard to deal with long term.
2	Tips from an ENTP in a relationship with an INFP:\n\n\- Let them talk.  They can be pretty introverted and shy at first but when you bring up one of their interests, they will not shut up.  \n\n\- Don't be afraid to be silly with them.  Humor is really a great way to get them to like you\n\n\- They really do appreciate and enjoy the little things.  Things you mentioned like the letters or wishing them a good day will make their heart melt into a gooey mess.  \n\n\- Once you get to know them a little better, nudge them to express their emotions.  Just listen when they do and be supportive.  Don't offer logical solutions unless they ask.  Just accept them and maybe assure them and acknowledge them.  This lets them know they are validated and that you actually care about them.  \n\n\- Give them personal space and alone time when they need it.  They are introverts who need that.  \n\n\- If they are upset at you, give them a bit of time to feel through and go through their emotions before you try to interact with them.  This gives you time to think things through as well.  \n\n\- Bring them food.  Seriously, the way to an INFP's heart is through their stomachs.  Trust me on this.  \n\n\- Make them comfortable.  If they are cold, offer a blanket or extra jacket/sweatshirt (or if you are noble, offer your own).  If they get hurt, help them out with some aspirin.  Physical comfort is a bit thing for them.  \n\n\- If they offer physical touch, try not to refuse them (of course you have a right to though).  Refusing their hugs is basically the same offense as killing their grandma's pet kitten or something.  They might even cry (I refused my INFP a hug and he questioned me about it the rest of the day because he was so hurt).  Physical contact is an act of trust and an expression of love to them and by refusing it, it is like saying that you don't love them or trust them.  \n\n\- If at all possible, ask them out first.  They are extremely shy and don't risk rejection.  I had to ask my INFP out and I am a female (and he's a male; ten year olds called him dickless at camp when we were both counselors because he didn't have enough courage to ask me out).  
1	As Dale Carnegie said \n"God gave us two ears and one mouth". \n\nAsk more questions about her.\n\nTo even meet or to get a phone number,\nI always ask the same 10 questions about a woman.\n\nFor me Since 1998 whether it's\nOnline & in person it works 75% of the time.\n\n
1	Honestly you barely revealed anything about her personality AT ALL. Just knowing she's an INFP is not enough information to give advice, if you want something serious beyond mbti clichés.\nYou could easily just google "how to win over an infp" and get the same advice
1	You can woo the INFP more easily by getting in touch with your own inner FP nature. She'll love it, and see so much in common with you!
-3	> There's this INFP I have a huge crush on. I think I'm doing well on being friends with her, however, it's quite hard for me to chat her or do anything romantic with her.\n\nBeing friends with woman to be with her\n\nSo, 90% of your soldiers are already dead, you need to pull some pretty Napoleon act here
5	The state of much of America’s infrastructure is appalling when compared to nations which are nowhere near as rich, due to a cascading series of failures of imagination; failures to invest in the future; and, perhaps most of all, cost disease.	
1	As usual, 'tis the fault of the government more so than anything else. When the government is put in charge of something, you can be nearly certain it will be a colossal failure. 
2	Why are Fi and Ti so commonly confused??	There are a lot of people on here that are confused about whether or not they’re an ENFP or ENTP and I find that very intriguing. \n\nFrom knowing INFPs and ENFPs, Fi does NOT even speak the same LANGUAGE as Ti. The factors that go into decision making are NOT that similar either. It just seems like a lack of understanding regarding the cognitive functions to me but idk. 
16	It's confusing only for Fi users, mostly because if you use Ti chances are you will find Fi pretty fucking annoying most of the time.
2	Along with what others have said, probably also because the internet skews towards males, and males skew towards Thinking. 
3	I don’t see anyone confused about it except for Fi users. 
3	**Let's start off by noticing the state of the sub**:\n\nIf you look at [this month's top content](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/top/?sort=top&t=month), you'll see that the majority of top posts are memes that reflect FP traits, "feel good" validation posts, and DAE texts that could apply to any type. Usually the posts that discuss anything actually related to MBTI/the functions get little to no  attention.\n\nThe majority of users don't familiarize themselves with actual MBTI discussion, but see a meme or post and say "Oh hey, that's *totally* me!" So the sub gets filled with people (mostly FPs) who really know nothing about MBTI, but still share their feelings and opinions because they're #relatable. So it's no wonder that few actually understand what the functions mean. Over time, this subreddit has gone from a place concerned with learning more about the functions, to a place of dwindling intellectualism. \n\n**As for the function discrepancy**:\n\n It's no secret that Fi is considered an unfavorable function around here. It has a negative connotation of being irrational and self-centered, which does often prove true. I'd imagine a lot of people don't want to *admit* to being irrational, and hold onto this idea that they're "logical" (Ti) and "have many ideas" (Ne). The problem is that people don't take time to learn about the functions, so they have this *idea* of the types based on the stereotypes you find scattered over the internet - [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/amha0n/ti_vs_te_taken_from_httpworldofanentptumblrcom/) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/acvsz1/fi_users_vs_ti_users/) which are absolutely misleading. \n\n\n
1	\> From knowing INFPs and ENFPs, Fi does NOT even speak the same LANGUAGE as Ti.\n\nThis is true. Ti uses a casual language A, thus B and not C. You can almost always ask a Ti user, Why B ? \n\nFi types talk about themselves. \n\nxNFPs also do a lot of "dumb trolling" btw.
1	I think it's because they think "But ENTP and ENFP are only one letter off, so they must be similar"
75	Have you ever had people get upset at you arguing with them when you didn't even know you were arguing?	Had this happen just barely. Too lazy to explain the details but to me I was just thinking out loud and the discussion ended with "I'm not gonna have this argument anymore," which left me pretty confused.\n\nWhere's the disconnect here?
66	The disconnect is that you are gathering information in the form of debate and they are trying to prove they are right. \n\nENTPs often play devil’s advocate, and argue positions they themselves don’t even believe.\nFor you, every point the other person makes adds to your knowledge and may provide new insight. Every point you make helps to solidify whether your thought process is accurate and complete - or spurs the other person to deeper thinking and clarification of their position. It doesn’t matter who “wins”, only that you get to approach it from many angles and thoroughly see the topic as a whole.\n\nSo, you’re having a fun discussion filled with  learning and challenging mental puzzle solving, and they are trying to prove they’re right. This is made even more intolerable when you both agree they ARE right, but you continue to probe the possibilities. You’re invigorated, they’re exasperated.
22	Happens a lot with strong Fi users for me, they get frustrated and think I’m arguing, I just thought we were having a discussion 
16	Pretty common.\n\nIt usually starts with a topic, two people having different opinions, you trying to explain your opinion, the other person starts thinking you're attacking them, when really, you're just trying to have a discussion.\n\n&#x200B;
14	Feedback from the other side (INTJ here). This happens to me sometimes with my ENTP SO. We're talking about something and halfway through the discussion I start to feel like we're fighting, I get upset and my SO is all dumbfounded "what did I say, I thougt we were just talking". I think it must be Fi vs ENTP thing.\n\nLike, when I talk with my ENTJ friend, I know that his primary mode of communication is debate/fight, so I'm always ready for some heated discussions with him. But with ENTPs, it kinda comes out of nowhere, you guys are typically chill and not that invested in anything, then suddenly BAM you start "attacking" my idea with so much fuel that leaves me wondering what the fuck just happened. Even though from your point of view, you are just exploring an idea, from my side of things it looks like sudden vicious attack.\n\nI guess for some types, debating with an ENTP takes some getting used to. If people around you get upset, try to talk to them how they see the situation, explain how you see it and find some common ground. They need to accept that this is your way of exploring ideas and you need to accept that sometimes, you might want to go gentler on them.
9	This happens to me. All. The. Time. -.- \n\nApparently if you don’t agree with a person and raise a counter point or play devil’s advocate (as we tend to do lol), you are arguing. \n\nAnd people tend to perceive an attack on their ideas as a personal attack on them. \n\nWhat to do, it’s exhausting dealing with the feeler types. Might as well bury my head in the sand, lol!
7	20 years of marriage and this the whole time, so yeah. We’ve gotten better at understanding each other, though. :)
6	Ayyyy lmao. Ne Ti. You like data  for it's own sake, you like arguing both sides just to see where it takes you. Your radar for other people's feelings is okay, but brainstorming is fun! And we're having fun! Until suddenly someone is not???\n\nPeople don't say it outright but sometimes the thing they are talking to you about if mired in deeply held personal beliefs, aspirations or needs within themselves that largely go unspoken. Unfortunately this is a minefield, you may inadvertently be arguing against someone going for an aspiration they hold dear to their own heart, or asking them to countenance taking the opposite view to something that speaks to their core identity.\n\nSo the same thing happens with INTP, and I have A LOT of INTP friends, and I love 'em, but sometimes they totally forget that, hey, I'm telling you I want to work on my career more because I feel worthless, unaccomplished and like I'm not earning enough, and I'm terrified I'm going to reach 60 with not enough to retire on, and here you are telling me not to keep studying but to "put into practice what I already learned" Like. :-| wow thanks, so easy.\n\nDon't just hear the words, hear the meaning.\n\nSometimes, depending on who it is, they may be self disclosing some really important aspect of their deep desires, aspirations, loves, fears. But it's hard to hang out like that, and even me, as abrupt as I am, will couch things in veiled language when even I don't know what I'm really try to say about my core beliefs.\n\nThe horrible thing is that you might be discussing something that seems fun and objective, a safe topic, and yet in the course of the discourse (lel), you stumble upon some inner wound or longing and then bumble all over it.\n\nYou can take it to a meta level, if you really feel like giving that Tertiary a work out, but asking them outright if they'd like to talk about why this topic is personally important to them.\n\nOr if you just don't care, because it's Frank from accounting, you can just shrug, wear the label (whatever it is) and say "Whatever dude, I'm chill."\n\n^(hi, do I use Ni as my Dominant? I dunno lol)
5	yeah... It's part of being us I suppose.
8	Too real. My entire life feels like a constant series of "But wait, what did I say???" and "Of course I was listening to you, how else am I responding to all your points???"\n\nThis is me *trying* to practice Fe, no less. I've gotten better over the years of just shutting up instead, but sometimes I can't help myself. \n\nI think some of the disconnect lies in how personally different people take points in an argument. I'm usually fairly emotionally (and personally) detached from what I'm arguing, versus my conversational partner, who seems to think I'm attacking their person instead of their specific idea in the context of our specific dialogue. 
3	My mother thinks I'm "biting her head off" and gets upset every time I even slightly contradict her. She's an xSFJ.\n\nIt's infuriating and childlike. 
3	Oddly enough I have also been the person saying this, when friends of mine intentionally try to pick apart everything I say because they KNOW I can’t resist an argument. Sometimes I just don’t have the energy when I know you’re not debating in good faith!!
2	Does anyone else feel like this is just a thread with A bunch of me's and you's? Or really the whole subreddit. It feels very strange, yet very comforting.
2	It’s funny because I recognise it from my dad (ENTP) and the rest of my family who dreaded ‘having arguments’ with him. While he was just obviously enjoying a good discussion!\n\nI’m grateful we had plenty of discussions, I’m very much an INFP but he taught me the fun of going back and forth, playing devil’s advocate the both of us (we’d regularly swap sides during the discussion) and just jumping everywhere possible on a topic haha. And if it was one of my ‘sacred’ things that noone can change my feelings about, I’d just smile, shrug and leave it at that. \n\nMy mother (an INFP too) and he divorced after a couple of years mainly for this, she felt he was always fighting her. I never had that feeling, while he could be feisty as hell, there were never mean intentions. Just the desire to be challenged and dig deeper through debate. I liked that about him :). I still do about ENTP’s generally.\n
1	This happens to me all the time. I always think we are having “discussions” or “exploring an idea/issue” and I don’t even realize that the other person thinks we are competing. I think it’s in part due to the fact that I have a tendency to get a bit riled up, I feel physically and mentally energized by deconstructing things and exploring ideas, idiosyncrasies, etc. \n\nAnd then the other person suddenly says “I’m sick of this fight” and I’m always like ???? Fight who? What? Who’s fighting? I’m having a discussion. I think it’s also due to the fact that most people will take you asking “why do you think that?” As an attack. It’s honestly a compliment imo. If I thought you were completely full of shit I wouldn’t bother asking, if I respect you and your ideas enough I want to understand them because maybe you have a better understanding of something than me. I rarely come to these debates/convos/fights trying to win, I am normally trying to refine my own platform because I value my own accuracy more than I value winning anything. \n\nIt gets me peeved because if I was trying to fight you you would know. I can be so Fucking mean. A close person in my life recently told me I have a habit of leaving fights by always having the last punch and making it absolutely ruthless. The kind of thing you think about months later. And yet the same person still accused me of fighting them when I was debating the definition of speculative fiction with him! Aghhhh 
1	This happens everyday.
1	>Too lazy to explain the details\n\nI totally understand. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah, huge part of my everyday life.
1	Yeah, same, some friends won't even talk to me anymore about anything more than schoolwork, because of that. :/  I'm trying my best to not do that anymore
1	Happened on a date I was on yesterday, she was actually getting mad and I was just like...if you didn’t want to debate you shouldn’t have asked my opinion¿ apparently she just wanted to fuck but once I get into that mindset of civil debate there’s no coming back.
1	A lot of times people will say they don't want to argue when they don't like the tone they are using. They usually have a point, even if it's kind of a crutch to use whenever something is offending them/making them uncomfortable, if they are people you know well, they probably don't want you express yourself even if you're right.
1	What's crazy to me is that many times I'll evidently make a good point they won't acknowledge it right then, but then 3 months later they bring up What I said..\n50% of the time I don't recall it...lol\n\nAlthough it's Strokes my ego it's somewhat terrifying for me to think that someone remembered what I said three months ago and mulled it over that entire time.
1	SFs say this a lot, especially ESFJs and SFPs. 
1	A lot. I’m learning to avoid that but it happens.
1	Don’t talk to IxFP’s if this is a problem for you lol
1	Story of my life!! I’m over here just having a conversation and people think it’s a debate and get that “you should’ve joined debate if you like arguing so much”... I still don’t understand it.
1	I have an enfp and a intp friend both of who I can debate fiercely with and never compromise our friendship. Seriously I've debated whether or not I could kill my friend before he killed me for like two hours. However my entire family hates talking to me.
1	It can happen to me but it's not me trying to argue just trying to put my point across. 
2	How does dopamine affect satisfaction with life? – Jan Jileček – Medium	
1	Thank you for this article.\nI've been telling people about L-Tyrosine for years but had no clue on the rest that was mentioned. Again... Thank you.
1	> Dopamine is the chemical in your body and brain that is responsible for the feeling of “being rewarded”.\n\nUgh.  No it is not.  Period.
83	Rant: are we not likeable?	I'm really aggressive and I love arguing with people but it comes from a place of good intentions! I want people to be the best version of themselves they can be so of course I'll criticize, but most people think I'm scary or aggressive or a witch (????) Or they just don't like me...I feel like this is a common entp problem! Also REALLY tired of being called a sociopath. 
100	Want to be likable and make friends? Be agreeable. When you're tired of being a little bitch, realize that it's more important for them to respect you than for them to like you 
31	This calms down with age. Just learn when you can get away with being aggressive and when you can't. 
22	I've been told hanging out with me can be too intense.
13	Here's how you'll find yourself liked and respected. However, just note, this is almost a way a sociopath will operate-just don't lie to people/kill people then you won't be a sociopath. Haha.\n\nEveryone you meet is different. They like different things and they think differently. There are those that respond well to challenges and others that don't. Know who to challenge and know who not to. You want to be respected and liked? Look at what they like and what they respond to in good taste. Then, cater to that. It's simple to do with your Ne Ti Fe.\n\nBTW, intent means nothing if no one understands your intentions, or if you can't persuade someone of your intentions. Remember this, when you open your mouth, you bare the responsibility of accurately conveying your message. \n\nIf this sounds exhausting, fuck people-don't waste your time if you don't want to put in this work. Lol.\n\n-Your ESFJ buddy.
11	One of the differences between an NTJ and an NTP as I have noticed is that we mask ourselves more around people with smiles/goofiness. We don’t let many people close but will know a lot of people and if you play it right. You will be looked upon as a friendly and a rather smart person.\n\nThe way I reason it for myself is efficiency. When you piss people off they become less agreeable and more critical. I just act :’v Sure, one can argue it’s manipulation but it gets things done.\n\nAbout sociopathy. I read somewhere that ENTPs are most likely to have sociopathic traits but for some weird edgy reason I think of it as a compliment really. You know you have some degree of empathy right? That is more than enough. Trust me on that. Being objective is not sociopathy. It’s just people being people cause fair systems seem unfair to most people just cause it takes away their advantages. Also, “*insert unpopular opinion* is wrong cause it’s not most people think”. 
10	>I'm really aggressive and I love arguing with people but it comes from a place of good intentions!\n\nYour problem is not arguing with people *per se* but being agressive. If you are aggresive for no reason, then that's your problem. If people get offended because you argue with them, it's their problem. 
6	Unless you guys get dark and beat up, I think you're among the most likeable. My best friend in college was ENTP and he made more friends in a month than I did in 4 years.
6	You’re probably just an asshole. I was an asshole for years until I started dating my INFJ girlfriend, who completely changed my worldview in the best possible way. I still slip into being an asshole sometimes but once I realize I’m being overly argumentative it’s easy enough to pedal back and apologize. In my opinion, being able to realize what I’ve said/done is wrong and apologize as soon as possible has saved many friendships when I was being an asshole. 
7	If you're "really aggressive" then no, you're probably not likeable. Try being assertive instead. You can have fun and interesting discussions with a smile.
11	As an ENFP, I love you guys. Please never change. I have an issue with everyone else around me being agreeable for no reason. I personally really value honesty and a good debate. Take into account how others feel, of course, but don’t let that prevent you from saying your opinions. If you do end up being “heartless”, I’ll just use my ENFP empathy to smooth things over with the other person, easy peasy.
6	You'll find people who appreciate you the way you are - other T types mostly 😂 \nBut at the same time it does help to learn when to hold your tongue and how to challenge thoughts and ideas with tact and in a more gentle way.  Doesn't mean changing who you are entirely, just learning more effective ways to present your thoughts 
5	I'm pretty salty in general and have high standards when it comes to other people. I feel like I could be likeable if I didn't give off such negative vibes towards everyone.
6	Tom Hanks is supposedly an ENTP. I don’t think it gets more likeable than that 
2	If your goal truly is for people to be the best versions of themselves, you have to learn the way a person is motivated first. Even then, people often don't want to be treated like a project. I think whether you are aggressive or not, others will resist the idea of being a problem someone else is trying to solve. I know us ENTP's love problem solving... haha 
2	Im very likeable,because i wear capes and capes of Fe xDBut also because i make some very very complex jokes and im extremmely playfull, the problem is when people see one of my capes and draw conclussion too fast.\n\nI got a lot of Enfp friends, and one of my friend always falled in love with girls, and he was zero charm, zero game yet he was so convinced this girls loved him back, so i tried to explain to him that those girls didnt like him back and that he was being dellusional, well he called me toxic, supresive and tried to destroy me, so i leaved that guy.\n\nSome time after that, i met an enfp who had the same profile the same modus operandi, and of course i knew he was being dellusional, but since he didnt care about it, he cared about getting the will to talk to this girls, i made two cases one i explainned a plausible explanation for the girl and called it she is just friendly, but aware of it, i also made a case for the girl liking him back and well he went o that girl and she rejected him harshly, and again and again girl after girl, and one acquantance picked on it, and called me a manipulator sociopath that wanted to see my friend humilliated. In reality i knew that the bst way to know that someone is not into u, is if that person told u so, as it would make it clear, also there was tons of + for my choice compared to arguing my friend, he would develop exposure to women, loose fear of rejection, etc,etc, it was the logical choice.Yet for someone only seeing one layer would draw a shortsighted conclussion i was being a sociopath, thats the thing with people who ar not so simple,were really hard to judge.the truth is, it was all in benefit of my friend.\n\nSo ill say im extremmely likeable, since i learned to show diferent layers to people who dont see them as easily as i may think.Also because i think deeply about the best way to solve a problem, and i learned that criticizing is not the best, i learned to understand other peoples perspectives and understand why they were judging me or not getting me.Perspective is a very unique thing each of us, see thinks in our own personal way, we perceive things totally diferently, learning that, learning to use perspective in ur favor is what will make u likeable, is what ill make u the best version of urself, u need to expand ur consciousness.\n\nTeaching requires sometimess see in the future when the lesson can be learned, in the present a lot of people ar not ready for ur lesson, use that in ur favor.\n\nAnd this from someone who is quite more cold than most people here, being likeable is not a weakness, is just a tool use it.\n\nMy biggest problem is the porl  Fi, i will not feel much about anything really, so i kinda expect that most people will feel thigns with a normal level, but Fi makes people overfeel some stuff and it will let me in surprise because i often ignore that people feel with wildy different degrees about the same stimuly wich is actually the only problem i face, i dont plan on it, it always surprises me, even thoug im extremmely good with Fi types as i like to fuck them.
2	Arguing is a bad connotation. The ENTP optimistic term is debate; however, people do not always react well to criticism. My girlfriend is ENFP, and her feelings prevent the logical debate of doing things a certain way. I make trips or cooking ideas seemingly "hers" and she's more accepting of them then. I learned through school and work, the easiest way to change someone's opinion for the better, is to shape their thinking that THEY came up with doing it that way. \n\nSometimes you just have to let people fail as well. To re-use the girlfriend point, we we're cooking together once, and she put too much water in the sauce she was making. She asked me about putting flour in the sauce to thicken it (she sees me do this to make southern gravy all the time and made the connection). When I said it wouldn't work, she said I was silly and did it anyway. Thus, that night I had chunky sauce. \n\nThe hardest part of the arguing to improve someone, is realizing some people are ok the way they are and don't want change, and you shouldn't force them to or debate about it. If they ask for help, give it, but be aware of people emotions, be empathetic.
2	If you're picking every little thing to argue about, knowing that it's going to ruin the vibe of the room, then yes you'll be unlikeable. You gotta choose some of your battles. Sometimes it's called for and can make for good conversation. Other times people are just trying to have a good time and don't want to have to deal with the "ackshually" kind of petty debate. 
2	Sometimes you just need to know when to shut up and agree even if you don't agree 
2	We're not likeable. What we do is point out flaws. Flaws in thinking, flaws in being flaws all day long. And when it's are pointed out, we join in and mention flaws of ours they haven't even considered -- there's no win. \n\nWe've come to understand we're flawed and vowed to be better do we don't have to project a smoke screen up to keep our ego and serif-esteem intact around that. \n\nPeople feel attacked by us, unheard by us. They just want to tell us their flawed story. And we, paragons of virtue it seems, hear it before it's spoken and can't permit it's utterance. \n\nWe are not likeable people. \n\nOur charm is too edgy, we're too real, too present, too fast and too right. It's intimidating to weaker personalities, more reserved ones. We can be see as devils with smiles, but we're not. We're trying to be likeable and learn something new because we've been spinning our wheels too much... alone. We know lots and lots of people. We're probably legendary in some circles (not that we care). But the amount of mental energy we generate can be too intense for most. Everyone likes a flame, but one can only be so close for so long until they begin to feel their skin grow warm past the point of comfort and they have to draw back. \n\nWe are not likable people. \n\nBut when we learn that it's not about what we think, that others have autonomy, even if their flaws are glaringly evident, because everyone has a right to be their own way.\n\nAnd that trumps your "help".\nAnd usually you're distracting from dealing with your own flaws in a productive way instead of constant navel-gazing.\n\nThen we start becoming likeable people.\n\n
1	Haha I love my ENTP friend. Debating is fun! I see why people don't like him, he often says things just to get a reaction but his sense of humor is top tier. I'm an INFj, you just need to find the right people. 
1	Depends how charming you are. I’m very well liked. I genuinely care about almost everyone I meet, though, and that shines through. I always say honesty is my best quality but unfortunately also my worst. 
1	I'm totally likeable... i just don't know why!
1	I am likable and not at the same time, more likable (that's what people say about me)\n\n> it comes from a place of good intentions! I want people to be the best version of themselves they can be so of course I'll criticize, but most people think I'm scary or aggressive or a witch \n\nYou defined it very well. Indeed it comes from a place of good intentions.\n\nIn most case, during a debate, people don't listen. They only fight for their rights ignoring the facts, not being sensible. If they do something wrong they want to hide that part. For an ENTP, a debate will eventually result with a win. That makes the other side angry, terrified and they quickly get aggressive and start naming you...\n\nsociopaths, narcissist, insane...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe as ENTPs always have to cover people's mistakes and insensitivity, pushing them to be a better version of themselves both for them and society. Few understand, others cannot realize and start naming you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday I had a very simple discussion with a family in the market parking area. I wanted to give them a lesson for them to be good people. When the lesson was completed and I was totally right, they immediately started a fight and even tried to use violence. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI filter people I meet and leave people with high ego immediately. ( I have my own methods to figure them out easily) Because they never listen, no need to spend time on them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlways remember that you are the Devil's Advocate. Try getting used to it, plus make them your playground. Test them. Enjoy it, otherwise, life won't be easy for you.\n\nIgnoring them and being yourself with confidence is a good start.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Ne is self actualization out there for the whole world to see, puts lots of people off. Take solace that everyone is equally obnoxious, yall just dont hide it. 
1	You're not very mature.\n\n\nLet's get that hard truth out of the way. Aggressive is not a bad trait but coupled with trying to change people... Well that is just down right immature.\n\nI don't have advice but to say you need to change your mode of communication to be less confrontational but  gentle hand that slaps people across the face without leaving  bad taste. 
1	I view myself as an ENTP and my answer to your question is that a "true" ENTP wouldn't even ask that question. It sounds more like an ENTJ. 
1	Rather than attack directly, disarm with humor.  So much more effective and likeable than confrontation.
1	I think I'm very likeable on the surface. Except people don't like it when you're very straight forward. I learned to keep my distance and only open my mouth when I gauge that they can hang. 
1	That is probably an issue with you. Not ENTPs in "general". \n\nLike sure, there's people I just don't get along with on a friendship basis but I'm still able to have a casual talk with them and play nice. \n\nI like to play with other people's worldview a lot too because I wanna know where they are coming from. It's interesting and I usually let people know and genuinely apologise if I notice I went too far.   \nA lot of people take what you do and say at face value. No one knows your intentions if you don't make them clear. You can have oh so nice intentions but if you keep being brash and harsh while criticizing most people will probably think you're a dick. 
0	Sounds like you have bad company. Just keep being you!
0	Why do people hate arguing and debating so much, anyway?
0	Sexually Abusive Priests	What are your thoughts on this matter?\n\nI don’t understand much how it works. Do they go into priesthood normal, and then an urge is triggered while they are in service? Or were they just messed up to begin with?

2	If you like to prey on others the logical next step to fulfill that is to find some position of power
1	A lot of people think pedophiles actively seek out jobs like priesthood to prey on children. I actually disagree. I think they figure they don't plan on getting married so an oath of celibacy is fine. Additionally I can see many turning to religion to pray away such mental urges. However despite these measures, constant sexual repression inevitably results in misconduct and Big Church pays to cover it up resulting in a perfect storm of sexual abuse

8	What do you think is the most valuable knowledge in the world?	Yes, I know, entirely subjective.. But this is something I often think about. I have not arrived at any conclusion, still searching. I know there is likely no definitive answer  I think diversification of knowledge is probably most important, but if you were to prioritize knowledge or rank it how would you personally rank it?\n\nPersonally I think maybe knowing your mind and perception is most important as it is the filter through which all external and internal stimuli flows. It was what helped discover math, science etc (strengths) but also contains the biggest weaknesses of the human race.
11	I had somebody ask me once a really interesting question. “If you were a character in the matrix and you could download all the knowledge of one thing what would it be?” My answer was all facets human language. Language is one of the biggest things that separates us from other animals. Human beings have the ability to communicate about phenomenon that they have never seen and phenomenon that does not exist. Incredible. If I knew every word and understood all aspects of communication, I cannot imagine what a playground the world would be. \n\nHis answer to his own question was parkour btw. 
6	Odds.  Understanding just the basic premise that something is more or less likely to happen, or to be true, or to have potential, is foundational knowledge on which my entire understanding of the world is based on.
4	Formal logic & mathematics > empirical knowledge about the physical world (physics, biology, chemistry, etc.) > knowledge about the mind > anything else.\n\nMy initial approach was to determine which knowledge is necessary to infer as much as possible about the world without having a decent grasp at understanding a specific phenomenon. I'm not sure if I succeeded with my list above.\n\nEdit: I thought about this during my daily walk. Another take on determining what knowledge is "most valuable" is to take a pragmatic perspective focused on survival. Instead of trying to determine which knowledge is fundamental to understand the world (world as in the totality of facts) as it is, knowledge should be seen as valuable if it increases the knower's chances of survival. So, I don't need to know how many moons Jupiter has because being able to *apply* physical laws to build a shed that doesn't crush me takes precedence over creating an accurate picture of our solar system. \n\nI think ultimately the pragmatic perspective collapses into an "accuratist" approach because once humanity enters the information age (we're on the verge of it in the actual world), creating accurate theories becomes a matter of survival.

2	How to cook a hot pocket without burning the edges or it being cold in the center. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides that we already know that answer, it's the correct question is what we don't know. 
1	When you can look at yourself and understand that you are the only absolute truth you can know . I think you’ll start to get somewhere. 
1	Knowledge of the self.
1	If you can convince yourself more and more each day that you are only interacting with your own self; as if the things you imagine being outside, the "external world", if you can accept that it all exists only because you're creating it with your own perception; and that the only thing that there was all along was you alone, playing with your own self, then there's a chance for you to become more gentle at heart.
1	knowing that there is no knowledge in this world
1	Most valuable specific knowledge? Bank account numbers. Bitcoin passwords. 
1	The principle of falsifiability - accumulating testable hypotheses to explain observations and rigorously vetting hypotheses through repeatable experimentation.
1	Knowledge about the truth. The truth will never be 100% revealed and safe, but at least every person should take their time to think about what they consider as the truth. I‘m talking about how the world functions, religion, atheism whatever you are for. If someone really lives without giving any of the  deeper meaning behind everything any thought, I wonder how their priorities go. Then again this is subjective. For me the most valuable knowledge is certainty in what you believe or don‘t believe in.

1	How can you live your best life? (ENFP sup guys)
9	Spirituality and ENTPs	Hey everyone, \n\nI was wondering if any of you believe in any sort of magick or spiritual beliefs (ie. tarot, crystals, chakras, spiritual healing, animism etc) and why you believe in such. Similarly if you don't believe in such it'd be interesting to know why. If you're not an ENTP I'm happy to hear from you too (why not?)\n\nPersonally I've always been optimistic about some sort of spiritual being or presence being around. I have looked into certain forms of magick (for fun) and I still feel I can take the advice and support they can offer with a pinch of salt. (that might or might not make me less ENTP- who knows)\n\nThanks for reading! Mods, let me know if this post shouldn't be here or is flaired incorrectly- I just wanted to start a conversation haha
19	I paid a hedge witch $1000 to cast black magick on my ex gf because she cheated on me. Result?  Lost her job and is on welfare.   I'm a believer. 
9	>ie. tarot, crystals, chakras, spiritual healing, animism etc\n\nThat's really more of a NeFi thing. None of these will pass Ti's shit tests. 
6	Don't believe in anything for 2 reasons, first is haven't witnessed anything I don't have an explanation for and second is because I see things logically. I can't or wont make sense of things that aren't logical. So as far as I know magic sounds pretty retarded, but I also recognize that I don't know everything, but then again if you push knowledge far enough there would probably be logical material reasons for the magic. It comes down to the definition of magic
6	No, I don't.  Not in the sense that you're talking about.  I do believe (for certain people) that these sorts of things can have a placebo effect that could have some positive outcomes.\n\nAs to why not, simply because I haven't seen evidence for it.  
8	Its simple! There is no proof that its not true and there are no proof that it is true! \n\nSo unless we get proof of anything, nobody can know for sure if its true or not.\n\nI look down on people saying that these stuff dont exist just because they dont "think" so.\n\nI do hope these stuff exist but i wouldnt know.
4	I believe in spirits and some rituals done by folks from my province only because I saw them work.\n\nTake for example two kids kicking an old tree, the next day they both can't walk. None of the doctors could do anything and suddenly this old guy did some ritual with candles, offered a chicken to the tree, and voila, kids can walk again. He said they angered a spirit living in that old tree and as a result, disabled their legs. \n\nOur house was haunted too, so I tend to believe anything involving the presence of spirits as long as I'm the one experiencing it. When it comes to spirits, I usually throw "logic" out and automatically assume i'm being haunted. If it's just a story from someone else, I'd give it a second thought.
4	I've had the biggest fantasy boner since as long as I can remember, I'd dress up all wizardly and mumble strange chants and hand movements in the hopes that MAYBE a fireball will appear in my palm, so far no such luck.\n\nI'd love to believe, our world appears so washed out and mundane compared to fantasy, but I've yet to see anything to support said belief, instead the contrary.
3	I don’t believe in any of the cards or crystals hr fuck yeah I believe in spirituality, I think that’s what gives people character. I’m just me in a sack of meat.
3	As someone who was born seeing spirits and having psychic abilities, I believe in that stuff.  \n\nI believe that there is so much science cannot explain with our current primitive understanding of the universe.  Everything in existence is made out of electricity or perceived through electricity in some way.  Our realities are created through electricity.  Scientists can't even explain what exactly electricity is but only describe the generalizations of how it behaves.\n\nEverything we perceive as solid is just a bunch of smaller electrical particles that make up atoms.  Our mind only perceives it as solid and the process doing it is just a bunch of neurons (made out of atoms which are just made of smaller bits of electricity) carrying electric signals through our brain, firing in a certain pattern that our consciousness perceives as being a chair or a rock.  \n\nEmotions are electricity (as they are electric signals in the brain or chemical messengers that are made of atoms which are made of smaller electrical parts...you get the point).  \n\nI think there is another way of sensing and gathering information that most people refer to as a mystical or spiritual sense.  \n\nThere is the "concrete" way of taking in sensory information like sight, sound, touch, etc.  Animals have even more ways of getting information that humans wouldn't understand (like echolocation).  Does that mean it doesn't exist because it isn't in our direct senses?  No.  Does sight stop existing for all the people who can see because of blind individuals? No.  \n\nThen why is it so hard to believe that some individuals can sense spiritual things that some people don't on a daily basis?  \n\nI think spiritual senses are simply a gathering of information in a shortened intuitive way.  In a way that is more associative than specific.  With your eyes, you may see a red coffee mug sitting on a table.  Using this metaphor, a spiritual sense would instead perceive things associated with the overall concept and "energy" of the coffee mug such as impressions of the color red or maybe the smell of coffee.  It is like the idea or object is communicated using the shortened energy code rather than going through all the complicated processes using the physical senses.  It is like direct concepts being communicated.  \n\nThis is why spiritual senses often involve symbolism, emotions, or more simple and vague objects.  A strong sense of association is needed for this.  \n\nI am not sure exactly how this energy that transfers information like this in a shortened form works on a specific level but I know that even the most skeptical human has the ability to sense it.  They just don't believe they can and therefore do not notice it.  The most common way of this happening is when people get gut feelings with no rational explanation for it.  \n\nI do believe that quantum level discoveries could explain this in the future.  They are just now starting to discover quantum entanglement (how two previously related then separated objects can affect each other remotely with no time lag) and that what we observe is in fact altered by what we expect to perceive.  \n\nMaybe spiritual knowledge is just simply a form of knowledge transfer through some sort of process related to quantum entanglement.  I can't say for sure but can only speculate.  Maybe it is somehow the direct transfer of the stimulus happening directly to the brain which then triggers the electrical patterns in your brain.  \n\nThat being said, I believe that most spiritual things are simply energy related.  Chakras are just energy centers.  Not completely sure what tarot (I think that "tells" the future) or crystals do so I really don't have a comment on that.  I personally am a spiritual healer.  I believe in the existence of souls and reincarnation.  I believe in different dimensions (and that our planet is going through as shift in consciousness right now).  \n\nCall me stupid.  I really don't care.  If I ever feel petty enough, I will be telling the doubters "I told you so" when this shit is all explained in the future using quantum physics.  
2	I believe it works for people who think it works. Probably it's a Placebo effect? Or maybe Confirmation Bias?
1	Hell no.
1	I was really high on acid and felt like chakras were real.. so there’s that..
1	nope nothing\n\ni couldn't believe if I wanted to its just not made for me\n\nI'm perfectly fine with oblivion after death as if you don't feel anything you wont feel anything. \n\nsupernatural experiences are largely guided by chance and the emotional response tied to it. theyll fuck you up more than anything and you better believe it cause emotions are the reality.\n\ni could entertain the idea of a god, gods, spirits and such but it would remain an exercise.\n\nso can everything be reduced to 'science'? human psychology? like how ouji boards are moved via micro muscle twitches? this i remain indifferent on too. sometimes it does, sometimes it doesnt. the human brain spins the narratives, finds the patterns and the meaning. i just go along with it
1	Background: I grew up in an evangelical household, then my mother got into alternative medicine, so I learned alot in my teens.\n\nI like Tarot as an insight into my own brain; it's a Rorschach test but with cooler art and history. I use chakras as a way of sorting my emotions and working though them.  I like crystals because they're pretty, and if it's a placebo, well the side affects are small and it looks cool. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been told I'm clairvoyant, but I chalk it up to being hyperperceptive.

12	Psychological MBTI analysis of 1200 reddit users	
34	> Another negative correlation you can see in this example is that people who feel superior do not feel emotions very much. Or a positive correlation between people who said they feel their breathing fully and who meditate regularly. Another interesting one is that people who reported breathing deeply also feel their emotions more. And people who feel their emotions correlate with having more friends. Thus, meditation implies more friends.\n\nUgh. This chain of reasoning is just plain wrong. \n\nPeople who watch football correlate with liking beer.  People who like beer correlate with liking hot dogs.  Therefore people who watch hotdogs drink footballs....or something.  You can’t compare correlations like that. There is no causal chain of implications to be inferred. \n\nThis is survey data with vague definitions.  It could simply be that people who report being more emotional have a different, more emotionally tinged definition of “friend” than people who report not being emotional.  So what constitutes a “friend” to one type of person (“I’m friends with everyone!”) may be not be thought of as a friend to others (“I have a few special people in my life.”).   \n\nLikewise it’s also possible that people who report being “more emotional” are reporting positive emotional states. But people who are likewise very negatively emotional — moody, sullen, depressed, hostile, etc, report themselves as *not* being emotional.\n\nLikewise, many meditation techniques focus on breathing.  So people who meditate are *more likely to claim* they are aware of their breathing, especially if they're primed to confirm that with previous questions about doing yoga or meditation, etc. \n\nI don’t think you can draw the conclusions you’re making from these questions, irrespective of some magical p-value.\n
9	The descriptions of introversion, extroversion and sensing are phrased poorly or are just plain wrong tbh
8	the chart in the article is difficult to decipher
6	These are self-reported answers from self-typed subjects, right? Just clarifying.
3	Someone made one conclusion and forced this entire article to justify it. Hence the errors, the improper characterizations, and the just plain cryptic chart in the beginning. 
3	That chart is way over complicated.
2	On which sub was this survey posted?
2	That chart is textbook r/crappydesign
1	Many of the comments here, while potentially valid, may corroborate the relationship between feelings of superiority with a lack of friends. *Who knew that being know-it-all mansplainers would negatively effect our social lives!?!* Someone should have warned us.
2	Weirdly strong Fi?	I'm not *certain* of my type as an ENTP, but the description of the functions seems pretty on point, except for Fi as PoLR. My N is heavily dominant over my S, my T and F are relatively balanced, and people who attempt to type me see Ne more often than Ni. The question of ENFP vs ENTP is more difficult. I have an obsession with making sure my ideas are internally consistent that doesn't really concern itself with how practical they are, which shows Ti over Te. I'm super invested in winning other people's approval to the point of making myself miserable, which suggests Fe over Fi. And yet... Even though Fi isn't *quite* as prominent in my life as Ti or Fe, it's still a major factor. I'm very *aware* of what my heart yearns for even if I don't actually pursue it. It's not a "blind spot" in the way that the PoLR function is generally described as. At the same time, ENFP makes even less sense as a type. While I find the people in r/ENFP quite relatable, Ti being a blind spot seems even MORE ridiculous than Fi being one. Do I misunderstand the meaning of "PoLR?" Is the Beebe stack simply incorrect? Or should I conclude that I'm mistyping myself?\n\nMy apologies if this question is inappropriate, but if there are other ENTPs out there with unusually prominent Fi that would help a lot of pieces fall into place.
13	I wouldn't take Beebe-inspired function theory too seriously personally.  Most people can't even decide their primary function, never mind discerning the effect of some mysterious 8th which is supposedly buried so far down in the unconscious to be practically non-existent. \n\nFor what it's worth, many Fi types have trouble discerning Fi from Ti, because they both have a similar form of valuing internal rationalizations (the so-called subjectivity).   Moreover if a Fi and Ti type both agree on a path of reasoning, then there's there no conflict.  So Fi looks identical to Ti in that case. \n\nYou can think of Ti as a stricter form of Fi -- one which disallows the types of rationalizations that Fi makes.   Ti is a far more limited function in this regard.   Fi allows itself to make rationalizations based on inferred meaning rather than being forced to conclusions like Ti.   \n\nAs an example, a Fi type might read about how we're all made of stardust and then infer a meaning from that -- about the connectivity of all things and about a shared, common nature.   They may then apply that in their reasonings and judgements.  For instance, they might be antagonistic to racism based on that principle.  ( That's an example of why some people say Fi is 'values based' but it's not really quite so specified.  )   I Ti used, while he may come to the same realization about starstuff, is unlikely to adopt that as a meaningful observation which then gets applied to other facets of life. \n\nI personally think that ESFP is a more similar type to ENTP than ENFP.   NeFi can be really "out there" and the more grounded and rational nature of Se reels those tendencies in with the ESFP, so they seem more superficially ENTP-like.   So you might want to consider that as well, even if you feel you are certainly an N. \n\nBut for what it's worth, I don't see any of the usual Fi-type language I usually expect when people make these posts.  So I don't see any immediate reason to rule out ENTP.  \n\nAnother thing to consider, I've noticed that ENTP women are often less sure of their type, likely because emotionality gets confused with F-reasoning which aren't the same thing. 
3	You can still have values. I see a lot of circle jerk in this sub about wanting to be in the same box of not caring and being disorganized and a wasted  intellectual thats unaware of emotions. Its not as bad as your daily "I cried earlier today when my dog dieded am I still XNTJ" or "Im disorganized am I an XNTJ" neurosis post. But still can be pretty obnoxious.\n\nYou're more likely to have some basic values but you wont use Fi candidly  the way an Fi user would to organize and stick to a matrix of morality. 
1	Why do you think your Fi is strong?
104	Ti vs Te (taken from http://worldofanentp.tumblr.com)	
29	Te meet Fi.  Ffs
14	This is the stupidest depiction of Ti I've seen.
18	I refer to my knowledge monster as "internal working model of life".\n\nIt feels like a million tiny gears clustering into a giant movement (a mindmap machinery of sorts). If something is logically out of place, it'll block large areas of the machinery. Every bit of new information I get, is carefully placed somewhere in the machinery. If it does not fit the machinery either the new piece of information is wrong (question it) or the surrounding cluster of information is wrong (question and/or restructure).\n\nIn the end, the machinery will either grow and/or improve.\n\nThis is also how I explain that I often just know something to be wrong or right even though I don't have the corresponding information. Too many hard proven cogwheels of my machinery wouldn't work if that new piece of information was to be true. I can also fill/estimate the gaps of information if the cluster of information around the missing spot is dense enough. There just aren't many options left of what fits the blank space.\n\nTransferring this understanding of my internal machinery onto a Fi user scares the shit out of me...
13	All I see is:\n\n1. Te condemns innocent person for murder.\n2. Te is a child killer.
7	Ti is the pruning of the leaves and the watering of the trees of the ecosystem of logic.\n\nTe is the fucking Lorax. 
16	Shamelessly  biased graphic from a Te user\n\nLet me try an equally biased rebuttal.\n\nTi - able to connect & rationalise complex systems and ideas, to create new systems and ideas\n\nTe - Bases their opinion on the logical achievements of Ti users who actually turned out to be correct.\n\nMad? 
4	I'm definitely the guy who wouldn't rush to conclusions, but I'm not sure what the second visual is getting at.
6	Generally, I think that extroverted thinking incorporates the soldier, sargent , executive archetype way of making decisions based on established principles of logic, and that  Ti are the ones that incorporate the magician, alchemist, inventor, chessmaster, erudite archetype of the observation of knowledge, and the constant desire  of discovering those principles. Also, I want to pin point that there is no intelligence type better than the other, it's just the trade off between application and research that we need in those rational parts of society.\n\nAlso , isn't it a beautiful occurrence ? We are naturally in interweaved system of cooperation and order. I always think that  at the end, we are just little, egotistical, cooperative, intelligent ants working for the same things . We need systems  the same way they need us.\n\nEdit: second language grammar and sintaxis. 
1	can someone explain to me what the e and I mean. like I know my type  (entp) but have no idea where those other letters come from
1	Never contribute in this sub just wanted to randomly stop by and say you people take this stuff way too seriously, it’s basically astrology
12	Help! I’m an INTJ (m) who has been on a couple of dates with an ENTP (f)	We hit it off when we’re together. Conversations flow and we get into some really deep and personal conversations.\n\nBoth of us have showed obvious interest, but I’m unsure of where to go from here. How do I not lost her interest (she’s voiced she regularly loses interest) and what can I do to keep her interested?\n\nShould I be giving her space or regularly continue talking to her?
16	I'd say looking into what really makes the ENTP tick or what they like to do hobby-wise. I want to date someone I can share everything I'm into with one way or another. If you stimulate me mentally or share some hobbies, I'll stay around. Ultimately, I just have to like your personality. If you're funny, smart, attractive, and fun, I'd probably date you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nthat being said, don't wear yourself out trying to please or satisfy an ENTP. Who can really tell what will happen? Don't spend energy trying to make someone like you or changing yourself for someone you have a crush on?
11	> (she‘s voiced she regularly loses interest)\n\nWe usually don‘t know ourselves why we lose interest in the first place (or at least I don‘t)\n\nBut some things I can say where I know the reason why I lose interest is that 1) It makes logically no sense in the long run and I can already see the negative aspects of it. 2) When the person is not as interested in deep topics as I am (it seems you are though) 3) If I don‘t like their lifestyle. 4) Don‘t do anything that will be a warning sign to her.
8	Regularly continuing talking to her. If u give her space, she's probably gonna find something else to occupy her time. But also, you just gotta be the right person to keep her interested. I mean I don't suppose you can maintain a distance constantly even within a relationship? \nWhat I would like for as an ENTP (f) would be someone who I can vibe with and stay entertained many years down the road. Cause I think about the future a lot. \n\nOnly people who have kept that up so far have been Ne types. I have a few INFJ friends, we usually talk with a purpose in mind, it doesn't get boring mainly cause we meet once a week and they are offer much deeper and meaningful conversations than Ne, probably due to their Ni. So I guess that's a plus point for you, but I'm also friends with a few INTJs, they do have the whole deep and meaningful aspect of Ni but they lack that sense of wonder/excitement of Ne. \nSo maybe channel some Ne. Explore. Just go on a date seemingly unplanned and spontaneous etc. Make jokes, be funny. \n\nAlternatively you can do the ole- bed her and wed her tactic.
6	ENTP gal here ... I like interesting, new, clever and thoughtful things :-) And interesting talks, and good company ... and if I like you I don't want to be left alone, I'd prefer to hang out!
5	Be yourself, but the most open version of yourself. Entertain her ridiculous ideas. Play with her hypothetical questions. Say yes if she asks you to do some random activity you've never done before together. ENTPs like to stay curious. 
5	INTJ (28 f) here, I’ve been dating an ENTP for a year. I don’t know your exact situation, so I’ll tell you what worked for me and maybe it will be helpful to you as well. My ENTP needed a lot of space in the beginning, at first he didn’t want to hang out more than once a week but he wanted to chat on facebook 24/7. Gradually he became ready to see me more and these day we can spend weeks at a time together. Also, he doesn’t want me to assume he wants to be left alone. So communication seems to be very important, ask your ENTP how often she wants to see you IRL/talk to you online. Keep talking to her, that will keep her interested. Other than that, I’d recommend trying two things that are difficult for us INTJs but seem to be vital for ENTPs: make sure she knows you love her, because it seems to me that ENTPs need that emotional security, despite their sometimes unemotional/tough facade. Second, be open to new ideas, be spontaneous, try new meals at restaurants, try new hobbies with them, show your ENTP that you want to discover the world with her.
5	I can’t speak on behalf of all ENTP females. This take it with a grain of salt. It  should also be known that I myself might be misrepresenting my own emotions without knowing it, attributing too much of a logical framework to it.\n\nIt’s hard to tell with the first few  meetings! A couple of dates and the other person is always exciting and fun. And information is fun to extract from said person. But it’s also important that the ENTP not be the only one digging for information. You should both be mutually doing so. Seems obvious right? \nHowever I know personally I have a lot of hallow relationships where I was digging to retrieve their information and ideas and they loved the attention so much they stuck around. But that ended and so did my interest in them. I knew all I wanted and they knew little about me aside from some hobbies and passions. But emotionally, my past, who I was. That was uncovered ground. And ultimately they were a well for me to take from while they never really took from mine. So it was easy to leave because they didn’t really know me, they only liked what I did for them. Which I mean doesn’t everyone like? But if it’s my mutual than the infatuation runs dry and no foundation is onne aobuilt. If you are both exchanging information about each other at a similar rate. You learning about her and her learning about you. Than you should be fine. And if she gets bored of you it’s likely not your fault just a lack of compatibility to begin with or that she’s simply underdeveloped herself.  Either way you can steer it in the right direction but if it’s hopeless than its should be allowed to shrivel up. \n
3	Be yourself and be honest.\n\nI have come to expect INTJs need social clarification and to a degree honest verbal reassurances. I don't mind giving it to them. I like the honest and open dialogue.\n\nLet her know in a casual and honest way what you need. ENTPs tend to be fairly adaptable. 
1	I’m an ENTP female and I’m not saying the following applies to all ENTPs, but they are the most important things I look for in a person when I’m deciding if they are worth making long term contingency plans with. :)\n\nFirstly, be interesting and be authentic. Do not try too hard to impress her or try to appease her too much, that will definitely make her lose respect for you and she will subsequently lose interest as well. \n\nAbove all, the most important thing you can do is be the best version of yourself and have a life (I’m not suggesting you don’t but just making a general statement) beyond this relationship. \n\nShow her that you live your life on your own terms and have your own individual goals, interests, values & hobbies. Show her that you are a self-aware man - you know your plus points as well as your flaws and you are willing to work on your flaws and evolve as a person. I think this last point is very important and acts as my acid test. I cannot imagine being with someone long term who does not have a growth mindset or is resistant to it.  \n\nOne more final thing, common hobbies & goals do not matter. The only thing that matters is that you share some core values about life, and for that you need to engage in deep discussions and get into her mind. Physical passion is not enough to keep our interest.
1	Talk to her. INTJ's are very comfortable being alone and need that time.  ENTP's do not really need that alone time.  If she's into you, if she knows you could grow with her and keep up with her you most likely will know...Actually you might not, because she can't read you.  DAMN FRUSTRATING INTJ's You are usually not easy to read, and ENTP's can do that usually really really well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI (an ENTP) have known a INTJ  female, and recently I'm single and she is now too.  So we just decided to hang out, not even a date.   The conversations are amazing, only one other woman has compared to that..  INTJ's are generally really smart and can keep up with me intellectually and follow a wide ranging conversation and bounce ideas off each other....   But I had no clue on how she felt beyond that and usually...actually always do,  whether if it's friend or if she wants more.  I got sick of it and straight up asked.   Too soon after each of our relationships, and to be honest that was the Healthy answer.\n\nKeep up with her Intellectually, Support her ideas and new ventures, if you get in the way you'll be saying good bye.  If you support her in new and interesting things that she'll get into then she'll have a partner in it, she should see that that growing with her and she most likely will really value it.
1	To everyone suggestion "be yourself" - that is the shittiest advice that is usually given to men by women. It doesn't work and it is misleading garbage that we keep regurgitating because it somehow "feels right to say".\n\nInstead, you want to be best version of yourself.\n\nIgnore the MBTI world for a second and consider the most important two rules of dating:\n\n* be attractive\n* don't be unattractive\n\nWhy do you like women (in general)? Simple answer: because they are women and you are a man. Sound horrendously stupid but that is literally it. This works the same way around for women. They like men because they are men.\n\nSo instead of running down a panic spiral by trying to impress and entertain her, I suggest you switch your perspective. She's seen what you have to offer and she has expressed that she likes what she sees (otherwise this would already be over). You already tick all the boxes to make you attractive in her eyes.\n\nWhats left to do is signal your intentions clearly. No holding back, you will need to escalate. Most of the time, she will want you to take the lead.\n\nWhen you meet, take her hand and lead her places you like and find interesting. Tell her stories that you like, instead of stories you think might make her like you more. Open up your world and let her peek inside (only a little bit at a time...).\n\nMake sure to always keep in mind that you are not trying "to make friends" with her. You want to be with her in a (very) sexual way. If there is three things that you should focus on it is this:\n\n* let her know that your are a man and that you are interested in her as a women - not an asexual playmate\n* work on yourself to fulfill the two most important rules for dating\n* be the person you **want** to be
-4	You're not playing chess here, just fuck her right in the pussy. She'll love it. If you ever sense that she is beginning to lose interest, then you just keep fucking her right in the pussy, a lot. Stop talking to her. Nothing you say makes any sense to her and she thinks you are dumb. She's only putting up with it so that you will fuck her right in the pussy.

26	Do ENTPs come back?	He destroyed my image of him in one blow-up. I pushed him in the end, I was scared. He had a strange duality of sweet charm and childish detachment. It was unexpected, he had never been so hurtful with how he spoke to me even once before. He said things to me like he had no friends and yet he had more close friendships than I've ever had. He'd have done anything for me he said, and really did try. He's one of the only people I'd ever let so close to me in my life. I wanted to remain friends, he was offended at the idea. He apologized after his blow-up, he said he's been hurt too much by me, he doesn't want to speak until he's done with school (he has a rebound already).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI normally get people out of my head very easily.
42	If you’ve pushed me to that point, chances are I’m not coming back. I don’t cut people out of my life willy nilly, so once I’m done with someone there’s probably a good reason for it. \n\nThat being said, I’m more than capable of saying things I don’t mean when I’m angry, too. Depends on the details of the situation and what’s actually happened between you guys. 
16	ENTP here. \nDon't expect him to turn back if he is in such a state!\nHe will turn back only when he is feeling nostalgic, and is waiting for "the next victim".\n\nI would advice you to move on.\nUs ENTP's (when young, immature and mostly hurt) endulge ourselves in new romances to suppress that ache in our soul that is constantly there reminding us that we fucked up and were too afraid to commit to something serious.\n\nI am speaking from experience here.\nTook me a Good 10 years to realize that I was an ENTP and was able to grasp what it was all about when taking the MBTI tests (took several to be sure) and started working on my ignorance and my faults as a human soul.\n\nTL;DR: He's hurt and immature. Seeks new romances to suppress the pain. Move on.\n\nEdit: Autocorrect...
7	ENTP here and yes, I do come back. I can blow up an say a lot of hurtful things, things I don't really mean, but it's just... vicious. And sometimes after it I'll want to come back, hoping that this person knows me better than that, knows that I really didn't mean all the things I said (not all of them, well). But sometimes damage is already done and coming back is not possible so I just accept consequences of my actions 
4	Depends on the severity of the situation. Did your actions really hurt him that much, and is he still gonna see you often?\n\nIf it were me and I'll still see your face, I'll find it hard not to talk to you and if I'm gonna be seeing you anyway, why make it hard on myself? I'll talk, but I'll subconsciously shut you out and I wouldn't be as comfortable telling you my inner thoughts but you still have a chance.\n\nBut if your actions really hurt me, then I'm leaving. Keep in mind that it's hard to **really** hurt an ENTP. 
5	For me, when I was done, I was 100% done.. it took a while to push me to that point.\n\nI went through a phase when I was younger.. I would fall head over heels, I'd give 110% and do anything for the person I loved, even to the point of being a detriment for myself. I always felt like I gave more than the other person, and when things would go wrong, I would desperately do whatever I needed to do to fix it, even to the point where I had to give up important things to make someone happy.\n\nI used to be emotionally open, wear my heart on my sleeve to those close to me. It took a while to get me to open up, but once I opened up, you got all of me. For the most part, I had a tendency to hang on and make things work, even if I realized I wasn't truly in love with whoever.\n\nIt usually takes a very hurtful deed to make me end something, whether it was lying, infidelity, abuse.. something that put me so over the edge that I had to burn the bridge, although I would be emotional about it. I have to cut that person out so I can heal myself, and I didn't always mind having a rebound, although I was rarely serious with them.\n\nI wouldn't say never, things always change and I would have to see some real effort and change from someone who hurt me.. but I would always have it in the back of my mind, and might be overly cautious or paranoid to trust the person again after being hurt. I would not make the first move to come back though because I would never crawl back, from just embarrassment and maybe some anger. I'd expect someone to come to me if they really wanted me back after hurting me.. maybe that's some immaturity on my part, but to hurt me that bad, is sometimes devastating.\n\nAgain, this is just me, though.
5	He sounds like a “basic” ENTP. I identify as a male ENTP and when feeling or falling in love or in a relationship, I dive into it 110%, and even prior to diving into it, I go through every possible scenario and step to make sure that this relationship is even worth going into 110% in the first place. I’d say when ENTPs, or I, fall in love or are in a relationship, we will go out of way to move mountains for you, and if there’s no reciprocation, or reaction, on any scale and it’s mixed with a scenario in which I’m “forced” to address feelings and/or deal with matters of the heart...it's something that is not completely “natural” for an ENTP to handle, unless it’s balanced with a logical approach. \n\nIf we come to the point, of realizing that we can’t approach this problem or any problem, logically, but only emotionally, that is the moment that will drive us, insane. Then, if I ever reached my breaking point (and it takes A LOT to get there) and when truly angry, I will go out of my way to pick up “that mountain I’ve moved for a person, and drop it on them” and never go back.
3	They don’t. I have to echo the other answers. I do this all the time when I think trust is broken or there has been some type of betrayal. Now that I am older I manage to stay on speaking terms at least but never the same again. You should move on. 
5	ENTP here too\n\nBut I come back.\n\nWhenever I cut someone I care out, after a while I regret this and miss that person. I really don't know how many times has this happened. \n\nYou know, I easily forget what happened. \n\nSo I say, he may come back. But he may not too. \n\n
3	People who hurt us the most stay in our mind the longest. But it's not a sign to go back, it's a sign to RUN! 
3	I can't speak for the others, but if you have pushed me to the point where my give-a-damn busted, then no.  I will never come back.  Byeeeee and don't let the door hit you in the butt on your way out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is partly because to get me to that point, trust has to be broken in some way.  I can forgive and get over it, but I can't repair the broken trust.
2	That sounds complicated, not complex.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA come back? It depends on the person, M&B is only the top of the iceberg.\n\nPlease don´t ask help, accept things and walk !
2	Rarely, especially when we're younger, sorry. Normally the younger we are, the more egotistical we are, and two things ENTPs normally hate doing is admitting when we're wrong and being forced to change for someone. We'd rather be alone than do those two things, and we **hate** being alone. \n\nIt may be best to try and move on. I am sorry to put it bluntly, but it's for the best. 
2	It's all about full complete pure authenticity. I could see why remaining friends would be offensive to him. I think ENTPs can come back although it would probably mean you two are in different places in your life than you are now (probably a ton of progression on both parts)
2	I'm an entp. I've never been accused of moving too fast through relationships. I'm a pleasure delayer. I get a lot out of conversation and I love learning about someone. I think all entps get pride from being able to charm someone for an extended period of time.\n\nI've become a master at compartmentalizing thoughts. When I'm done with something or someone, it's over. I'm not vindictive or malevolent, but I also don't make an effort to be friends. I've also never been in love.\n\nNobody wants to hear they're unloved. An entp sees this as a door closing that he'll probably never get back into, even if he wanted to. That's probably why he got that upset. I never loved any of the women I've been with, but I was never happy when it was over. I don't go out with just anyone, so I always see potential in every relationship. That being said, I got over all these breakups very quickly due to compartmentalizing.\n\nIt seems like you two are still very young. Like the whispers sang in 1978, "like the sweet sound of good music, there will always be something new." 
2	I've cut people out of my life for years in circumstances like this, very often not looking back. Occasionally I'll look back 5-10 years later to check in and see if they're okay when feeling nostalgic for the friendship part, but it's never really the same. And it's *definitely* never romantic, at best it can just be casually friendly.
2	If you want it you better go after it.\n\nOnce I cut someone out, while I may be open to something still w them, i’m certainly not coming back no matter how it hurts
2	I always wanted to come back, but (thankfully) those options never really managed to be open. (xNTP)
2	Listen, if u really want this dude back tbh don’t wait for him to initiate it.. you’ve got to do it. It sounds childish bc it is, it’s easier for us to deal with it that way and plus I think it’s more logical to distance myself as far away as possible to drop the feelings as quick as possible(and it’s surprisingly quick) but I won’t sacrifice the possibility of hooking up with the chick again if it was good, but it depends on the severity of the conflict, OR just to flex on the chick with a different bitty - I’m petty like that 😈. ANYWAYS... Like personally, I’ll get the urge to text or snap a chick that I just recently stopped talking to when I see their Instagram post or snap story or even in person, but I think it through and choose not to bc I don’t see the logic in it. But if she’s fast enough and contacts me I’ll most likely respond back, but I’ll test them first to see if it’s worth it, like I’ll take awhile to respond back then see how long it takes them to reply, short answers, etc... if u know u know 🤷‍♂️, just playing hard to get (it’s a natural talent yenno ENTP’s). \nThen, if all goes well I’ll see where it goes. \n\nNOTE: this will all depend on the situation of course, not at all common for me to give a 2nd chance to some chick, unless the pussy was BOMB AF or the issue was not serious at all.. anyways if anything else happens after that rare 2nd chance or if I feel like it, I’LL DROP YOU LIKE IVE NEVER KNOWN YOU without hesitation, but tbh I’m one of the ENTP’s who are more callous in these types of situations because I’ve done it quite a lot so forgetting someone who I was close with isn’t a challenge and I have no problems with it whatsoever. \n\nHate it or love it haha good luck 
2	On the rare occasion that I cut people out of my life, I don’t really ever turn back to them. It take a *lot* to push me to that point.
2	I'm an Intj, and the entp I dated came back about 3 or 4 times?
2	You sound like my ex describing me. Crazy. Well, I being an entp, remained friends with my ex after finding out I was a rebound, and that's worked out well. So I guess it really depends. Good luck
1	Funny how this sounds exactly like an ENTP friend of mine, who just distanced himself away from everyone a while ago and made a new bunch of friends with ESxPs. \n\nHe never brought the topic up again. Years later, though, I got to to know that my two friends kinda sorted it out, not completely though, but we're on speaking terms.\n\nSo really speaking, I'm an INTx don't ask me.
1	when i read the title 'do entps come back?' i was shocked and started thinking how someone could come back after death
1	people are individuals. our MBTI type doesn't determine every decision we will make in life, there are other factors at work.\n\nyou have a relationship problem, not an MBTI problem. OR rather, your relationship ended and you regret it. 
0	Any emotionally intelligent person will say sorry, and try to don't fall in the same rabbit hole again . Also I think I that I cannot comment because I don't know the background of your social relation, so any advice would just fall shallow. Remember that in ANY sort of behaviour there's always an explanation in the environment. Hope that helps. Also, seeking explanations of people behavior in the internet is useless because  people will always comment their overconfident, biased opinions about the situation. Be careful of the self confirmation bias.
-1	That ENTP was a jerk to you. People all tend to be jerks sometimes. So, remember his jerkness and how awful he was to you and please don't want him back. Go out there and live/love again. Its painful sure, but it's a valuable lesson for a better you tomorrow. 
-1	"childish detachment" sounds Fi as fuck. 
-10	ENTP here.\n\nFuck that guy.
3	Projections of the Introverted Functions	
2	This was an interesting comment written by u/The_White_Baron on the ways in which introverted functions project their ideas/assumptions into others. Original post got removed, but the comment is worth sharing. 
4	Do you remember what you had for lunch yesterday?	Cause I so often don't. I feel like I've got really terrible memory. I don't remember what I ate, I don't even know what I had for breakfast till I focus really hard on it. \nAlso, I very often don't remember people's faces and then see this person and wonder if this person is who I think they are. Same goes with names. \nOn the other hand I can rember poems pretty easily, songs, facts I've read somewhere.\nSo I guess my question is, what is your memory like?\n\nPS. Please, don't suggest that my problems with memory are result of some medical condition, I have heavy health anxiety, and am hypochondriac-like, so it's really not a good idea. Thanks in advance.
10	I think you tapped into the difference between S and N -- S is more focused on individual data points and the contents of a specific instance, N is interested in the bigger picture. Si creates a detailed internal map of concrete information (like an actual map of a room for example) while Ni does the same at a conceptual level. \n\n\nI suck at remembering details, names, what I had for lunch yesterday or what Paula was wearing the night before. Ask me about the general outline of some concept or idea though, and I can reproduce it easily. I have no problem remembering deadlines though. Truth be told, the ever so often used line of "I forgot we had homework" was usually code for "I didn't care enough to do it". \n\nI think a lot of it has to do with interest. I simply don't care about remembering minuscule details but I do want to understand the underlying structure or logical form of something. Compare this to an ISJ. N and S will clash because their foci on what is considered important are at odds with each other -- S thinks N to be an "absentminded professor" who forgets to have breakfast and spends too much time in his head and N thinks S can't see the forest for the trees and more often than not offers nothing than trivial non-information. 
3	so your problem's remembering lunch?  i even forget what i had for breakfast and my home that was a few meters away.\n\nthose things are not necessary you dont need to remember them.Just hope your food gets digested.people just make us think like we should be aware of that crap
2	I don‘t remember names. faces. what I did the past few days. I forget to even listen to the lyrics of songs, but I do know what I‘m going to do next and I can explain every fact I‘ve understood with my own words
2	No I don't remember what I had, but if you find it important to remember that here is a few tips;\n\n1: don't tell yourself you have bad memory, short term and long term memory are 2 different things. I may not remember what I had for lunch yesterday, but I do remember that in the month of July when I was 4 ( 23yrs ago ) I was at a trailer park with my grandparents, and right before I went to bed I looked out the window and saw the sunset for the first time. (That I remember)\n\n2: write it down, not only you will have it written for reference, but you are running the memory through your mind multiple times which will help you remember better. \n\n3: think of your mind as your body, and your legs as your memory, DON'T SKIP LEG DAY!!!\n\n4: don't forget\n
1	I have a lousy memory for that stuff.  I really have to think hard to put together the sequence of mundane things I’ve done over the last few days.  I also have difficulties memorizing things like poems or songs — even if I love them. But I remember faces, even if I don’t remember names.  Other things, like little pieces of family history my grandmother told me as a kid, I remember 30 years later.
1	I do, because I usually have the same kind of food everyday. 
1	Yup easy. Nothing. I never eat lunch. But I can relate to having shitty memory about dinner and breakfast and other things. Perhaps we just don't see it as important and thus don't care to remember? Maybe that's an ADD thing but I dunno. 
10	ENTPs score higher on the Dark Triad than ESTPs (since Openness is positively correlated)	
10	And overall, ENTPs are the most Dark Triad-loaded individuals. 
10	I took the tests 4 years ago. Results said I'm machiavellian. Nothing changed. They don't give you anything to work on or improve, just useless things you can tell people online to "sound badass". Useless.
2	Psychopath = ADHD + ASD. Now ASD can be combined with others as well, so I would say there are varieties of Psychopaths. Most cinematic depictions of "bad guys" are typically Borderline + ASD. \n\nHonestly, the average sociopath is just a [dumb bore](https://illimitablemen.com/). There are so easily manipulated - you can kill them with a woman and 100 blots of LSD.\n\n\n\n
2	Yurp. Id say my philosophy is pretty much that of the joker in the dark night. Pretty Machiavellian and nhilist 
2	I see it like this alot of people who are "Good" are a bit crazy. \n\nSick comparission: Like the ´Harry Potter VS Lord Voldermort thing Harry Potter has alot of traits that stem/are the same as voldemort and yet he is still The one who kills Evil (Voldemort) 
1	I don't think I'm a bad person I just have a grip on reality most people will never truly be my friends so why should I stick my neck out for them. Keys to life right here never loose valuable information, never loose a valuable contact, look out for yourself cause no one else will, don't be attached to people who will stab you in the back, always get revenge on those who wrong you. Sometimes bad people need to be manipulated by good people, i.e diplomatic solutions with dictators.
3	Anyone ever take the DISC assessment? What did you get?	Had to take this at a work retreat recently. It asks you questions, some similar to the MBTI, but more focused on behavior I think. It ranks you then on:\n\nD- Dominance: focused on efficiency, action, less swayed by feelings, not afraid of conflict and confrontation, goal-orientated \nI- influence: focused on relationships and generally enthusiastic\nS- stability: focused on not rocking the boat, having easy and calm relationships with others, working at a steady pace, risk averse\nC- conscientiousness: as far as I can tell this is focused on being methodical and  process orientated, wants to make sure things are right and correct and accurate before proceeding.\n\nSo, I came out as a hard D, which I was actually surprised by. There were only three of us who were Ds in the entire department of 30 people. Most everyone was S or C. I asked the other two women who got D if they knew their MBTI type and they were both ENTJs. So, I feel like I’ve been suffering a low-key personality crisis ever since. Like... OMG, am I an ENTJ???? I really don’t think so, but I do think I’m more of an ENTJ at work? Like my operating style is direct and action-oriented... \n\nAnyway, anyone else take the disc?
4	Heh...hard D.\n\n(Not sorry. I'll go take the test now and post my result)\n\nEdit: As promised, D: 29% I:29% S: 24% C: 17%. I'm going to assume that means I'm the well-balanced model human I tell myself I am.
1	Yes I was mostly D (110iirc?) with a high I as well. This is 10 years back though when I was 25. Definelty ENTP not ENTJ. 
1	If I remember correctly I got an SI, with a third option of D. 
1	I took the test and it was so stupid I wanted to close it after only 3 questions. And after finishing the 12 questions the results were even more disappointing than I expected.
1	Just took the test and got: D (39%), I (39%), C (16%), S (5%)\n\nI don’t even know what it means honestly 
1	Just took the test, I got D (44%), I (39%), S (10%), C (7%)\n\nSo, what do I get?
5	Seeking Advice on "Getting Over Mistakes"	Over the last few months, I've come to the realization that I've just never gotten over any mistake I've ever made. I realize even more that I don't even know what "getting over it" would mean. \n\nI was in therapy and I realized that a lot of my life and the decisions I make are driven by a desire to "cover up," "fix," or "make up for" the mistakes I've made. \n\nFor example, I didn't do as well in undergrad as I could have. I did fine, but I felt like I should have been amazing. I blame it on being lazy and being a general bad student. As a result of this I overwork at my job  to prove to myself I'm not lazy, and I obsess over learning and spend a ton of money on classes to prove to myself I'm not a bad student. On the surface this seems fine, but it leads to anxiety and stress about not being able to prove to myself I'm better than I was. Every failure leads to "See, you are just as shitty as you were. You haven't grown. You were never capable of amazing."\n\nA worse example of this comes from my love life. I haven't had the most success with romance, especially back in highschool. But I realize that I've stayed friends with a large number of girls I liked that didn't like me back in the hopes that maybe they'd say something in the future that would nullify their rejection. A simple "I wish I'd dated you." That's super toxic behavior that I'm only just realizing comes from this inability to get over shit. \n\nAn ESFP friend of mine asked me this weekend, "why can't you just forget about it?" And I straight laughed in his face. \n\nThen I watched an episode of B99 and Jake made the comment "I don't have to grow if I can just fix all my mistakes!" And it was a joke, but damn it hit me hard. \n\nI put in so much effort to make it like my mistakes never happened, and I used to think that was the right way to live even if it made me miserable... But I don't know anymore. \n\nHave any you guys dealt with this? 
8	Hi there - some advice from this nearly 36-year-old ENTP.\n\nYou don’t “get over” mistakes - you learn from them. You adapt and change. You make different choices. You reflect on what patterns led to those mistakes and hone in on the things you can change. This is how you grow and mature.\n\nAnd someday you’ll look back at your life in high school and realize how little any of those dramas that seemed so world-defining actually mattered in the bigger scheme of things.\n\nMistakes are endlessly useful if you take them as an opportunity for growth and reflection.\n\nYou can always choose to do things differently next time - but hindsight is 20/20 and living in the past will stunt you. \n\nI made sooooooo many mistakes in high school. I nearly got expelled. I torched friendships and burned bridges. I got into relationships that were toxic and unhealthy. I could have gotten better grades - and maybe I wouldn’t have had to go to a crappy college. But I made up for some of those mistakes in undergrad by focusing on studying things that mattered and investing in relationships that would sustain me. I still made tonnes of mistakes, though. My first job out of uni was a disaster - largely due to me not really knowing what was expected in a professional atmosphere. But if I dwelled on it and never learned I wouldn’t be where I am in my career now.\n\nMistakes are momentary. The past is always receding further away behind you. The question is: what about your past will you take forward, and what will you try not to repeat? Don’t get “over” it - embrace it, find the lessons, adapt, and move ever forward.\n\nYou got this. 
5	I learned how to forgive me.  Discovered I forgive other people just fine, but have trouble forgiving myself.  So I literally went into the bathroom, stood in front of the mirror, and looked my own self in the eye.  I said, "\[my name\] I forgive you.  I accept that you are human and I forgive you for not being perfect.  I forgive you for \[list of mistakes that haunted me\]."  Knowing some psychology, I know that repetition breeds belief, so I repeat this to myself whenever the past tries to haunt me.  It has helped immensely.
1	This is a classic. In Jungian Psychology, you’re afraid of your shadow. There’s things lurking around in your subconscious mind that your ego wants nothing to do. Alas to find peace within yourself you must integrate your shadow into your conscious mind. This is difficult but not undoable. I would Recommend a video ‘Jordan Peterson Integrating the Shadow’. 
1	Failure is not the opposite of success. It is a key part of it. There are few things more powerful that a person can do than owning their mistakes and learning from them.
1	Okay, okay. Let me see if I understand. You've made big mistakes in the past. And whenever you let your mind wander, like in the shower, or when doing chores, you recall those mistakes and cringe. Hard. \n\nIf this is what's happening to you, I've got good news. I figured out a simple solution about a year ago:\n\nWhen you recall a past mistake, grab pen and paper, and write down what you learned from that mistake. The result? You'll never cringe about that mistake again. \n\nHope this helped.
4	Why ExTP and IxTP relationships fall apart	Speculating, based on my  interactions with my friends.\n\nAlthough the first two functions are easy to communicate between ExTPs and IxTPs, trouble starts with all the other functions involved.\n\nGoing by the car model - ExTPs have a teenager Fe and IxTPs have a child Fe. ExTPs will often be dragging along  IxTPs in the sense of a teenage baby sitter dragging along a child. The child wants to sit home and play but the teenager is more interested in going to the mall, metaphorically speaking. Usually if the IxTP is not too bitter this is actually quite fun.\n\nWhere things fall apart  I believe will be once the ExTP starts being a total dick. Roasting, insulting, snubbing ..... In many ways this could be attributed to the Trickster Fi. The Trickster is quite cruel!  I could say the Trickster is like a rebellious teenager.  Rebellious Teenager + Child Fe is not a good combination at all!\n\nThe last straw in the relationship happens when the IxTP uses their Daemon Fi and says fuck you and go their own way. More than any other type  IxTPs can do plenty of things on our own.\n\nDon't be a dick! You need us more than we need you.
8	I think what makes the ENTP and INTP relationship problematic is that you end up competing with each other and constantly trying to one up one another.  Also at the same time their is a lack of emotional support for one another as the relationship is mostly based on thinking and ideas.  \n\nInferior Fe makes the users quite self-absorbed and have this need for constant validation while the tertiary Fe user will judge the other for talking about themselves too often.  \n\nINTPs lead with a judging function so they can come off as closed-minded at times compared to the ENTP that leads with a perceiving function.  
4	This is why I prefer Feelers -- with their teenager and child T functions they never realize when you're manipulating them because you can always out argue them.  Thinker-Feeler relationships are the beautiful intellectual pedo relationships of MBTI. 
2	Lol if only IXTPs weren’t that sensitive . 
1	I'm ENTPf married to an ISTPm 😁
10	Guide to ISFPs. How to social engineer them as an ENTP.	I wrote this in comment thread and decided it might be worth making a post.\n\n\nENTP - ISFP interaction is actually quite compatible due to complimenting functions, it’s just that there is some “traffic” between function.\n\nAlso ISFP is stage 1 social engineering. Basically it’s beginner level because the cognitive functions only have to transform into functions that are within the ego/shadow which it is already in. If you can’t handle an ISFP, you won’t be able to handle much else.\n\n\n\n\nNe Hero - Ni Child\n\nNi child is optimistically focused on what they want and in turn, they tend to only really believe in 1 outcome. Because Ni child also has Ne trickster, they are generally like, “this is what will happen and that’s it”. They don’t really ever consider the other possibilities. That’s where we come in with Ne hero and present a huge amount of other options. They will generally be intrigued but sometimes a hero - child interaction can get overbearing for the child and the child can get shocked into paralysis. This might happen if you go super abstract with them and start talking about quantum physics etc. Don’t go too abstract with them. Overall if you tell them something random but interesting, Ni child will latch on to “play”. Asking about their motivations is also a way to activate the child. Ne Hero also has a huge need to be “wanted”. Ni child will do this but only if the Se-Si interaction is fulfilled first. After which they will shows signs of really wanting your company and having you around. All 3 ISFPs I know in my personal life always smile and say my name whenever I meet them and proceed to hug me, which not only is great for me because I feel valued, but is also a good opportunity to reinforce the other functional interactions.\n\nTi Parent - Te Inferior\n\nISFPs have a crippling fear of having a bad “reputation” and not being respected by anyone. You must tell them what you think of them, and if they deserve it, give them praise for anything they do well. ISFPs love it when others say they think highly of them. They also need to be congratulated or applauded after they do any work. Even a simple, “wow great job” will suffice. Ti Parent can be a little harsh sometimes and be a little too brutally honest. This is where it can get rough. The inferior can respond negatively and immediately activate the Ti demon, where they will come at you with flawed logic defending their Fi-Hero beliefs. Telling an ISFP, you suck and everyone knows you are incompetent is literally kryptonite to them and everyone knows how much ENTPs like doing that. If the Parent - Inferior relationship is handled well, the parent can gently mentor the inferior to get it into its aspirational state.  ISFPs respect smart people because of Te Inferior, so show off your knowledge and logic and also help them with it. Give advice to them about small things and they will like you more.\n\nFe Child - Fi Hero\n\nFe Child is naive and optimistic and wants other people to value them and like them. Generally they want people to be happy around them and a lot of times this comes off as being the “funny” guy. Being funny is basically Fe child’s way of making other people feel good and value them. Fi Hero on the other hand is all about their own feelings. It’s their first response to any situation. “How do I feel about this?”. Make the ISFP feel good using Ti compliments “I think you are blahblahblah” and showing Si loyalty with Ne creativity. ISFPs are also very moralistic because of this, and they have a need to act in line with their own beliefs. So, RESPECT THEIR BELIEFS. DO NOT MISTAKE THEIR FI FOR TI AND ATTACK WITH TE CRITIC. This is the most common source of strife for this type of relation. You can make a comment or two to just stir up Te Inferior, but remember, Fi is emotion, it’s not supposed to make sense, it’s not supposed to be logical, so don’t argue like it is. Much like the other Hero - Child interaction, sometimes the Child is just not built to fully handle the extent of the Hero. If the ISFP gets too emotional we don’t really know how to handle it. Just remember, act like an ESFJ and everything will be alright. ESFJs have Fe-Hero and you can see this when they get all motherish with others. “Aww it’s all going to be ok” and stuff like that. If you can emulate that, you will be all good. Just remember, be funny, make dumb jokes and don’t be afraid to make a total arse of yourself (Se-Demon).\n\nSi Inferior - Se Parent\n\nRemember, Inferior functions are the source of fear and weakness. You guys probably dislike ISFPs because, like Te Inferior Ti Parent, the Parent can be too much for the inferior. ENTPs are afraid of being consistent, loyal and they are afraid of responsibility. They are also afraid of their physical surroundings as in, they might get anxiety when going to a new place. Se Parent on the other hand, wants to give others a good experience and is really focused on that. It might be how they look, how they act or what they do. Because the parent is pessimistic, they will believe they are not giving a good experience which is why they are always trying to fix it. So, do not make fun of an ISFPs appearance because they will cut you off. Do the opposite and compliment their appearance. ISFPs like to make others comfortable, but in return, they expect loyalty and some kind of reciprocation. Get them or help them with what they want (Ni-Child) or feed them a compliment (Fi-Hero/Te-Child). ENTPs, you must show loyalty to an ISFP if they is to be any hope for a good relationship. This is because, being the first and the strongest pessimistic function one has, the Parent is like the border security function. If the parent does not like you, you are cut off from even attempting to get to the other functions. Other ways you can convince Se-Parent to get you on your side, is to show them that you enjoy their company. Act comfortable with them. Kind of like when cats do “slow blinks” to show trust, you can do this with ISFPs too.\n\nUnderstanding shadow interactions is good because it tells you what happens when everything goes down the drain and how you are supposed to claw your way back out but it’s not important if you can just make sure everything stays in the ego (first 4 functions)\n\nNi Nemesis - Ne Trickster\n\nENTPs may worry about their own future and what they want, but the ISFP doesn’t care because they are blind to it. ENTPs can start calling ISFPs self-absorbed and selfish if it goes down this route.\n\nTe Critic - Ti Demon\n\nTe critic will be vicious in its attacks of other people’s logic being like “you’re stupid and wrong and here’s why”. Ti Demon is basically logical fallacies heaven. If an ISFP comes at you with Ti, they get super stubborn and use broken logic which the critic will call out immediately.\n\nFi Trickster - Fe Nemesis\n\nENTPs have a penchant for being immoral aholes. Fe Nemesis worries other people are bad or even evil. Point is, just embrace the fact that you are a piece of crap sometimes and the nemesis can be at peace with itself.\n\nSe Demon - Si Critic\n\nSe demon gives off demonic experiences. Wearing a rainbow suit, for example, when going to a formal event. (I actually know an ENTP that did this and thought it was cool). Not getting haircuts or not taking care of appearances. Si Critic is critical of every experience they receive. It’s like being a professional chef, eating out. “I could do this better”. Same thing, just embrace it, you suck at giving good experiences and the critic won’t have to come out to prove you wrong.
7	In theory
5	You could have written how to communicate better - instead of going full machiavelli :) A million ways to fool people, a handful to help someone.  But thanks for writing about it using the Beebe lingo - will make a post similar to this later today about why ExTP and IxTP relationships fall apart. 
4	Operating under the assumption that functions are valid, you've got a couple of ours a little wrong.  Fi is not emotion and is not susceptible to the flattery and platitudes you think will make it bend to your will.  In fact, it can spot manipulation a mile away and if you think you are successfully executing one against Fi dom, whatever your intentions, I guarantee you are only subtly antagonizing, you  are not doing anything to build trust and if  we are tolerating you, we are doing so to a) keep a modicum of peace and b) appreciate that you are trying, for your part.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for Se aux, we don't really care if anyone else is comfortable.  Our aesthetic and experience is entirely for us and has absolutely zilch to do with how we feel about you or making someone else comfortable.  In fact, as filtered through Fi dom, you can take it or leave it and we're just going to keep doing our thing.  You are right about saying something negative about it though;  it's a fine way to completely antagonize yourself (and don't even think about coming back with that subtle manipulation crap, especially if you haven't already genuinely connected with us on our ni level, which incidentally deserves more credit than it gets). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn closing, check out the facets and see how your isfps measure up because if this is your experience with them, throwing out all function talk, they sound like isfjs.

1	May I cross post this on r/isfp?  
1	I'm curious, you said you got hugs from the isfp's you know, I assume your a man talking about women or vice versa (correct if wrong)\n\nDo you think that your exp would differ if you were talking to the opposite gender? Gender roles are still a thing in society and I think the opposite gender or same gender contact would produce different results, especially men on men contact if no homo.\n\nAlso how do the isfp males and females differ in your life generally. Food for thought 
34	A method I figured out on how to be get shit done	I call it disconnect.\n\nIf you have to do something but really don‘t want to, you can use this method.\n\nI‘m not sure if this is healthy or even normal, but it works for me so I thought I‘ll share.\n\nThe idea is that you think of your mind and body as seperate things. You literally disconnect your mind and your actions from each other.\n\nWhich means that even if your mind is saying „I don‘t wanna do this this is so boring“, you just view your body as some kind of robot which you tell what to do with a controller. If our bodies were just a doll that is moving, our mind would have no impact on it. \n\nSo you basically have to just let your body move against your „will“. Even if you yourself don‘t feel like doing it, if you tell your hand to start moving and tell your eyes to read this text, it will do it. There is no way your body says no. \n\nYou have to learn how to control it like a robot instead of letting your mind/emotions take control of the robot, your body, on autopilot. \n\nI‘m not sure if this works for anyone but me. So if you try it, tell me if it works for you.\n\n(*typo in the header)
15	I started to negotiate with myself, it's kind of similar. I treat myself as a little child, who doesn't know what is good and bad, what would be rational and responsible thing to do. I ask myself, why I don't want to do certain things. Then explain why this reasons are stupid. Then I explain to myself why I actually should want to do this things, how I will benefit from it, why or how I can make it fun. And I tell to myself what will happen when I'll finally finish or don't - good and bad stuff. After this process my grown up brain order my stupid body to get my ass together and do the right thing. \n\nActually, it's almost the same as you describe it, but with some process of explaining, tutoring myself. Though, I find it a bit scary, that your mind and body can be so separate, that you may want do certain things, but it's so hard to convince yourself to do them.
10	Super interesting! Love it.
6	You're the only person I've seen or heard of who does this too. I've been doing it for ~10 years now, when it comes to any small task my mind or body doesn't want to start doing. One of the two (mind or body) just says "you have to do it, though," and then that part makes it happen. It works especially well for *starting* to do something specifically. It's just a matter of training the weaker part to stop begging you to engage with it.\n\nExercise? Brain turns off, body goes for it.\n\nWork (writing)? Body sits down, and then my brain will go on for a few hours.\n\nI've just never thought about it as an actual process that my mind-body goes through, and I think you've worded it pretty well! It's like when people say there's a connection between the mind and body, except in this case the mind and body have to decouple in order to function together at their best. They each know what's best for the both of them, but they're conflicted, and if you can shut one of them down for a bit it'll benefit the three of you.\n\nWhether the task is getting out of bed without snoozing the alarm or sitting down for a while to think through a problem, one of the two often has to settle down and make way for the other to take over.\n\nIt's actually a pretty good way of overcoming the "I don't feel like doing this" problem a ton of people encounter. Thanks for bringing it up!
4	Theres a problem with this, have u seen the movie click? \n\nIn a lot of works, and task i put the autopilot, i go inside my mind start making movis, puns and forget about my body doing the job, the problem with that is that it makes ur mind a small world where ur comfortable and some peoppple get addicted to it, they pass torugh live on auto and they forget to embrace live as what it is, some shit is harder to be present when ur doing i know, but still autopilot is crutch not a tool, it can be damaging long term one must need find methods to cope with the mundane.
3	I totally get it - this is basically the long way of saying "dude, just *do* it". You really can't get away from some mundane tasks, unfortunately.
3	Descartes's philosophy. I'm more of a Spinoza guy so thank you no thank you.
2	I do something similar to this when I need to wake up early and my body doesn’t want to. 
2	I already use it sometimes, so I second this : it works 
2	Last week I was thinking to myself something similar. I call it the "both and" approach instead of "either or". "I'm feeling lazy, I should sleep" to doing the opposite of it and saying to myself it's okay to be both lazy and working. I feel thinking of "either or" leads to perfectionism. My end result need not be perfect, it can be terrible and good at the same time if I think of it in terms of "both and".
2	I use the treat system, like if I do this boring task, I'll treat myself something. It works well for me so far. 
2	I sometimes do this! Except, instead of viewing the body as a robot- in that moment, I have a personality alter. But as I type this, it sounds kind of crazy
2	This is genius. I'll definitely try this from now on.
2	I have switch in mind for doing difficult things. For example putting hand in jar full of worms or something disgusting. It is harder for doing something like studying. Maybe because it is not one thing at a time but longer task.  Any thoughts?
1	Sooo it’s basically like giving pity sex to your partner when you are not in the mood.😝 \n\n
1	I'm with ya on this one, the dissociation is enough to get me momentum so regular me can take over. It's the NOT ROBOT torque to my HUMAN horsepower, *bleep bloop*
1	Thank you for this ,this is something if not all that ENTPS might have thought about already .  Of a technique helping them get shit actually done and on time because it’s required to (:<
1	Solution? Take adhd meds
1	Isnt this dissociation disorder?
30	Why do I act dumb/joke alot irl and in groups, but serious and "smart" in private convos mainly in text? This is what my irl friend said about me	
23	MBTI-wise: Ne and Fe in public, Ti when alone in private text. 
11	This hurt to read. Does your friend talk like this irl? 
3	People say the same about me and I think it's good. People who underestimate you make mistakes when they think they can take advantage of you. Also it's easier to impress people when they don't expect you to.
7	Intj unconscious\n\nI act like a dumbass in text convo but serious irl.
8	Reading this gave me cancer
3	Stop worrying about that and start enjoying
7	This image is the epitome of stupidity. What did you expect your friend to say? To call you an idiot back, and list in detail why he thinks you're retarded? If this is what constitutes "smart" conversations, I shudder to think what you classify as a dumb conversation. 
2	Ne and Fe playing the role of the funny charismatic jerk in public and Ti when shit gets serious. Happens to me all the time. 
5	[removed]
3	I do this as an INTP— I’m known to be a crazy person around others since I use Ne to be social and I act like an ESFJ to maintain my fear of Fe awkwardness. Around people I’m comfortable with, I extrovert like an ENTJ.
1	like my entp friend,  she's dumb ( I know her intelligence is hidden somewhere), but at times she act and talk like a very intelligent person, at the very unexpected moments.\n
0	[removed]
5	Where do I meet ENTP women?	Aren't they all in their houses playing DnD or marathoning Star Wars?\n\nDo I have to break into their houses? \n\nI imagine it's pretty hard to find INTJ guys as well, as we're probably doing something similar. \n\nJust don't tell me I have to go to a library. (But actually do tell me that if that's what I have to do)\n\nSo any ideas?
30	The ENTP female is best found in late afternoon or when it is dark outside, as they generally are nocturnal.  Mating season is year-round, although there may be weeks of inactivity monthly.  \n  \nLook for the distinct scowl made by the ENTP female whilst out socially.  It can be terrifying to other females of other types.  \n   \n  \nBest to stay away during molting season, though.  That shit is scary, yo.
13	Usually the funniest girl in a group :P
9	 You can meet us anywhere, really. I mean we are extroverts. So I’ll just tell you how to spot us. Look for the woman who has a resting bitch face and frowns at things & people without meaning to (I also roll my eyes or side eye people a lot without meaning to according to a friend). But if you happen to catch her smile, it will be completely uninhibited and has a tendency to be loud. Speaking for myself, I’ve been told I even frown and make weird expressions at books & my phone when I’m reading or doing something else.🙈 \n\nAnd I think our air or manner has a tinge of bold confidence to it, so you will definitely notice us if we are in the vicinity. Since we are females, we have learned to tone this down a little bit but if you pay careful attention to our body language, you can still pick it up. For example, I’m sitting down, I will put my legs anywhere that’s comfortable for me at the time. I don’t care to cross it or act super formal unless I am in a professional setting. \n\nAnd it’s the same with our clothes, which tends to be super casual and informal as well. I’m not tomboy-ish myself but I do prefer to wear pants over skirts and dresses. And I see the other ENTPs commenting similarly...so I think we do have a preference for comfort! \n\nAnd our body language translates into how we speak and interact with others too. I know I have a tendency to be irreverent & snarky when I’m interacting with people. While being super animated at the same time if it’s a relatively open-minded & non-traditional setting. If you catch us in a traditional setting (which is very unlikely!!), we’ll be so quiet you’ll mistake us for an introvert. 
6	I used to like coffee shops, late evenings at Denny's and pubs. Also enjoyed doing art in the park. Lots of NeTi happening there. 
5	It's not like we congregate in a secret bunker or something. Nope, no siree. *shifty eyes* But if we did, it would definitely be in an undisclosed location, and I would definitely be bound by a blood pact to keep that location secret.\n\nUm, libraries? Libraries are good.
3	There’s quite a few on this subreddit. 
4	A variety of places actually. I am on a long break before I start university and I do lock myself in my room sometimes when I am in the mood to be left alone but I often like to go out with a few friends at least once a week. Usually the places we go out are really diverse? We would go shopping, amusement parks (my favourite), ice skating, amusement parks. Never really the same place. I mean- if you see a cute ENTP girl at a cafè, she probably won’t find her there again.
3	Most guys meet me at work. I’m pretty obnoxious so I’m hard to miss and if I’m in the room you’ll know it. I really like bookstores, but that’s probably the only place you won’t notice me. Casinos are fun when I’m around them, I love traveling so anything that is travel related is good. I enjoy museums. I don’t know where else I hang out. I guess bars sometimes? 
6	In my undergrad, I found that they tended to cluster heavily in political science and international relations courses. A couple at business school as well.\n\nAt work, there are a decent number in law, consulting, and at startups, from what I can tell.\n\nAs people, I think we tend to come off as witty but also a little mean, and more relaxed than our ENTJ counterparts. The ENTP smirk is real. I think we are louder and talk more often than other women do. We also laugh quite easily and have a slightly mocking sense of humour. Interestingly, while we do interject quite a bit during group conversations, we rarely raise controversial points just for the sake of it the way male ENTPs seem to. However, I do find that we question other people quite a bit and aren't as afraid of coming off as potentially rude in our takedowns of their lack of logic, during the same conversation. So, better Fe than our male counterparts but still a little annoying.\n\nFashion-wise, I've noticed that whether we are fashionable or not, we are also generally not trendy (or classic in style). We either look super casual or make a lot of bold choices.\n\nThat's all I've got, really. Hobbies tend to really vary, but I've never met an ENTP who wasn't a voracious reader. If a woman is constantly sending you (vaguely intellectual/thought-provoking) long-form essays she just read, with witty one-liner commentary, she's probably an ENTP.
2	I met my INTJ husband through mutual friends at a bar, TBH.
2	Only if you tell me where to meet INTJ guys, lol
2	Depends on your age but go to a university. Look at the females that seem odd. If you share the same class as us you‘ll notice us immediately. It‘s the one who is discussing with the professor. \n\nOther than that I‘d say it‘s hard to tell for Ne people in general as they have various interests in most cases. And everyone will have different preferences. For example I‘m shut in at home in the dark most of the time and my other fem entp friend is always going out dining or at cafes. When we do go out we usually just hang around somewhere in a chill spot and talk. Other than that you‘d only find me on campus and my friend at work. So it‘s hard to sum it up.\n\nGood thing is they stick out. You‘ll know when you meet a ENxP.
1	My INTJ and I found each other through a common interest-- we were both playing this mobile game, we were part of a group chat for that specific game, and we ended up talking to each other via pm.\n\nSo basically, look into your interest, maybe check a forum, and see if that works.
1	Forums making witty comments or being self righteous...
1	> Aren't they all in their houses playing DnD\n\ncan confirm...\n\n> Do I have to break into their house\n\npossibly, but chances are they'll end up tasering you, tying you up, drawing benis shapes with bright red lipstick all over your face before calling the police :(\n\ni dunno man, maybe join a meetup group consisting of people who are interested in the mbti. alternatively, look online? lots of people on dating apps are listing their mbti these days. 
1	I'm always at my home club, s/o to Mosh, when I'm not there im either studying, having fucc, blazing.\n\nso the best place to find me is tinder, cheap clubs, porn sites, or the library, if you offer some fucc while I'm stressing over an essay, you'd make me a very happy ENTP-a Woman
9	How to make interaction with ISFPs not completely terrible	I've been beginning to realize more and more that ISFPs tend to make me want to strangle them, and this is apparently pretty common between ISFPs and ENTPs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny tips for dealing positively with the ISFPs in your life?
10	Yeah, never disagree with them. They're always right. No exceptions. 
12	Keep conversations superficial. Don’t ask them difficult questions. Don’t poke fun at them.
11	I think u/rawson25 hit the nail on the head there.  I mean, that sounds completely terrible too, but some people need to be handled with kid gloves.  ISFP's are those people.  Talk like you're trying to weasel your way out of being hanged, drawn, and quartered in ancient England.
4	I actually laughed out loud at your title. \n\n"Yessir, no sir, three bags full sir, have a nice day sir." Like you're talking to a police officer and have a backpack full of magic mushrooms. \n\nHonestly, I don't know. I just stay away from them.
4	ENTP - ISFP interaction is actually quite compatible due to complimenting functions, it’s just that there is some “traffic” between function.\n\nNe Hero - Ni Child\nNi child is optimistically focused on what they want and in turn, they tend to only really believe in 1 outcome. Because Ni child also has Ne trickster, they are generally like, “this is what will happen and that’s it”. They don’t really ever consider the other possibilities. That’s where we come in with Ne hero and present a huge amount of other options. They will generally be intrigued but sometimes a hero - child interaction can get overbearing for the child and the child can get shocked into paralysis. This might happen if you go super abstract with them and start talking about quantum physics etc. Don’t go too abstract with them. Overall if you tell them something random but interesting, Ni child will latch on to “play”. Asking about their motivations is also a way to activate the child. Ne Hero also has a huge need to be “wanted”. Ni child will do this but only if the Se-Si interaction is fulfilled first. After which they will shows signs of really wanting your company and having you around. All 3 ISFPs I know in my personal life always smile and say my name whenever I meet them and proceed to hug me, which not only is great for me because I feel valued, but is also a good opportunity to reinforce the other functional interactions.\n\nTi Parent - Te Inferior\nISFPs have a crippling fear of having a bad “reputation” and not being respected by anyone. You must tell them what you think of them, and if they deserve it, give them praise for anything they do well. ISFPs love it when others say they think highly of them. They also need to be congratulated or applauded after they do any work. Even a simple, “wow great job” will suffice. Ti Parent can be a little harsh sometimes and be a little too brutally honest. This is where it can get rough. The inferior can respond negatively and immediately activate the Ti demon, where they will come at you with flawed logic defending their Fi-Hero beliefs. Telling an ISFP, you suck and everyone knows you are incompetent is literally kryptonite to them and everyone knows how much ENTPs like doing that. If the Parent - Inferior relationship is handled well, the parent can gently mentor the inferior to get it into its aspirational state.  ISFPs respect smart people because of Te Inferior, so show off your knowledge and logic and also help them with it. Give advice to them about small things and they will like you more.\n\nFe Child - Fi Hero\nFe Child is naive and optimistic and wants other people to value them and like them. Generally they want people to be happy around them and a lot of times this comes off as being the “funny” guy. Being funny is basically Fe child’s way of making other people feel good and value them. Fi Hero on the other hand is all about their own feelings. It’s their first response to any situation. “How do I feel about this?”. Make the ISFP feel good using Ti compliments “I think you are blahblahblah” and showing Si loyalty with Ne creativity. ISFPs are also very moralistic because of this, and they have a need to act in line with their own beliefs. So, RESPECT THEIR BELIEFS. DO NOT MISTAKE THEIR FI FOR TI AND ATTACK WITH TE CRITIC. This is the most common source of strife for this type of relation. You can make a comment or two to just stir up Te Inferior, but remember, Fi is emotion, it’s not supposed to make sense, it’s not supposed to be logical, so don’t argue like it is. Much like the other Hero - Child interaction, sometimes the Child is just not built to fully handle the extent of the Hero. If the ISFP gets too emotional we don’t really know how to handle it. Just remember, act like an ESFJ and everything will be alright. ESFJs have Fe-Hero and you can see this when they get all motherish with others. “Aww it’s all going to be ok” and stuff like that. If you can emulate that, you will be all good. Just remember, be funny, make dumb jokes and don’t be afraid to make a total arse of yourself (Se-Demon).\n\nSi Inferior - Se Parent\nRemember, Inferior functions are the source of fear and weakness. You guys probably dislike ISFPs because, like Te Inferior Ti Parent, the Parent can be too much for the inferior. ENTPs are afraid of being consistent, loyal and they are afraid of responsibility. They are also afraid of their physical surroundings as in, they might get anxiety when going to a new place. Se Parent on the other hand, wants to give others a good experience and is really focused on that. It might be how they look, how they act or what they do. Because the parent is pessimistic, they will believe they are not giving a good experience which is why they are always trying to fix it. In turn, ISFPs like to make other comfortable, but in return, they expect loyalty and some kind of reciprocation. Get them or help them with what they want (Ni-Child) or feed them a compliment (Fi-Hero/Te-Child). ENTPs, you must show loyalty to an ISFP if they is to be any hope for a good relationship. This is because, being the first and the strongest pessimistic function one has, the Parent is like the border security function. If the parent does not like you, you are cut off from even attempting to get to the other functions. Other ways you can convince Se-Parent to get you on your side, is to show them that you enjoy their company. Act comfortable with them. Kind of like when cats do “slow blinks” to show trust, you can do this with ISFPs too.\n\nUnderstanding shadow interactions is good because it tells you what happens when everything goes down the drain and how you are supposed to claw your way back out but it’s not important if you can just make sure everything stays in the ego (first 4 functions)\n\nNi Nemesis - Ne Trickster\nENTPs may worry about their own future and what they want, but the ISFP doesn’t care because they are blind to it. ENTPs can start calling ISFPs self-absorbed and selfish if it goes down this route.\n\nTe Critic - Ti Demon\nTe critic will be vicious in its attacks of other people’s logic being like “you’re stupid and wrong and here’s why”. Ti Demon is basically logical fallacies heaven. If an ISFP comes at you with Ti, they get super stubborn and use broken logic which the critic will call out immediately.\n\nFi Trickster - Fe Nemesis\nENTPs have a penchant for being immoral aholes. Fe Nemesis worries other people are bad or even evil. Point is, just embrace the fact that you are a piece of crap sometimes and the nemesis can be at peace with itself.\n\nSe Demon - Si Critic\nSe demon gives off demonic experiences. Wearing a rainbow suit, for example, when going to a formal event. (I actually know an ENTP that did this and thought it was cool). Not getting haircuts or not taking care of appearances. Si Critic is critical of every experience they receive. It’s like being a professional chef, eating out. “I could do this better”. Same thing, just embrace it, you suck at giving good experiences and the critic won’t have to come out to prove you wrong.
3	Smoke some shit and crack'em up.  \nI actually have no idea. Not even an ISFP. I know only one ISFP, who's pretty old and very easy to get along.
2	Talk about everything you explicitly can't give less of a shit about
1	I would like to help you, but I'm unsure and would actually like to know more of the details of why you think you are frustrated with them. I don't mean to pry, but it would help me to understand your situation a little better than giving you a brief answer, even if it's just a little bit or an example... I get that you are trying to better the relationship and that's good of you, but what exactly is wrong? Why do you feel the way that you do? 
1	Share interesting things that happen in your life with them, if you want to bond or at least have a cordial relationship. They're Fi-dom with Ni in the tertiary. If you can manage to interact with INFP you can manage ISFP.
5	Does our brain get heavier as we acquire more knowledge?	If no, then why does the human brain get larger in size over time through evolution?\nIf yes, then there is a limit to our knowledge? Is that why we forget? Is that why we have a habit to compress things? To take shortcuts? Because we know so much? \nThen the more you know, the more simple things become, because we compress it. Then what happens next? \n 
13	Knowledge has little to do with brain size. [Exhibit A.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Suzana_Herculano-Houzel/publication/38091649/figure/fig7/AS:667213421887504@1536087484959/The-human-brain-is-not-the-largest-Brains-of-a-human-and-of-an-African-elephant-are.png) if brain size is what determines intelligence, elephants would be more intelligent than humans. \n\nWhat is true is that the wrinkles in a brain determines intelligence more than size. In other words, if a brain has denser neural connections, that affords more brain power. And that's what gives humans their intelligence—they have brains with the densest neural clusters of all animals (someone correct me if I'm wrong). \n\nIn fact, throughout human evolution, I think there's actually evidence that the human brain as *shrunk* at times. \n\nOne of the reasons humans forget so much is that the brain is not a computer (computers have perfect memory storage). The brain seems to take a heuristic image of what it actually observes. For instance, when a baseball flies in the air and you attempt to catch it. Your brain isn't processing some memory about how parabolic motion in gravity will determine an exact drop point. Instead, you constantly update your estimated landing position from the shadow of the ball, your relative position, etc. \n\nIn other words, the brain is attuned to observational, short term data. It subsequently dumps everything in the working memory when it's done. This makes the brain remarkably efficient at tasks. \n\nOf course the brain does have long term memory, but even that isn't exact. There's evidence that long term memory is often inaccurate, and can be distorted with updated information (E.g. gaslighting). This is also why when people give statements in court, it sometimes contradicts their written statements given months/years prior. Long term memory also gets updated with new information. \n\nIts not really a habit to compress things per se. It's essentially an evolutionary mandate. The brain takes in a nearly immeasurable amount of data, constantly. It has to have filters to reject the noise, and also properly interpret signals (signals like language/convos, baseball trajectories in air, looking for lost keys, walking and avoiding objects/stepping on dog shit, etc).\n\nAs far as I know, whether there's a "limit" to human knowledge is not an easy question to answer, and likely currently does not have an answer. The reason being scientists really have little idea how the brain works. \n\nIt makes sense really. The brain evolved over millions of years. We've been studying it for O(100 yrs). So we've essentially been spending a century trying to unpack millions of years of evolution. \n\nIt's somewhat like how Wakandan scientists struggled so much to disentangle Vision's neural network in Infinity War. \n\nEDIT: [Exhibit B](http://adarshpatil.in/timewarp/images/blog/nature-vs-comp-arch/1.png)
1	Your brain makes more connections when you acquire knowledge. Physical size is irrelevant.
6	I Argue People Out	I lose my friends when i argue with them\n\nYou know, I treat people as they treat me. If someone's being rude against me, I'm rude too. \n\nAnd sometimes when arguing, I can be so stubborn proving my point.\n\nAnd it becomes a problem, I lose my friends.\n\nWhat should I do?
11	> What should I do?\n\nObviously, stop doing that.\n\n> You know, I treat people as they treat me. If someone's being rude against me, I'm rude too.\n\nDitch this mindset. Start treating people the way you **want** to be treated. Doesn't mean you have to be a doormat. Just means you don't constantly retaliate. 
5	It seems like you have a dilemma on your hands. You don’t want to lose your friends but they won’t let you argue till your heart is content. You can either discipline yourself so you know when to stop arguing or you can make your peace with having few friends. Unfortunately you can’t ever totally get rid of your argumentative nature as it’s part of who you are. 
3	Try convincing people of your opinion rather then destroying their ideas. You’ll make friends and win arguments. It’s also just a helpful skill to have in life 
3	Typically what an immature ENTP does.\n\nDebate is useless with most people. Feelers won't change their opinions even if you win the debate. Many thinkers will hate you for constantly destroying their ideas.\n\nIt's much better to listen to other people and using their ideas to "debate in your head". Not only will it give you a better competition, the person in front of you will like you for being so interested in her 
2	Find somebody smarter than you. You will see how fast you stop arguing once you lose 3-4 arguments in a row.
1	> I lose my friends when i argue with them\n\n> What should I do?\n\nMake friends that don't care if you argue with them.
5	I think I'm in Si grip.	I know the loop/grip theories are kinda bs but I feel really numb (not like depressed or detached, rather like I'm just existing and i don't feel or think much) and really the opposite of witty or critical or observant (aka my usual self). I haven't been taking care of my physical self much either. Today one of my friends told me she thinks I try too hard to be like my memory of my past self and that's when it really clicked. I think I'm in Si grip. And it really, really, really sucks. I constantly act and feel dumb and tired and awkward and boring and unmotivated but mostly it just feels like I'm in a dream and my brain is made of jello. Do you guys have any suggestions that might help?
14	>I know the loop/grip theories are kinda bs but I feel really numb (not like depressed or detached, rather like I'm just existing and i don't feel or think much) \n\nIf you know loop/grip theories are bullshit, why the post title? Also, what you described is literally depression. "I feel depressed, but I'm not depressed." That's basically what you wrote. \n\nStop trying to fix this issue with "grip" theory. Go to a therapist. Your post is the equivalent of "man guys I fell and busted my arm. I can't move it, and i see a bone spur, but it's not broken. I heard acupuncture is kinda bs but do you think poking a needle into my bone spur will make my arm feel better? Any suggestions?" 
5	I think you should see a professional.\n\nMaybe you're so tired, or depressed, but its obvious that there's something wrong. \n\nAnd maybe if you read, it may help because it will let you imagine, think and take you away.
2	I don’t think it’s bullshit.  It accurately categorizes behaviors during low episodes of my life.  In the grip I become lifeless, with no ideas and no motivation; I become a hypochondriac who also is lax about hygiene; i have tunnel vision and start dwelling on old memories, and basically curl up with my blankie as often as I can.  I usually start to feel better with some type of change in my life, whether it be very small like rearranging my furniture to jump start my brain into thinking of possibilities or something more drastic.  I also have bipolar 2 disorder so I take my mood stabilizers regularly so I don’t often fall down in that fucked up pit of nothingness these days.  And as said above, seek a therapist.  Even if it is helpful to put a name to a face, identifying a grip state doesn’t explain it’s cause.
2	Make short-term plans and stick to it. What happened?
5	Do you think this news anchor is an ENTP?	I watch this guy Paul Gerke on TV every morning and find him hilarious, thinking he's either ENTP or maybe ENFP? What do you think?\n\nI'm having a hard time finding videos of the funny moments I've seen, but [:20 sec](https://youtu.be/Yy6k3j1YAFE) will have to do. Here's him doing a Ron Burgundy impersonation at [2:55](https://youtu.be/noWE980znVU).\n\nFirst time I saw him there was a segment about a livestream of an Eagle nest, where 2 eagles were together, and he interrupted this lady's eagle facts with a comment like "This is a private moment...we should look away" and I died! Always making sarcastic/funny comments out of nowhere even about serious reports. \n\nSo whatcha think?\n
5	Yeah I watched a good deal of that video. Seems like an ENTP to me. He has that distinctive ENTP ramble where one idea blends into another idea in the same breath of speech. 
3	There is more to people than their public persona. 
32	List of unappealing career paths for ENTP type people.	
23	Accurate.\n\nI’d like to add grocery store checkout clerk (I did that for a year after high school and I spent most of my time actively hating life and developing a class consciousness). It was soul-destroying and repetitive, but I managed to memorize all the produce codes and could tell my supervisor exactly how much change I would be over or under in my till at the end of the shift and was promptly promoted to the cash office. I was 18 years old, making minimum wage, and somehow in charge of all the cash in the store? Like, I had keys to the safe!\n\nAnyway, I don’t know why that turned into a story of my meteoric rise at a shitty grocery store chain, but needless to say it was the worst job ever for an ENTP. A big long stretch of monotony and dealing with morons and pretending to be “nice”. 
18	My wrists are hypothetically slit just from envisioning myself in these positions 
12	At first I thought it said APPEALING, and I was second guessing myself as to if I really was an ENTP. 
13	This is incredibly relatable to me since I've always aspired to be a teacher (and I still do), but even as a child I rejected the idea of teaching in elementary or high school because teaching kids seemed so horrible to me. It's either a college professor or not at all.
8	so much structure. so much repetition. every day the same. WHERE'S THE CHAOS?! Unless you're an American pilot. With the random government shutdowns every day is a fresh adventure.
9	Disagree Library assistant is great.\n\nJust sit, spend your time reading, if someone needs something in the library, help him out, and earn money .\n\nDream job if I had no bachelor. (Actually, even with my master... I am considering getting into that job)
3	God yes this all sounds awful 
3	Really, airplane pilot? The others I for sure would hate but pilot? Iunno... I’m almost through with Electrical Engineering school and I thought about flying high on a few days. 
3	Lol the ones for INFPs be like \n\n• Writing\n\n• counseling \n\n• drawing \n\n• writing more \n\n• helping the homeless\n\n• being homeless \n\n• working with children because you will be stuck at the mental age of 10 until death \n\n
2	Yeah I can absolutely see why some of those are just despised, I spent years advancing in my career to get past the mundane, not so bad now but the other half of the equation will always be management, I've done really repetitive jobs with a fantastic management team who offer you freedom to explore different ways of working etc and it can be actually quite fulfilling, flip side I've had jobs that ought to be fantastic for ENTPs but being micromanaged to within an inch of your life (literally) will ruin it
2	I think I would legit hate everyone of those
2	Absolutely accurate.\nI work for a bank and recently went from being a teller to being a full relationship banking specialist.\n\nThe teller transactions were so cut and dry and my obvious charisma was not being used to it’s full advantage. \nHowever, thankfully, my manager had a new opportunity open up that he thought, “Skarsgarde and his wordiness will be perfect for this.”
2	Got a list for the best careers?
2	A more accurate list would be.\n\nList of unappealing career paths for ENTP types.\n\nAll of them. ENTP's don't do careers.  \n\nIf I had it my way I would just be in an ever changing area of academia.  I would just go from one area of research to another solving their problems. Get bored and circle through again.
1	What website is this?
1	I have a student job giving out tasters to people at my local supermarket. It also boring that I literally enjoy taking out the rubbish as it gives me something to do.
1	Repitition and structure. Seems like the ENTP kryptonite. Is it a bad omen then that I'm shooting for the Air Force Reserves at the moment? The two months at Basic Training seem incredibly difficult in theory, but I feel as if its a rather painful investment that pays off quickly.
1	I would argue mechinist wouldn't be a *terrible* career for ENTP. Lots of variety. Problem solving.
1	Why the pilot? I frequently say being a fighter pilot was my dream job before the real world happened, and airline pilot is a common transition after discharge. 
1	Hmm, so they are fine with working at McDonalds but dislike being a library assistant?
3	ENTP in sales VS in engineering	Believe it or not: I decided that I will stick to my next job for 3 years at least. I have been changing too often. I am in discussion with recruiters which asked me where I would like to go (I have more than 10 years of mixed experience in the medical device field):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow my question:\n\nA) Engineering:\n\nGood:\n\n\- Lots of stuff to learn\n\n\- Complex and dealing with smart people\n\nBad: Need to figure out the tedious implementation details, not so dynamic, lots of documentation, no decision power\n\nExamples: R&D Leader, Technical Project Leader for devices or software\n\n&#x200B;\n\nB) Sales:\n\nGood:\n\n\- meeting with many people and talking / presenting / travelling\n\n\- part of the strategic decisions\n\n\- good benefits (car, credit card etc)\n\nBad: Meeting people that have NO clue, repetitive presentation, not very complex (just scratching the surface)\n\nExamples: Sales consultant, Technical Sales for devices or software\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere do we ENTP fit better? I feel lost. Can somebody give me some insights about your experience?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	I work as a mechanical engineer tuning cars, and I can say that it does occasionally get monotonous and you want to do something else. That soon changes once you finish the one project and move on to the next one. Each project brings it's own challenges and excitement. The small details are easy to learn and if you focus, should take about a month to catch on to fully. Watching a project go from CAD, to prototype, to a finished product is very satisfying and I love my job. \n\nI used to do sales for a very short while, I got bored of dealing with people, Because after awhile in sales, you learn to recognize certain traits in new people to find out how to make a sale. Yeah, it's easy money, but it isn't enjoyable and it became a bore. It's like reading a mystery novel, and solving the mystery a third of the way into the book. It's an ok read, but you gradually lose interest and stop picking the book up.\n\nGranted I said both get to be boring, but the project you get in engineering changes your whole mood. Something fun and creative can keep you on your toes for months, while something boring that shouldn't take long can be procrastinated since you know it's so easy. \n\nI'd say follow what comes more naturally to you. If you are better at people skills than problem solving, go sales. If you are better at problem solving and enjoy new challenges throughout the year, go engineering. 
3	A) - has no women  \n\- cant bullshit way through\n\n\- more stable/less stressful when it comes to income  \n\n\nA sounds like the better career path, I mean sales? I did that when I was 19 and even if the scale is different, its just trying to take morons money by selling them stuff they ultimately dont want. Engineering is more boring, less filled with exciting people, engineering looks better on the cv and might be the smarter career path. Yes there is probably a lot to learn, and you will meet really smart people that you will connect to, but also a lot of morons regardless and practically no women.   \n\n\nI always felt like the MINTs are directly trading fun for intellectual stimulation.
1	I used to do order desk at an architectural hardware wholesaler. Lots of people time (Ne) and down time (Ti) lots of product research, and problem solving (had access to over 20,000 different products with varying applications. \n\nMoney was pretty good, salary and commission plus benefits. 
1	Sales I am in now. Its fun. I am also the best in the company at it. comes natural. youre basically arguing with someone why they should buy somehting
1	Guy... I need more input from all of you. This is the most difficult ENTP question of my life currently:).\n\nAnyone in sales or engineering here?
1	Sales...
2	Dating a Sensor --- Is it a bad idea?	I'm a sophomore in high school, and I've recently been talking to a junior girl who is probably either ESFP or ESFJ. While we both kinda like each other, conversations are usually dull and I struggle to really get interested. So often she'll be trying to start a conversation, and I'll just stare at my phone or off into space as I ignore her. We went on our first date yesterday, and it started off pretty rough but got a bit better later.\n\nShould I date her? I kinda like her, but I just don't know if our personalities will ever really work together. If I was to shut things down, how can I meet INXJs or any heavy N types I might be able to converse better with.
20	>I'm a sophomore in high school\n\nThe answer is "yes". Chances are extremely high that whatever relationship you develop with her won't matter in the long run anyway. 
5	Go the FWB route. Sex with ESFs is quite good.
5	Sensors and intuitives might have differences, however there’s more to people than their MBTI. Don’t overthink it, if you like her date her. Don’t let fear of a difference stop you from an awesome experience with this gal. 
4	Why would you stare at your phone and ignore her when she makes an effort to talk to you? That's not nice :)\n\nEither way, relationship between sensor and intuitive type can work, you'll just have to put extra effort in it, and you'll probably feel a bit misunderstood most of the time. I spent 7 years with ESTJ and we made it work. I don't think he ever truly "got" me but on the plus side, he was dependable and responsible person. Being you I would give it a shot, just be patient and kind and don't expect her to be something she can't be :)
4	It's not a bad idea because she's a sensor per se, but if you regularly struggle to be interested in what she's saying its not a good idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: a word\n\n&#x200B;
2	Yeah, and bang her. 
2	If you like her then date her. Don't rely on mbti when it comes to that 
1	Lead the conversation and see how she reacts.\n\nI like chatting with my S entourage. The discussion are different from the ones with Ns though \n\n
9	Do you read books often?	Just so we have something to aim at, I am going to toss out reading a book once or twice a month on average as reading often.\n\nWhat genres of books do you prefer?\n\nWhat books would you recommend?
8	I like keeping myself occupied with reading. I usually prefer fiction of any kind because of how it fuels my imagination especially SciFi and fantasy. Apart from that I read books on history, philosophy and linguistics. These genres seem really interesting to me as they are monumental in learning about today's society and human nature itself.\n
3	Firstly it was so hard for me to read books until I was 23, always kept daydreaming after a few pages about 40 mins then hated myself for not finishing any books. Later on, I fixed that problem, started reading my all time favorite genre; fantasy novels. I am into Warcraft series and I love to promote it anywhere, anytime, that how great and well structured, creative, clever and complex that story is :D  (even tho I left playing it 8 years ago, i still read its new books)\n\nbesides that, If you are truly ready to get into the next level of consciousness and looking for a key to open your door, my all time champion would be OSHO. Calmly reading his books and embracing his teachings completely helped to most of my ENTP issues and also other personal challenges, he is the mentor that I never had before. I'd recommend his "insights for a new way" titled series, especially "creativity" and "joy" titled books.
2	I'm guessing redditors in general skew into sci-fi / fantasy geek culture. That's my core, though like most ENTP's I can find interest in most any subject if it's presented well (yay Ne-Ti!). Here's three  rec's off the top of my head:\n\n\- Terry Pratchett's Discword Series for silly fun + satire on society\n\n\- Roger Zelansky's Chronicles of Amber. Great fantasy series and I'd tell you more but it's *really* fun to go into the first book 100% blind.\n\n\- Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy. Follows the colonization of Mars from the first 100 scientists through to an entire, developed society. Has aged quite well since the 90's publish date. Tries for hard sci-fi and mostly succeeds.
2	For fiction I like Lee Child, Dan Brown, and John Grisham.\n\nFor non-fiction I like books on electronics and also on architecture. How to read Houses is good.
2	I’m doing that too. \n\nI usually prefer non-fiction, self growth category but lately I have been getting into fiction. \n\nJust finished ‘the unbearable lightness of being’ by Milan Kundera. If you’re into overanalysing stuff and philosophical fiction I’d recommend that 
2	The average user here finds it impossible to finish a 5,000+ character comment without a tl;dr. I don't think most of the people here read books often. 
2	I don't read fiction. I have a pretty vivid imagination so it's no problem for me to envision a story but I've tried to enjoy reading fiction but it just doesn't pickle my tickle. Keep in mind that I'm in HS so this might change but for now I'll stick to non-fiction, mostly self-growth books. \n\nAs for how often I read: By your definition I don't read that often. I have a few unfinished books that I've dragged on finishing for months and so I decided to make the switch to audiobooks. Reading physical books seems like a chore sometimes because I have to focus all my attention on a single task at hand, on the other hand, audiobooks enable me to do other activities while "reading" the information. 
2	Yeah, I try to read a lot.\n\nAlthough I can easily get distracted, I make time for reading everyday. \n\nI use the app named "Forest", it really helps when I should focus\n\nI always read fiction, and my favourite genre is fantasy, i like scifi too tho\n\nBrandon Sanderson is excellent, Stormlight Archive is my favourite series. First book, the Way of Kings, took me a while to read -it racks a bit- but the second one, Words of Radiance was the best book I've ever read. You can find it at the ENTP book recommendation lists too\n\nWords of Radiance is the best thing at this universe,  no need to explanation\n\nPierce Brown's Red Rising Trilogy is great too, first book may proceed slowly but after 100 pages, the pace is always up. Excellent story, I say. It was my favourite till I read Stormlight Archive.
2	Well I start books often, ask me how many I‘ve finished. Currently I have like 5 books I‘m reading, I need diversity so I can read according to my mood. \n\nI don‘t like fiction or romans. When I read it‘s usually knowledge related, like books about history, or if it is a roman, it must be a classic one. Because they usually contain great lessons. For example Moby Dick or The Godfather.\n\nCurrently I‘m reading one about Isaac Newton, one about business, and like 3 theology related. \n\nI have a book about philosophs where I read just about the philosoph I‘m currently interested in. It‘s always there but not for me to finish from A to Z.\n\nI used to hate reading. I just recently started reading properly. Because I always space out when I read a physical book. But since I started reading eBooks I love it and don‘t space out that much. I can also read anywhere while waiting etc.
2	Pop science and history of science. Been trying to work through a layman intro to quantum mechanics (Susskind and Friedman) for a while. If I'm lucky, I manage to skim through a book a month (slow reader here). 
1	If you want to witnesss the death of an INFJ main character, read *Justine* by Marquis de Sade. Sorry for the spoiler
-1	when i was an INTP i used to read many books , i still do , i just dont do it in public
3	Loosing my train of thought.	I have a habit of loosing my train of thought when I'm not fully invested in a conversation. When I'm drinking this is a particular problem, do anyone here know of any techniques to keep my thoughts in check?
5	Maybe you should try fasten it with some rope or something. 
1	I loose my trail of thought even when I’m actually interested in conversations. \n\nMy best bet is to just say whatever you have to as quick as you can. It’s not foolproof but hey, it works for me
36	ENTP "charming" stereotype	I don't know if this one fits for me but then again still just a late teen so I've got a lot to learn.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this trope?\n\n&#x200B;
42	I've never understood the assertion that we're good at manipulating people - I'm VERY extroverted, intuitive, thinking, and perceiving and I can't manipulate my way out of a paper sack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, we are in fact quite charming in our own way. We are 'on' as soon as we are in the public eye and often seek to entertain or present ideas to others. In a way, we are putting on a performance which generally ends when we get home and go unobserved again.
43	ENTP are shape shifters. We meet you. We share a few words. We pinpoint your fundamental motivations. With that knowledge we can become what you desire if we so chose. 
27	I once returned home almost blackout drunk at 3am having forgotten my keys and ringed intil someone opened the door. The mother of one of my flatmates opened (she came for a few days), a woman I had never met, opened the door. I do not remember that.\n\nThe morning after she told me what happened and I was really embarassed at first, but then she said I had been really polite and had talked with her for a little bit with a warm smile on my face and actually using good language.\n\nShe said she wouldn't have realized I was drunk had I not been unable to walk more than 5 steps without almost falling to the floor.\n\nI do not know to what extent this is true, but maybe that "natural charm" refers to things like these.
24	ENTPs are naturally extremely charming individuals, especially when they are going after something that they want. ENTPs have a way with words, and a natural ability to charm those around them. This often makes ENTPs very good at manipulating people, if they do desire. They are seen in television and books, as the more charming and suave characters- with extremely smooth personalities. ENTPs are fun and adventurous, which only adds to their natural charisma.
18	I’ve gotten away with a whooooole lotta shit just because I have a big “genuine” smile. I also know how to present myself as very well mannered (isfj mom) so people think of me as very innocent and typically don’t question my intentions when they don’t know me well. \n\nPretty open minded so I can appreciate a lot of people’s different humor and people generally like you if you laugh at their jokes. I laugh even if it’s not funny sometimes. \n\nI’m toooo flirty. It just comes so naturally. I like flirtatious energy when it’s play and bouncing back n forth but when someone turns my playfulness into something serious I get awkward lol\n\nThose are some examples that come to mind for me. 
10	My favorite thing is the performance piece. There is a significant difference between the cold calculations I do in my head and the intense quiet time I enjoy when in my abode, when compared to; chatty, knowledgeable, pop-culture fiending guy with a disarming smile and over abundance of information to unload on you.\n\nThere is no inbetween for me, I’m either on or off extroversion. Shit needs to recharge with a good bowl and book and/or documentary.
7	Yep, and as an ENTP woman, I am constantly having men think I’m flirting with them when I’m not (in reality, when I really like someone, I become really reserved).
5	I feel like I missed the god damned memo
5	ENTPs are smooth as fuck. I'll give you guys that. Makes my panties wet just thinking about it.
4	I have yet to meet a non-charming ENTP. But I am sure they are out there.
4	ENTPs are fueled by socializing and attention and tend to be very curious and open minded. With high emotional intelligence, ENTPs can come across as charismatic and charming. With low emotional intelligence, ENTPs might seem a bit all over the place, combative, intrusive. 
3	I do not consider myself charming, BUT other people often do and I have accepted it as a common occurrence.
2	Extremmely accurate.
2	I've never been as charming as I wanted to be. Some people do seem charmed by me, but it's not something I can control. And I've definitely experienced some people hating me immediately!
4	Were talking about charm here, charisma is something else entirelly.\n\nTrump won because he used hes charisma against all odds, but the guy is zero charming.\n\nHitler was extremmely charismatic but had very low charm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCharisma is extremmely rare, and is not about types but individuals most individuals regardless of type dont undertand charisma and thus dont have it.
1	I’m actually very charming and I can manipulate situations and people very well. It comes easy to me but I also had to use that as a kid to get by a lot so I had to develop it. I’m glad I can because it came in handy when I was a waitress and bartender.  I try not to manipulate people anymore but I definitely use my charm daily. 
1	As an INTP, I've trained myself to tap into Ne mode and it's helped me become a charming ENTP when I need to use. A lot of times I am somewhat obnoxious, but I always try to charm people and people seem to really like me. On the other hand, I go full introvert when I've had a full day of that at work. When I'm in introvert mode at work and I need to change to extrovert mode, it's like a huge switch that I struggle to throw and I have to adjust to extrovert mode. I'm very not fluid about it.
1	I definitely wasn't charming until after my teens, then I became *hella* charming. I had to learn it. Once I did it was just so much fun to see reactions that I just kept doing it. I think that's why we tend to do it so much. We like people watching. 
1	Personally I just kinda zone out in social situations when people are talking about gossip etc. and prefer to surf the web think about interesting ideas. Until an interesting subject comes up then I get progressively more energetic the more we talk about it and people are usually laugh at this and find it "charming". Or when I drink even the socially mundane things become interesting so things just get out of control
1	People say I’m charming *only* once they get to know me. \nTo strangers I’m just awkward lol 
1	ll
5	Recently broke up with my INFJ girlfriend of 3+ years.	Just wanted to know how many of you have had lasting relationships with INFJ's? \nBefore her I had a very good friend throughout middle and high school we never dated, but both of us felt connected in a deep genuine kind of way. I also felt like this while I was my girlfriend. Often I find myself reverberating the personalities of the people I interact with. Never really being able to be completely genuine with myself. \n\nHow do you feel about the shipping of the to types as an ideal pair? \nEven before I had discover the mbti types I have found myself magnetically attracted to the INFX types, I'd go as far as to say I felt instantly attracted to them as soon as I saw them, initially anyways. \n\nwhat were some of the problems that either of you perceived to have within the relationship?\nI feel like one of the problems I had was getting her to admit openly that she was upset by certain actions, I often had to coax it out of her, but more often than not she would silently compromise in order to prevent 'conflict'. One thing I had a problem doing was following through with plans, or favors. I was always very open to discussion about our relationship and felt it was very healthy in general. This being true the break up took me by very harsh surprise. \n\nAny of you have like a ritual or something that you would do after such an occurrence has happened? I wanted to develop a healthy amount of routine in my life. 
7	Every INFJ I've met has come off as kind of snakey and weird, so nothing ever really happened. Dated an ISFP and ISTP though, not so bad. Breakup ritual? Find someone else fast, or brood and use it as some kind of fuel.
5	I have an INTJ boyfriend and we've been dating for almost a year. We started talking in March and got together in April so we don't have a long history together as friends, but what brought as together as a couple was the fact that we liked how we both think. Conversations served as our foundation. Even until now we still talk all through the night for a minimum of 5 hours. This isn't every night of course since we have lives and sometimes we just want to be lazy, but when we're both mentally stimulated, we could talk for hours. We realized that the main trait that we look for in a person is "NT". So even if i'm extroverted and lean more on an abstract plan, while he is introverted and a very detailed planner, we still work. Our differences are settled through talking it out logically, and we usually put feelings aside. Yes, feelings are unavoidable, but it's more important for us to just understand that you feel that way, and then think of a "fair" compromise.\n\nWe also rely on "commitment" not "love". We've concluded that if you rely on the feeling of love, that automatically means you're putting yourself in an unstable place. What if they change or they're in a mood wherein love is hard and someone comes along that make them feel more "loved"?  So in the end, we've established a set of rules for ourselves, commit ourselves to that, and the only time we would ever really "fall out of love" is when we stray from that commitment and break it.  \n\n\nEdit: I AM SO SORRY OP! I read it as INTJ, not INFJ. Making share of experience totally unrelated!
4	Not sure if I'm gonna contribute anything that's actually useful, but the part about your GF not telling you when/why she's upset caught my attention. I've been dating an ENTP for about a year (INTJ here), and I know several other ENTPs. I've observed that you guys definitely have drive to improve yourself and that you want feedback, so that you can do things better. However, I've noticed myself doing the same your INFJ is doing - keeping it to myself when an ENTP upsets me. Because no matter how carefully I word it, how nice I try to be when I tell them something bothers me, I always somehow end up being the bad guy. The Ne/Ti/Fe combo in ENTP comes up with plausible "I did nothing wrong, it shouldn't be upsetting, you being upset for 2 hours creates negative space and I have hard time dealing with it... therefore I am the one who is hurt in this situation" rant. I suppose it could be Ne-Fe loop, triggering insecurity when criticized, I don't know. It doesn't happen always, but enough to make me hide it when I'm upset about something. I only ever say anything when the ENTP coaxes it out of me, because that's the moment when they are ready and willing to hear it. I don't know whether this happens to you as well, or whether your INFJ had different reasons for not telling you. \n\nAnyway, from what I've read in the comments, if your INFJ is depressed, perhaps she could see a therapist and once she gets better, perhaps you could get back together. I have depression as well and it does weird shit to brain, it definitely doesn't help people think clearly.
2	Wife and gf of 15 years is a infj. Hard work but completely worth it. So much to unpack and understand!
1	What did she say the reason for the breakup was? Maybe it's still recoverable? Even if you get the INFJ door slam sometimes you can come back from it. 
1	My first girlfriend was ESFJ. The relationship lasted a couple years but I would say it sucked. I'm currently seeing an INFJ. It seems really difficult breaking her barrier. Initially my natural playful banter got her excited but now it seems like she is done with it and it wasn't enough to get her out of her shell. Both of us are 19 and in college and still pretty immature.\nShe was a bit more invested in me during the winter break, but now she's focusing more on her studies. I do support and understand this but it seems we are drifting apart.\nI honestly don't know how far this will go, only time will tell.
95	Procrastination is not just a matter of willpower or laziness. A new brain-scan study finds that procrastination can occur due to difficulties in valuing outcomes or associating outcomes with tasks.	
37	> Prior research on procrastination has shown that people are less likely to procrastinate on a task when they associate it with a high-value incentive. \n\nThat’s some real Nobel quality research right there...
22	Error 403 : Pre frontal cortex is not accessible
15	It's hard to care when its only a grade\n\nIt's hard to care when its it's only a job\n\nIts hard to care when its only a career\n\nIts hard to care when its it's only a emotion that is felt for a small moment...and not something that is permanent.  That's why many struggle with the goals they set for themselves. \n\nThere is this loop of a emotion that only lasts in our minds for a tiny bit....but what if I told you that this feeling and emotion of success. . .is the beginning of an unfathomable rabbit hole?\n\nOne which has many branches and twists that our mind hasn't been able to conjure possible connections of yet, because we are unable to detect that such branches are have a possibility of existence. . . .? 
5	True. I don‘t consider myself lazy when I *care* about the result. But most of the time I don‘t, it‘s hard to still be productive in that case. \n\nedit: Ill come back later to add sth/ edit this
5	This is tough news for me seeing how I'm a nihilist
4	ENTPs are too divine to value outcomes 
2	It's part of the adhd diagnoses and medication usually works pretty well. 
1	So having FI trickster has to do with misunderstanding the value in the work being done thus equating to procrastination. I know ENTP's have difficulty determining between good and bad which are value sets of belief.
1	 procrastination: the action of delaying or postponing monotony.
1	I'm pretty sure at some point ENTP will be labeled as a disorder. But from my point of view us ENTP's are usually the most stable. Even if we make others feel uncomfortable
1	Waving money in front of my face makes me 95% more productive. The only thing I've ever procrastinated on is school assignments.  
-2	Procrastination is a mental challenge to the problems we face. Showing that we do not have fear to fail. Giving more time to the problem as an advantage. Then when limited time remains we focus as high as possible to win it. For me, that is an indicator of high intelligence. 
6	Religion and ENTPS... are you guys at all religious?	I personally grew up in a quite religious household and family. I always had to attend religious events in our community and had been brought up going to religious schooling once a week though my elementary and middle school years. I have definitely distanced myself from my religion, especially in recent years. I do believe in gods or a god- a superior being per say, but I can’t say I agree with abiding by a certain set of rules to appease a god we don’t know exists. \n\nI was curious about your guys’ experience with religion and how it has evolved through your lives \n\nDope, thanks 
10	I was raised Catholic but I haven’t believed since I was about 12.  I find religion interesting to study though.\n\nI see it as this whole other lens for looking at the world the same way I’d look at something like anthropology or sociology so I don’t see the study of religion and the questions it raises as incompatible with science 
6	I was raised Roman Catholic but never believed.  I started telling people I was agnostic in high school, and since then I describe my view as weak atheism.  The world works without a creator.\n\nI do have a bit of a sense of interconnectedness that some would describe as pantheistic. It's more looking at the totality of existence as a beautiful mosaic rather than organs of a conscious god.\n\nThat said, I had a pretty bad time growing up in school, and I look around at the world and see a lot of needless suffering and death, so if there is some kind of sentience in charge of all of this I'm mad at it the same way I'd be mad at a parent who sat around while their kids killed each other.\n\n
4	I start being atheis since highschool but I do read bible,quran,buddhist text. I found some of the teaching interesting and practical so I take them in .what I don’t believe is praying ,miracle, after life and stuff, I look at them as a kind of fiction cause some of them are really fun to read\n\nPs. My family is not religious and I used to be Buddhist
4	I grew up in a religious household (Catholic). My family actively participated in church activities and of course I just followed it as a child. It was around high school when I started questioning the idea of a God. I wasn't a non-believer, I just questioned conundrums like why does he allow bad things to happen? Now, depending on who you voice it out, you'll receive different kind of answers. The most common would be, it's not his will. That was the deal breaker for me. So good things = God's will. Bad things = not his will? That's too convenient!\n\nI still believed in a higher being that created the universe. I still talked silently at night to this unknown being, ranting about the world he created. I know he'll never answer, but it was nice to let things out. The most prominent thing that changed was I stopped participating in Church activities. Basically I ditched the whole practice of religion, but in paper, I was still Catholic. During forced family gatherings and instances where I have to attend mass, I'd unwillingly go, apologize to God the entire time cause I can't find it in me to swallow whatever is being thrown by the Church. From my experience, the priests were assholes. I didn't agree with their lectures, so I just zone out every time I have to go to mass.\n\nThe crisis, however, was in identifying my faith. I explored other religions, but just like the case with Catholics, I can't find it in me to relate to any of them.\n\nAround college, I stumbled on the word "Gnostic". One google search led to another, and I found myself spending nights reading up on this ideology. I don't 100% relate to every article there is that has anything to do with Gnosticism, but I fell in love with the fact that "knowledge" is the main foundation. A discovery of your faith through enlightenment from knowledge and experience.\n\nUntil present time, when asked about religion, I always say I'm Catholic on paper, but I don't practice it. I do, however, believe in a God and have my own set of beliefs.\n\nAnd depending on the person, I talk about Gnosticism. I don't want it to become a 'thing' like 'Sapiosexuals' so I avoid throwing it out without much thought.
4	I was born with an innate sense of spirituality. As long as I can remember I have always thought to myself ‘there is more to this than what meets the eye’. I was Presbyterian until around age 7 then Pentecostal ever since. From my experience religion is the finger that points to thing it is not the thing. What is divine, ethereal and transcendent. That is the thing. The problem is when one experiences the divine they come to a realization. We  don’t have words that can describe it.  So I could try and tell you  what I’ve experience but I won’t  really make any sense. \n\nI will however Leave you with this “...one of the names for God is the I AM” — one thing you come away with when you encounter the divine is the understanding that You also can just be. Not I am tall, I am intelligent, I am rich just I AM. If one pays close attention you’ll realize that what this does is suppress the Ego “the need to be something” this notion of ego suppression is echoed every where from psychology, philosophy, mysticism, religion, to shamanic practice etc. try to find the thing after you’ve located a finger. 
4	I was Muslim by birth, but when I turned 14 I started doing research online and in the library. It’s more of a comparative study really and now I am Muslim by choice. In all the debates I watched and in all the Q&A I came across, it’s the only religion that keeps winning and keeps amazing people and me. 
3	nah pretty much everyone are atheists in Sweden
2	I am a devout Catholic.  It's the only religion I wasn't able to poke holes in, so I committed myself 100% and that's that.  Can't say I was happy about it though.  When my last hold-out argument against it fell through, I was so upset and angry that I burst into tears.  Then I pulled myself together and told God that I'd be the worst Catholic ever but given the option between living an uncomfortable truth or an easy lie, I could never choose the lie.  I don't know how people do it - knowing that something is true and ignoring it.  That would snap my tenuous hold on sanity like a twig.
2	Interestingly enough, I'm a practicing Muslim despite how much dogma I reject concerning everything else. I converted into the faith at the age of 16 after 2 years of study, and even at that point I was not convinced the religious aspect was that important. However, I am exceedingly spiritual and have faith in the teachings of the Prophet and the Quran, but not in the same sense as other Muslims. Compared to my friends, I'm a very different Muslim. I pray, I fast, I do all of that, but the way in which I am aware of concepts and use logic and science in tandem with faith is shocking yet refreshing to many of my friends and family. Call it faith, but there is a certain logic to the lessons within Islam and I'm always skeptical but when I see something happen in my life that would be impossible to understand outside what I learned in my theological study, I am overwhelmed. There is a higher power, and perhaps that's the only authority I allow in my life as I reject all others. For some, they may perceive that authority as something else, but it's worked for me and it's made me more self-aware. However, I'm not your typical Muslim by any means. 
2	The entp brain is too damn good to be wasted in religion.
1	I tried to be lol. I went to a Jesuit school from 5th-8th grade. I tried attending mass and doing the catholic shit to fit in. By the 6th grade, I told the priest that I didnt believe(I didnt know what atheism was at that point) and that I would no longer attend mass. Thankfully the priests at my school were some of the coolest and most understanding people I've ever met. So I got to chill with the Muslim kids during mass Haha 
1	I grew up Mormon and stopped believing around the age of 12 of 13 but still went to church. Stopping going at 16 and my mom lost her mind.
1	My family goes by 'choose your own religion', so most of them have beliefs that are a mush-up of diffrent teachings. Some are atheists, some are Jehova witnesses and some are weird new age amalgamations. There are a few proper Catholic ones, but they are in minority. Over all made me pretty relaxed to just go and check diffrent belief systems out.  \n\nI went from believing some of them to atheism. But couldn't stick to it after reading Dawkins and talking to atheists. I think atheism in theory is as cool as any other approach. But a lot of conversations with atheists I had were so similar to conversations with very religious people it seemed like they substituted religion for non religion and nothing changed. I now think that some people have more inclination to hold strong beliefs either  religious or not religious, and I'm not one of them.\n\nNowadays I sit somewhere on the agnostic spectrum, if I had to choose a belief system it would probably be some form of animism.
1	When I was a kid (6-12 years old) I had coonversations with my parents and other family members where they explained me Christianity and Islam, two of the most extended religions. The idea of god didn't make sense to me so I accepted Religion as a tool to control what people think.\n\nAt the age of 14-16 my view on religion changed to a philosophical belief. People believed in it to answer the unanswered philosophical questions, which helped them sleep better at night.\n\nThen, at 18-19 I got sucked into a magick rabbit hole and got obsessed with it. It was fun. There I chaged again my view of religion to a "spiritual" tool to manifest change into the world on situations over which you have no control. Again, I saw it as a way to help people sleep better at night, but this time regarding personal problems.\n\nNow, at 21, I have combined all these points of view and accepted religion as a "library" of ideas which can be used for many different reasons and each person has their own reasons. Personally, I am a firm follower of pragmatism, so I use religion as a tool for growth. I am unable to follow pre-established religions because I believe the most powerful ideas are the ones you come up with, so I am slowly building my own religion. Its main idea is the existence of gods that embody different aspects of life. For now I have created 5 gods:\n\n**- The god of Discipline**\n\nThis god handles anything discipline related. You pray to him by showing discipline and he rewards you with the fruits of said discipline.\n\nIf you make him mad he will suck all discipline out of you and make even the simplest task exhausting. You have to show him that you do appreciate him in your life by pushing through his challenges.\n\n**- The god of Competition and War**\n\nThis god handles anything competitive. You pray to him by preparing yourself for a competition and he rewards you with advantage in said competition.\n\nIf you get on his bad side he will make you feel and perform worse than other people. You have to show him that you appreciate him by training hard enough and winning without his help.\n\n**- The god of Curiosity and Knowledge**\n\nThis god handles anything related to knowledge. You pray to him by studying and learning things you didn't know, and as a reward you recieve "free knwoledge" by combining ideas and coming up with original thoughts and by curiosity in things related to the subject you're studying, which helps you learn faster and better.\n\nIf you get on his bad side he will make you feel stupid, unable to learn even the most basic material. You have to show him you appreciate him by learning and understanding something complex.\n\n**- The goddess of Family and Society**\n\nHandles everything social. You pray to her by building and stregthening relationships with people in your life. She rewards you with opportunities and help from the people you interact with.\n\nIf you get on her bad side she will make you feel like an outsider, useless for everybody around you. To show her your appreciation you have to make the effort to build new relationships on a regular basis and improve your already existing ones, even if it feels pointless and exhausting.\n\n**- The goddess of Beauty**\n\nHandles everything beauty related. You pray to her by making a conscious effort to physically improve yourself and your surroundings. She rewards you with peace of mind.\n\nIf you get on her bad side she will make you scatterminded and self conscious. To show her you respect her you have to fix everything that is "ugly" or bad looking in you and your personal space.\n\nI also believe everybody has a special connection with two of the above gods, and praying to them will make you feel energized and alive. Improving your relationship with them is more important and, once you do it, they make it easier to improve your relationship with the other three. If you do not improve it they will make you obsess over things that are related to them. For example, if your main god is Curiosity and Knowledge you will feel curiosity towards many things, but nothing will stick enough for you to actually learn it.\n\nOn top of that, they interact with each other and being in a good relationship with any of them involves improving your relationship with their "friends".\n\nEven if they are created by me and they don't exist, I do treat them as real because it's easier for the subconscious to understand that there is a guy who will get angry if you don't do X than to understand the idea behind doing X. So you could say I mainly use religion to create a way to communicate with my unconscious. And I do believe the majority of the religious population also does this without realizing it.
1	Agnostic, because who really knows ? 
1	I was raised Catholic, started reading the Bible and became a Christian, eventually finished reading the Bible and became an agnostic atheist.
1	I was raised catholic and gave it up when I was 11. I was strictly agnostic up until about 2 years ago, now I would probably say I’m Christian, although I don’t really think I deserve the title. I try working on faith and taking a more logical approach, but some aspects are hard to do that with, so it’s been quite a process for me. 
1	Pure atheist here. I don't believe in any of that stuff. 
1	born into a secular muslim environment, always been the questioning kid at school, had debates with religious authoritarians and it made me feel like an outcast teenager. thanks to social media I was able to understand the big picture and leave all their delusions behind.   \n\n\nFirst stage was me being an angry atheist, then I calmed and nowadays just l'm just letting them religious people drown on their delusions, and enjoy when their prayers are not answered. :) I'm 29 now, in muslim country, still an outcast but a clear conscience. 
1	Grew up Catholic, became agnostic for a few years, then had a hardcore reversion to Catholicsim in College. Never doubted since...it became settled science for me, though I fought it hard at first
1	I think religion has only ever existed to keep people moral. I've never been religious but wish I was, cause I feel like I'd benefit from having a moral code to follow. I tried to find one that suits me, and came up with Wicca as the closest ("do as you will if it harms none") but even that comes with belief in a God and Goddess and prayer etc. So alas I remain an Agnostic to this day
3	Does it require any amount of faith to believe Jung’s theory?	Allow me to preface this question: I have a pretty good grasp on the cognitive functions and have put in a lot of internet-research into unpacking Jung’s theories. But one thing has never been substantially answered for me, that being the fundamental assumptions behind how the cognitive functions are ordered and why this structure they manifest in, according to Jung, are necessary. \n\nThis article raises a good point about this:\nhttps://careersintheory.wordpress.com/2010/04/27/do-i-still-like-mbti-part-1/\n\nI should mention that I’ve never come across Jung’s own works and read them for myself, but it does seem that no one challenges the assumptions behind the structure of the cognitive functions in their dom, aux, tert, and inferior positions. The article claims that Jung seemed to make the claims about the structural order of the functions purely based off of faith in duality. Supposedly, if you take away the order, this opens up the potential for over 40,000 possible combinations of cognitive functions, which is mind boggling. \n\nWhy are the functions necessarily ordered the way that they are? Why does dominant intuition necessarily mean inferior sensing? Does this question make sense? I welcome any links or further reading. :)
5	You only need faith is you think MBTI or functions is actually explaining human personality from deeper principles.  If you just see it as a kind of heuristic, a way of thinking about things, then it doesn't require any proof or faith.  You simply have to respect the boundaries of what it can tell you -- which ultimately is just the gross, big picture behavior. \n\nJung decided upon some arbitrary but well chosen distinctions. And the permutation of those lead to 16 types in MBTI.\n\nIt's kind of like classifying Netflix movies into genres.  They're really arbitrary distinctions, but they nevertheless serve as a guide to picking movies.  If instead you try to argue that those genres are somehow *fundamentally true*, then you need to start believing in things.\n\n
2	Eyyyyyy my brotha!  \n  \nI have the right link for you.  \n  \nEEG brain scan correlations for the functions and types!!   \n  \nDario Nardi is legend and im down to discuss at any time.  \n  \nI have his book and could send you some stuff that you want to know more about.  \n  \nhttps://youtu.be/MGfhQTbcqmA
1	> I should mention that I’ve never come across Jung’s own works and read them for myself,\n\nWe have a link in the sidebar to his description of the types:\n\nhttp://www.bostonneuropsa.net/PDF%20Files/Classics%20in%20the%20History%20of%20Psychology.pdf
1	> The article claims that Jung seemed to make the claims about the structural order of the functions purely based off of faith in duality.\n\nChange "duality" to "mutual exclusivity," and I don't see a problem.
1	All belief takes faith.\nTo be short as I am Lazy this I a great point your making. And the answers is there are a lot of debate that spans Psychology and Philosphy
1	I don’t buy the 16 function stacks either. And I’m not sure where exactly it came from – I suspect it was neither Jung nor M-B. I think Jung was aware of the difficulties of his enterprise\^ – especially in a post-Enlightenment world where the extraverted thinking/quantitative-empirical approach is valued. In *Psychological Types*, I think he thinks that he has found something true, based on his observations of common people, prominent philosophers, and biographies of scientists. (That something being the eight attitude-function types.)   \n\nI suspect that there is a heavy dose of intuition involved in the writing of *Pyschological Types*… There are statements not completely explained by his observations (how did he arrive at *four* function types? how does he know that *that* is what the person is thinking?). I’d suggest that he implicitly justifies his use of intuition in a roundabout way, for example, by associating Nietzsche with intuition and elevating Nietzsche. But at the same time, he’s also aware that intuition is not infallible. \n\n\^ Leaving here a paragraph by Jung on the difficulties of doing psychology in a scientific age. The TLDR I’d make is that (i) it’s difficult but possible to quantify the human psyche, but (ii) we would never be able to fully capture its complexities through a quantitative approach. \n\n>It may perhaps seem superfluous that I should add to my text a chapter dealing solely with definitions. But ample experience has taught me that, in psychological works particularly, one cannot proceed too cautiously in regard to the concepts and terms one uses: for nowhere do such wide divergences of meaning occur as in the domain of psychology, creating only too frequently the most obstinate misunderstandings. This drawback is due not only to the fact that the science of psychology is still in its infancy; there is the further difficulty that the empirical material, the object of scientific investigation, cannot be displayed in concrete form, as it were, before the eyes of the reader. The psychological investigator is always finding himself obliged to make extensive use of an indirect method of description in order to present the reality he has observed. Only in so far as elementary facts are communicated which are amenable to quantitative measurement can there be any question of a direct presentation. But how much of the actual psychology of man can be experienced and observed as quantitatively measurable facts? Such facts do exist, and I believe I have shown in my association studies that extremely complicated psychological facts are accessible to quantitative measurement. But anyone who has probed more deeply into the nature of psychology, demanding something more of it as a science than that it should confine itself within the narrow limits of the scientific method, will also have realized that an experimental method will never succeed in doing justice to the nature of the human psyche, nor will it ever project anything like a true picture of the more complex psychic phenomena.     \n\n([https://the-eye.eu/public/concen.org/Princeton%20Jung/6%20Psychological%20Types%20%20%28Collected%20Works%20of%20C.%20G.%20Jung%2C%20Volume%206%29.pdf](https://the-eye.eu/public/concen.org/Princeton%20Jung/6%20Psychological%20Types%20%20%28Collected%20Works%20of%20C.%20G.%20Jung%2C%20Volume%206%29.pdf), p.569)
35	Why do you think people are so keen to single out ethnic groups or just groups in general as the people who rule the world AND why is the word conspiracies so stigmatized?	
21	I think conspiracies are stigmatized because they are usually up to no good. Most conspiracies also offer an alternative for current reality - which makes many people uncomfortable. Most people don‘t want to hear about anything they‘re not used to. Fear of the unknown is a major influence I‘d say. They want to stick to the good old view they had, and don‘t need anyone messing with it. It sometimes has negative impact as well. It is common for conspiracies to throw shade on someone‘s/ a group‘s name and accusing them of things while they might be innocent after all.\n\nFunny thing - the ones who want to single out a group as the „rulers of the world“, are members of that group themselves. I‘ll be honest it usually has some underlying reason though. For example I know many people think the US and white american men „rule the world“, I think that‘s because the US is a very strong force, as in being one step ahead in some fields, be it money or control, they do have an advantage. So it follows for some people that all white american males must have power then. Which is just due to a lack of knowledge, because in fact many of these „powerful white males“ are jewish as well.\n\nSo to conclude I think people falsely connect certain things together and give people the power they don‘t really have. OR it has some reason to it. It‘s important to mention that „the rulers“ are different for everyone. There are rulers for technology, rulers for business, rulers among the „cool“ folks, rulers among „what‘s considered as pretty“, I‘m not sure if I got my point across well, but this is my opinion.\n\nEDIT: btw this pic is kinda fucking cool.
18	So I know this guy. Great guy. Honestly, I really like him. He has a dead end job and makes little money. I am totally fine with that. I don't want to value him based on his economic output blah blah. But it bothers him, which is also fine... thing is though, as bright as he is he can't figure out how to move forward towards his larger goals. Now he's pushing 40 and he's got a killer record collection but you know... its hard. Life's hard. \n\nAnyway, we get to talking one night and he starts loosening up about what's really going on. Like full out - flouride in the water is a tactic to depress masculinity so that alpha males won't rise up (he smokes pot and drinks everyday) and topple the government... it goes on and on. \n\nMy thinking is that people are autonomous and they know that they could change things in their lives. But they continually make decisions that undermine the changes they want to see in their future. This causes cognitive dissonance and in response to their failure they make up/buy into other reasons that explain why they can't make the changes they want. Its externalising their failure. \n\nTypically, I think a lot of these conspiracy theories revolve around economics and loss of entitlement. So, you know... like all the crazy bananas q-anon and the previous Obama shenanigans being pushed by middle-aged/boomer white guys is a pretty good example of what I am talking about. \n\n&#x200B;
7	Rich people rule the world. That isn't a conspiracy theory it is simple reality. Any other sort of conspiracy theory is based on a lack of class consciousness.\n\nWorkers of the world, unite.
6	A lot of conspiracies are likely true. But they are stigmatised because they rely on circumstantial evidence and incomplete information.\n\nA lot of people who push them also ignore or brush over pre-existing counter arguments because it doesn’t suit them.\n\nPeople single out the Rothschilds when discussing “deep state” theories because they legitimately have a history of controlling interest rates and the money supply. \n\nSwitching from gold backed currency to fiat is pretty much one of the worst things that ever happened in finance for the ordinary person\n\nLower interest rates, create a debt bubble, raise interest rates, people can barely pay back the interest let alone the lump sum, they default, take actual things that have value (land/property/business) rinse and repeat\n\nRight now we’re in a pretty big debt bubble. Stocks and housing are grossly overpriced pretty much everywhere in the world and its funded by cheap loans/ low interest
6	It's stigmatized because the ones who are in charge of things need the general public to fight shadows and ghosts rather than the actual problem.\n\nIt's a form of control. That's why racism exists. To divide people for useless reasons.
3	*The picture is from a Swedish internet/tech newspaper I found in my school library*
3	\n\nWe, as humans, generally need excuses to travel this rollercoaster called life and the smart people are aware of this and foster ideas of God, religion, scapegoating and the likes to get people up in arms, in solidarity against a foe or just to get stuff off of them.\n\nReligion has been around for centuries. There still is no proof of a God or any other deity as believed by others. Humanity has targeted Jewish people since records began with the Egyptians, Europeans from c.1100s to 1900s and elsewhere. Humanity needs a scapegoat and who is better to target than the people who like they arent affected by the plight that the rest of us mere mortals suffer from. Eg. Europeans purged Jews during the plague years because they didnt suffer as much because they had better hygienic conditions than the rest of Europe. And then in 1930s Germany, Jews didnt seem to suffer as much as the general population did as many Jewish people had reputable jobs as doctors, judges and bankers making them more well off than the average farmer or factory worker. So Hitler got the poor to go against the seemingly powerful. Now we say Jews control the US government and other major industries and antisemitism is prevalent across the world in one form such as active persecution to conspiracy theorists telling people to go against them (Alt right)
3	It is the Cain and Abel story. Essentially, people hate those who are prosperous because they believe it is a condemnation of their own character. So unless they choose to understand that they need to be better, they often believe that there is some reason that the other people are prospering and they are not. Since they do not believe that nature could be causing this inequity as nature as no will, they believe it is some man-made force that is keeping them down.
3	People like feeling elitist and "in the know." Everyone else is sheep except me. You know how it is. The racial aspect comes in, because a.) people like neat explanations for stuff they can't control, and b.) people are racist.\n\nI'm not sure the word "conspiracy" is actually stigmatized. It's just that people tend to throw theories about conspiracies really easily that it becomes annoying and basically associated with kooks. I mean, think of the most popular conspiracy theories -- anti vaxxers, people who don't believe in global warming, chem trails, flat earthers, etc. None of those things are likely and/or debunked with science. Actual likely conspiracies involving political and corporate corruption are usually ignored completely by most conspiracy theorists because they don't alter reality as much as they want them to.
2	It's easier to "fight for something" when you have an enemy. It's easier to have an enemy, if you give them a face so to speak. It's easier to think in general terms. So if you choose an ethnicity or group and generalized them as the "enemy" the masses find that easier to understand. Good example is when I talked to my grandpa about WWII and ISIS. He said that in WWII, the enemy had a face. They were THE JAPS or THE NAZIS. They had uniforms and a special salute. They were easy to spot, so easier to fight. ISIS is harder. They could be anyone, anywhere. They don't have uniforms or salutes. Now look at our border (I'm a native Texan). Many people here just say it's a bunch of Mexicans coming in. That's not true at all. It's people from all over south America. But it's hard for the general public to understand that. So they label them as Mexicans
2	As for groups, people love to think that other people are way more invested and competent than they really are.  It cracks me up!
2	When you align the dots things happen.\n\nJewish media control for most is just a conspiracy, The fact is the vast majority of the American media is Jewish owned.\n\n9/11 has thousands of conspiracy theories behind it. Most people think it was terror and brought down by planes.\n\nThere is some truth to many of the conspiracies listed here [https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/9/11](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/9/11). Not all of them have merit, Most of them don't but do some digging and a significant enough number of them have merit in debunking common held beliefs about the incident. This alone raises more questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact is I don't care about what I am told to be correct. I look at the dots, If they align I have a general gut feeling and I go with it. If the dots at any point stop aligning with new information my opinion changes.\n\nThe world is not what people believe it to be nor is it what they see it to be. It is what it is.
2	The term Conspiracy theory itself was coined to marginalise fringe journalism and narration of alternative events. Strictly to ostracise and shut down the elements of truth and to mitigate risk of exposure by associating poor mental health or life choices with alternative unpopular beliefs. \n\nWith the majority of media censored meanwhile  intelligence leaks or whistle blowing more common, and free discussion or group-think easily accessible through technology, as well as rampant corruption just increasing and easier to turn a blind eye more than ever due to distractions and lack of time.. it’s become alot easier for the “Elite” to play devils advocate and control the theories with a false left/right/alt that explores many half truths and intentionally misleading bullshit or fallacies. Obscurity at its finest.  \n\nIf theres only ONE truth and thus can only be that, the truth(what actually happened in reality.)THEN by speculating or theorising 9 slightly different alternative possibilities, we have effectively gotten ten times further away from that truth. This is modern dissemination 101.
2	Jews learnt many lessons throughout there cultures life. So the culture and sects are much wiser generally speaking. They really do use magic, in the sense of controlling there realities to benefit or suit, and working together to achieve. Freemasons too. There are many factions and they all do really attend and cooperate in a ‘illuminati’. But I dont see why that’s surprising and people aren’t surprised. Culture and tradition has allways been a way to pass on valuable knowledge. Working together as a group to utilise multiple skill sets, to achieve a basic end, (even survival) has allways been what works for us humans.
2	I have thought a lot about this topic, I have spend a good amount of time, like probably 100’s of hours trying to understand this topic, and I think I’ve got a fairly good idea.\nWhen I get back from work I’ll try to write something up, since it will be longer than what I can afford to write on company time. 
1	Most people refuse to accept the most logical and provable conclusion as i know it based on direct research as well.\n\nRich elite intermarried families rule the world- mainly from their banking entities\n, trusts, corporations via interlocking directors, ngos, think tanks, and fake proxies. The media is how they enforce the mind control. They dont like how its being exposed and censorship is rampant. The financial system is based on fraud and these families benefit from the matrix we have as they created it. People need to wake up. They dont care about us.\n\nThis cortez chick is one of their hegelian dialect trojans for example aka a proxy \n

4	30 Struggles All ENTP Personalities Face	I'm going to regret posting this because it puts me on blast and ran me through the so-called "emotional river" pshhh...more like a waterfall. Let's discuss why Mickey Mouse would be a better president than Winnie the Pooh....let's start with this. Mickey had overalls, met Winnie, and cut it up so he could have a shirt...ever think about that? That's a good humanitarian action if I do say and I did. Have fun ✌️\n\n\nhttps://owlcation.com/social-sciences/30-Struggles-All-ENTP-Personalities-Face\n\nFrom Discover on Google
5	If I constantly struggled with all of these things I would have killed myself years ago, lol.\n\nI don’t get or relate to some of these.\n\n>23. They so badly want to get people involved that sometimes they don't see how bad combinations of people could arise. They may also try to cram too many people into one space, table, etc. than is possible for people to have discernible conversations.\n\nNot true for me...at all. I never combine groups of people who I don’t think will get along because then if things get awkward then I am forced to lead the entire situation and make things go smoothly- which also makes me feel stupid because I know people well enough to understand if a certain person will get along with another person in the first place. I don’t run into this issue 95% of the time because I’m very conscious of it- so I definitely wouldn’t say it’s a problem I face.\n\n >24. They will collect people around them that are cool, often neglecting those that may be less fortunate.\n\nI’m struggling to understand what this means or why I should care. I have many, many different types of friends. If by “less fortune” you mean a self-pitying low life who is self-destructive and does nothing, then like...I guess that’s correct? Sorry I don’t want to be around people who I think suck? Idk??\n\nThis article sounds like it was written by an xNFJ.
2	Winnie the pooh is a god in terms of morality and ethics. He is kind to and cares for all, disregarding any grievances and generally unbiased and hard to be bought by corporate money (unless it comes to honey). What he may lack in smarts, piglet can help him as vice president.\n\nMickey on the other hand hasn't always been rainbows and smiles. If you look at the earlier mickey cartoons he's not always a nice guy.\n\nWinnie the pooh has a deeper cultural richness being based in friendly literature from the start.
11	How to stop saying bad jokes?	For some reason I always have the urge to make a joke about everything. And once I've come up with something, no matter how bad it is I can't resist saying it. I know it's harmless but just wanted to know if anyone else ever experienced this.
11	LOL yes \n\nI think, dang I'm hilarious, no one else will think so though, so don't say it....ok but i gotta say it! Someone will get it right?\n\n*crickets*\n\nI guess when you have those moments, just force yourself not to say it lol\n
9	Making bad jokes is how I learn to make good ones. It took trail and error to come up with punch lines other people can actually get.
4	Honestly don't.\n\nNot many people can understand the fine arts of BAD PUNS and stupid jokes. Take pleasure in what you have and annoy the shit out of others.\n\nTbh, it's fun.
3	haha own it man. I do anyway. I've learnt to be serious and mature, but I still like to crack a joke, even if it's something serious. \n\nJokes are a way to say some new idea or offend someone(create a stir), without actually been offensive. 
2	Practice resisting the urge. \n\nThat's really all there is to it, as much as I hate to say so.
2	I have the exact same urge. Once I have the joke in mind it’s gonna come out no matter how much my better angels try to stop it. However, I have much more successes than failures with this socially. I’m pretty fuckin funny tbqh
2	Just go ahead and say it. Helps weed out the types who can't be bothered to figure out what you're going for. Some of my friends think I'm funny, some don't, but my jokes don't go over their heads because they at least understand what I'm going for. (I'm a pun guy :|)
2	I don't have any issues with people not finding my jokes funny, but more with not knowing when to stop with a running gag, particularly with sensors.
2	This is probably one of the most relatable posts I've seen on this subreddit.
1	Just revel in it... 
1	Step one: don’t say bad joke.\nStep two: ...
1	I am the same way with wanting to tell someone. I usually think of them when I’m on the road, being that I am traveling Solar consultant, I think of jokes all the time so I think of it and laugh but I don’t share them with my customers. My wife on the other, she gets to hear them as soon as I think of them. #dadjokesfordays

11	How can I succeed in finding a job as an ENTP?	So the last few years I've had a scattered work history to say the very least.\n\nI left university and started freelancing straight away. Making okay-ish money.\n\nLong story short - I sued one of the companies I worked for and got a decent payout. \n\nI then used some of that payout and free time to set up a video production company (which failed).\n\nAfter rough times, I did a very short stint in a warehouse which confirmed for me that I can NEVER do that kind of work again. EVER. \n\nGot fired 7 days in. \n\nSince last year I've been freelancing in the film / video world again but not making great money. My resume is getting to the point where I get interviews for job roles with $60K salaries (which is pretty good for the film industry at my age)\n\nBut no offers. \n\nI'd say I've had 8 interviews in the past year - 0 offers. \n\nI've probably sent out over 300 applications. Mostly on job sites, or via Linkedin listings.\n\nI know what I want to do - a creative film / commercial producer. \n\nBut as an ENTP I'm starting to think that the typical job hunt route isn't the way for me. \n\nAny advice?
6	300 applications and 8 replies? Maybe that's a starting area of improvement perhaps. Try to make your CV better. Develop some skills that your competition won't have. Should be easy as an ENTP.\n\nThat is just an outsider perspective, I don't know much about your industry and the typical rate at which you get replies.\n\nENTP. Extraverted. Reach out to people personally, see if they know any jobs going. Maybe they could put a word in. I once read somewhere that like 60%(or some other surpassingly high figure) of job positions aren't advertised.\n\n
3	Is stable employment in the creative film and commercial production industr(ies) generally difficult to find? My impression is that many people are freelance.\n\nIt's hard to give advice from an ENTP perspective (IMO) because your situation is so specific. Maybe, for example, there are things you could work on in your interviews. It sounds like you maybe *want* to have an employer, at least for a little bit, before you take the reigns yourself. Therefore, it becomes a question of how to succeed in your job search, rather than what type of role (e.g., having an employer or being self-employed) is better for you. I'm not sure; I can't 100% tell based on your post.\n\nMoreover, what *is* the "typical job hunt route"? You mention sending out over 300 applications, but not networking. In film and television, I would assume that a *lot* of the work available is unadvertised. If you're not networking hardcore, that's what I'd suggest you try next.
3	Why are you relying on online applications? Network my dude. You're an ENTP - you should have the charisma by default. Shoot cold emails, attend network events and maintaining an online portfolio of your work will nab some attention

2	Ento female going through divorce.	After many years of pain and suffering the marriage is in the process of divorce. Any advice? I think I got it but I worry if I supposed to wait longer due to kids.  The past three years all we talk about was calling it off and it is happening so fast and now I am wondering if I supposed to stay few more years until the kids grow a bit older? (Kids 10 and 16). 
6	First of all, I'm terribly sorry for your situation. I hope you are okay.\n\nSecondly, get a lawyer if you don't have one already. Don't be cheap.\n\nThirdly, I think there may be more helpful subreddits than this one wrt a divorce.
3	One, if the kids are old enough to see the tension in your relationship, to  know something isn't right, then they are old enough to handle divorce. Don't delay for their sake, they will only learn negative things from it.\n\nTwo, do not be your own lawyer. Divorce law and asset dissolution is a morass, which is why divorce lawyers are a breed of their own. The amount of emotions that come out in the process can be debilitating, best to have someone to guide you through the practicalities. Since you are the higher earner, you will have more to lose, not to mention all the legal disputation that come under "what is best for the children".\n\nBest of luck\~
1	I’m sorry ENTP for what you’re going through. I hope everything will turn out to be better than you expected and sooner than you think. \n\nIt looks like your relationship is dead. It’s been dead for a while. So, my point is there’s no point in trying to stick by a corpse. Just bury it and move on. Your kids passed the age where this could damage them severely. So, don’t worry about it as long as you sit down with them (both of you) and calmly explain why it is necessary for you to find happiness somewhere else. \n\nThey will understand, if not immediately, with time. \n\nI wish you a happy life ENTP sister. ❤️
1	I agree with counseling. That is where I would start. Thank you. 
1	It's a hard decision to make.  \n\n\nOne thing, I do not know a single person that after even though divorce with perspective of years looks back and is no content with that decision.  \n\n\nPersonally, my parents divorced early in my life and it has always been non issue for me. Neither I heard from other people with divorced parents that the divorce was a problem, unless one of the parents went ballistic with retribution on the other. Divorced children (well adults now) I know who have the biggest problem are the ones where parents decided to keep up appearance until the children grow up. And it's mostly because children are perceptive enough to know that parents wants to divorced and for years they get stuck pretending they don't. Seeing your parents happy apart is always better then seeing your parents miserable but together.
1	Children do better with divorced parents than ones who are unhappily married. Go find some studies. DO NOT worry about your kids in the breakup except for making sure that you and your ex are as polite to one another as possible. Your children know that they are half them and half you, so if you're rude to their other parent, you're insulting half of them and somewhere deep down, they know it.
1	I knew a lady whose parents stayed together for the kids.  She told me she always felt awful about how her parents did that.  She felt like it was her fault they were miserable.  She wished they had separated earlier.  Now this is just one person's experience, and IMO you should do what you feel is best, but there is no rule that says you should stay together.   It may in fact be better for the children in the long run.  I am so sorry you are going through this.  And I agree with the others that you should get a lawyer.  There are possible alimony and custody issues that can go on for years based on what you do now.  Talking with a lawyer can also at the very least help you get more informed about what your options are.
2	Procrastination is not just a matter of willpower or laziness. A new brain-scan study finds that procrastination can occur due to difficulties in valuing outcomes or associating outcomes with tasks.	
7	Not being argumentative	Now, I can generally identify with ENTP traits, besides a huge one: being argumentative.\nI've always been agreeable and I've never really been rebellious. The key causes of this were/are:\n\n-Being afraid of confrontation. I think it's just how my Fe manifests itself. I like online debates/discussions though (even arguments where I argue with an idiot, it's kinda the way I blow off steam)\n\n-Not being very observant. I am usually absorbed in my own head with something I find/found interesting, and just do thing on 'autopilot mode'.\n\n-Having low energy levels\n\n-Things usually work out for me, hence I don't really need to fight the system\n\nAre there other ENTPs who can identify with this? What could be the reason?
7	I think that what lays beyond "being argumentative" is being triggered by logical and intelectual discoveries. Being agreeable or having low energy levels seem to be just a side effect of a life experience.\n\nBecause of some problems that I've had in childhood, I also tend to keep quiet in open discussions, but always searching for a logical conclusion in what is being discussed. Maybe, like me, the way that you grew up (bullying, relationship with your parents) is the cause of insecurities. \n\nOr whatever, I am not quite sur
6	I've become a lot less argumentative over time, as I've gotten older. I'll generally only argue with someone these days if I think there's actually a point to the argument, I can learn something, or I'm seriously bored. \n\nI don't think every ENTP is super argumentative all the time either. Based on what you said, it sounds like you're maybe actually processing a bit of the argument inside your head instead of bringing it to the other person (which sounds like TiNe rather than NeTi, or maybe an ENTP with better-developed Fe).  
3	I think you just reach a point where you understand that people are really not that interested in original thought and so you just learn to have the conversation with yourself in your head. 
2	i don‘t really discuss with people. i just add my opinion and tell people to do whatever they want with it. or ask lots of questions to make sure myself and the person infront of me actually *understands* the topic. but it‘s not really a debate, i just need to get my opinion out if i see logical inconsistencies and if someone attempts to argue i‘ll just go yeah sure whatever

10	Getting a useless degree and then whining about debt/unemployment	Let's have a discussion, ENTP style, about a controversial topic that many people get upset talking about.\n\nI see this trend a lot. People get mad that they now have 200k in debt from getting a college degree and are unable to find a job in their major. The usual antagonists are the state of education or societal expectations. Of course, the fault is never on them for choosing an oversaturated field. Apparently the rules of life state that getting ANY degree means you WILL get a job in your field.\n\nNow, for comparison, I would like to share a personal story. I recently paid $2k for a bird identification course, which promised a certificate and a job in my field upon completion. When I finished the course, I received my certificate in the mail, but could find no job identifying birds. As this is a commonly required skill in all industries, I was shocked, and began ranting to everyone how unfair the system is that I spent 2000 entire dollars, with nothing to show for it.\n\n/s, sarcasm rant over.\n\nDo people seriously think that going to college is a rite of passage and not an investment? You put money in, and expect money out of it. \n\nFor example, teachers make ~$38k out of college. Starting salary for those without a degree is ~$30k. Average cost of college for public 4 year in-state school is $25k per year. This means the cost of college if you don't work while in school is (25k * 4 years (school) + 30k * 4 years (missed wages)) = $220k. Yearly wage difference = 8k. Time when a teaching degree becomes "worth it" (220k/8k) = 27.5 years. (Obviously this doesn't take into account raises, but with a similar base salary, the yearly wage increase difference wouldn't be too large. This also assumes the student doesn't work while in school, which as a teacher, is required for at least the last year due to usually required unpaid student teaching. Also assumes 0% interest rate for school loan.)\n\nNow I understand that some people really want to be teachers (or physiologists or math professors or any other oversaturated field), but if that's the case, the person should expect to be poor and have an incredibly long period where their degree is financially a hindrance more than a benefit. Whining and complaining about not making money/having huge debt/etc is really dumb, because the person should go into college expecting the outcome of debt. Expecting any other outcome is ridiculous. \n\nAnyways, what do you guys think? Should people go to college with unrealistic expectations about job placements and be frustrated afterwards? Does getting a degree in a field require the government to make more jobs for these grads, even though simple supply/demand logic means these grad's skills might be less useful than they think?
9	Getting a degree does not entitle you to a job, I thought that was common knowledge. Particularly if you are getting average grades and don’t do anything particularly remarkable during your time there. \n\nIn specific areas of study, the amount of places offered per year should be capped based on the amount of jobs actually available. My understanding is that is usually the case. Subjects that are broad and applicable to many professions would be hard to regulate, and would probably struggle most with unemployment. \n\nGranted, I am primarily thinking of students in areas such as Psychology and Geography, who typically need to gain a Masters to get anywhere specific. I can think of a few Arts subjects that would have an even harder time finding employment. But, people are typically aware that their chosen subjects might be difficult to find employment in. If you go ahead with it anyway, that’s really on you. 
7	>Does getting a degree in a field require the government to make more jobs for these grads, even though simple supply/demand logic means these grad's skills might be less useful than they think?\n\nI think some onus should be on universities to do a better job of connecting... let's just call them non-STEM grads, really, with the job market. You can come out with a humanities or social sciences degree with many transferable skills. Obviously, a lot of that is up to the graduate themselves, and graduates should be able to take some initiative to market themselves as well. However, it'd be great if, instead of just teaching Virginia Woolf or whatever, there were more courses in business writing or technical writing or networking sessions helping to connect young English majors to publishing houses. (I don't know exactly; I wasn't an English grad.)\n\nFWIW, my undergraduate degree was in philosophy. I took the very predictable route of going to law school and becoming a lawyer. However, I've never regretted my degree in philosophy. I'm so incredibly grateful for the analytical tools it gave me. Had I not chosen to go to law school, I'm certain my philosophical education would have helped me succeed in myriad career paths, if employed correctly. \n\nFrom philosophy, I learned how to be a clear and concise writer; I learned how to identify and question different logical and argumentative fallacies; I became very good at certain types of research, as well as a far more critical thinker; et cetera. (Also, I learned how to name-drop Wittgenstein during arguments to sound smarter, such wow.) Quite a few people from my undergrad program went on to become lawyers. One or two are pursuing a career in academic philosophy (poor bastards, but doing genuinely interesting work). There are some building careers in politics and others who have gone into business and/or consulting. An ex-boyfriend of mine went into intelligence. \n\nAt the same time, of *course* I know those people who got the non-STEM degrees and are massively underemployed. Usually, they recognize that it's their own lack of initiative that stagnated them, because they're failing to launch while their peers are succeeding. However, their failures have less to do with whatever skills (or lack thereof) they took from their degree, and more to do with their social skills.
6	Of course it's not sensible to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a degree without a concrete plan of how that degree is going to benefit you financially, but the people typically making these decisions aren't even old enough to vote yet. The problem is a system that asks kids with very little life experience and limited information to make extremely costly and consequential decisions that will impact their entire lives.
5	I absolutely agree with you, however when you're a young 18 y/o getting out of highschool every single person has told you for your whole life "Go to college and get a degree, it's the only way to succeed". I literally heard asinine stuff like "it doesn't matter which degree you get, a person with a degree is always on a whole different level", which is absolute stupidity^2 , not only you've wasted a lot of money but you also have 4-6 years less of full-time experience that you could have acquired on the meantime.\n\nMy advice is to give little attention to "your vocation", which is a flawed concept in itself, because people change a lot after 18 y/o and because there's no higher power that determines some kind of special job for everyone which will make them happy and will make them successful at their field. If you're going to college, pick something that will pay itself in a short time or you're better learning a trade, bootcamp or something else that wont waste 4-6 years of your life and disturbing amounts of money. That means no gender studies, philosophy, arts, astronomy, etc.
3	> For example, teachers make ~$38k out of college. Starting salary for those without a degree is ~$30k.\n\nHow many people without a degree have full-time jobs which provide full benefits, union protection, 'tenure', 3 months off, and a pension, like that teacher's job?   Moreover at a private school you can *easily* make 50k to start and if you have more advanced degrees in a wanted field (like chemistry or mathematics) you can make $100k a year teaching at elite prep schools. \n\nThere's more to this analysis than simple wage differences, but your overall point is nevertheless a good one.   If you're not planning to go onto grad school, many undergraduate degrees, including many STEM ones, are a giant waste of time -- psychology, biology, etc.\n\nAnd if you plan on being an academic in the humanities, you better to go a top 20 grad program for your Ph.D. or else you're going to be a 'visiting professor' for a *long* time -- or wind up teaching at a community college which is basically like slavery. 
2	I go to a tTrade school so I cant really relate, but i also know the 4 year college system is extreamly messed up. 
2	> Does getting a degree in a field require the government to make more jobs for these grads, even though simple supply/demand logic means these grad's skills might be less useful than they think?\n\nThere is an easier way to solve this issue then creating jobs. Biggest problem with for profit education is that the degrees, no matter which ones, can swell in numbers. And in some degrees the number of students admitted should be limited because of volume of demand. Governments in plenty of countries do that.  \n\n\nI did one of my BAs (it was in Arts) in a country with very limited amount of students admitted per year.  A year would have around 10 students in class, and the entry exams would have anywhere between 130 to 400 people trying to get in. Pretty good system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat kept the number of art educated folk quite small so that the industry had space for both self made people and university educated without people having trouble getting jobs. Sure, there were always be some people that couldn't get a job but it was minority.
2	No degree gives you a job, most fields are already oversaturated. But it's most often prerequisite to any job. They want you to have a degree and then comes the rest. \nI currently need to decide what to major in too,and it ain't easy.  The best decision would be to go into STEM field but I was never good at math and I probably wouldn't make it. I'm interested into cognitive science and I think about majoring in it, with more narrow specialization in AI, but it's certainly not something that is a guarantee of job. I could work in UX probably tho. Nothing else comes to mind, so it's not so easy to just go into what is good for money when you know you don't have necessary skills 
2	I agree with you 100%. I feel that if someone consciously made a choice such as going into a field with as much competition as teaching they should have been aware of the repercussions of that choose.
1	Why should teachers be poor?\n\nSeriously ask yourself why a job that requires education that serves us is one we think shouldn't have a good standard of living.\n\nIt's not 'natural market forces' because they're paid by the state.  So why?\n\nPlus secondary education as a whole functions to better us and society.  And honestly, many high schoolers are told if they don't immediately go to college they'll lose whatever grants and scholarships they could get. At least that's how it was as recently as 2012 when my sister graduated high school.\n\nThough mostly, I don't know why you think the problem is with individual actions when the system at large is the problem.  Why has college ballooned in cost? Why have wages stagnated?  Working part time in the 70s could pay for school.  Now if you worked full time even for $15/hr, you wouldn't be able to afford room and board at many state universities.  It's fucking bonkers.

I can't stand anyone that would lower himself from a prized rocketscientist to a dramatized pop culture icon. What a freakin joke. Empty your dookey-bucket already.
2	Career advice	Like many entps I’m having difficulty on figuring out a career. I graduated college a year and a half ago and I’ve already had three different jobs (not including my internship). I’m pretty passionate about fitness and I’ve been fixated on trying out the military and/or perhaps firefighting but I also would like to continue my education. From everything I’ve read we entps don’t do well in a highly structured environments and we enjoy freedom. I’m just looking for some advice on how to go about this. Apparently engineering is a preferred field for entps but I’ve experienced the engineering work place and it isn’t my cup of tea. Thanks guys.

12	interesting article about delaying matters and errors (si)	A brain that delays: do people with procrastination learn less about mistakes?\n\n...
2	A brain that delays: do people with procrastination learn less about mistakes?\n\nPeople with procrastination - people who used to postpone important matters "for tomorrow" - process their mistakes differently than people who do not hesitate. This was shown in brain studies by Polish neurobiologists.\n\nThe deadline for taking part in your dream competition is tomorrow, and you have not yet started submitting your application? The slogan "what do you do today, do it tomorrow!" are you very close? Maybe you are struggling with procrastination?\n\n"Procrastination is an irrational postponing of previously planned activities despite the awareness that this leads to later discomfort or stress" - explained Dr. Marek Wypych from the Brain Imaging Institute of the Experimental Biology Institute in an interview with PAP. M. Nencki in Warsaw. The scientist with the team checks whether the brains of people with procrastination work differently than the brains of people who are unfamiliar with this approach.\n\nWHAT IS MORE ABOUT THE PROJRADMENT?\n\nDr Wypych says that there are probably various mechanisms related to procrastination. Research has already shown, for example, that half of people with ADHD have to deal with such a delay. "These people are due to attention disorders" - comments the scientist.\n\nIt is also known that sometimes procrastination may be related to the regulation of emotions. "People who procrastinate under the influence of negative emotions postpone even more: If such a person is stressed that they are not studying, he delays the education even more, and if he is afraid that he is seriously ill, the more he reluctantly visits the doctor" - says the scientist.\n\nHe adds that for some, procrastination goes hand in hand with perfectionism. "If I set the bar too high, it paralyzes me, and when I put the task down, I have an excuse that my work is not perfect, because I did it at the last minute" - says the scientist.\n\nIt seems that among people with procrastination, there are more often people who are looking for impressions (it can not be hidden that sending the PIT last April at five to twelve provides additional emotions). This, however, turned out to be a mistake. Research has shown that there is almost no correlation between procrastination and sensation-seeking.\n\nIt has also been shown that procrastination and impulsiveness go hand in hand (scientifically: there is a positive correlation between them). Impulsivity is a tendency to take action (and in the case of procrastination, giving up on planned activities) under the influence of a momentary impulse.\n\nWITH BRAKES EVERYTHING IS OK?\n\nResearchers from Nencki decided to check for people with procrastination braking mechanism. Researchers expected that people postpone things for later will have weaker results in the braking task, because it is harder for them to stop the impulse to address something else than they should.\n\nIn the first experiment, the surveyed students performed the so-called task go / no-go. The experiment shows two types of stimuli. The task of the subject is to press the button when he sees one stimulus and not to press when he sees the second stimulus. The first stimulus, however, appears frequently and the second one sporadically. When the second stimulus appears, the respondent must refrain from pressing the button.\n\nThis study showed that there were no great differences in this "inhibition" between those with and without procrastination. It was not until the detailed analysis of the results that something interesting was noticed. Well, between the groups there were differences in how people reacted to their own mistakes. Particularly, it was about some cases - where for each mistake financial fines were calculated (subtracted a bit from the sum that the respondent received for participation in the study).\n\nNOT EVERYONE LEARN FROM ERRORS\n\nIt turned out that people who did not have a problem with postponing after each mistake they made needed a little more time for the next answer. It's so-called slowdown after error (post-error slowing). This is interpreted as the additional work that the brain does to process information about the mistake. This is an important moment in the process of learning from your own mistakes. Meanwhile, in the group of procrastinated subjects, there was no such a slowdown after the error - some even gave the error "kopa" and made further attempts faster.\n\nTo more accurately check what is happening right after making the mistake, it was decided to investigate this phenomenon using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This study shows which areas of the brain are more active for a given task. In fMRI, a go / no study was also performed, and in one of the conditions the subjects were punished for errors. And indeed, it has been observed that after committing a mistake in procrastinating people and non-brains, it works differently. Research is still being published.\n\n"In people with a tendency to delay, the activity of the anterior cingulate (ACC) after the error is lower than in people who do not postpone," the scientist summarizes. As reported, the same effects were observed in similar experiments carried out among people struggling with addictions..
57	I feel uncomfortable when I hear about the geniuses of our time..for some reason.	When I hear someone tell stories about Richard Feynman and his personality or Leonardo Da Vinci's great work. I get “annoyed lol in a sense that I wish I was like that. \n\nI don’t know what it is, it’s like a fear of never succeeding and never reaching excellence. It’s a feeling of me inevitably ending up as mediocre. And the pain and struggles as well as genetically factor to being an intellectual elite is something I’m afraid I will never be able to reach.\nI’m currently 17 years old and I’m honestly scared of the future.
40	I’m sorry if this sounds harsh but not a lot of individual have what it takes to become intellectual elites. I don’t know if you do or don’t but I do know that if you set your mind to it you can become very knowledgeable with time. 
15	I’m 18. I’ve had thoughts similar to this. It’s more of a thing where I am mad at myself for not achieving the great things they’ve done at the same age as me. It drives me crazy, and forces me to constantly adjust my behavior (thinking that if I force myself to have habits that I think those I envy possess, I will eventually find some of the same success as them). Just do your best you can right now, do everything you can to self induce success. Do not allow yourself to live in regret. Do your future self a favor!
8	Leonardo wasn't seen as an intellectual elite for most of his life. People see artists as largely dumbasses in his time . Additionally, Leonardo hated painting lol. He hated michaelangelo too, that guy was INTJ AF. Right after the last supper, some moron got jeolous and tried to sue him for sodomy lol. He was not guilty but it damaged his reputation. The guy just wanted to sell his seige weapons man. Most cities rejected it so a large part of his life he felt like a failure and procrastinated. \nHe canceled on so many rich merchants who wanted their portrait painted too. He did some here and there because he was broke. Normally He bailed on them and got sued. Didn't care.\n\nIf you want to know his secret, first know this; He died thinking he failed god and mankind...next to the king of france.\n Similar to how you're feeling lol. He only completed mona lisa (he probably thinks he could've painted better). Last supper i think he thought was was a failed job...because he painted it early in his life. Anyways, he left behind alot of scrap books that meant nothing because he was too ahead of his time. It's sad because he never knew how important they were in the 1900s.\n\nHe had no formal schooling. So he spent alot of time learning the fundamentals just to "get" it. That's a blessing in disguise. Hint hint. Most of the quotes you find of him on the internet are about battling procrastination lol.
10	Try to ignore where the outcome might bring you. Fall in love with the process, for whatever it is you decide to do. An outcome orientation will only cause you pain in life - and each successful outcome will only set the bar higher.\n\nLove the process. Love what you do. Don't fall in love where you might end up.\n\nI say this as someone aiming extremely high. I just got funding for a healthcare clinic at 27, am interviewing physicians twice my age. I find myself worrying about the outcome now that I'm close, and my life has gotten worse as a result of that worrying. This is not easy advice to follow, as easy as it is to say to others.
8	You sound a lot like me.\n\nI'll tell you what I realized, that finally gave me some peace of mind: There's no way of knowing unless you try. So why not just assume you are, and then get on with the steps needed to get there?\n\nI guess you could call it positive fatalism.
4	>The chance of having tremendous success is very small for any individual, we are the beneficiaries of a lot of luck as well as hard work and perhaps a tiny bit of talent. The fact is most of us here loved what we did and that carries you through failures.\n\nA Nobel Prize Laureate, a physicist I believe, said that.\n\nThis quote calmed my inner yearning for fame, and it is probably as burning or even more so than yours.\n\nWhat you can, and should do, for now, is work hard at something you do well and enjoy doing. If you still don't know what that is then excel at the controversial stuff.\n\nGet the highest GPA possible. Go to the best school possible. Get the best internships. Participate in the best competitions.\n\nBy then you'll probably figure out what you like & how good you are, hard work gives you a sense of scale because you have so many references to objectively evaluate yourself.\n\nIf you need more reading this is the best guide I found, and I read a ton of them: [https://80000hours.org/career-guide/](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/)
3	Here's the thing. None of those great people of history are remembered for going through their life self-obsessedly worrying about how great they would be. They charged into the world and did things, and they worked hard at them and were passionate and interested and deeply, deeply obsessed, and through some combination of practice, passion, opportunity, and perspective, they discovered or did something that touched and inspired and made a mark on the lives of a ton of other people, for which they're now remembered.\n\nSo don't obsess about success and excellence, don't be insecure about mediocrity, don't be petty and envious. That will never bring you anything but paralysis and pain. Shut that shit down and focus.\n\nLook at the world. Discover and learn as much as you can, try things, do things because they're interesting and because you can, and don't get discouraged if you suck at them especially when you start out because you can't expect yourself to know what you can't possibly know. Learn from your experiences, always do better the next time, and work on improving yourself one day at a time. You'll find lots of things that are interesting, lots of things that you're good at, lots of things that other people like and find valuable, and sometimes you'll find things that are great overlaps of these categories and worth focusing on.\n\nSome day down the line you might know a ton about a small bunch of stuff that's rare, cool and exceptional, a little bit about a wide variety of stuff that you've tried, absorbed, experienced or heard about kinda and can look up and find deeper knowledge about at the touch of a few buttons. Plus you might find you have the ability, honed by experience, of picking up something you have no experience with  and learning about it and getting better at it faster than many people learn within their own chosen fields.\n\nAnd eventually, you might take one of those things that you know pretty much as well as humanity as a whole has ever known it, or a bunch of things that are known separately, and discover something new within it, or a new way of putting known things together that opens a whole new world of possibilities for humanity. When you hit that, history might remember you. And if it never happens, doesn't the rest still sound pretty exceptional and awesome?\n\nIt starts with your attitude. Are you going to self-obsess about your ego and image and compare yourself to others, or are you going to focus on learning and discovering what you can, understanding as much as you can, and doing whatever's within your power to improve yourself and live your best life?\n\nYou can't build a castle on dreams and clouds, and laying bricks is hard, slow, and doesn't look much like your dream, but if you lay a brick every single day, over a longer timespan you'll see it take shape.\n\nSource: currently trying to lead a pretty exceptional and awesome life, and sometimes doing pretty good at that.
3	I'm in my early 30's and my early teens through late 20's were significantly influenced by a deep-seated fear of mediocrity. At worst, this has manifested as paralyzing perfectionism. At best, it has driven me to finish large, multi-year projects. These projects  now form the basis of an intellectual and technological canon that has made major impacts on my field and spun off startups. But let me tell you, finishing these projects ranged from annoying to excruciating. At worst, this fear has caused me to break off friendships and relationships that don't serve my goals. I've matured a lot since then and now recognize that success in life comes in many forms and the metrics for a good life are wildly different among the realms of work, creativity, friendship and love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point is that this fear you are experiencing can be immensely useful. There's energy and interest towards creation and achievement somewhere deep inside you and channeling this can yield truly exciting life experiences and meaningful results. I think most poorly-developed ENTPs (including myself at various times in my life) have immense amounts of creative, interpersonal, and visionary energy that can be both productive or destructive. Channeling this energy was the challenge of my life at your age, but it was worth it. Good luck.
3	success is a combination of intelligence AND hard work. a lot of people only have one part of this recipe down. if you can knock out both, you're already ahead of the competition.
3	Three words. Reading is power. If you can understand that and put in the work it takes to build oneself. You will realize knowledge is vast and scary.\n\nYou are in a library playing a game of chess, the people are the pieces and you are the only one who knows how to play.\n\nLove, intent, Psychology, eloquent manipulation, understanding, freedom, living live, respect, mystery.\n\nPlay the game\n\n
6	Why tho. Arrogant to compare yourself to them. Live your life. who cares if you're recognized after you die
2	Same with me. I really want to do something extraordinary and to  finally show how awesome I am to the peasants that wronged me. \n\nJokes aside, I know how you feel and I have the similar problem, like I have to live up to the world's expectations (although the world doesn't really care) and do something smart, inventive. I would really like to change the world with my brain. That's why I am learning how to code, so one day, I could, perhaps, make at least a small change.\n\nIf I don't do make something new, or at least improve something that already exists, or discover something marvelous, I would probably feel like I failed and my ego would be insulted. (That's bad.)\n\nThe cycle of discovery and making the change would probably go like this:\n1) Idea\n2) Analyze in my head\n3) Start doing it\n4) Continue the analysis\n5) Continue doing it\n6) Figuring out it is dumb/ Forget about the idea\n7) New Idea\n8) The previous cycle repeats\n9) You think you have no purpose\n10) You think you failed\n11) No more ideas\n12) The new idea\n13) The cycle repeats\n\nBUT\n\n\nIn one N-th (Ne-th) moment, if the idea is good, it would soon become the reality and you would be proud of yourself. Just. Try. Hard. \n\nWell, this is a long comment, I went all over the place, I am bored so I need to slap people with words, until the cycle starts. 😁
2	Geniuses are people who immerse themselves in specialized work. The most impressive among them are those that find multiple specializations. Whatever innate factors are involved in the development of a genius are unclear and of questionable significance... Geniuses are generally determined by circumstance, and you can see that clearly when you look at the early lives of any of those famous people. It's not that they're neurologically superior, it's that they got really, really good at certain things and when you look at the time they spent at work it makes a little more sense.\n\nChristopher Michael Langan enjoyed a level of fame for being "the smartest man alive", for his IQ and mathematical prowess. I read some of his writings on metaphysics, and it was just a bunch of schizophrenic, self contradicting garbage aimed at a hypothesis that's been written better a hundred different ways hundreds of years ago as far as philosophy goes. The reach of a genius' genius does not extend very far beyond the domain of whatever kind of work earned them the title. When someone like Da Vinci is good at a bunch of different things it's often because they developed methods that apply to different things.\n\nI've heard it said before that there are no lazy geniuses. They aren't given excellence, they obtain it through work. If you want to be one of the "intellectual elite" then you should get off Reddit and study something.
2	I'm almost 21 and I still have this. I don't understand why most comments here are so pessimistic. Like, oh don't worry about it, you would have to be veeeery intelligent and this is very unlikely, so maybe just accept that you'll have mediocre life.\n\nI would advise you to take professional IQ test. If this bothers you so much, you can have straight answer and just stop thinking about it. Also, even if you're not in this 0,01% - who cares? Feynman and Da Vinci are typed as ENTPs, so you don't have to worry about not having right personality. As I know, Feynman's IQ was like 120? 130? It's not that much. Intelligence isn't some magic card that guarantee you exactly the life you want. It's hard work. Really. Take Elon Musk for example- he's very intelligent, of course, but as I read, he's also very hard working. Very very hard working. So this is the thing you would have to change. Just start doing things you want. Or if you don't know what you want, just do something challenging, something is always better than sitting and thinking whether you're good enough. Also, take into account that they lived in different times, so it's hard to compare yourself to them and that they had different childhood and it's very likely that all great people had in a way easier start. For example, I think Feynman's father made so much easier to his son to accomplish what he did. Feynman often said, that his father taught him a lot, encourage him to learn, show beauty of science etc. So you should check people around you. Change your circle of friends on people who would inspire you, make you better.\n\nIt's your life. You only have one. And honestly, it would be a shame if you'd give up, without even trying. When I was 17-18, I had pretty bad existencial crisis. I concluded, that it's impossible for me to change something in the world, that I'm not good enough and stuff, what's the point. I stopped pursuing my goals and I really regret this. Anyway, you're not alone in this, just wanted to let you know. And please, don't repeat the same mistakes as me and most people - accepting their shitty lifes and live in misery.\n\nOh, and you can watch some of Jordan Peterson lectures, I think it would be helpful.\n\n\*sorry for bad english (especially grammar), not native\*
2	I think a lot of people who want to become famous/billionaires/geniuses or to get in some sort of elite are actually looking for some sort of recognition from society, maybe even love. It’s like you’re asking society for the permission to exist, “if I have this social recognition then I’m definitely one of those who deserve to stay on the planet right?”. I know I did when I was your age (I scored ENTP back then, now ENFP btw).\n\nYou definitely can build a good life worth living for yourself if you work hard at something you don’t hate. “So good they can’t ignore you” was a wonderful reading for me and I recommend it very much for Ne users.\n\nSorry if I’m reading my own shit into your story, I’m just genuinely trying to help. Bottom line is that it’s very common to feel lost at your age. Hell I’m 23 and I feel like three kids on top of each other in a trench coat among adults!\nBut you’ll carve your way into life. Internet hugs!\n
2	Don't waste your time trying to achieve something bigger then you all the time. Follow your interest and refine your craft, you can only go up. Being worried about not being up to your current standards and punishing yourself for it by lamenting will only get in the way of actually achieving what you want and that's not really productive. We aren't born masters.
2	Your worth does not come from what you accomplish.
2	you'll go nowhere if you resent people for their abilities and accomplishments.\n\nand i agree with the other comment. most people don't have even a slim chance of being as influential or educated as true geniuses.
1	Feynman and Da Vinci are in the top 0.01% when it comes to intellectual achievement. That's a pretty unrealistic standard to set for yourself. You, me and 99.99% of the population won't  ever achieve that, so don't worry about being on their level.\n\nNow, if you don't want to be mediocre, that's great! But how about you aim for the top 10% instead of the top 0.001%. That's still good and certainly not "medicore", and if you make this your goal and actually work  hard at it you should get it easily.
1	Those people are incredibly rare, and you may never be like them. That doesn't mean you won't be excellent, however.\n\nIt's still very much possible to become an expert in your field (if that's what you want), study a PHd, or become good at doing something to a very high standard. You just might not be famous for it.\n\nBecause you're 17, try every activity and topic you can. Find something you can have fun doing, and you're reasonably decent at. Go from there.\n\nI have the same anxiety about not being well respected and earning shit tons of money and contributing to society in a big way, but you don't have to invent the next hadron collider or anything! Making a lot of small contributions is equally valuable, so just try your best at every little task :)
1	Unless you were born in the top 0.01% within intelligence levels and not doing anything with it, there's no real reason for you to be frustrated.
1	I noticed you acknowledged some arrogance towards the matter. I've learned that putting others before one's self, helping them achieve their potential (in a healthy way) will bring you satisfaction. Most things get done in teams, helping others equates to helping one's self. All things you do are in the pursuit of helping others - in the future, or the present. (really helps to lift a lot of the pressure in this temporary life)
1	i get the eschewing of mediocrity.  I said some harsh things to my dad when i was your age because of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never found it in the way I sought, but I find comfort being extraordinary in the lives of people around me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	I definitely agree. Seeing people who are more accomplished than me makes me reminds me of my own shortcomings, which ends up inspiring me to work harder.
1	the wonders of fearing failure, limits, and not being the best.
1	The sort of specialisation or "genius" levels you seek come from commitment and industriousness.\n\nAlthough I think an ENTP is very capable of this, Finding his or her calling is difficult. Sticking to it is even more difficult.\n\nIf it makes you feel uncomfortable change it. If your situation allows find your passion and dedicate the time to become an expert in that field.\n\nMy passion for example is being lazy. So I am already an expert. I just need to find a way to market my expertise.
1	This resonates with me. Elon is probably the best example of the modern day Renaissance Man. All you can do put yourself on the right path. The success is all relative. Surround yourself with other people as crazy ambitious as you. That’s the key IMO. It’s like the story of the founding members of PayPal.
1	Humble brag warning\n\nI  used to experience the same thing. It was uncomfortable and embarrassing because it wasn’t unclear where the annoyance came from. Until few years ago I had no reason to think that I was particularly intelligent, other than a nagging feeling that I was. Seeing other people recognized for their intelligence was frustrating to me. I felt arrogant and I hated it. Then I was unexpectedly accepted at Harvard. Ever since then the uncomfortable feeling has diminished. Now I’m thinking that maybe I was annoyed because I subconsciously knew that people underestimated my intelligence. Maybe that’s true for you too OP. \n\nUsing a throwaway since talking about Harvard makes me uncomfortable. 
1	u know, i felt like that a lot when i was your age (only 2-3 years ago) but trust me, it starts to get better once u go to college and find ur niche :)
1	Same here. Always scared of being mediocre 
1	You’re currently 17 and worried about not achieving....let me set your mind at ease for a second \n\nA) You’re 17 years old...you have so much time in your life to improve. Use the fear to motivate you- that’s what I did to put myself through school, get two fairly difficult degrees, attend an ivy league program all through my own money that I saved working through college. I’m not bragging - the work came from straight fear of non achieving. \n\nYou hear about people who do stuff all the time but you never hear about the constant struggle, mental breakdowns, times where you wish you would break an ankle not to go to school/work because you’re exhausted, the constant getting every small illness that passes you by, missing out on fun stuff etc.\n\nB) You’re 17, decide now what you want to excel in and decide what habits you need to instill to get you there. If you need help figuring those out, PM me.
1	Do what you love. Never fall in ignorance, and let yourself be yourself at all times. It doesn't matter if you are able to succeed or not, because the path that normally leads to high ambitions will always give you some source of success. My philosophy teacher always said that if you want a 80% in an exam for example, you should always aim for 100%. And so on. Do not be scared.

1	All these people worked incredibly hard and sacrificed many worldly pleasures to achieve what they did. You have to be willing to do the same if you wish to follow in their footsteps. There is no easy path to greatness. 
1	What do you envision for the future?  \n  \nCrazy nanotech?
0	When someone tells you they're vegetarian and you cant help but go into debate mode level 99	I always feel like vegetarians/vegans are easy targets(sorry) and almost always willing to go full lengths to protect their views. \n\nAnd for that, I love vegans/vegetarians.
5	Factory farming is an awful, cruel practice worth ending just for that.\n\nAlso I think anybody who eats meat should slaughter and butcher it themselves at least once.  We're too separated from the process.  Know how many times I've talked to someone who loves chicken but recoiled at me talking about slaughtering and plucking one?  Or people who love pork but feel uncomfortable with me talking about dispatching and shaving a pig for a roast?  Or hell even while eating venison jerky, made from the muscle fiber of one of the limbs the doe used to try to run away from me after I shot her, people don't want to put together animal and meat.  It's especially strange in English, where from the Norman nobility we say venison (hunted meat), beef and pork, but for the animals the common Anglo-Saxons had to deal with we get deer, cow and pig.\n\nPeople don't want to face the realities of where their meat comes from.
-4	I recently came up with an argument against vegetarianism.\n\nSo, they don't want to eat animals because they think it's wrong to enslave them and murder them, right? They say animals should be free, right?\n\nWhat about enslaving and murdering plants? Plants are also alive. Plants also have a **will** to live. And we control them in the same way or even more than we control animals. They say what right we have to kill an animal and eat its flesh. Well, I say what right do they have to decide that animals are more important than plants? Why should they tell us what we can and what we can't kill but we can't tell them to shut the fuck up and leave us cold blooded flesheaters alone. I will eat anything that can be eaten and NOBODY will stop me. 
22	ENTPs and depression	What does a depressive episode look like for you?\n\nI’ve consistently had seasonal depression growing up but I didn’t know I had it due to the fact that I had a skewed idea of what depression was. I envisioned it as crying all the time to be honest but that’s never been the case for me. \n\nFor me, I can never really tell if I’m depressed WHILE I’m depressed... I can only tell after an episode has ran its course. I get very fatigued, mental blocked, apathetic, detached, stubborn and strangely head strong. After a series of self sabotage, I can usually determine that I wasn’t acting in my typical frame of mind. \n\nI’ve read that depressed ENTPs act like INTJs. 
17	The worst episodes for me have had me unable to force myself to do anything. Even social media. It’s pretty debilitating. I’ve had some emotional moments—always dealing with some messed up view of life with my Si going crazy. I get out of it by focusing on solutions with my Ti. And if there’s a brain chemistry component to it, you gotta address that, too.
9	Re: Depressed ENTPs acting like INTJs: This was me for a long time. Not necessarily typical depression symptoms but when I was younger and not great at forming social connections, I tested as an INTJ and was pretty down usualy because I didn't have a lot of close friends (and therefore, as I know today, no one to really stretch the legs of Ne with). These days, when I get in that mood, I force myself to interact with other people, especially people with whom I know I will have a good engaging conversation (hate to perpetuate the stereotype but for me these people are rarely Sensors). It's funny because when I was doing this quasi-INTJ thing as a kid/teenager, I was way more conscientious/hardworking in school and didn't really give my parents too much trouble about chores, staying out late, etc. Then when I decided I was going to make friends and have fun, the conscientiousness fell off and I slacked a little bit in college haha.\n\ntl;dr my lived experience, FWIW, agrees with the depressed ENTP -> pseudo-INTJ idea.
6	I agree that it's really hard to identify a depressed ENTP. I don't actually know any ENTPs who've been depressed before, so I can only speak to my own experience. I've seen a lot of highly *stressed* ENTPs, but that's something different from depression.\n\nI've been depressed before, but as the result of other medication (birth control, etc.), so my experience was a little different. I literally felt like I was going crazy - I just couldn't stop crying or thinking about walking into traffic. It was like an alien had beamed into my brain and was sending crazy thoughts or something. (Not in a "voices" kind of way, but in a "this is so unlike me and has no logical basis whatsoever" kind of way.)\n\nAs soon as I stopped taking the medications, the side effects (i.e., depression) terminated pretty quickly as well. \n\nIn any case, I can believe that depressed ENTPs act like INTJs. We turn more inward, I guess, and close ourselves off from all the possibilities that we're usually so excited about. I act like an INTJ at my most unhappy, at least.
3	I have a thing I like to call the "faceplant", where I'll be skipping along and maintaining a relatively positive rhythm and some little thing or even a memory will hit me in a soft spot and I'll basically crash into the ground and stay there. There will be nothing I want to do except lie down somewhere and listen to sad music, if that, and perhaps daydream about being able to express my problems to the people I know in spite of the fact that I have zero desire to when I'm actually with them. In the deepest episodes I can't enjoy music either, and I can't take solace in anything except imagination. I'll usually just get really high and wait for a new day, where I'm able to find something to bounce into and forget myself somewhat. I work hard against depression in my own way and I try my best not to indulge it.
3	I just stop caring.  I don't care if I need to go to work.  I don't care about diet, or working out, or anything like that.  I just sort of ... stall.
3	As someone who is recovering from one, i can totally say is acting like an INTJ, i went trough a really bad breakup and somehow  ended in a date with a girl few weeks later, i wasn't in a good place and normally in dates as i guess we all ENTP are, we get our charm full on, and are like full of witty answers and proposing "poptarts are ravioli fight me" plots so the other person is laughing and it works, normally it works. \n\nThis time was different, I didn't feel like putting all of this energy outside, and it wasn't shyness. I guess it was like there was no wit on me, I mean i could still make some clever points but it wasn't me, the normal me, it's an awful feeling. \n\nSorry for any mistake, english is not my native.
2	Depression to me is like when Frodo touches the ring and he gets all fucked up. Like the knowledge that the other side exists and is so close to my reality is always there. It's a weight.\nSometimes I'll realize I'm in an episode, via a eureka moment. Like I notice I gained ten pounds, or can't run 3 miles, or have been going to bed early every night. I'm older and have been through cycles a lot, so I try to snap out of it at that point with conscious effort. Anhedonia is a symptom for me as well, where I don't feel joy easily. I'm happy I've developed coping mechanisms and deal with it better than I used to when I was younger. I can't imagine I will ever be free of depression though. 
2	Being unable to sleep unless around family. Needing a lot of comfort\n\nCutting off contact with most of my friends, and only speaking to two people
1	i think i can know when im about to get depressed or into a depressive episode, since im constantly doing mental checks on how i am doing/performing. I just try to get stoic asap and try to detect what i need to get back on track, i dont succeed every time but whatever. Just get used to it and try to fix it from a different perspective every time until you get something that works
1	Exact same
1	Depressed episodes have happened to me and since going on meds I really shocked myself that I can't actually like that. It used to be like a purge of just ne and Fe against people I know . Them later calling me crazy or I have problems. I know deep down I am fine. But I was depressed and it showed . I'm glad to have found a better side to me come the years 
1	For the most part I don’t get depressed, but every once in awhile I’ll have a 4-5 day slump. The most recent one I just wanted to stay in bed and sleep and do nothing. I had to force myself to get up and do stuff. Typically I won’t shower, I won’t watch tv, I won’t do anything except lay there. It’s pretty awful. I literally force myself out of it. 
1	r/seasonalaffective \n\nCome on in, the water’s lukewarm 
1	I get stuck in loops 
1	Well I've been philosophically depressed for more than a decade now, but it doesn't manifest somatically all the time. The moments when it gets really bad I'm very negative and hate everything, just want to sleep and do nothing else.
1	If I have an episode I feel nothing, if you let it it will drive you mad, followed by self hatred, and random outbursts of truly dangerous rage. Interaction with someone who can stimulate your need for intellectual interaction is great and can maybe relax your out of control brain and ground you, a sexual relationship with someone who you actually connect with really helps, I'm not saying you have to fall in love but don't just self indulge with any dumb bitch find a nice girl and buy her dinner. 
-1	Basically you are a people pleaser and you act dumb to get attention. 
-1	I never really thought ENTPs could be depressed unless they let emotions override logic. Let your logic take over and see what happens.

7	Scared but liberated.	Hey! So I’m a 17 year old entp from the uk and I’ve recently dropped out fo college (been trying to drop out of schooling since ever.) and I’ve been terrified these last couple weeks but it looks like this is gonna be one of the most important years of my life ever. \nI decided around age 14 to get into makeup, at the time I didn’t realise but as I got better and better, it’s one of those amazing things that is extremely creative and is also in very high demand (and won’t be replaced by robots too soon....hopefully), having a skill in makeup became a thing that means I don’t have to worry as much as my peers because I’ll always be in demand for a job, and I’m really damn happy with that! So dropping out of college and feeling an immense fear but also an extreme motivation has been weird to say the least! And feeling anything but happiness has been a journey it it’s fucking self. The feeling of after 17 years finally being free to do what I want to do in life is unbeaten and makes me want to be the best version of me I can! I was just wondering if anyone else has been through something similar? If so any advice on easing nerves (thinking through things logically helps a damn lot) 
3	Enjoy the freedom. You can always choose different paths in the future, so don't see it as some super important, definitive choice. 
2	[This](https://youtu.be/ynbgMKclWWc) helped me a lot.
1	I was in a similar situation last year, enjoy the freedom for as long as you feel necessary... You have 17 years without it that you need to make up for after all
3	What do you think chaos is and are ENTPs chaotic?	ENTPs get labeled as chaotic very often. Do you agree?
9	Chaos is a mythical power split into seven colored emeralds. He who controls the Chaos emerald will know ultimate power. 
6	Chaotic is the ability to cause chaos, which is disorder in a community. By this definition, I would agree that most ENTPs are chaotic by nature. We know what make people "tick", and can troll accordingly. An unhealthy ENTP may thrive off of the attention received by the excessive chaos they have created.
6	I like to identify myself as a glittering tornado. People knew I am chaotic but still trying to get close. Either you got destroyed from getting too close, or get covered with glitter and sparkling forever. 
3	Yes, but people don't realize that they either don't care about that thing or that they are capable to oversee the chaos.
3	It may look to the untrained eye that it looks like chaos, but it's not. \n\nENTPs love to have a system in what appears to be chaos to others. Like take my room for example,  I have a pile of dirty clothes next to the pile of homework and assignments. There's a reason for that. It's because everytime I want to change my clothes I remember that I have to finish some stupid assignments.\n\nAlso, yeah. We don't have to get into more examples, do we? 😂\n\nWe are anarchists!
3	It obviously would hinge on the definition of the word chaotic, but if our operational definition for this thread is something like: "the opposite of order" or "scatterbrained", then I would have to first say that there are exceptions to every rule. For example, one could ask the question: "Is grass green?" and the obvious answer would be "yes", however the more precise answer would be "usually, because some grasses are yellow, or another color, and when grass dies it usually turns brown". So just because something is generally the case does not mean it will hold true for every specific individual.\n\nThat being said, there are also varying degrees of "health" associated with all personality types, as well as learning and adaption that take place over your lifetime which cause you to fall outside the cookie-cutter stereotypes. One might say that a "healthy" ENTP possesses all of the traditional inquisitive and justice-oriented traits that are typically associated with ENTPs while also being humble and keeping their life in order, and knowing when to stop pushing buttons to save interpersonal relationships from souring.\n\nIn my own case, being organized as an ENTP has not only helped me at work and my personal life, but has actually helped me to be even MORE ENTPish in the sense that by collecting and organizing data, I am able to make even more compelling arguments and then back them up with truth. More data is always better to an ENTP.\n\nAn alternative way of looking at the whole idea is that to some, there is order within the chaos. Like many people have said before, even though on the outside it may appear to be a pile of books and clothes, the owner of that stuff may know exactly where everything is. Obviously that is not a very objective definition of order, but some people operate that way.\n\nTo summarize, again using the definition of "the opposite of order". Are ENTPs chaotic? Some are, some aren't. And some have a method to their madness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit - I forgot to make an important distinction. I made the assumption that we were going with the idea of "outward chaos" as opposed to "internal chaos". Outward chaos being that the ENTP would appear chaotic to others, while internal chaos would mean that the brain activity of the ENTP is random and hectic as described by the MBTI. To the topic of the internal chaos I would still have to say my answer is that I don't actually know if most ENTP's brains are chaotic, but from reading about it and from my own thought patterns I can say that it certainly seems that the ENTP brain is indeed quite chaotic. That being said, the healthy ENTP in my opinion is able to recognize that chaos and harness it responsibly, thus creating order, or at least the type of order that the individual is wont to create.
5	I love chaos. I love the idea of danger. I find comfort in anything related to death how it gives life meaning. I find things that are "safe" to be boring. 
2	Tonight I recorded some thoughts about chaos and had to admit out loud... after +1year of trying to "clarify" my life, goals/surroundings/relationships/etc and seeing the strange results, that I was MADE of chaos and that the sooner I'd embrace that fate the better, so I could start making decisions purely for fun since nothing I want or expect is bound to happen.\n\nI mean I tried hard to keep schedules, to sort out my files and stuff, build momentum but it seems that the law of chaos buzzes too fast. Things fall on my lap, that's cool but they all autodestruct after a short period of time, leaving me confused. Even clothes seem to collapse after couple of weeks on my back. Circles of people who let me join implode. People in need for a rough ego slap love to approach me. My sole presence tears the matrix of the mundaine. I'm not special, not trying to. I'm just a walking mess. Not even sure I'm ENTP, I might be introvert. But if that utterly chaotic vibe is charateristic then I'm in!100%
1	ENTP rhymes with three.  [And everyone knows period-3 implies chaos.](https://www.siue.edu/~aweyhau/teaching/seniorprojects/dewaele_final.pdf)\n\n
1	Chaos is disorder which is the opposite of order. Which is related to complexity.  \n  \nEntps and enfps and to a lesser extent 4-6 introverted types show a high usage of the 'Christmas Tree' Brain pattern. Its when all the neocortex regions fluctuate randomly. Its associated to transcontextual thinking.
1	I love chaos cause I know I can thrive under stress when others cant, it puts me on a pedestal.\nNot to mention a deep rooted disregard for rules and authority. Idk if anyone can relate but I am always hungry to be apart of the next great revolution.
13	What do entps think of intps?	What is your honest opinion on intps? 
27	Most of my best friends are INTPs.  They're cool as fuck, and are almost like ENTPs who talk way less, even when you get to know them.  I see them as more analytical versions of myself who think a little more before they talk.  \n\nOne of the best things about INTPs, in my opinion, is the fact that they don't need constant attention or affirmation.  I can go weeks without talking to my INTP buddies and they are perfectly content to do whatever else it is they do with their free time.  There's never a guilt trip when I come storming back into their lives after a month long hiatus.  We just pick up where we left off from.  \n\n
42	The geeky ones can be a bit painful to speak to, the ones that wallow in self pity are exhausting, and the cool ones are some of the best people on the planet.
8	They’re p fun and I’m generally more willing to tolerate their awkwardness than my more social friends
11	This question gets asked a lot - the responses are usually positive.\n\nINTPs are one of my favourite types, although I think I've had the good fortune of meeting all the socially well-adjusted ones.
14	They are great, fantastic, but I can't stand their sub. What the hell is going on there?? It's like a group of might-be-depressed-but-probably-just-angsty teenagers tried to held a circlejerk but were too weak from crying to even jerk off. The self-loathing jokes are actually pathetic to the point I think it might just be toxic for INTP's and anyone else visitng that sub and the irony of the irony of these memes actually making me feel bad for them is not even a little bit funny. (( *Now that's ironic* )).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I really do like 'em INTP's.
4	The ones that take them too seriously and act like they're the most rational people in the world drive me up the wall. The ones that don't take anything seriously are super fun. My little brother is the latter type and he always has a deadpan monotone joke for everything I love it lmao. I know another intp who's the former.\n She basically said I was mistyped bc she thought she was an entp based off of her relating to some fictional entp character she liked... Then said I must be a feeler bc I wasn't as "rational". Just laughed it off bc it was so weird and she's pretty immature. She's still funny, tho. I think intps in general are pretty funny
3	Both types can be 100 percent their weirdest self and it doesn't freak out the other. 
2	The only type I can see myself loosing a debate to.
2	My husband is INTP. Lot of fun to live with him. \nWe can joke around. He understands my third degree. My projections. Completes my reflections. I translate his idea to other people. I get how amazing his reflection is. His family is mostly XSFX. So it is amazing to him to get deeper interactions.  \n\nNot a big sense of organisation though. And he’s convinced that emotions are the result of ideas. So when I used to say that I got hurt. He used to reply that I was wrong to feel.  I had to explain him the concept of feeling anyways. That afterwards we could discuss the grounding of the emotion.  But still. I needed it to be considered. \n\nHe gets me less spread around. More getting together my knowledges to reach one goal. Makes me happier to get more result in my life. \n\nHO ! And he still has the childlike sense of amazement at 42. INTP are amazing for ENTP. 
3	fun edgelords
2	I have a personal bias but, obnoxious.
1	Totally loved them. They usually are (or seem to be) more intelligent then everyone I know including myself and definitely have more knowledge. Beside that, they are very much like me, amazing conversations, they laugh at my jokes etc
1	I love em, I am a little old school, but before nerdy franchises were being pumped out to the degree that they are now, well INTP adults were the type I could rely on to have conversations about science, table top role-play, Sci-fi and fantasy, what if scenarios about dystopian setting, books, art, etc, etc.\n\nINTPs make me feel sane and I like dragging them out on adventures.
1	In a family of alot of INTPS and INFJS sometimes ENTJS, I can say I really enjoy having INXPs around me, just be coopartive, my INxPs like to isolate themselves and it sucks, sorry im a lazy writer.
0	Most of INTPs I know are loud drama queen, trying really hard to look edgy.
-2	I used to be one, so pretty cool. Basically an awkward, emotionless nerd, but in a good way if possible.
-3	The same with all i*** types, they’re npcs. Not really important unless proven otherwise. 
9	How often do you have to hold back your sense of superiority ?	While I don't think that's actually a bad thing, because if you don't think you're the best, no one will, it sometimes can get in your way, usually when in a relationship. \n\nDo you feel like this ? How do you deal with it, fellow ENTPs ? 
12	I never have to hold back my sense of superiors because I don’t feel superior. Ne Ti has huge fucking blind spots I’m smart enough to try to learn from other types. 
5	Develop some anxieties and replace it with a sense of inferiority
6	I try to hold back my sense of superiority for my own sake. I always think that if you're constantly finding yourself feeling superior to those around you, you're either: (a) an arrogant gasbag, or (b) hanging out with the wrong people. The better way would be to go find a bigger pond to swim in. Life's no fun when you're the smartest person in the room.\n\nIt's also helpful to remember that, although I am good at some things, I am also piss-poor at others. I am great at drafting documents, for example, but cannot fix a leaky faucet to save my life. On that note, it's also important to remember that just because you value something doesn't mean it's objectively valuable. For example, just because somebody isn't open to the ~possibilities of Bitcoin~ doesn't mean they're narrow-minded or dumb (I hang out in crypto subreddits sometimes; this is often the prevailing consensus). More likely, you have an inflated sense of its value and of your own value in relation to it. You have to be able to see and understand things from other people's perspectives. Otherwise, your life will be filled with blind spots.
3	When I took LSD, me and a friend (who also took acid) had an immense mental battle of who was superior.\n\nEver since that trip it has really made me aware, and I've since started to treat more people as superior (in atleast one way).\n\nStill don't think anyone is as superior as me, in all aspects. hehe. 
3	in general i don't feel that way\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut i have a few zones where I sit back, smile and say "welcome to my world."
3	Sense of superiority is a narcissistic trait and not a good one. It's damaging to you and others. \n\n
1	My gf is an INFJ, so we both have a huge sense of superiority but in different ways. She accepts that in most cases I am smarter when it comes to things that require logic, or as she puts it "I use my brain more than my heart". I accept that when it comes to how to deal with people that she will often just know the best way to approach things. \n\nThat being said, myself and other ENTPs aren't superior when it comes to all facets of life, we are only really superior at the use of our Ne + Ti functions. So that includes big picture thinking, abstract thinking, etc. I am in no way more superior than an ISTJ at things like organising socks, or an ISFJ at baking cookies, or an ENTJ at being arrogant and thinking I'm the best because I work 90 hrs a week.\n\nI'm only the best at being efficient, seeing big pictures, being handsome, and having a 12 inch penis (on the flop).
1	> if you don't think you're the best, no one will\n\nHonesty is a great virtue for many reasons, and thinking that you're the best is certainly not honest. Not only does this mentality make you seem like a complete tool and create a host of psychological issues rooted in delusional and unrealistic idealism, but it's also best you stop lying to yourself, buddy: we all know you're not the best at anything.\n\nWell-adjusted people know that they'll never be the best and realize that trying their hardest is all that they can do...something you might have a hard time intimating instead of merely acknowledging.\n\nIn desperate need of an ego death: you.
1	> because if you don't think you're the best, no one will\n\nNot really following your reasoning. Why does *anyone* need to think you're the best?
1	I always feel superior. But at work place I tune that a lot down since I love money and I like being paid.
1	If you are constantly feeling superior then you are either extremely smart and/or hanging out with stupid people.
1	To hold it back would mean ceasing to exist. Staying at home or avoiding conversation gives the illusion of lovin'kindness but that doesn't count.
3	Empty sympathy—what’s the point?	I always see things about how you’re a dick if you try to give people advice instead of just sympathizing with them.  In my personal relationships, I find that I lean more towards the former when people are sad or struggling.  For example, when my friend told me that she was having trouble coping with her anxiety, I didn’t just say “That must be really tough.  I’m sorry for what you’re going through.”  I also researched various coping habits that were recommended by therapists and shared them with her.  She said that it helped a lot.  If someone is unhappy in a situation that can be improved, my first response isn’t to just sympathize with them (although I always do that too), it’s to try and help them improve their situation in a logical way.  \n\nI find it frustrating when people are unnecessarily pessimistic about their problems.  I have another friend who was sad about a falling out she had with her best friend, and it was pretty easy to see that there were many ways to work out the situation, all of which she thought “wouldn’t work” despite having made zero effort to salvage the friendship.   It seemed like she just wanted to mope, and thought it was out of her hands.  Should I give people words of sympathy if they don’t even try to solve the problems they complain about?  It seems like a huge waste of time for both people involved, and personally, I find empty validation/sympathy to be of very little value.  Do other personality types crave more sympathy than ENTPs, or is it just a matter of whether the person is toxic and content with wallowing in pity?  Am I insensitive for not caring about a situation if it seems like the person isn’t making enough of an effort to solve their own issues?\n\nAlso, disclaimer, I’m talking about “empty sympathy” in the context of problems that can be solved or dealt with more efficiently.  If someone’s parent just passed away I’m obviously going to sympathize with them, not give them advice on raising the dead.
6	Yeah, you're kind of showing a lack of empathy.  I get it, I can be the same way.  Sometimes people aren't ready to fully wrap their head around a problem, and "wallowing in pity" or crying, or some other physiological response is necessary for them to move forward to the more productive problem-solving phase of whatever issue it is they're dealing with.  \n\nYou should understand that not everyone has the same coping mechanisms you might have.  You might also want to consider that your idea might not work because of some context you're missing that the grieving party is aware of, but incapable of sharing with you because of some sort of emotional barrier.  The more you press, the higher this barrier gets, and the more frustrated (and less apparently caring) you're going to seem to that person.  \n\nSometimes, if you're chosen as the person this party is going to confide in, all they want is a hug and a shoulder to cry on.  I think you'll find that many times the person already knows what they must do to rectify the situation, and that they are just looking to you for some strength and to be their calm in the storm.  \n\nHope this helps.
2	Give them a hug.  Then tell them when they're ready to challenge it to let you know. \n\nI'd rather challenge first then cry later, but that's me.
2	I call it platitudes. And I let people know that I wont give them, I'll listen, I'll validate feelings,  I'll offer to look for resources or give a random set of experiences that apply with differing actions and outcomes. But zero platitudes.
2	Ritualized expressions of sympathy are societal grease. It's gross and sticky and you're gonna need to wash your hands, but it keeps things moving smoothly.\n\nEspecially for the more ~~hidebound~~ ~~boring~~ *tradition-minded* members of society, the platitude can be more important than actually dealing with the problem - I know; it's stupid. Humor them so they don't go grudge mode because nobody had time for that.\n\nTo keep myself sane, I usually approach situations where it's expected to go through the motions something like this: first describe the situation broadly as though it happened to you. Usually this is "man, that sucks" or something similar. Second, drop in "I'm sorry". You can add detail or qualifies if you want, or leave it out if it would be a lie, but generally this keeps the judgers off your back. Finally, ask "is there anything I can help with?" This gives them an opening to ask for problem-solving without pushing it on them - again, because some people are touchy and you don't want to deal with them in a triggered state.\n\nWith experience you'll stay to figure out when you can drop various portions of these, but it's a passable fallback.

1	What is a baby chick after 8 days old?
1	At precisely 7:00 a.m., a monk sets out to climb a tall mountain, so  that he might visit a temple at its peak. The trail he walks is narrow  and winding, but it is the only way to reach the summit. As he ascends  the mountain, the monk walks the path at varying speeds. Though he stops  occasionally to rest and eat, he never strays from the path, and he  never walks backwards. At exactly 7:00 p.m., the monk reaches the temple  at the summit, where he stays the night.\n\nThe following morning at 7:00 a.m. sharp, the monk departs the temple  and begins his journey back to the bottom of the mountain. He descends  by way of the same path, again walking slowly at times and quickly at  others, stopping here and there to eat and drink and rest, but never  deviating from the path and never going backwards. Twelve hours later,  at 7:00 p.m. on the nose, the monk arrives back at the foot of the  mountain.\n\nIs there any point along the path that the monk occupied at precisely the same time on both days? How do you know?
3	Decision making	I need some help here. I'm am ENTP who always makes quick but informed decisions. My what if machine is off the charts and I usually see fifty outcomes to any decision and make solid choices based on my what ifs. Very rarely does this fail me and if it does I use it as a learning experience to make my what ifs even better. \n\nThis is my problem, I have entirely too much emotions going on now and my what if machine isn't useful. It's literally crippling me. I'm sitting at a bar drinking more than I know I should and it's making me spiral. \n\nI guess my question is how the hell do I force the emotion out of something to allow my highly logical what if machine to work. I'm jumping between decisions so fast my mind is a blur. \n\nI've done this in the past by killing my emotions but that's exactly what I don't want to do. I need help...
4	what are your emotions telling you\n\n&#x200B;\n\nlike at the root, the core reason they're flailing around.
3	This sounds like one of those broad hypotheticals that is actually about a very specific series of events happening in OP's life.\n\n...either that, or it's early onset schizophrenia.\n\nForcing your emotions "out" is never helpful. The better way is to try to understand your emotions and incorporate them as part of your decision-making processes. Your emotions are, believe it or not, probably trying to tell you something important. I would take a breath and try to process them slowly. Firstly, what is it actually that you're feeling? Secondly, why might you be feeling this way? 
2	I don’t have any advice to offer you like others in this thread, but I genuinely hope things get better for you. I can relate to the swarm of emotions raging in my brain, and while my methods aren’t effective(overworking myself to ignore the building emotions), I take comfort knowing that there is a light at every tunnel. You’ll get through this eventually, and while emotions are unpredictable and confusing, having them is one of the things that makes humans so interesting. Best of luck 💜 !!
2	When I find myself in similar situations I tend to lean on those closest to me. Do you have someone or a support system? Not necessarily someone who needs to know everything that is going through your mind. But knows you well enough to just listen and understand? Sometimes we don't need input, but saying the logistics of a situation out loud help create an understanding within you. I have been where you are in terms of feeling like no matter how many steps you take in what you feel is the right direction only to find yourself right back where you started. It is an exhausting process. Especially when there seems to be no outcome or sign of the other side ahead. No one needs to go through that feeling isolated and alone.
1	To expand on this a little every decision I make ten minutes later I'm second guessing and my mind starts cranking out new solutions. I can't seem to fix anything though. 
1	Don’t know how comfortable you are with your masculinity but you can always try crying to let out the emotions.
1	What's worked for me in the past is to simply write / type out a complete stream of consciousness. Could be a few paragraphs, or sometimes up to a couple of pages, depending on what kind of shit is going on in your life. Once it's on paper my brain has no need to keep replaying my emotions over and over. It's nice and stored in a file or piece of paper that only I can get to. Knowing that it's locked up there and safe from prying eyes, I can then focus on finding a solution. \n\nAlso, meditation.
3	asking ENTPs...	what are the signs of getting entp's attention, especially for a friend and how to make a one interactive and cooperative in a common project ( like improving themselves). 
4	By signs, do you mean ways?\n\nAsking questions definitely helps get ENTPs engaged. I'd avoid delegating too much detail work, as it may be done poorly. Idk, I feel like ENTPs tend to be interactive and cooperative in common projects by default, although we may "cooperate" in a different way from others. I think we're more likely to try to facilitate debate, which some types might find aggressive, but to us is useful for exchanging ideas.\n\nA brainstorming exercise might work as well.\n\nIf you're talking about making an ENTP friend, we're generally pretty friendly so long as we think you have something interesting to say. 
3	Just walk up casually a bet 100$ they can’t get something done. Sit back and watch them try to prove you wrong ;)
1	Honestly just be interesting and an ENTP will naturally be drawn to you 
7	thoughts on ENFPs	So i'm an enfp but the enfp subreddit is pretty much "i'm sad, help", "don't understand enfp partner","relationship stuff"  and a circle jerk of intj/infj. Like all this is fine and I've done it but in moderation. I want a place where I can discuss ideas and this seems like a pretty decent place. \n\noverall how do you guys perceive ENFPs? I want the good, bad, and thee ugly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
11	I have a number of ENFP friends, all female for what its worth. They're all lovely, excitable people who are very creative. Yet, despite their "out of the box" thinking, they make the same mistakes over and over and ultimately seem to be on a constant emotional roller coaster when it comes to relationships (hence perhaps the nature of your comment). 
10	> overall how do you guys perceive ENFPs?\n\nSounds like "relationship stuff" to me. 
6	Well, ask something and we'll bring you something cool and fun !\n\nBe yourself, stay nice, fun and PLEASE NEVER be a crybaby with logic people if you have sentimental issue...\n\nMy INFJ coworker/friend piss me off today for 3 (FUCKING) HOURS while pushing me outside of my code because he wasn't sure about the sens of his life and doesn't like the technology he work with --'
3	I have an ENFP sister... it's a challenge. I love her and through her I've learned to understand F types a bit more. She's currently going through a rough patch and I wish I could help her more but I don't see how I can because of our type difference except just to try to be there for her.  \n\nI've accepted that she will bump her head,  multiple times, and not understand why even after I explain it. It has taught me a bit of patience towards F types and hearing her talk helps me understand more. Hearing her  sounds sad at times and its hard to first undertstand how ENFPs can exist but through time I do undertstand... 
2	Some of my closest friends have been ENFPs. They’re great, for the most part. Fun, excitable, and have a positive attitude towards life. They are definite people-persons and most of them have had a compatible sense of humour. It’s cool having someone to bounce heaps of ideas off, too.  \n\nI have noticed that they can be two-faced, however. They can be fake and care too much about other people liking them. And they can be seriously lacking in self-awareness. Having them as close friends has, at least, taught me a lot in terms of being patient with people’s emotions. They can be sensitive about things I don’t understand but, for the most part, they aren’t often offended by me. They seem to assume people have the best of intentions, which is cool. \n\nMy ENFP friends also tend to ask me for advice as to whether I think they’re being unreasonable about something. Not sure why they bother, because they don’t listen and interpret everything I say as being on their side anyway, lol. A pattern I’ve noticed with Fi-users is that they often re-interpret things I’ve said to be in-line with their values/beliefs. Even when they’re blatantly not. \n\nMy last comment is that I don’t bother arguing with them about things. It’s just seen as a form of conflict, whereas I see a discussion. The resulting tension isn’t worth it and they are not always that open to alternative viewpoints. 
2	I don’t know many ENFPs in real life. On here I just judge the content of what people are saying rather than worrying about their type 
1	I love 'em.\n\nOkay, this is a guilty pleasure of mine but uhh I watched Shane Dawson's little earlier videos where he was messing around with his friend, one of them being the most ENFP ENFP I know, Garret Watts. I don't think I could've through lasted the videos without him as Shane's reality-tv style of vlogging isn't my cup of tea but he is so free-spirited and mad creative. Garret Watts is so admirable human being, he bought some random fucking notebooks for his friends on a whim aaaand they didn't really seem to be that notebook-writer kind of people...at all. Also he bought a dollhouse for ANTS in his backyard and a doll/figurine grandma to watch out for them ants (---but yeah he also had a slight hoarding problem (he got attached to a foil ball and a ribbon) and he's lazy as heck but he's better now blahblahblah that's not the point).  Most of the time when I was watching that crap I wanted to jump trough the screen, softly kick Shane in the face and join Garret to his crazy shenanigans. I'd love to have an ENFP friend. So yeah I didn't know what ENFP people where like before that and he was a great introduction, in conclusion: you seem pretty great to me.   
1	They’re cool for the most part but they don’t usually get absurd humor and get butthurt easily. Also kinda flakey? I feel like I cannot rely on them. 
23	ENTPs in finance?	I’d imagine that the constant innovation, the monetary benefit, and the rush of predicting something accurately all come together to form an industry which ticks all ENTP boxes. \nIs this true or am I being idealistic?\n
15	I have worked in various roles in the finance industry for 6 years now. It's a pretty solid industry if you enjoy problem solving and numbers. I would be aware that there are a lot of finance roles that are extremely monotonous. I would avoid fund accounting like the plague if you can. If you find the right role for you, you can have a rewarding career in finance. 
13	I enjoy finance, But also economics politics and history surrounding it.
11	I'm a trader. Good gig if you know what you're doing/can stick around through all the hard knocks.
9	I'm a morose crypto gambler... but hope springs eternal and I keep investing... at least I tell myself I'm investing.
6	I think we generally are too impulsive to be good in the markets, that said I made about 1.5K in crypto last year but it was more luck than capability.
5	Finance /= accounting. That being said, finance is a lot of problem solving so I could definitely see it as a profession for an ENTP, although you may be better off with the end goal of having your own firm rather than working for a big company solely due to the rigid structure many large companies have for their employees
3	I'm in the field and working on my CFA cert. Parts of it are a slog, and parts of it, as you say, tick those boxes for me.
5	I mean I can see your point since we also tend to love interacting with customers and those in workplace. (E)\n\n(NTP) would blow our mind with possibilities and the "what if's" $$$$
2	I think there are lots of us over at /r/wallstreetbets
2	I’m an analyst at a hedge fund, I love it, free explore for opportunity and analyze/execute however I see best, with the trade off being instability (of my career not my investors’ capital). It’s enjoy work immensely, and how it forces me to stay abreast of global geopolitics and events. The quality of resources (news, meetings etc.) allow for a much more nuanced view of the world beyond the clickbait spin of commercial news outlets. The meritocratic nature is great, no bs office politics, just right or wrong. It’s refreshing to be surrounded by people interested in finding the truth - a lack of intellectual integrity and a big ego is a good way to have a short career. That said, it sucks to lose money, the job requires you to fight against your most natural knee jerk emotional responses and stay steady which I think is an invaluable and incredibly difficult skill to master. Getting the seat in the first place is hell as it usually requires banking (which is the seventh circle of hell) and interacting with bankers (who are usually vacuous tool bags). Even if not professionally I’d encourage anyone to explore as useful hobby - but only do it if you’re going to do it right - I.e. read the filings, learn about the company, visit the store. Otherwise drop the pretense and play online poker\n
-1	Ir being too idealistic, i have invested money and espended time learning and playing with the market, the reality is no Matter how good u think u ar, the market is incredible hard to predict, u need to takes risks and yet be prudent and wise at the same time, this is hard in itself imagine un in a constante changing place like the market, is not easy to keep a clear head when u see urself earning 1k in an hour and is not easy when u see urself loosing that the Next, and when u do It with the money of other people is the same ecept that is easy to play It Safe when a 0.5% means Big money as the market benefit those Who can play Big of course in finance there ar many works an entp can do but the same as un any other industry, basically im saying that is not entp easy place is as dificult for US than It is for most other types, i think actually si doms tend to play Safe and sure and It benefit them even if is the long Game. And if theres a type that benefits for continuos risk taking i think Estps have the upper hand in that, were not bad in taking risk but Estps usually ar better. Entps when they dont know and they have to choose betwen risk or safty usually jump and improvise the thing is in the market of values that doesnt translate as well.\n\n**I edited to fix some spelling mistakes because my cell keeps trying to translate everything to spanish**
11	INFP	Hy ! What do you think of INFP-s?
12	I currently have a big crush on what I suspect is an INFP. My urge to PROTECC her is overwhelming.\n\nI am in a phase where I want to understand how she works, so I spend a lot of time thinking about her and observing. \n\nI can see she never talks about herself and is very guarded, right now the only goal I have in my boring ass life is to break open her shell and become close to her
6	Very interesting and insightful. Get along extremely well with ENTP’s. They love the weird stuff we love. Most are cute snowflakes without that killer edge. They’re amazing to have an one on one with, specially after a day of speaking to xSFx’s. 
6	Intelligent, perceptive, complex creatures and also submissive and very tender,definitively the best type.\n\nI think the most dominant u ar the best u get along with high Fi types and if ur submisive ull clash with them.Because one of the reason i get along with infps is because im extremmely protective and dominant and infps ar mostly submisive.
5	Aye I have a crush on an INFP dude and he's amazing. I love how kind, humorous, considerate, observant, and downright awesome you guys are. I suspect he also likes me back, but is too awkward to initiate conversations. (Don't worry, I find this strangely endearing.) He stares at me a lot, tends to mirror my body language and talk about my hobbies when I'm around, and show up in places I frequent. I caught him staring at me the other day and he instantly looked down and blushed, I found that pretty cute. Sometimes he seems to feel sad about not being able to perform better in school and lacking motivation, which makes me want to hug him and tell him he's already good enough the way he is. But yeah, I find you guys amazing :)\n\nI might tell him how I feel towards him some time in the near future...not sure though.
5	I like them. They are hard to get to know but they are extremely interesting and intelligent w great humor once they open up to you
5	My partner of 10+ years is one. We're a perfect match except our home is a frikken mess. I wish you guys were obsessed with organizing and keeping everything tidy. =( That's your only flaw!
5	I’m an INFP (my boyfriend is an ENTP) and he gets along with us really well. His roommate is also an INFP. I spent the weekend with him a few weeks ago and he invited some of their friends over to play board games and one of them is also an INFP. In a room of 5 people, 3 of them were the second (?) rarest personality type, which I thought was hilarious. 
5	They often remind me of brain-damaged INTPs.
2	I love 'em, they have their principles and they fight for them but helping rather than fighting. But the quantity of them is about right, it keeps them special but not enough to make them isolated and different. They truly can be the flame
2	My best friend is an infp I've known her since we were 7 so.... 18 years? I mean a friendship that's lasted that long is revealing to how compatible we are. We go hours just talking when we're together and go days/weeks without talking, then when we get back together, it's like we saw each other only yesterday. My only complaint is that whenever she dates someone, she goes too quickly, and acts married almost immediately, then we barely have time to hang out. Luckily, my other best friend gives me ALLL the attention I need lmao
2	Haven’t come across many, but the few I have end up as some of my closest friends! Hard to get know at first, but definitely worth sticking it through, I find it extremely comfortable just talking to them
2	I really enjoy INFPs! Even on a bad day, you guys are weirdly charming to me.
2	 I've gotten really close to an INFP this month, and I just got home from an open road trip with her (gave me a lift because my car's getting fixed ATM). SHE'S VERY SOFT !!! AND I JUST WANT TO PROTECT HER ALL THE TIME. I am usually very straightforward, but I am extra cautious with my pranks when it comes to her. :--) it's funny when she makes really cheesy jokes!!! She's so pure and adorable. I'm definitely keeping her close ! She's also very reliable :-) the kind of friend who always puts others first !! 
2	They have great ideas and I wish they had the self confidence to intellectually spar with me when we're on a team together. I swear, I stop to ask what others think frequently and I still get told I tend to talk over everyone! Share your headspace, my I friends!
4	[deleted]
2	I think I hate these types of questions. 
1	I just broke up with an INFP. She was cool until we went official, then she became highly protective and generally envious of other girls. The weird part was she tried really hard to stop me, like things could ever be the same after I told her I was done.
1	I want to torture you guys in my sex dungeon and drink up all your tears.
1	My male best friend happens to be the very unfortunate victim of my latest obsession, which is myers briggs related stuff. Although unphazed and sometimes downright bewildered by my enthusiasm, he has to admit that his INFP (in his case -T, like me) label does hold some truth to it. I am still trying to figure out whether or not I am crushing on him or my INTJ friend though. Sometimes I just feel like putting both of them in a blender and hoping for the best. I guess time will tell. \*shrug\*
0	Looking for the opposite sex	Or actually, where to look for the opposite sex? I'm a straight guy so I look for gals.\n\nNow, I've been single for well over 3 months but usually when I look for girls I act like an introvert for a while, and only after I've built enough... trust/sexual tension/love/etc... only then I show my extraverted nature.\n\nWhy do I do that? Well the answer to that is a question actually. In groups I mostly look for mental dominance not physical or social status dominance and so I barely attract girls like this. Actually once, just to test I was bored, I more or less "mistakenly" bumped a guy and kicked him off balance, then physically asserted myself with posture and me being tall. The girls in there were instantly attracted to me. I obviously didn't do anything, because it was just a sociopath test of mine and I was not thinking particularly seductive. (But this shows how rudimentary human beings are...)\n\nNow the question: Are all ENTP's like this? a.k.a only mentally asserting themselves?\n\nActing like an introvert with girls does work for me but not all of them like it as I slowly reveal my energy - which kinda looks like adhd sometimes t.b.f. - so I can't emulate that truly for long.\n\nOther alternatives to being an attractive ENTP?\n\nAlso an idiot question now: Where can I find girls again? On the street they all have headphones or are in groups, and I am intimidated by large numbers of them. Most groups in like comedy clubs, parties, book clubs etc are either designed for introverts or for ES\*\*'s, so not for me either.\n\nJust like any ENTP I am very charming when I talk to a bunch of people my different views on the world and plans and other stuff, but towards the end it's just all I look for. I can't seductively connect my charm. I think it's common problem with intuitive extraverts like me?\n\nThank you
3	I've the same 'nature' that I arrived as an introvert, then I analyse stuff and go to the extraverted true nature lol\n\nMaybe try to learn dancing stuff... That's something i'd like to try (I really need to clean my brain actually) and that's the stuff i've found.\n\nMuseum could maybe work for you \^\^
5	Pick-Up Artists HATE This Mad Lad's Simple Trick To Make Women Want You\n\n"Give 'em a li'l trip."\n\n
2	I started talking to this girl. At first I was so caught up in trying to have sex with her I came across all creepy and weird . Now since letting go out communication had become a lot more natural and I feel so much better about myself. I have found myself after 23 years of being lost with this girl and I want her . I get a primal urge when on the phone to her and she's just in her room doing random things like getting dressed with her nan. I loved her then and there and I think I'm falling but we'll see.
9	What is the thinking equivalent of a moral compass? Or how can I relate Ti in a catchy phrase?	Basically, I am that sort of person where I address things that no one wants to consider because they are hard topic, and I keep teams accountable for our decisions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExample, we said we would do event x last month and it did not happen, Why was that and how can we fix this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr, or numbers from last year did not meet our start of the year expectations. Where did we go wrong, and what can we do better?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nor, We say that we value X but our actions say otherwise. We need to either admit that we don't value X  or see where our actions have failed us and change them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want a phrase along the lines of moral compass that I can include in resumes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
10	Ethical Abacus?
3	Creative problem solving?\n\nI ask these questions a lot and am mostly met with resistance for pointing out unpleasant truths. I like your optimism that it actually has value. Am still searching for a job that also believes it.
3	Unmoral compass.
2	Accountable/accountability sounds like an appropriate word you could use for a resume, not sure how catchy that is though!\n\nBusiness Ethics might be another?\n\n"Disparity Distinguisher" lol\n\n"Dissonance Resolver" \n
2	> Basically, I am that sort of person where I address things that no one wants to consider because they are hard topic\n\nBut you can’t answer your own question? 😏
1	You need to conjure up that Si demon, bring back it's head. You return with this new weird skill. I think the feelers call it empathy.
1	something along the lines of the phrase "scientific approach" or just the word approach. words like methodology sounds smart. A moral compass is just a way of acting or perceiving at things according to set principals, this is no different than a scientific approach. 
1	Accountability in decision-making? Decisional accountability?\n\nI don't think you're going to come up with anything as "sexy" as "moral compass", unfortunately.
1	"I'll be really good at pointing out your mistakes."
72	Empty Out Your Dookey-Bucket.	Everyone keeps talking about feeling terrible on here. \n\nHow they don't fit into society. \n\nThat they can't figure out what they should. It's easy to overthink things when we have such beautiful minds. So I'm going to try to frame a good perspective of how ENTPs can view the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone is in a battle to destroy each other.\n\nIt's a fight for imaginary paper that buys future trash.\n\nNothing belongs to you. Everyone wants what you have.\n\nIf you have nothing, then no one wants you.\n\nFeeling sad and feeling special is a form of control to keep you on the hook.\n\nNo one knows you. You aren't special. Your feelings mean nothing to the world.\n\n*Repeated phrases are a form of conditioning:*\n\n# "I'm Not Being true to myself."\n\nWho were you being? the mailman? Who says what you are supposed to be? even if you are pretending to be something else, You're still being true to the guy who pretends to be something else. That's who you are. This esoteric crapola is why so many meaningless rules exist.\n\n# "I'm A Moron."\n\nHow do you know? You can't understand relative theory, but maybe it's a bunch of bull anyways? How smart are other people? You made mistakes, but I bet you did them for some benefit. Stupid people do things that harm themselves, and others, and have no benefit. losers never fail. They never win either.\n\n# "I Feel Worthless"\n\nWorthless to other people? You don't know what they are thinking.There are 6 billion people in this world and you feel worthless to probably 10. You owe them NOTHING. Worthless to yourself? Quit eating for a day and see how worthless you are to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# "I'm Dreaming Too Much"\n\nDream up ways to make money. 90% of the world dies without doing anything significant. Most people don't take chances, so they live poor and hate their lives. They hate you too. They hate that you are different. They'll hate to see you win.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Let's close with this.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nENTPs are the best. The world is trying to get into your head to make you doubt yourself. It's their (seemingly subconscious) strategy to keep people like us from being in charge of everything. That goes for similar personalities. They love rules. We love freedom.\n\n**Understand this one truth**: Society Wants Your Money.\n\n**Consider This Second Truth:** \n\nElephants are caught in the wild when they are young. Their trainers tie them to a stake in the ground. The baby elephant fights until he **decides** that he can't break free. When full-grown, he could simply take a step and wouldn't even feel the stake pull out of the ground, **but he doesn't** ***believe*** **he can.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou've been force-fed other people's rules of life since you were born. You've been feeding yourself the same old crap. It's time to empty out that D**ookey-Bucket** and for the love of God, stop eating out of it, you filthy elephant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: ENTPs are the best. Don't get caught up in sensationalism.
6	Wow dude this means alot to me😃. I plan one using it for future use as well😎. Incoincidently im learning to empty out my dookey-bucket🛢 while simultaneously emptying out my dookey-bucket🚾. \n*Bad pun 🤣😂🤣😂\n
5	Great Post. The greatest of all posts. I was actually feeling worthless yesterday night tbh, and you are right, only to 10 people at the most. And what have those people achieved? The same that you mentioned at the end, they achieved being and elephant that is unable to move from a small post.\n\nI'm a baby elephant that can pull a tree goddamit! 
13	I would recommend reading Jordan Peterson's 12 rules for life to everyone here. He's a controversial figure for some reason I can't quite understand, but his book is pretty fantastic. Helped me a lot. 
3	You're not a victim because you're an ENTP, you're a victim because you think you are. 
3	The answer to self dis-like or self doubt isn’t to sit around calling yourself the best. That’s a narcissistic style of thinking. ENTPs are not “the best” just like INFJs are not “the best.” Your type doesn’t make you remotely special.\n\nThe answer is to have self compassion. Knowing how to feel for yourself over your failings or mistakes is what fills you up. \n\nThese superficial puff-up posts do more harm than good. It’s okay to be average. It’s okay to have bad feelings. Self acceptance and emotional acceptance should be the goal. \n\nThere’s also nothing wrong with some self-doubt. Intelligent people are riddled with self doubt. It’s just that you need self love on top of that self doubt. Self doubt done right is humility and willingness to accept you may be wrong or there’s a better solution out there. 
45	Starting over	Do you ever just feel the need to drop everything and ghost everyone you built a relationship with and just starting over? Building from the scratch, but this time smarter from the previous life without failing, at least trYing to, and If it doesnt go well, you can start over again because you’ve got nothing to lose. Sometimes I just wan to disappear and see people care for me. Ask me where I was and that they miss me. I need attention but I hate it so dearly
24	I was with you up until this point:\n\n>Sometimes I just wan to disappear and see people care for me. Ask me where I was and that they miss me. I need attention but I hate it so dearly\n\nI've always loved starting over, but never with any thought to what impact I might have on people I was leaving behind. Based on that statement, it sounds like you might have some unresolved problems with the people in your life. \n\nI moved around a lot growing up and so got accustomed to being able to reinvent myself. It's a bit of a cliche, but of course I came to the conclusion that no matter where you "run", you'll always end up running back into yourself. The idea of starting completely afresh is an illusion. An attractive illusion, but an illusion nevertheless.\n\nEven though I'm fairly settled in my life now, I still definitely dream of dropping everything and starting over. It's not so much that I want to escape my life, though, as I wonder about all the lives unlived and paths not taken. I wonder what would happen if I'd moved to Asia instead of staying in the West after graduating, for example. What opportunities would I have pursued there? Things like that. 
3	the most relatable post i‘ve read in a while. however for me the urge to disappear doesn‘t come from wanting others to miss me, but just out of a feeling of being left out. because i don‘t feel like i fit in, i just want to go far away and want to be erased from everyone‘s memories. as if i‘ve never existed. but no matter where i go this feeling will follow me so i don‘t even start. \n\nbut i‘ve considered starting over many times too. and i actually did it like twice. but i‘ve already exploited all friendships i can make in my town, and have a bad reputation for being „heartless“ - so i cannot start over again since these friends i have are the only ones that never betrayed me and i cannot trust anyone else. \n\nif i would start over, i wouldn‘t make any friendships at all. no interpersonal relationships nothing. i‘d live in isolation and only have short-term acquaintances, but so that they don‘t consider me part of their lives.\n\ni‘m actually trying to realize this. i know i‘ll regret it because i‘ll feel lonely but between two losses i‘d choose the lesser one
4	I’m with the others here on this. I feel exactly this way, but not motivated by any desire to have others miss me. In fact, I just want to shut everyone out and start over from scratch. For me, it’s no hard feelings to anyone (easier said than done, I’m aware), but when I move on, I move on. It’s like a breath of fresh air! Letting go and starting over is super therapeutic to me. I have to imagine that since it’s good for me, it’s probably, on some level, actually good for the people I step away from. They would do better to have authentic friends, rather than someone who feels compelled to stick around due to guilt, despite every ounce of their being wanting to bound away and start over. 
3	Yeh I feel that a lot. Then I remember that when the problem is me, I can’t escape me.
3	Yeah, I've done it more than once myself. I figure if someone doesn't talk to me at least once every couple of months, and I have to do ALL of the legwork in communication - they don't give a damn. I've tested this theory and was horrified at just how many people didn't care about me that I thought were my friends and I always did my best to be a normie around them and shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChances are if you don't think they care about you, they don't - fighting your intuition will just make you suffer, man. Cut the fucking cord, on the inside, and keep them around as what they are - acquaintances. Don't ruffle any feathers and be like "FUCK YOU MAN!" because they'll paint you as a lunatic even though your assessment that they never appreciated you, is true.
2	Op also i have donne that i have started over many times, last one 3 years ago when i moved to the south of Spain, so i can answer some comments if u need.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  He can never exist in stable, long-established conditions of generally acknowledged though limited value: because his eye is constantly ranging for new possibilities, stable conditions have an air of impending suffocation. He seizes hold of new objects and new ways with eager intensity, sometimes with extraordinary enthusiasm, only to abandon them cold-bloodedly, without regard and apparently without remembrance, as soon as their range becomes clearly defined and a promise of any considerable future development no longer clings to them.    \n>  \n>  It is as though his whole life went out into the new situation. One gets the impression, which he himself shares, that he has just reached the definitive turning point in his life, and that from now on nothing else can seriously engage his thought and feeling. How- \[p. 465\] ever reasonable and opportune it may be, and although every conceivable argument speaks in favour of stability, a day will come when nothing will deter him from regarding as a prison, the self-same situation that seemed to promise him freedom and deliverance, and from acting accordingly. Neither reason nor feeling can restrain or discourage him from a new possibility, even though it may run counter to convictions hitherto unquestioned. Thinking and feeling, the indispensable components of conviction, are, with him, inferior functions, possessing no decisive weight; hence they lack the power to offer any lasting. resistance to the force of intuition.    \n>  \n>  Since his intuition is largely concerned with outer objects, scenting out external possibilities, he readily applies himself to callings wherein he may expand his abilities in many directions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think ur getting the feeling that u have exhausted the possibilitys of the place ur in, and ur trying to rationalize it, to stop it from happening but is ur intuition telling u that u need to o explore, travel, i can understand this heavily because it has happened for me many times.And i have acted accordingly, i know that urs is heavy tainted on Fi, but still ur wants ar common to Ne doms, i know that thirst i have it in me all my life.\n\nIs funny that even in this place which is build for us the Ne doms so few people understand this and will readilly call it Se because they dont undersand our need for potential for novelty.\n\n&#x200B;
2	into the wild, read it or reread it
1	Do it but only if you communicate to the people you're cutting off why.
1	Yes but it’s not a great way to go through life. I’ve stopped doing it as much as I’ve developed and had a better understanding of who I am
1	Often I wake up and wonder how impressed acquaintances would be if they met me for the first time... then, throughout the day I beat the pride outta myself until I’m too tired to resist. Finally I collapse into bed with a wry grin and think to myself —“if YOU were to start over, YOU would still be here.”  While we can grow as people, we can’t change who we are. Even nomads self-loathe to some extent— even if their city of embarrassment/disappointment was left far behind.  \nI just always try to remember one thing: .........\n\nHope that helps :) 
1	I have that urge also. Ive made the experience however, that better i perform in social interaction and manage new relationships, the less I connect with people. (Which reading back over the sentence is not too absurd to percieve). Anyway what im trying to say is that starting all over and doing everything perfectly might just lead to a shallow empty perfect life, that you start to dread insanely quickly repeating the cycle of starting again. As compared just going with the flow, taking in all the side effects, doing what you want, not worrying too much and continuing to develop something more profound.

19	This post right here officer
12	This aren't really cringey so much as they are lame. I can appreciate a good anti joke, but some of these push it, lol
3	I will find you, and I will argue with you.. 
7	>Have you ever noticed that all the machines searching for intelligent life are pointed away from earth? :O\n\nWrong. We're looking for *any* kind of life out there, and are actually searching for the most basic life there is. \n\n>Idk if it's just me but ... sometimes when I close my eyes I can't see shit.\n\nWrong. Closing your eyes reduces the amount of light getting through to your eyes, but it's not a perfect barrier. A test is to close your eyes in a well lit area, and then wave your hand in front of your eyes. You'll "see" different shades of black, because even with your eyes closes, some light passes through. \n\nYou may think a loophole is to try *really* hard to close your eyes, like scrunch your face hard. Still isnt perfect. Try that, then place your hand in front of your eyes. Move it closer and farther away. As it gets close, you'll again see a "darker" shade of black, because you're blocking more light. \n\nThis is one of the reasons a blindfold is so effective for deeper slumbers. \n\n>The amount of followers you have doesn't matter. Hitler had 4 million. Jesus had 12.\n\nWrong. If you're going to assert Hitler had millions of followers, then Jesus has billions of followers. Jesus had twelve *disciples*.\n\n>All the rules in this world were made by someone no smarter than you, so make your own.\n\n[Citation needed]. Smarter than you, maybe. \n\n>Professor: you've just failed two tests. Me: You've failed to educate me twice now.\n\nProfessor: I can't educate those who don't wish to learn.

0	Are ENTP's kinky or is it just me?	Not like full blown dungeon and gimp suit with electrodes and fish hooks. But I can attest this is true of myself. Seldom make it through the qualifiers but a question to ask right off the bat is "do you like it rough?". And then it's usually the crazy specimens whom are brave enough to let us go wild with them and experiment/try new things, all of whom then become obsessed/in love/addicted to an idealized christian gray embodiment we've become. Which leaves one gaping void they're unable to fill once we're through with them and the relations have run there natural course(or when we're running the other direction)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore reserved and traditional girls probably won't get the privilege of experiencing all the kinks and red hand prints.. or even try out the entry level BDSM restraints/gags/whips and toys we keep stashed under the bed for just the right occasion(freek), if per chance that present's itself.. with a ravenous expression on face n all  ;)\n\nThese regular plain-janes probably won't sing our praises like the submissive crazy kittens do, not that they would even dare tell others.. when it's that good they don't want friends or competition to find out!  And are probably sure to be judged by peers if they do speak of the devious things that wen't down. (Eg actual demon mask and an elaborate slew of cable ties adjoined to ligaments rigged to ropes and chokers.. to paint it polite and stop there)
13	Oh ENTPs are definitely the kinkiest type. Given their boundless curiosity, moral boundary pushing, and experimentation - it's really no surprise that most dog fuckers are ENTP. 
6	>More reserved and traditional girls probably won't get the privilege of experiencing all the kinks and red hand prints.. or even try out the entry level BDSM restraints/gags/whips and toys we keep stashed under the bed for just the right occasion(freek), if per chance that present's itself.. with a ravenous expression on face n all ;)\n\nI hate to break it to you, but 50 shades is a thing so pretty sure every reserved, traditional person is now obligated to stash few whips under the bed,
4	i love dominating guys with floggers and gags and such but idk if it's because of being ENTP. Maybe we're excited by danger and power (and sex) so we're more openminded to it than other types
3	I’m rather conservative when it comes to sex. All the extra stuff people use to try to spice shit up always baffles me. To me sex is a very deep union between two souls and if you just let it be that it is beautiful.
4	...gross
1	Personally, it mostly has to do with curiosity,  sometimes to a morbid extent, that makes me seek out kinkier and kinkier stuff. \nMost of the time I’m not even getting off on the act itself, just the idea that it’s a taboo for most.
1	It's because of dopamine receptors.\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-compass-pleasure/201503/the-neurobiology-bdsm-sexual-practice\n\n
1	If you want to say ENTPs are better in bed, I would have to agree 😁\nTo say it’s the ENTP aspect that allows us to be kinky... I’m not so sure. 
1	[deleted]
1	I wasn't exactly drawn to kink, but was introduced to it by my now-bf a couple years ago. I really enjoy kink/BDSM culture and find it all pretty fascinating, although it's difficult to fit into my lifestyle on a consistent basis... running my own biz takes up a lot of creative bandwidth. I'd really like to immerse myself, but time is limited.\n\nIn any case, I do feel my ENTPness allowed me to be open to all of it... pretty interested in most things.
1	I like a girl who likes it rough but is also going to be rough, sex should be like combat. I love leaving the bed with us both being scratched bruised and even bleeding. Consensually of course.
20	Do we ENTP have any value in today’s job market?	I am wondering if me as an ENTP I am dreaming too much about what job I can get. \n\nI have had more jobs than any of my friend in my age. I understand the big picture (worked for academia, industry and public)- however I feel totally lost. At the moment I am trying to get a job where I can transform an industry.... I tried to combine all my knowledge from all my jobs. Somehow people don’t understand this! People are overstrained and don’t understand my value. Or maybe I am just a dreamer and maybe we ENTP don’t fit most of these jobs!?\nAnyone has the same problem?\n\n
27	How are people supposed to know you can transform anything? Being special isn’t enough sorry to break it. Put in your dues just like everyone else, or start on your own. If you can’t figure out how to “transform” an industry and make it tangible then it was never in the stars for you. 
12	ENTPs have to balance their own vision with what it takes to actually communicate and inspire change.  It's a hard road, and what I've learned to do is use my ENTP solution skills to learn how to manage change.  \n\nIt can be a tough balance to strike, but an ENTP that can inspire and manage change for other types is incredibly valuable to a company.  I worked for years as a consultant and built a practice with $100M book of business because I was able to build and communicate a vision. \n\nWhat kind of jobs are you working on?  I have several ENTPs who work for me, and I try to put them on the front end of projects so they can design and come up with solutions with users/customers. Then I phase them out because we suck at follow up.\n
8	Consulting. Consulting is the answer, especially if it's in something you care about (I specifically do environmental/energy consulting). You get paid for your ideas and for being a thinker while also getting a good grounding of knowledge in the field(s) in which you're working. I'm not detail-oriented enough to be a good electrical engineer, but I'm damn good at getting electrical engineers, state regulators, and environmental advocates to understand each other and formulate mutually acceptable strategy. Also a cool platform to set you up as an entrepreneur in the future, since you're exposed to a lot of different business problems, customer segments, etc.
6	I think iNtuitive types of people were inherently much more useful in a feudal system, as a members of aristocracy. If all your tribe is full of farmers, ENTP, INTJ, ENFP farmer would not bring much benefit to society. \n\nAlso, I strongly believe all those quirky personality characteristisc of every type are just used in tribal contextm without regard for that person's happiness. Person with paranoia - useful for defences. Night owl - night guard. OCD person - prevents spread of diseases, or may be the only one person not wiped up by a plague caused by filth. Borderline, histrionic person? More genetic variety at the cost of children wellbeing. ADHD? Useful, too. Strong Fi doms? Martyrs that made the birth of human rights possible. They're all incredibly useful, even if they hate being useful
3	I feel you, had the same. Wasn't able to land a job I knew I could handle. \n\nThe trouble for me was that I'm just not a specialst. I'm a generalist. I'm way more inclined to know a bit about many things then a lot about one thing. That's a good qualification to have in a manager, but not in a starter. \n\nTwo years ago I had enough and decided to become my own boss. Now I can control where my company is going. With my generalist nature I can do a bit of everything, which is usefull in the first startup phase. Now we're slowly starting to hire more people for specific tasks.\n\nProblem solved :) 
3	You have value in the job market when you contribute value. ENTPs often think having the idea is enough, but until you're at a stage where people take your ideas seriously, and where *you* have some inkling of how to implement them, you're not very useful to most employers (including being your own employer). It isn't enough to be smart and creative. Unless you can use said cleverness and creativity to turn profits, nobody cares. I never think about it as other people being "unable" to see my value, but as me failing to communicate my value to them.
3	Here is where I say the Myers Briggs does not have the scientific rigor to predict something like that about a person or group of people.
2	I have also had more jobs than anyone else I know. I write articles online. It's the best job ever. Much more fulfilling than following rules at some hourly dookey-bucket.
2	Also had more jobs than I can list/count, and I've done exceedingly well at all of them work/value-wise, they always make a special exonerated place for me and give me ample chances to fix my punctuality.  Most usually let me off with improvising and inventing on the job, even when there are procedures/protocols that should have been followed. I always quit/self sabotage and throw the great opportunity away eventually, usually due to external interests and overconfidence in means to get by.  Yep thrown away more great opportunities than I'll ever know, because I couldn't conform and suck up my unique Identity. Everyone seems to like me there too once I settle in.. and I seldom jostle for position and often let others shine and take credit for my ground work or saves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince I've found I can adapt to many different jobs, oh so many, usually unqualified too and become one of the best workers/employee's in my pay grade quite rapidly.. I don't think we are as fucked as most make us to be. It's the circumstances that matter.  \n\n\nAlmost anything so long as it has maximum freedom/flexibility and ample opportunities to solve problems/think on feet and is busy/challenging/full of things to learn.. And there's No EXTJ/IxTJ breathing down your kneck or putting a target on your head for not following there rules. \n\n  \nThis is where luck and necessity need to align a catered opportunity. Eventually SJ world find's a way to foil us time and time again :P 
2	I'm a Conceptual Designer (essentially Industrial Design) in training, so yeah, we do. You need to pick something that caters to your innate ability to brainstorm, make shit up, and just create interesting things with ease. My job is going to be doing concept art in the end, AKA that guy who made up that giant spider, that's also a car, and curses at people while going at 200 MPH.
2	Of course. ENTP’s have an amazing ability to effectively manipulate and utilise knowledge. That being said, we still have to work hard in order to first obtain that knowledge. Unfortunately, though we are brilliant, we still have to work hard to become experts in a field. That’s the difficult part. After that, any industry of today will be at our mercy. Best of luck! 
1	Other than the obvious confusion ( saying you understand the big picture but proceeding to say you are lost/ being too generic about what jobs and what industries...),your way of seeing this is very binary. Nothing is wrong with people and nothing is wrong with you. Doing a lot of jobs is fine but also can be dangerous. Implementing change in a society that refuses novelty is not something easy. That's why only very few people have succeeded.\n\nYou seem to be ambitious, that's good but it's better to be pragmatic. Know you limits before focusing on what can you do as an ENTP ( don't dream of making a breakthrough in physics with an IQ of <135 for example).\n\nAt the end of the day, most ENTPs fail to accomplish what comes easily to most people and it's not a sign of us being special rather than a weakness  that we need to work on harder than the other people.
1	To answer your question, yes. Of course. Why not? It takes all kinds to make the world go round as it were, that includes you ENTPs! If you can dream it you can achieve it. \n\nThere is a huge swath of possibilities, opportunities, and so on between the chasm hopeless idealism and overly cynical realism, and you can achieve your goals without falling into either of those extremes, both of them are equally defeatist. 
1	Learn and then start your own firm in STEM.   \nInspire investors to invest.\n\nGather people who want to achieve the goal and then get rich and change something. Others have done it, others are doing it and I am planning to do so currently.
1	I think it would depend on what marketable and in-demand skills an ENTP has, just like any other type, but being a certain type alone is not a marketable skill...
1	You are a generalist. You are supposed to build your own business and not serve under someone else. Many ENTPs are very well suited for entrepreneurship... 
1	I recently graduated. I interned in corporate finance and kinda hated it. Considering breaking into product management as it sounds like it might be up my alley. The key is don't focus on titles, pick up skills and work towards something in the long term. Don't jump around too much though. As much as you are a big idea person, you need to be able to implement them. 
1	ENTPs have risen to the top of the dominance hierarchy in every discipline. [Presidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama), [businessmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio), [inventors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison) (ones that didn't die as broke and wifeless pansies - fuck you Tesla), [entertainers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Weird_Al%22_Yankovic), [designers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci), [conquerors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great), [geniuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann). Easily the most versatile type. If you aren't accomplishing your dreams, your personality isn't to blame.
1	We can be great conversationalists - I usually get highest points from my boss for enthusiasm and friendliness. The trick is to respect your boss and be polite about offering up ideas - know you're place but also know that having the initiative to find better methods is appreciated by any good employer!
12	Choosing routine vs it being forced	So I'm normally a terrible self-taskmaster.  Like right now I should be packing for a trip but instead I'm typing  this because, well, it's on my mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, I hate being forced into routines.  I'll resist them even when they make sense if someone else is forcing me to do it.  But if I'm left to my own devices and parts of that routine occur as part of what I have to do to achieve whatever goal is in mind, I do it without a problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGetting my own place is a good example of this.  Fuck chores (tidying, laundry, making bed, doing dishes, etc) living with my parents, but after I got my own place, the only thing I basically don't do these days is make my bed.  If someone who sees it will care/judge me, if it help me find things better, or if it's good hygiene, I do it.  90% of chores fall into at least one of those criteria.  So I do them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel less volatile, more stable, when I have routines.  I still love and crave the same things (like I'm going on a week vacation by myself so that I can let down my performance, sort some things out, and practice my music), but these routines help me feel grounded.  And I really like that metaphor because when you've got solid ground beneath you, jumping is easier and landing doesn't cause you to twist your ankle when the ground shifts.  I've got something predictable to work with.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm making the assumption this is Si developing somewhat, but what I still find interesting is the distinction between forced and chosen when it comes to this.  Like everything else, nobody could tell me I was wrong.  The only way I could really learn this was by fucking up.
3	I'm with you! I was a messy teenager who turned into a neat freak as soon as she moved out of her parents' home. Of course, I think my neat freak mother did instill what my SO refers to as "nutjob" standards of cleanliness in me, but I'm essentially a functioning adult with a decently clean/organized apartment.\n\nI don't mind routine as long as it makes sense, rather than "just is". Routine helps maximize efficiency. If I want to lead a busy and productive life, it doesn't make sense to do stupid shit like "keep all my appointments in my head" rather than actually save them all in my calendar. \n\nFWIW, I still suck at Si, but I do recognize its value. Wrt routine, I think that as an NT, we'll be cool with routine so long as we understand the logic behind it - it just can't be arbitrary to us. 
2	Agreed. Still living with parents (18yo) and hate doing chores, especially when someone orders me to to them. But when they're leaving tho, like for vacation, and I stay home alone it's really much cleaner. It's just when I won't to them then no one will and it helps me to feel like I've got everything more under control 
2	Yes sir. Entrepreneurship even made me like accounting. Who would've thought.
8	How can we really connect with INFJ's?	I feel like I always flip into an unhealthier version of myself to some degree when in their presence. They question/demand alot sometimes and they find it hard to trust my ability/memory/thought process/consideration's.. they seem to change when I'm around aswel to a less natural version of themselves(other types bring there basic form back)\n\nThere motives/next moves/plans seem to be so well hidden and disguised to everyone else but myself. To me it's just so obvious.. and always disappointing down the track to know I was bang on right with my elaborate insightful gut feeling and predictions. They never give any indication or clues and are the best I've encountered by far at masking whats going on inside and their intentions.. but in retrospect my cold analysis and predictions are always correct about what/when/how they are really going to do. I wish I was ENFP and didn't see that side of them and we could just vibe off each others basic bullshit.\n\nBeing with an INFJ is like looking at some blueprint's and recognizing every individual part and piece, discerning all the thing's it should be capable of, but not knowing what the true purpose is of the machine or even it's name.\n\nWhy are they such a mystery.. do they purposely mess with ENTP to keep up the snow-flake syndrome or because they think we're handicapped?\n\nI postulate ENTP is allways trying to figure the INFJ out(the un-figurable, motivation wise) INFJ is always trying to manipulate ENTP to display likeness akin to how they interact with  your average run of the mill ENFP that they're more accustomed too. \n\nENTP is hoping for the day INFJ finally becomes ultimately awesome and dares to go deeper intellectually while INFJ is hoping eventually, for ENTP to be warm, sympathizing and really vibe with compassion in the moment.  INFJ is let down and saddened, ENTP is annoyed and detaching from failure. \n\n&#x200B;
16	Huh, I have a pretty different experience of INFJs from you. I feel like they make everything more complicated than need be, therefore obfuscating their own desires from themselves. To me, they are usually fairly transparent. I never think they're intentionally trying to mislead, so much as they're just hella confused themselves.
11	Being ENFP doesn't make you blind to the INFJ. I see right through them just as much. You're searching too much inside a glass labrirynth. They're just like their privacy and naturally curious types can project whatever they want onto that blank slate. Don't expect them to live up to their potential. what you're seeing IS their potential. They will usually NEVER do anything with their insightful deductions as the search and discovery of them is a reward in it of itself. INFJ's are known for feeling like you never really know them but that's all it is, a FEELING that you don't know them. Not that you don't, But yeah, the two INFJ's in my life do get a kick out of being seen as mysterious.
5	Nothing can actually connect with an INFJ, lol not even themselves.
4	I’ve had a pretty different experience with my INFJ than you. Sometimes I don’t understand his motives, but I think he does a great job explaining why he does/thinks the way he does. I find the parts I don’t understand interesting and it keeps me wanting more. I think he might enjoy being mysterious a bit, but despite what he says and how sure he is that he could be alone forever I can’t help but think he enjoys having someone that understands him more than others. He’s definitely closed off, but over time I get more and more from him. Most people bore me after a couple months, but I don’t see myself getting bored of him anytime soon. I really don’t have anything negative to say about him or his personality. That’s my only experience with an actual INFJ. Now, their subreddit puts me on the verge of suicide. For some reason I frequent it more than any other subreddit other than this one, and every time I leave frustrated. Do I enjoy this frustration? Probably. But it sends me over the edge. So much snowflake bullshit, so much “this is my home,” so much no one understands me garbage that I feel the need to bathe in holy water after looking at their shit. If I see one more “how do I find an INFJ!” post I’m going to lose my ever living shit. I like my INFJ very much, but holy fuck people need to stop glorifying a type. We all know ENTPs are better. 
3	Yeah, well, I hate being an INFJ. Wish I would be an ENTP instead. 
2	INFJ goal: Fundamentally change the world for the better -so that innocence is not/less harmed- at a core level so that it can never be undone. Everything funnels into that; Ni does not change.\n\nWonder no more, please.
2	We are also a mystery to ourselves 🤷🏻‍♀️
1	Dissapointing I was hoping to get the serious dealing to or ultimatum by an INFJ that would of sent me to noddy land and back  or at least verbally bashed by some ENTP elders out there who are more cognizant  than my current Ne-Fe looping mid bender self. You all must of sniffed boredom! Or maybe my arm pits... the heat is so extreme mid summer with no ozone layer. \n\nWell played guys.. no going down a martyr for Dizzy today.\n\n&#x200B;
1	I have INFJ cousin, my uncle's daughter, and I spent helluva lot of time at their house, cos I was friends with her brother and her parents are like second (better) parents to me and I still know shit about her.
3	I'm late 95% of the time, even when I try my hardest to be on time. Wonder if this has anything to do with being ENTP. Ideas?	Saw on r/NoStupidQuestions about why some people are always late and it got me thinking. The answers on there seem to be lacking detail, and I can't really relate to many of them.
11	ENTPs are always late and full of apologies, yet it seems they can’t help it even if they tried. There are two reasons why the ENTP can’t be on time:\n\nThey are bad at estimating time needed to accomplish a task,\nthey tend to get sidetracked.   \n\nEven when ENTPs begin their preparations early, they will usually get distracted in the process and the next thing they know it’s time they are supposed to be somewhere else.  \n  \nedit: No one seems to care that this is just an ENFP description from a random website that I copied and pasted with ENTP/ENFP swapped.  Source: https://psychologia.co/10-ways-enfp-annoy-others/
7	Pretend your time of arrival is a full half-hour before your actual time of arrival. Genuinely pretend - don't just wake up and think to yourself, "Eh, I've *actually* got at least another 30 minutes, so..." \n\nBoom; you'll generally be on time. It's all a matter of developing a system that works for you. Sometimes you have to hardwire yourself into it.\n\n(ETA - if I think my time of arrival is my actual time of arrival, I am invariably at least 10-15 minutes late. It's because I try to get away with as much as I can with every additional minute, leading me to miss my turn/miss my bus/overshoot my route by a block/etc. That may be an ENTP thing, I don't know.)
3	Force yourself to become more aware of opportunity costs. Acknowledge that you don't have enough time to do *everything* you want, and actively make a choice of what you are going to prioritize/be on time for rather than letting your inaction make that choice for you.
2	I’m the same way, and I’ve noticed that I have an irrational fear of being early, which almost always pushes me into being a least a little late to almost all appointments. On the rare occasion that I’m out of bed and and showered earlier than I need to be, i’ll feel like a chump and end up trying to fill the time with twitter or some chores. All of a sudden, I’m 15 minutes late for where I’m going. Then I really feel like a fucking idiot 
1	Yes it does, at least for me. I can never seem to be on time anywhere and for anyone. I’m surprised I still have a job hahaha but that’s mainly because of the warnings I got from my boss. \n\nAlso, I literally have too many alarms to count and a chime app on all my devices. It’s all just so I can stop procrastinating, do my assignments and work, and get things done. 
1	These days I make it a habit of blocking out hours just for an event. It works. \n\nThe truth is that if you are really preparing, there will be other things in your way that you have to deal with. Plus contingencies that can make you late. \n\nFor instance I’m typing this in lo and behold a traffic jam. Perfect that my appointment is a hour later. 
1	Same. I’m pretty much always late for the fact that I don’t have a good concept of time. Also I HATE waiting so being early on something seems worse to me lol
1	That's some of the P for ya!
1	Just leave super early and bring a book or work you can do on your phone.
5	Idealizing every conversation	If every conversation doesnt go exactly the way I want to, I dont say the perfect thing, I dont have the perfect reaction I start beating myself over it and feel extremely shitty afterwards. I switch between getting motivated and researching socialskills forums to start over and go into conversations ready to beating myself over the slightest inconvenience and falling into this shitty feeling, repeating the process and never getting out. Its been like this for two years. I wake up and say to myself that this is THE DAY I wont fail myself, and do the exact same thing I said I wont do 2 hours into the day, leaving me either cope or overthink and shut myself off from society. I need a way out because I dont know how long I can keep this going. Now that I think about it I might or might not have BPD or Im just a failure.
5	You're taking things way too seriously. Calm down, and realize you're the only one thinking anything close to this about your performance. It doesn't *really* matter as much as your internal dialogue is making you think it does. 
2	Conversations are awkward for everyone; it’s ok. Look at people all around you being awkward or just barely dodging awkwardness. It’s a struggle. I know it might not be helpful since you might not be able to help yourself, but don’t beat yourself up about it. \n\nIf you’re on the younger side, like in your teens, things will get better, at least they did for me. Also BPD is pretty serious so if you think you have it you ought to get it checked out. 
2	Yeah I had this too and it sucks. I realized being comfortable in your skin and not giving a fuck goes a long way. When I tried to be something I wasn’t or didn’t align with my beliefs this got worse so be yourself don’t try to fit in a perfect persona and try to silence your mind every once in a while 
4	What do you do for exercise? How do you keep yourself accountable to the routine?	I've reached the point where my metabolism can't keep up with my shitty eating/drinking habits. Those habits i've learned how to address, but I still need to work off some of the thiccness I've accrued. \n\n**What do you do for exercise? How have you made the [gym/running/etc] routine? Any mental strategies or tips that help keep your committed?**\n\nI honestly loathe physical exertion, and can't seem to maintain gym routines for more than a week. In the past when I was actually swole it was cuz I had a good set of weights & a bench at home allowing me to do a full workout from the comfort of home.  \n\n
5	I hike.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do it because I love it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find excuses to go hiking, and the harder and further I push myself the better I feel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm like |--| close to taking a week portion of the Appalachian trail.
3	To quote a motivational speaker: **JUST DO IT**.\n\nYou've been swole before. You know the dedication required. Step one, stop making excuses. Be honest with yourself. This isn't your "metabolism" failing to keep up with shitty habits — it's shitty habits, full stop. Unless you're Gregor the fucking Mountain or an anorexic African with a subtended stomach, your metabolism is fine. \n\nStart tracking calories. Download myfitnesspal and track fucking everything you take in. That includes olive oil out cook with, BBQ dipping sauce, and that soda pop you're drinking. It's easy and intuitive to use. Abs are made in the kitchen, and the same holds true for cutting your "thiccness" (again, be honest with yourself, this is adipose tissue accumulating). \n\nSet *specific* goals. Don't just say "man I wanna get swole again". Say "I'm going to the gym Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 11 am." The more specific your goals, the more accountable you are. You don't just want to lose weight, you want to start eating x meal at Y time in Z proportion. It's tougher to do because we hate blaming ourselves for violating our own goals. When you're vague, you can make excuses like "my metabolism is slowing". Even if your metabolism magically slowed by 20%, all that means is roughly a 400 calorie differential per day (that's foregoing the extra donut at breakfast).\n\nIf you want to get into a routine, set a fucking routine. "I'm going to begin Strong Lift 5x5 program, and hit the gym Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday". That's a routine, and you've committed to it. After you do this for a few weeks, you'll have set a habit. What's your goal? To be swole and hot. If it was easy, everyone would do it.\n\nOkay, you've finally gotten off your lazy ass and hit the residence of Iron Will. What now? Commit yourself. Follow through on the workout plan. Proper form. Read how to do the lifts, make sure you feel the lifts where you're supposed to (you *are* reading about how to lift safely, right?) Don't ego lift, start light. Maybe you were a beast benching two plates in your home 4 years ago. Well that time is gone and you're fat now. Start with half a plate and focus on form. \n\nIf you're not sweating in the gym, you're not trying hard enough. Up the cardio speed, or stop resting for too long before sets. If you're not exhausted at the end of your workout, you didn't do a proper workout. But don't *over* exert yourself, you still have to lift safely. \n\nEmbrace the DOMS. Don't use it as an excuse to discontinue working out. If you're sore, **good**. Keep up the good work and exercise a different muscle the next time. Stretching is good. If you're still sore a week later, you either didn't stretch enough, or you over exerted yourself. That's fine, just be mindful about it for next time. \n\nSee what I'm getting at here? Specifics. Be *specific", not vague. Vague goals are an excellent way to never accomplish them. Break everything down into detail. Have a *plan*. Commit yourself. Make a shopping list to pick up what you need at the store for your specific meals. If you need a cheat day to help yourself commit, fine. Incorporate a cheat day on Sunday to eat whatever you want in whatever quantity you want to reward yourself for a great diet.\n\nCut the drinking down, or completely. Alcohol is empty calories. 7 calories per gram of alcohol, that adds up! One shot of vodka is 100 calories. Four standard drinks is an extra 400 calories in your diet. Be mindful of that. Track your weight on the scale every day to get a baseline. \n\nIn short, stop making fucking excuses. Set a specific goal and commit to it. **JUST DO IT**. Sound difficult? That's because it is. If it was easy, everyone would be swole. If, after setting specific goals, you still find yourself lethargic and unable to get off your lazy ass, then that could be indicative of potential depression or other anxiety inducing disorders. In which case, seek a therapist. \n\nSource: swole af. Regular gym goer for years. 
2	I feel all entps do jui jitsu. It’s like a puzzle. And exercise.
2	There are a few ways to view it, and people's motivations vary, for some people the desire for the benefits of working out are enough, although I think it's much less of a chore if you figure out something that you enjoy doing rather than simply wanting the results.  For instance I don't mind working out, but I hate making a trip to the gymn, so that's a routine I'll never keep.  Running isn't so bad because I can choose to do it and 5 minutes later my shoes are on and I'm out the door, and a nice run through back roads and a bit of exploring can be fun.  I think one way or another you have to find something you can moderately enjoy doing, rather than just chasing the desired results.
1	In my oppinion, i have tried every way. Gym didn't work for me, then i started using an app called freeletics (very good app, but very hard). \nFinally i tried a personal trainer, and i think it's the best way. The routine is prepared especifically for you, you get someone who knows about this tracking your progress and checking you're doing the excercices the right way.\nThe price for 2 classes a week, in my country at least (Argentina), is the same price as gym membership. \nAbout the bad eating habits, step by step, first i cut sugar, then cookies, sodas and all that stuff. The body will get used to it. I think it's been 3 years i don't drinks sodas and now i can't tolerqte them.\n
1	Door frame pullup bar. Set of olympic rings. Do pullups, dips, roll-outs, tricep extensions, leg raises, or whatever else your heart desires. Harder to find a good excuse when you walk past it every day.
1	I do go to the gym 6 or 7 times a week if im not travelling or sick, and i do run 2 or 3 times a week.\n\nMotivation get you started but discipline get you going, create a routine that you just have to do it, ex. you’re going to only work out on monday and Wednesday at 8:00 o’clock, and you are going to do it, doesn’t matter if is raining, snowing or you are feeling crappy, it’s important that your actions doesn’t depends on your moment feeling, don’t even consider just do it, after it becomes a habit you will stop struggling with it. 
1	Is there any physical activity you enjoy? I was extremely fit and shredded for years because of martial arts/ muay thai, and to me I wasn't necessarily going to exercise or train or anything like that, I was just practicing a fun hobby.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I have since quit due to fear of head trauma down the line. I lift weights now 3x a week and do cardio 1 or 2x a week, which I do enjoy (but it is a little bit of a chore sometimes). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut yeah, find something fun that is good at keeping you fit, and do that.
1	Skateboarding, surfing, and the occasional 2 hour swim at the pools for cardio.\n\nI don't keep myself accountable, they are my hobbies, I enjoy them, I dream about them, and when I'm not working or with family I'll be doing one of these activities for pleasure. They are more fun when you get to do them with a friend or group, but even solitary is fine as well. Exercise is a secondary but welcomed effect of these hobbies. \n\nI should also mention, if you have a high carb diet, you will have a hard time losing weight no matter how hard you exercise. It depends on how shitty your eating habits specifically are (as you put it). But basically the more you consume, the more insulin you produce, and insulin inhibits almost every hormone that stimulates lipolysis (I think except for growth hormone). This effect happens independently of exercise, and as a result, there are a lot of postprandial post exercise ketosis studies out there that make it look like exercise has no effect on ketosis / lipolysis / weight loss. Which isn't true, you just need to be in a fasted state, so that when you're producing adrenaline during exercise, it isn't being nerf'd by insulin. \n\nI don't know what your snacking habits are like, but if you can't handle fasting, then try not snacking. Because technically your glucose insulin levels should drop to fasting state levels periodically in-between meals. It's not a long period of time, but it's long enough that over time you should slowly lose weight.\n\nAnyways good luck.
1	I don't, because \n\na) My job is a physical one and \n\nb) exercise is not an efficient way to keep your weight down. \n\nDiet is much easier and far more effective. You will however, have to cut down on your drinking. Trust me, I know that's a hard one. But again, easier than a workout routine. 
1	I think martial arts and tennis/ping pong are the exercises that fit our personality most. I LOVE tennis, I ve tried a bunch of sports in the past and tennis is the only one that is not boring to me. It’s a very mental game and at some point you forget you are even exercising. The most mind-numbing boring is the goddamn gym or any repetitive exercise 
1	I lift weights 3-5x/wk depending on my schedule. I've only been lifting for like a year and haven't been the greatest when it comes to dieting and macros etc, but still look the best I ever have. My motivation is purely narcissistic lol, I go to the gym because I like looking at myself in the mirror when I'm done.\n\nYou've just gotta find the initial motivation to stick with a routine for a month, and then you'll feel weird not going to the gym so you'll just kinda keep going. 
1	[deleted]
1	I do weight training 4/5 times a week. Results are the most motivating factor for sure. Looking in the mirror and seeing improvements will remind you that the pain is worth it. Also, try not to exert yourself too much. Go light, so that you can go often. 
1	Group exercise is great for this. Crossfit is a little dangerous and should be approached slowly but the culture is very stimulating. MMA, boxing, BJJ are all fun, and very good workouts. Kickboxing classes, bootcamps that are HIIT oriented
1	MMA. my inherit desire to be in control coupled with my truly unhealthy competitive spirit, stubborn will, and true hatred of vulnerability constantly drives me to work harder and be the best. It also forces you to accept that you will never be the biggest fish and introduces a nice healthy self introspection that builds your confidence while still allowing for a healthy humbling experience.
7	Slow processing of emotions	[Yes, I sound like a robot here.] \n\nI find that when I recieve unexpected and emotionally unpleasant situations, I'll be completely emotionless and then process those emotions (not a lot but a tiny bit) a few days later in a completely calm and detached way, if that can actually happen. It is unlike my childhood and honestly I'm pleasantly surprised at how I'm not as affected by people than when I was younger but my _feelings_ seem to be really slow to process lately. It'll either hit me hard immediately or days later and I wonder if it's some kind of health problem (probably not) or a brain problem (MBTI aka thought process) and I think it's more of the latter. Sometimes I hear a few EXTX talk about this as well, so have you ever experienced this before? 
7	Yup. Same. I feel like a deer in the headlights with intense emotions. I don't immediately respond and, depending on the situation, will go hours or days before I've felt I've properly processed. I refuse, almost on principal, to share my initial feeling or reaction. It has been an effective strategy in handling volatile situations, but... I'm beginning to wonder if it also prevents me from connecting to people emotionally. So. This year, I'm going to try to, at a minimum, describe my feelings as they occur. So. :clears throat: This makes me uncomfortable.
2	I definitely relate. I process emotions on my own time, haha
1	Not so much with day to day stuff, but if something really important happens I don't usually feel stuff in the moment
1	I feel that 100%. It’ll usually take me a few hours or a day to actually process emotion 
1	Infj here. I figured out that this is the best way to deal with stressful situations. I try to do that consciously to stay functional, but I can't always pull it off. I think it's a self-protection strategy for me.
1	Oh yeah, I do the same and so does my INTP dad.  We take a little longer and have to work a little harder to process big things.  I, personally, process big things by pushing it to the back of my head and letting it simmer until I've figured it out.  It looks like I'm ignoring it entirely, but I'm just working at it while I get other stuff done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: this can make us excellent emergency responders.  In an emergency my emotions completely shut down and I can handle it and deal with the emotional aspect later.
1	“Emotion can be the enemy, if you give into your emotion, you lose yourself. You must be at one with your emotions, because the body always follows the mind.”
1	Brain regions we use less can take 2-3 more seconds to output something than our most used regions.   \n  \nIve been relating to this recently through making decisions and possibly changing my mind about things im offered and my initial response is 'no'.
89	ENTPs are NOT always flirting with you!	This drives me crazy!! Other types think that ENTPs are flirting all the time and that they can’t be trusted in a relationship. \nENTPs can be serious and they’re one of the most faithful types ever. When they talk to others, they try to be funny, interesting, spontaneous, and smart but that does NOT mean that they’re interested in taking your number or Instagram or anything like that. \n\nCan other ENTPs here please share their experience with this and clarify to other types once and for all that we don’t mean to flirt with anyone when we’re just being ourselves! 😑
73	I flirt with everything that moves (or doesn't).\n\nGirls, guys, dogs, your grandma, the bank clerk, marble statues, plants, electrical devices, guns and heavy machinery.
45	This is so true. So many people either think I have a crush on them or hate them due to me just being myself.
41	I found the solution to this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Isolate myself\n2. stop talking to anyone\n3. ...
37	I once heard it put this way. ENTP flirt en mass. In  social interaction our entire demeanor is so open minded and inquisitive it almost certainly appears like flirting. Wait for the kicker... we can do this with almost anyone. \n\nTo those who don’t know you personally you will appear like a serial flirter. 
35	Please! If I was flirting with that person I'd have been all awkward and nervous rather than suave, sure, and collected.
77	If you’re not psychologically toying with someone, what’s the point of the conversation?
22	Or we are flirting because we want something from you. That thing might not be sex, though. 
19	Yup what we think is witty banter usually gets mistaken by others as ‘flirting’. It’s even funnier in the case of female ENTPs though, cuz males are not used to such assertive witty females so they don’t really know how to handle us.😂 Then they typically tell their friends about us and next thing you see is the whole group giving you side glances & treating you as if you are an animal at the zoo.👀 The other scenario is the person actually starts liking you and gets clingy.😑 Then you have no option but to ghost them and shit hits the fan for them! \n\nI was called ‘hot n cold’ by some guys for this before. They really have NO idea.😂
15	Agree. But I do like to flirt with everyone, even gay men, and I'm straight. Just for the banter. I like it. Flirting is a social battle of attraction, and I fucking love that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWho else finds it hard to say something without trying to make it funny? 
15	According to one of my friends “you’re like half of the time a terrible fuckboy and the other half an asexual.” Yeah people get that impression 
11	Hello! Fellow ENTP here! I've been described as flirty just after giving someone a compliment. I've been accused of being gay for telling a guy his eyes look really bright. If I like something about someone, I want to tell them. I don't go around telling all the girls they're the most beautiful things I've ever seen, but I see a really cool ear piercing or if they're outfit looks awesome (guy or girl), they deserve to hear it. 
6	I had a coworker say she and her sister thought I was flirting with her for the first few weeks I worked there until they realized I just do that with everybody. She said it’s like a thing I do to get a feel of a person, it’s a little provocative and I eventually tone it down once I’ve figured out how to talk to the person individually. I think this explains it pretty accurately. 
5	Seriously I will flirt with as a joke all of my girl friends just because its hilarious when were drunk. Its more like overly complimentary just to flatter them as a joke. Pretty much just showing off how I can think of all this stuff.
4	Yeap- there's nothing like having a rousing conversation with someone only to find out that- oh look, shit, I think they're under the impression I'm (sexually) interested when in reality I'm just talking.  \n\nThe rub is that ENTPs generally do the talking better than non-ENTPs.  Non-ENTPs have to put 110%+ effort into doing the talking as good as the ENTP does in their sleep.  This means they'd only do the talking this good if they really, really liked me/wanted something from me.  Ergo, this person is putting in 110%+ effort into this conversation because they're sexually interested in me (b/c that's the only reason **I'd** put this much effort into the conversation).  \n\nFiguring out the way others think does not come naturally to most of the other types, therefore they are limited to accessing logic only available through their own mind's rational patterns.  This ends up with **everything** being filtered through that pattern (the only one that makes sense to them).  i.e. You're flirting with them because this is very similar to the way they'd flirt with you (if they could).\n\nIt's kind of like being a skilled artist at the top of their game.  Someone invites you over their house for dinner, and you think man, I should bring a gift.  Oh, I know, I'm super-good at painting and I could easily throw together a little something in the couple hours before dinner.  Next day, the person is bragging to all their coworkers about how interested you are in them because of all the time it must've taken you to paint them such a nice picture.   Then you're sitting there thinking, man this person's acting really weird.  I literally just spent an hour and a half regurgitating paint onto a canvas- what's the big deal?
4	I don't know any other social way of being than flirting. Social me = flirting. That you are a boy, a woman, a grandpa, an African, a dog, an alien. I smile, I'm interested in what you say, what you think and feel. I want to share everything and I want to create some emotional bonds, sometimes using your personal story and feelings for it, because with just a few info on you, I know what gets to your heart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou were playing hockey when you were young? I'll make you talk about it and will listen and will feel your pain of why you're not playing anymore. I guess that is what people call flirting. I don't do it on purpose, I just care about every person I interact with, or almost every person, at least in the moment.\n\nI wish being interested in everyone didn't scare people from being in a serious relationship with me. It doesn't mean I want to sleep with everyone. That's generally not the reason ENTP flirt I think. Sex is not a goal for ENTP from what I understood. The interaction is what amuses us.
8	Oh yes. It‘s annoying because people act weirdly around me because of that. \n\nFor instance there was a guy I found funny because he reminded me of my friends. So I approached him and talked to him. After that he always gave me side glances which made me think „Did I do sth wrong?“. When I thought about it, usually girls don‘t go to guys and ask them hundreds of questions, like what‘s the sticker mean on their laptop etc, the first time they meet. \n\nHe probably thought I liked him, but that I was weird because I accidentally forgot/ignored him the next day and didn‘t even greet. Now he‘s avoiding me like a disease lmfao but it‘s kinda sad because I wanted to be friends\n\nPeople take things way too seriously 
3	Dude for real. The moment I find someone I deeply care about, that person is it. I end up investing so much time and care in them that I end up forgetting how to converse with other men, much less flirt, so our conversations end up being 80% silence. If someone tries to flirt with me other than said person, I'm dead silent with awkwardness. 
3	Bahaha my friends are always giving me shit for flirting with everyone. I honestly rarely flirt with anyone intentionally. I didn’t realize this was an ENTP thing 
3	This happens at my job way too much. I like the attention but at the same time I'm in a relationship and I'm not comfortable with cheating. I cought a couple girls talking about me saying I was cute. Also I keep getting asked to be taught how to use certain machines and equipment by girls who will never need to use it for there department. They also get kind of graby which is usually when I figure out what they're interest really are haha.\n\nSorry for the long comment it's just good to see I'm not the only one and it's just an ENTP thing.
2	well my flirting is like normal convo so i dont think all entp's work the same way
2	thanks for the heads up babe, see you on our date later
2	Back in college, I was told by a girl that I make girls like them but then they see me talking with many other girls the same way.\nShe was quite sad. \n\nThat's when I found out what OP was talking about. 
2	I have been accused of flirting with many girls that I never thought I was flirting with. Can confirm. Has gotten me into trouble with girlfriend before. 
2	I ended up accidentally leading a guy on for over a year bc I didn’t realize how flirty I was being it’s a Curse
3	Unlike the ENFP and ENFJ who totally does it on purpose to one up you or hurt you :P \n\nI don’t have this problem as much (or I’m just obvious to it now)since I’ve matured, but people still totally mistake my motives due to tertiary Fe.. and either think I’m trying to deceive them when I’m not or I’m totally being fake and have a hidden agenda. All while I’m being fully upfront and sarcastically poking fun at myself and them. \n\nI think a lot more talking behind our backs goes on then when actually realise or care to acknowledge, from other types who want to shut us down for whatever reasons. Because we don’t really consider this we  just be ourselves and play right into jealous haters hands who has been planting seeds of doubt about us. Eg ENTP is totally immoral and has no regard for values and feelings, he just toys with people and hurts them, watch next time your around them.
1	Something similar happened the other day. I told this girl that I liked her and apparently it surprised her. She said that coz I spontaneously went from joking around to something more serious that it was unexpected.
1	I more often than not purposely flirted back in grade school, but only to push the boundaries and see how far I could go.  I was also very public about it too, felt it was an accomplishment to have pushed to a certain degree.\n\nNow in my 30's I've changed a lot and I rarely flirt (I miss the old days).  But it often gets misunderstood as flirting.   More annoying is the few times they back off because of that.\n\nThey flatter themselves but this is just how I am!
1	Maybe its others who are to blame, sorry i stay positive and are interested in exploring ideas regardless of the person
1	I’m not flirting with everybody? 
1	I'm always flirting, with every bit of word which escapes my lush lips. ^(not sarcasm)
1	Idk I mean I'm a pretty big flirt. Like there are times when I'm not flirting but I can see how it can get mixed up because I definitely have an outgoing, playful and kind of sexual and teasing vibe going. Maybe our charm just gets confused for flirting
1	.....yeah I am
1	Yeah for sure. I smirk a lot and have one of those voices that sounds amused/intrigued most often. I also appreciate when people put time into developing a skill, so I'll compliment them about it. It's just my personality. If someone wonders if I'm interested romantically, then I'm not. I make my intentions clear by saying "Hey, I like you, let's go out for some drinks." haha not "Hey, it really shows that you spent a lot of time practicing guitar. Keep it up." 
1	Yeah nah same here I don't even like flirting, jus being friendly. Like fuck lemme just live like a normal bitch for a dAy and not get falsely labelled all the time.
1	I think I'm perfectly stuck in funny mode ):
1	"ENTPs can be serious and they're one of the most faithful types ever."\n\nI have yet to witness this in person.\n\nPlease explain (since nearly all these comments point in the opposite direction).
1	We're not?
1	If someone instantly assume I'm flirting, I use it as an indicator for whom not to befriend or date. They simply lack open-mindedness and are not curious enough to question their opinion.\n(My boyfriend and friends today are awesome, so mission accomplished!)
1	i am both of these people. like there is a 70% chance im flirting with you, either jokingly or because i want into your pants, and a 30% chance i am trying to make a decent conversation. these traits both look incredibly similar
1	well you know its not always a problem but , a few girls just fell for me after i talked to them for a few days , they all say that they love my sense of humor and all\n\nits pretty great sometimes but its can be a pain in the ass
1	Well I already heard shit like girls telling me "Yeah cuz we were flirting the other day".\n\nIn my mind I'm like "Were we? WTF is she talking about?" when I actually behaved the same way I do with everyone.\n\nI have to admit I like to appeal to everyone, but not necessarily in an intimate way.
1	Entp have an innate desire to be liked by others, or have others be attracted to them, sometimes flirting almost unconsciously. Excluding the need for social rebellion and desire to push boundaries.
4	Is this guy an ENTP??	
5	I don't know. He doesn't seem to be able to hold eye contact.
1	I dunno, his eyebrows are captivating af 
3	Combining Things: Mongolian Throat Metal (Thoughts?)	
2	Yeah, I love Finngolian songs as well.\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhO9j0G61Ac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhO9j0G61Ac) \n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR0ajCBFiII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR0ajCBFiII) 
2	I just realized that I've never seen modern Mongolians until now
2	This is great, I've been a fan of throat singing for a while and really like these guys' updated take on the genre. 
3	Why is r/estj full of relationship advice?	And why is there only 1.5k of them on Reddit, when they're supposed to be one of the most common personalities(11%)? 
11	ESTJs aren’t really into things that aren’t insanely practical, and in my experience, really aren’t big into personality tests. 
8	Assuming certain sites and interests filter out people, it is possible that a common type in the general sense is not represented in a specific location. Maybe estj doesn't seek out MBTI and reddits about their type as much as entp do.\n\nThat is a possiblity only. I don't know if it is the case.
9	Because let's be honest here, would you date an estj? 
0	Due to lack of N, they don't seek insight but ask this superficial questions. 
0	second try	whats up yall, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nlurked on here for a while and took the test and am coming to terms with my personality type. ENTP-PISCES is what I am so I wrote a song about it. lol, r/ADHD banned me for posting this so im sure yall will love it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand if you hate it but i would appreciate not being banned lol\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQgVL4i3olY&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQgVL4i3olY&feature=youtu.be)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/akklof/song\_road\_to\_reckoning\_artist\_lefty\_nosam/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/akklof/song_road_to_reckoning_artist_lefty_nosam/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\ncheers, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMason AKA lefty nosam

28	Being mean/taking things too far	Hi all, long time lurker. \n\nI am called mean/bully sometimes but I have lots of friends and people still seem to love me despite this. I think it's a combination of the debating everything, knowing how to push people's buttons and other things.\n\n Sometimes I don't feel any remorse or anything but I feel "bad" , but it's more like 'oh does this person now think bad of me' rather than like oh I upset them. But I do sometimes feel genuinely bad in hindsight and thinking why did I keep arguing/saying things I shouldn't have (but like quickly pop into my head) when I was just upsetting the person. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience/advice in just being a nicer person (which I do believe I am) and holding your tongue when you wanna say something witty/unkind/etc? 
42	Not an ENTP, but I tend to categorize you guys as 'likable assholes'. You make up for your bluntness and social 'blunders' (i.e. taking things to far) with being generally kind and playful(or not so serious atleast).\n\n You'll probably upset people who take things personally, and assume you're being mean and to critical. You're best bet is probably trying to take notice to how people feel more (use your Fe) and adjusting. While also resisting the urge to point our inconsistencies all the time, especially if it's being done unkindly. Some people might feel that your critizing *them* rather then 'just' their ideas.\n
18	Learning to hold your tongue is a great first step to being nicer, I'd go with that. It works for me... when I do it... Instead, I just smile. Hey, maybe that's what that "ENTP grin" phenomenon is. Anyway, I rarely ever regret NOT saying something. It's a win/win. Give it a try.   \n\n\nAlso, learn to use your wit to attack the scenarios, situations, etc., instead of the people. Push their buttons in a motivational way instead of a destructive way. Yeah, I know. None of this is going to give you a sudden change, but in changing your intent, you'll start growing in the direction that you want to. 
6	I think ENTPs think it’s ok to do a lot of these things because they still keep people around. But you gotta ask what type of people are still around you. Just because you have a lot of people who on the surface still like you doesn’t mean they genuinely want to be your friend or likes you. \n\nIf you want to be at a point where you are genuinely making connections with people and have a solid group of friends who actually care about your wellbeing, then you have to be better about other people’s feelings. Practice empathy and think about how someone might feel before you start arguing. That reflection is really important and will help you in the long run. 
3	How old are you? I definitely struggled with this when I was younger (high school but it carried on a bit into college). I still take things too far, but post-college me is more chill in these regards. \n\nE.g.: in college I had to sit down with several different people who were close to me, people about whom I cared a lot but who were newer in my life, and explain to them that I do care about them a ton and never meant to make them feel badly. Those convos were apologies at face-value, but also served to sort of clarify my tendency to cross lines when joking, though I never intend it to be truly upsetting (I’d often throw in a comment about how there’d be no mistake whatsoever if I was genuinely trying to be hurtful, because I have that ENTP knack for recognizing people’s deeply buried shame and insecurities even when they themselves might not know those things). \n\nThose convos suck, and each one helped me become more aware of the ways where I was failing to reign myself in sufficiently. While I often didn’t feel “remorseful” or like I was in the wrong in situations where I’d have to sit down and handle the repercussions of my behavior, I did over time figure out that small adjustments to my laissez faire sense of humor make socializing easier and more successful. \n\nI don’t think dealing with the interpersonal repercussions of my over-the-line funmaking is the only thing that helped me become better—just general maturation and experiencing meeting more and different people certainly made me more self aware. I’m sure I felt at one point like my callous humor was just a part of me that I couldn’t fully reign in. Over the years, I just sort of got a clue and got tired of the drama I’d more or less be creating and subconscious adjustments were made. \n\nI’m way less of an asshole today than I was 8 years ago. 
2	Yearh this is me, i tend to go a bit far and then get a bit anxious about people liking me, once im alone and i think things through.  The weird thing is i often feel over confident In the given social situation lol. Doesnt make sense. 
2	There's a lot to say about trying to be as mindful about others and their feelings as you can. I feel very sensitive to other's feelings, but it's not always true. Despite my best efforts I am sometimes told that I am intimidating and condescending and a mental bully. \n\nMost people don't feel this way though. Many personality types equate challenging their ideas with personal attacks and judgment. Most who get to know you will understand you don't mean it personally. For me it's a do unto others as I want them to do unto me thing. If I say something wrong, I want to be corrected, but in the most positive way possible. \n\nBest I can say is learn to identify quickly when people are hurt easily and back off as fast as you can, even when you are sure you've done nothing wrong. Personally, I can't apologize for something I don't think is wrong, but I can apologize for unwittingly intimidating or hurting someone. 
1	I try not to be, but sometimes I just can't help myself, if the joke is too good to let lie. My friends have the sense to know there is no malice behind it though.\n\nOn the other hand, if it's an enemy we are talking about, I can be particularly savage & vindictive, to the point where even other people who don't like said person tell me I'm being too mean.
1	I am VERY against the type of people I dislike the most. Those who have no curiousity, imagination, like too much mundane crap, boring way of doing things (S) **PLUS** Stupid, dumb, incompetent, lack intellect or don't think **PLUS** Trying to control me, or tell me to do shit that I already know how to do.\n\nI will be mean to these MFers **if they get in my way** for sure!
1	I still struggle with this so I’m not sure if I’m the best person to give advice. Nevertheless, I’ll just say what I typically do when I feel like that. I just stay quiet and smile like someone else said, it seems to make the other person less uneasy/anxious. Though I will say that I rarely take things too far with people who I don’t care too much about, I only engage in this type of behaviour with my closest friends and family. So for me personally, even though I may come off as an over-analytical jerk, it’s only because I care about that person & want them to grow mentally or spiritually. Although it may seem that way, it usually is NOT an attack on them personally, it’s an extremely blunt criticism of their ideas or philosophy. Not saying that’s an excuse for being argumentative or rude, but that’s my rationale for such behaviour. \n\nNow I think I have sort of understood the hard way that majority of others (obviously) don’t think the way we do and don’t have a growth & self-improvement mindset like us. They clutch onto their ways & ideas hard and are not open to self introspection because quite frankly they don’t know how to do that. Most of their life’s philosophy and value system is externally sourced & so when someone else comes and attacks their ideas they feel personally attacked. I have to admit that it’s extremely hard to see people in my close circle with such a mindset but it is the way of the world and I have learned to stop fighting it. \n\nSo my advice for you is to step away and let things be. 
1	Ah yes, welcome the community. It's pretty well known that we're the charming assholes of MBTI. People hate us and love us for the exact same reason because taste is highly variable from person to person and that's not even related to MBTI although it can help predict it. \n\nNo advice because it's honestly too complicated for a reddit comment. You'll get it. Trust me, it's just something that comes with age. Keep interacting, and keep making mental notes. Take ownership of everything that happens to you. If an undesirable outcome occurs, assume it's your fault. Taking this stance ensures that you can adjust for the future. 
1	Communicating your intent can go a long way. If you hurt someone's feelings, apologize and let them know what the aim of your comment was and that it wasn't personal.
1	I get what you mean. People would often express how they feel when I go ‘too far’, and I’m so in the moment that I just say things that amuse me. I feel like you should know the person more before you really be blunt and honest because then you really understand their limits. This is why I’m quite shy and reserved when I first meet someone, and when I know they are really sensitive I try to avoid that person or I try to ease into being a bitch if they like the stuff I say. It’s something that I don’t find that hard to do because I really would respect that person if I decide to stick around.\n\nI also like to think that if someone does not like me running my mouth they’re really no fun, and I found that I do entice more people through what I ‘tastefully’ say. So I wouldn’t waste my time speaking to those who don’t enjoy my company.\n
0	stop worrying about it and start enjoying it. 
4	Integrating the narcissistic shadow	How do you deal with these random thoughts of fame and power? 
6	Lol by remembering that I'm neither famous nor powerful and that fame and power mean I'd have to be in charge of things.  Ugh.
4	wat
3	I think most people entertain those kinds of thoughts, no different than entertaining thoughts of suicide, nonexistence, baths in jello on LSD, whatever. \n\nWell maybe not baths in jello on LSD.\n\nIt's okay to wonder what it would be like to be rich or famous or powerful providing it isn't affecting how you function within your reality. \n\nI usually make jokes of it. If I ran the country I would have a national holiday that was pastafarian based. \n\nAnd Bob Dobbs would be on the nickel. \n\nBecause its imaginary and ridiculous, and why not?\n
3	If there are thoughts you don't want to have, it's best to just accept them and realize it's okay to have them because resisting them will just make them persist.\n\nI will say I'm not quite sure what you mean though. You mean sudden desires for fame and power?
2	They usually go away after a few seconds. Cool to know im not the only one
2	Is this a ENTP-thing?\n\nI sure have these thoughts, despite the fact that I'm in no way interested in having power or fame in the real world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIMHO: Sometimes, it's ok to daydream and live in this world of fame and power for a little while. Just accept it and entertain yourself for a while.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	I relish in it because it feels good.\n\nThen, I open my eyes.
1	I just put on my pj's, get on my yaucht and go to my island house to shake'm off while listening to Bob Dylan, like damn, Bob, I don't care about your wife
7	How are ENTPs and INTJs similar and how are they different?	I'm pretty confident that I'm an ENTP just based on everything I've read about them and the fact that I usually get ENTP as a result on most online mbti tests. In terms of relating to fictional ENTPs as well as the definitions of heaven and hell for an ENTP, I match up pretty well there, too.\n\nThat said, I'm reading about INTJs and their tendencies, and a lot of what describes them also describes me, and sometimes in areas where I feel that I fall short of the ENTP label. I'm just wondering if anyone else on here feels the same way, or if anyone can shed some light on the subject in general.
13	In my experience: ENTPs are more calculating and less idealistic than they seem, and INTJs are more idealistic and less calculating than they seem.\n\nedit: spelling.
11	At a glance? INTJs often give the appearance of being cold/closed off because of how private they are, but they're actually very sensitive on the inside. ENTPs are often seen on the outside as ENFPs because of how talkative and charismatic they are, but are much more insensitive on the inside. I think a key difference is that while ENTPs like to come up with many plans, they have trouble implementing them. INTJs like to follow plans through from start to finish and will take on the work themselves if necessary.
7	I’ve noticed that I have very similar tastes in movies, books, music, etc. to a lot of INTJs. I think we sometimes consciously do what they unconsciously do and vice versa. We are also both “mostly intuitive rationalists, somewhat idealists” because our functions are placed the same just in opposite directions.
7	ENTPs rely more on pattern recognition and are more accepting of experiential learning. They are also more comfortable in unfamiliar circumstances. ENTPs are more mischievous and more prone to rule-bending behavior and playing the system. \n\nBoth are rational and think heavily before they speak. Both are goal-minded and introspective. Both are excellent leaders and stewards of power and influence. Both have excellent judgement. 
9	A lot of people on here talk about having an INTJ shadow, I’d never heard of this before but I think I can relate to it. Also I don’t think you should try and fit yourself into a specific one, just keep doing you 
3	I know what you mean! I always relate to INTJ characters weirdly, but it's usually the ones that have that trickster side, rather than the ones that are just very serious and reserved from the get-go.\n\nI saw one comment about the INTJ shadow, and I relate to that 100% as well.
2	There are two kinds of tests, one is the dichotomy/preferences test. Then you also have the functions test.\n\nIf   dichotomy test and function test both AGREE (Like for me was) you are ENTP then chances are good you are one. If either one doesn't match, then Hmmmm...\n\nUpon reading the basic description of ENTP from well-reputated MBTI sites which one is different from you?\n\nLet's focus on which description of ENTP doesn't fit you, to begin IMO.
2	Like others said, our functions are basically the same, just flipped. That’s why on the outside ENTPs seem warm & affable to others, but they are cold & ruthless inside. It’s the other way around for INTJs. In my experience anyway, they are such softies once you get to know them & earn their respect.😊 
1	I was mistyped as INTJ, and it was hilarious for my INTJ friend to watch. I can behave very INTJ-ish but my thought process doesn't match. I definitely use Ne, I think Ne vs Ni is the biggest difference here. I've seen someone saying that if you don't get what Ni is about then you don't use it. Not sure how true is it tho
1	We both think everyone else in the world is retarded, and circlejerk each other on that point. \n\nIf you're teetering in between the two, you might be an INTP. Study the functions and learn how stacks work. You can't go wrong with functions. They'll tell you real quick what you really are. 
2	What resources for ENTPs on a self-improvement journey?	I've recently identified as an ENTP (first time taking MBTI) and I think this would be a great framework for the self-improvement journey I've embarked on in the last year.\n\nAre there any ENTP specific resources you could recommend?  Not something I'm looking to work on in particular as I think a holistic view would be better than focusing on one thing.
6	What kind of self-improvement are you focusing on? Getting organized? Being a nicer person?
1	Scattered Minds by Gabor Maté
1	Learn to finish things. Just doing it until it is done. Listen motivational video everyday. 
1	i personally really enjoy Mark Manson's blog & work. i read The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fuck about 6 months ago and it really helped me decide which things i should focus on instead of being scattered all over the place. I also really loved his crude word usage \n\nedit: i think audible offers a free month trial, that's how i listened to it. cancelled it right after i was done with the book. i liked it because it gave me the ability to multitask instead of sitting and reading for hours. finished it in 2 days 
4	Movie / Video Games/TV characters from 2018/2019 that are ENTPs?	Since we are only 1 month in this year, no biggie(in also including 2019).\n\nMovie/TV/Video Games characters from 2018/2019 that are ENTPs. Go!
5	Tyrion Lannister
2	Lucy (little demon dude) from Disenchantment - reminds me of Bender  
4	BoJack Horseman 
1	Saul Goodman, T-Bag
3	Career - Happiness/Money	Hey guys\n\nSo I think it's established that ENTPs have a difficult time choosing a career, so I am interested to hear what is your priority in your job?\n\nDo you look for jobs that will fulfill you, or a big paycheck? When is enough enough and you have to move on for you?
6	Be able to have a LOT OF freedom, time to myself.\n\nNot get bossed around by anybody!
2	I always wanted to start/run a business and do project or consulting style work. Anything to prevent getting bored while maximizing freedom.\n\nDoing what you love tends to result in compensation. Compensation will never satisfy. \n\nAfter a roof over your head, food on the table, car in the driveway, there isn't a whole lot more materially. \n\nA little bigger house? A few more horsepower? A few extra miles on the trip? Another star on the hotel? These things wont satisfy and aren't worth selling our souls.\n\nThat said, discipline is our biggest challenge. Sticking with the stuff we dont like until we like it. \n\n\n
1	At 18 I was searching a big paycheck and done for 7 years some work as a technician on [Chemical\_engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_engineering), I'm from France and won 50k$/y during this period, it was nice but I hated some aspect of my job (night shift and not enough freedom)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I'm 25 and just get back to study in Software engineering but I don't really know where I'm going if it's more lifestyle or paycheck oriented.Pretty sure it's possible to get both  if I'm going in Switzerland or Germany :P
1	As a professional gigolo, i gotta tell you I'm quite content with my job content. I look for physical jobs with big fat paychecks to get smothered in. It's enough when I can't take anymore of the job, which is a long ways down the proverbial road. 
1	Fulfillment first, then paycheck.\n\nPaycheck matters, though. I dislike that ENTPs are supposed to be one of the lowest-earning types. I can see why. I can also see the same potential in myself, to make less money than I really should be. I'm more selfish than that; I want to be materially compensated for my contributions. Self-fulfillment is nice, but can turn into the snake eating its own tail. It cannot be the sole metric to base a career.
2	Name some famous real or fictional female likely ENTPs	I was thinking:\n\nEleanor Roosevelt\n\nAmelia Earhart\n\nBuffy\n\nHedy Lemarr\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Makosinski\n\nMary Poppins\n\nHolly Golightly\n\n\n
3	Sarah Silverman, Kate Beckinsale (?), megan mullaly, rose mcgowan, elizabeth olsen (?), Claire danes, also olivia munn and natasha leggero give an entp vibe as well
3	> Buffy\n\nShe probably only seems ENTP to you because her lines were written by Joss Whedon. All his characters sound like ENTPs. :P\n\nI get Se vibes from her (situational awareness, practicality, more concerned about a monster's weak points than its lore/history). Maybe xSTP?
3	I think you'll find quite a few comedians: Amy Poehler is often cited, as is Sarah Silverman. I also think Rachel Bloom is an ENTP. Wrt fictional characters, Miriam Maisel (the "marvelous" Mrs. Maisel) may be an ENTP as well, although I can also see some other options. Veronica Lodge from Riverdale is another ENTP. Eleanor Shellstrop from The Good Place is an ExTP - definitely presents as an ESTP but might be a closet ENTP, I'm not sure.\n\nETA: Another female ENTP may be Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I can also see ENFJ, but think she's ultimately a thinker who gets misidentified as a feeler because she's very expressive/a woman/cares about social justice. However, her speech patterns and Twitter account make me think ENTP. ENTJ is another possibility. Anyone have thoughts? I'm not American, so I haven't been following her super closely.
3	Jeez, these are hard to find...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShuri from Black Panther!\n\nBlackfire from Teen Titans?\n\nIrene Adler from Sherlock? (though I've only seen the Robert Downey Jr. ones and a bit of BBC)\n\nJunko Enoshima from Danganronpa\n\nMissy from Doctor Who?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all I got for now\n\n&#x200B;

1	Mary Poppins has got to be a J-type, IMO. She's way too regimented and organized to be an ENTP.

12	Do you feel like you depend on your MBTI/Enneagram/[insert personality test] to describe your behaviour a bit too much?	Personalities are not that rigid..
13	I know people think too much about it period. I'm surprised more ENTP are giving this much of a fuck about it in the first place lol\n\nThe compatibility questions surprise me the most
10	Personalities aren't rigid, but archetypes are. The sooner people realize that, the sooner they can stop abusing the MBTI. The archetypes defined in MBTI aren't supposed to capture an individual's complete personality; an individual's personality isn't supposed to fall exactly into one archetype.\n\nThe people who depend on it too much to describe their personality/identity are the ones you constantly see saying "as an ENTP...", "ENTP describes me perfectly", "I'm 100% an ENTP." These types of absolutist statements attach ones identity to MBTI, which is essentially an abuse of the system. \n\nThink of it this way. Let's use a more psychometrically accepted theory of personality, the Big5. If someone scored 80% extravert and 85% openness, would it be healthy for them to go around saying "well I'm an 80% E, 85% O, so am I more likely to become an addict?" What about if they asked questions like "at what percentage of E do I start to become more sociable?" What about "how can I reduce my neuroticism percentage in big5?" \n\nThese types of questions simply aren't asked. Perhaps people recognize it's nonsense, or perhaps Big5 is more rigidly so people don't abuse it as much as they do MBTI. MBTI, unlike Big5, is chock full of the Barnum Effect. We can say "ESFJs are the happiest of all types.." and many people won't even bat an eyelash. This allows people to stretch definitions, to warp dichotomies, and to assert malleable *archetypes*, which makes no sense.\n\nMBTI is a sorting mechanism, that's it. Four dichotomies are rigorously defined. Through this, 16 archetypes are derived. All this means is that there are 16 *rigid archetypes* which never perfectly describe someone, and which no person will perfectly fit in. All "ENTPs" will sometimes act like ESFPs, like INTJs, like ISTP, etc. \n\nThe accurate way to type someone is a frequency analysis of behavior over a long time, over many different situations. This is a long and difficult process, but it's the only way to get an accurate typing. There is no "development" of functions. There is no "prefect" pairs. There are no "shadow types". There are no "loops". So on and so forth. \n\nWhat is true is that there are 16 boxes to sort people in, and the predictive behaviors of these archetypes is done through the dichotomies. It's manifestly rigid. An ENTP archetype explicitly uses exclusively E, N, T, P. You can map these to Jungian functions with care, but that's a care thats often neglected. So instead I suggest working with the dichotomies.\n\nWhen someone is typed as an ENTP, that's really a shorthand for saying "their behavior is most commonly commiserate with the ENTP archetype in comparison to the 15 other types". This could be a weak effect, like they get sorted into ENTP 25% of the time (and ≈5% for the other 15 boxes), or a strong effect like sorted into an ENTP 75% of the time.\n\nTrying to view relationships, or work ethic, or anything else like that through an MBTI lens is just abusive to the system. It's narrow minded typecasting and bordering on manifestly unhealthy behavior. If anyone acted like any archetype 100% of the time, they'd be committed to an insane asylum. \n\nSome people try to mitigate this issue by allowed the archetypes to be less rigidly defined. The price you then pay is incoherence and inconsistency. The ENTP archetype will then blend into the ISFJ and INTJ and ESFP archetypes, and you lose accuracy in typing someone. As if it wasn't hard enough given the *person's* malleable personality, you now have a malleable *archetype* to sort them into. \n\nThat's where you come to the mercy of generalized Barnum statements. You try to have your cake and eat it too. If both archetypes and humans have malleable personalities, then the archetype system can be molded to however you want. An ENTP can then erroneously be described by inconsistent, contradictory behavioral patterns. People can be 100% positive they're an ENTP, and it can describe them "perfectly". \n\nThe only way MBTI has even a modicum of usefulness is if the archetypes are rigidly defined. But then you need universal agreement toward what these definitions are, and that's not going to happen. People can't even agree on whether MBTI is dichotomy based or function based. \n\nAt this stage in the game, it's just a toy. That's it. Something to tinker with from time to time, but as a rigorously defined system? It's on life support, and is currently being suffocated by Barnum statements. At this point, it's about as useful as Harry Potter's sorting Houses. Just a fun game. Which isn't so fun because the system is abused more than a drug addict abuses their own body. 
6	When I first got into it, ENTP described me perfectly already. Probably I do rely on it but it’s more about rationalising and digesting what I already knew. \n\nI was lucky enough to have someone type me in person (it was for typing everyone at work and we did 8 hours of group activities).\n\nTyping is maybe questionable but people who call it horoscopes are morons. I’ve guessed 2/4 peoples types before making them take the test. The other 2 were SJ’s and I was very close - and could still be right as they may not have been honest.\n\nI disagree with OP that it’s surprising that ENTP’s are interested in typing. \nIt’s making connections and rationalising a complex system (psychology) in a TLDR format. Why would we not love that

3	I sometimes get frustrated when I realise just how accurate it is. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it misses the mark a lot and there's definitely confirmation bias involved. However, I find it to be incredibly accurate in telling me what I can't do. Knowing my own limitations this way is both frustrating and useful.\n\nI can explain most things I do through analysis of cognitive functions and it helps me greatly in understanding other people
3	"Why, yes, I think that I am investing time and energy in a useless mental crutch!"\n\nWhat normal person would answer "yes" to your question? I wish your post went into more detail, as the title sounds a little bait-y.  \n\nTo quote u/The_White_Baron,\n\n> Personalities aren't rigid, but archetypes are. \n\nThe same way I can see myself in a fictional character and learn from their Hero's Journey, I can see myself in an abstract archetype and learn ways to improve myself. Like anything, it requires balance and moderation, but that's a given.\n\nTo me, the key is **viewing my own traits first**. I'm not going to superimpose ENTP stereotypes over myself; I'm going to keep my own strengths and weaknesses in mind and see where the ENTP archetype overlaps with them.
2	Nah. My wife is actually more into it than I am, I mostly keep up on it out of fascination for where her interests in it lie. I actually found this sub by her suggestion that I might like it, and I followed because it's got interesting content every once in a while and occasionally some stuff that I really strongly relate to. But I don't think about MBTI too too much outside it.
1	No
1	I think the MBTI definetly gets over romanticized. And, correct me if I'm wrong, But ENTP seem to absolutely be one of the most romanticized types out there. (Our compulsive flirting, competing and circle jerking might have something to do with it.)  \n\nPersonally, it happened to help understand myself more, explain how conflicting traits worked together, and to what end. \n\nI would say its a slippery slope though. A casual interest is suddenly defining every answer you give and role you play in a scenario. Then the more rigid archetype is made in your mind, more than anywhere that actually matters. I think it helps to remember your ultimately still in control of your own behaviour. \n\nI do like that quote by Lemmy Kilminster and think it applies here too: \n"fuck God and fuck the devil and fuck the church too. I'm responsible for my actions. I don't need to hide behind nothing. I did it... whatever I did."  
1	Everyone has an individual personality, I find I can relate to entps the most but I find I share aspects with all nt types and sometimes other types as well. Humans are extremely diverse and complex. I find too many people attach there identity to a type and then begin to morph there personality to fit it. Remember people Change as well, no way I will be this way forever.
26	Sensors	I’m really trying not to sound mean when I say this, but do y’all feel just a little overwhelmed around ESxx types sometimes? Like I have several close friends who are that combination, and I love them a lot, but oh my goodness sometimes I just really don’t want to talk to them. I get so overwhelmed by their speech style because it is so often so many details that I care literally nothing about and I just want them to get to the damn point. And I want to be sympathetic to sensors in general, but I really just don’t feel their excitement for experiences in the same way and so I often feel like what they want to tell me about really doesn’t matter at all. Like my roommate will talk to me about things happening in her sorority for 30 minutes, but never actually get to a bigger point she is trying to make. Like I feel kind of bad for saying this, but I just don’t care at all about what she is telling me, I need there to be a bigger picture and there just isn’t. 
20	Hmm...  I find sensors get to the point rather quickly.  It's just that I don't care about their point and often miss it because I zoned out while they were talking.
12	I don’t feel overwhelmed with ESxPs- in fact sometimes I just feel underwhelmed with ESFPs. But yes, I do sometimes feel overwhelmed around ESxJs.
5	Honestly I only feel this way with some ESFXs  I know, not all of them. I find ESTXs really easy to get along with. 
5	The ESTJs love to rant to me about things I never asked about nor ever expressed any interest in and I really just cannot stand it. \n\nMy coworker is an ESTJ and if I mention any physical symptom she will tell me every herb under the sun that will cure me. Where is grows. How to cook it. I have explicitly told her I have no interest and she doesn’t care. \n\nShe does it to customers too. They asks a simple question like “which one of these roasts is decaf” and she proceeds to tell them every single step of the coffee growing and brewing process. I watch their eyes glaze over and give them a free drink cafe with their change when she isn’t looking. It’s embarrassing. She goes on for like 5 minutes. \n\nSJs are a nightmare for me overall. Some are easier and calmer like SFJs but I leave most interactions exhausted and need to listen to some EDM or something to drown out all the useless info. My close friend is an ESFJ and I love her to death but if I ask here where she got XYZ item she will tell me the story of her entire day, 2 years ago, when she got that item. I don’t. I don’t care. It’s redundant. Irrelevant. I don’t. Care. 
5	Yep. Both my parents are ESxJ's, and while I'm much better able to "get" them as an adult (after a very rocky childhood lmao), there's still pretty much a timer that's quietly ticking in the background of every interaction I have with them before I'm too overwhelmed and need to go home.\n\nThe ESTJ gets a little longer of a timer, because I can at least follow *why* the things my dad cares so much about are so important to him for a little while. But every single interaction I have with my ESFJ mom is listening to her comb through the politics and personal drama of her co-workers, and when I try to reciprocate conversation by talking about projects I've been working on I just get a blank stare and a "oh, I'm happy if you're happy" level of engagement.
3	I have a friend group with the following:\nMale ESTJ\nFemale ESFJ\nMale ISFP\nFemale ESTP\nMale ISTJ.\n\nAnd yes, by god can the detail get frikken annoying. Just get to the point, it doesn't really matter if the wall was painted white or slightly cream, or if the drinking fountain at school was a sink or a trough...\n\nThey also seem to not understand some jokes I make as well, because I can sometimes make weird connections that they don't get unless it's spelled out to them. I do not have the same issue with INFJ gf, INTJ dad and INTP sister.\n\nBut still, sensors do seem a bit more organised in a lot of cases which comes in handy. 
2	Depends on the context for me. If they're close to me, I'll get annoyed and tell them to get to the point so I can help faster. If they aren't close to me, I'll just listen and tell them what they want to hear. You have to choose your battles and remember you're walking on eggshells with 90% of people.
2	I just get bored of face value conversations quickly. Definitely not overwhelmed, but bored.\n\nSensors can be really cool and a lot of fun to hang out with. Many have interesting style and are put together somehow. However, some expect others to be just as aesthetically focused, and I notice a slight superiority complex about it. Totally harmless though haha just very predictable, which instantly bores me. 
3	Ha, I get this with my ENFP friend all the time. I don't think it's a Sensor-specific issue. She loves to talk about people I don't know and don't care about - like what her distant family is up to. 
1	As a female ENTP, I find I get along relatively well with SF females on the surface, but we will probably never have a close friendship. I'm sort of a 'work-mom' to the young ESFPs at my office.\n\nESTJs are an interesting one. I generally find I get on very well with male ones, but can't stand females (& the feeling is mutual). I'm socially a very 'alpha' person & I think ESTJ women tend to view me as a threat, plus hate the fact that I think & act differently to them & their norms, so we constantly clash. \n\nESTJ males tend to view me as more of an equal & we work really well as a duo, with me coming up with the ideas & them making it happen. Although it could also be that I have an ESTJ dad, so I know how to manipulate one. XD 
1	I used to get annoyed way too much, now it is decreasing so there is hope. But there are some people I have to dismiss. Learn to surround yourself with the right people. Don't just be friend with anyone and everyone or limit your time with those who annoys you. The sad fact is, you see them but they don't see you, so it is not possible  to bring them to your level. Especially if your N is highly developed. Try to mix people with better match Infj, Intp, Intj, etc you enjoy them and less annoyances. Good luck. You cant change them so you need to ran away. 
1	They feel the same about our "big picture but ultimately irrelevant" talk. Treat conversations like food: I don't have to eat my favorite food every day and all the time.
0	Sensors must be lead or they will become rabid. 
8	how does that inferior Si manifest for y’all?	I can’t tell if the things ppl normally say are just simplified stereotypes, if my years of trying to improve have actually matured my Si just a lil bit, or if I’m actually INTP (which would Suck bc I’ve legit spent over a year now flip flopping and I rly thought I had it)
15	Ugh I'm so bad. So many examples of the same thing I just can't get it together lol. Here it is:\n\nWent to Walmart to buy a picture frame. Bought the frame at self checkout, put it in a bag, and walked away without it. Hours after getting home I realized what happened and went back to Walmart to get it.\n\nGot a $200 Gift Card to *store*. Go to *store*, spend an hour picking stuff out, go to pay, use my Debit card. As I'm unloading my items in my car, realized what happened and started debating if it was worth it to transfer the balance onto the gift card.... this gets worse: all of a sudden I hear a car horn and an old lady starts yelling at me to move out of the way... I was standing there behind a car trying to back out of a parking spot, completely oblivious just thinking about my money situation lol. So embarrassing. \n\nGo to store to buy eggs. Walk out with deodorant.\n\nWalk out of room to grab water for husband, come back to the room with a Coke for myself.
2	In me as an enfp, my si appears as nostalgia and a rejection of my families traditions.   I'm ignorant of my environment.     Si also is the thing seeking novelty, and when I'm stressed I'm an istj (same if I'm high, it brings out more of my Te and si) \n\nSi shows up as my usual anger triggers:. Someone telling me what my purpose is, someone telling me what I'm allowed or not allowed to do.  Fears on I'd I'm actually doing what/where I'm supposed to or made the right decisions.   Si is very not future oriented so it generates alot of forward facing anxieties.  
1	To be honest, I'm still not sure what Si means. It's the least clear part of my stack to me. I can't tell how to differentiate Si tendencies from Ti tendencies.
1	Well when im Aspiring in my inferior SI. I make sure everyone is doing good in a grounded type of way of talking to people. This pairs well with FE to make a caring person. It allows me to build discipline and be in the moment. To remember past events and present it successfully. \n\nWhen I manifest my inferior SI in fear. I can be uncomfortable being in a area with rules. It restricts my creativity and reasoning from not allowing a different perspective with being called out for heresy or dissidence. In the past my SI has made me obsessed with small details, demand control, have trouble remembering memories and/or tasks. Become anxious, narrow minded and seem introverted from the exhaustion of no grasp of my circumstances. \n\n
1	There is that thing when i dont wanna obligate to things because i take obligations very seriously and i always want to keep a way out of things.\nLike i didn't want to go to the gym but once i had to (weighted 110kg/242.5lbs) i went there, removed 36kg/79lbs and since then i go to the gym at the same time every day. 
1	I don't know how to answer this one, as I'm ADHD-diagnosed. :/
1	A Scattered/ADHD mess.. Letters pile up, room/office becomes a mess, dishes stack up, emails don't get checked, phone calls don't get returned, important appointments get missed, avoidance begins to set in.\n\nHowever there is still hope.. I've noticed every couple weeks - months I need to clean up my Se environment so i can't loose and misplace things, maybe move some things around for easy of accessibility and do basic maintenance stuff that's easy to usually put off THEN take time to organised my physical Si things like clearing the 1000 icons/files off my desktop in to put into one folder, message/ring people back about important things such as appointments I've put off. Put all my letters/bills in one place. Basic stuff. I then try maintain this for as long as possible.. well until it gets old and my attention towards details fades again slowly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I don't do these things I'll start going on a irresponsible downwards spiral into chaos as I avoid this stuff and my internal structures suffer leading to uncertainty and procrastination. Ne-Fe will distract me easier. It takes all of my Ne-Ti-Fe working together for their own reasons (a new improved self/life) to parent Si properly.
7	What is information?	I have been thinking on this for a long time, and still I can't really understand what exactly is information.\n\nI am not talking about the textbook definition of information (which I find a little bit too simplistic). What I am talking about is what exactly is information as something that exists in our world. \n\nIt doesn't really exist in the physical world as an object, but it can be stored in different ways using physical objects, be it a hard drive or a sheet of paper. \n\nEverything in the universe contains information. A block of ice from the North Pole contains information about the atmosphere of our planet was millions of years ago. Even the vacuum of space is filled with different waves and particles from which information can be obtained.\n\nAlso it's interesting that only life uses information because to obtain information you have to process data and obtain something meaningful out of it. A rock doesn't do anything of that.\n\nAlso there is no "new" information. All information is there, we just haven't found all of it yet. It is impossible to create information, like it is impossible to imagine a new colour. Our brains store information by collecring and analyzing data from our surroundings, and every single idea we come up with has its roots in the world we live in and the information we have collected since we were kids.\n\nI know it sounds a little bit like incoherent ramblings, but this is what has been keeping me awake many nights. I just can't really connect the idea I have of information to the world around me. It feels way too different from everything else.
8	*Epistemological crisis*
5	careful, this is exactly how I got suckered into a philosophy major 
2	Encrypted awareness of things that exist? Like, obviously being informed that it really hurts to be bit by a bullet ant wont make me actually feel it... but the language conveys a thought which makes me aware of the fact that when bit by a bullet ant it will be comparable to somebody twisting my skin with a red hot pliers. \n\nThe block of ice contains information, encrypted in signs and such, we use those signs and basically translate them into language that we understand... which brings us to thier meaning. \n\n
2	If a bear shits in a forest....\n\nInformation is a conscious label we put in all the things that are knowable. \n\nDoes it still exist if we aren't theres to observe and sense it? Probably. But it would exist without man made relevance. \n\nAs God(s) can be made in our own image, so too can be the universe.
2	Ill drop this dialogue here:\n\n[https://sites.psu.edu/phileduc/2013/09/23/socrates-and-meno-learn-more-or-remembering/](https://sites.psu.edu/phileduc/2013/09/23/socrates-and-meno-learn-more-or-remembering/)\n\nThis topic is fantastic, seriously one of the best i have seen here in quite a long time.\n\nIm currently exploring whats culture and how we define what is, and the porpuse of it,and is quite similar as what ur doing with information, im just focusing for 999x time on the philosophical school of Frankfurt.\n\nBut there ar so many Branches to what ur exploring right now, is information a construct, if does where does it exist? is there a collective consciousness where information is? Can information become an archetype or  a god like in Neil Gaiman books, is thinking the best way to acces information or is an inneficient way? if we explore how everything that is alive processes information can we end with the conclussion that materialism is simplistic and wrong? Is there wrong information or simply bad ways to proccess it? \n\nThis is one of those intuitive topics, because is abslutely based on constructs, if u were to test this place for sensors vs intuitives keep posting stuff like this.
2	What you're looking for is a philosophical [theory of information](https://web.archive.org/web/20120316090017/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/pci/downloads/introduction.pdf). A good starting point is the [Stanford Encylopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/).\n\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information/\n\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-semantic/\n\n>It doesn't really exist in the physical world as an object\n\nIt exists as an [abstract object](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects/). My first thought was that information is some sort of 'package' that contains individual facts to which we then apply an inner sorting mechanism (similar to Kantian categories perhaps?) to arrange it in a way that's useful to us.
2	Information, as I see it, is *perspective:* interpretation, ideas and feelings of a concrete or an abstract thing. These are generally unique within every individual, as such people will gain different information from the same *thing*. What and how you make of a *thing* is unique, though this doesn't necessitate to not being able to hold multiple perspectives. As long as there is a perceiver and an object, there is information.
2	Looool awesome.  \nI know just the person.  \n  \n/u/negativegpa
1	> What I am talking about is what exactly is information as something that exists in our world.\n\nIt's an abstract concept that we use in various contexts, changing its definition to suit the need. 
1	From Langan's CTMU: \n\n"Among the most exciting recent developments in science are Complexity Theory, the theory of self-organizing systems, and the modern incarnation of Intelligent Design Theory, which investigates the deep relationship between self-organization and evolutionary biology in a scientific context not preemptively closed to teleological causation. Bucking the traditional physical reductionism of the hard sciences, complexity theory has given rise to a new trend, informational reductionism, which holds that the basis of reality is not matter and energy, but information. Unfortunately, this new form of reductionism is as problematic as the old one. As mathematician David Berlinski writes regarding the material and informational aspects of DNA: “We quite know what DNA is: it is a macromolecule and so a material object. We quite know what it achieves: apparently everything. Are the two sides of this equation in balance?” More generally, Berlinski observes that since the information embodied in a string of DNA or protein cannot affect the material dynamic of reality without being read by a material transducer, information is meaningless without matter."\n\n.....\n\n"In conventional physical theory, the fundamental entities are point particles, waves and more recently, strings; each class of object has its problems and paradoxes. In the CTMU, the fundamental objects are syntactic operators (units of self-transducing information or infocognition) that are not only capable of emulating all of these objects and more, but of containing the syntactic structures to which they must inevitably conform and resolving their characteristic paradoxes in the bargain."\n\nGlad to discuss :)
1	My cs teacher once told me that data is just numbers stored in a HDD. Information is when someone can understand that data and use it.\n
1	The non-physical component of reality?
1	Information theory is my baby\n\nThere’s a handful of ways I could start this... but I’ll start with this:\n\nWhat does information taste like? 
39	The best word to describe entp	Personally I think Cacoethes is the best word for this. It means 'an urge to do something inadvisable'
22	EnTp are mad elusive. It’s so easy for them to take in information process it quickly and adapt their reaction. In the moment they can always be a step ahead. 
16	 Chameleon
13	Potent
56	I’m gonna go with Retarded. 
10	All the other chameleons (ENFP.ENFJ,INFJ)hate/LOVE us too cause they all feel like they should be a step ahead like usual.  so that means theres something wrong with us ENTPs. This makes us basically the loner in the corner all the other types look at like a weird creature. Allways mistaking our motives when we declare them upright, most people just don’t understand the coy bluntness.
19	In only one word?  \n  \nJackhammer. \n  \nInsatiable.  \n  \nMerciless. 
10	love it hahaha
3	Maybe just me but im gonna go spicy and say Chaoticly Organized
5	Argumentative, stubborn, resourceful, blunt, witty, powerful
4	I'd just say 'crazy'.\n\nSource: Friends, partner, family members, old coworkers, current coworkers, and my local grocery store cashier have used this word to describe me. Of course (hopefully?), in a good way.  \nEdit: grammar
8	Ethereal.   \nLook up the definition, then agree with me.  \n
5	Unexplainable 
5	Entp
3	Messy😂
3	One word? Armchair. Because we're still a chair with all the parts other chairs have. It's just we're lazy but can still do what other chairs do but more relaxed and cooler.

2	Because she (obviously, right?) think we will have to struggle with transhumanism shit and the life will be way more dark and long than ever before, smile and start to talk about it =)
1	because they don't have to be involved in the survival part and need not worry about the plight of the sun. i think the question should be why do the infjs worry about finding themselves if they are gonna die anyway

15	I am an ENFP interested in an ENTP. Any advice?	The guy I’m interested in is an ENTP, and I really do think that’s the reason I immediately clicked with him. He’s the first person in a long while I’ve been able to have in depth and deep discussions with, and due to him being less on the emotional side while I’m a huge empath, we are able to explain the emotions of ourselves and others in new ways to one another. He’s very busy and while I understand that I can’t expect him to always make time for me, I’ve been trying to think of ways for me to move up his priorities list. I am fine with any advice on how to catch his eye as a romantic interest, or even just as an intriguing individual in general. All help is greatly appreciated!!
17	When I talk to ENFPs I sometimes think they don't listen to what I say and just think about what they're going to say next. That's my only strife with them though, otherwise they're awesome! If you do what I mentioned above, definitely work on listening more. \n\nProbably my favorite thing about yall though is that you call us out when we're being tricky, there's really no fooling you lol it's pretty cool
14	1. Don't ignore your ENTP. Show him some attention by devoting time for him. \n2. Don't be distracted in the middle of the conversation. \n3. When he sends you a message don't skim through the whole thing. Read carefully and try to stay on topic. I hate texting ENFPs they either ignore 70% what you've said or forget to even reply because they discovered they have 10 fingers while typing their message so they googled why and forgot they are having a conversation.\n4. IRL,listen to him when talking. Don't interrupt his ideas. Both personalities are a bit self-centered. They care more about getting their ideas through rather than understanding the counterpart's ideas BUT if you listen to an ENTP and show interest he will respect you, become loyal to you AND he will listen to you as long as you need.\n\nGoodluck.
6	I’m in the opposite situation right now, and these are some things I wish the ENFP would do better:\n\n- Value my time (and value spending time with me) - don’t cancel or reschedule too much\n- Remember things going on in my life or that are important to me (if I mention that I’m worried about something, ask me about it the next time we talk)\n- Ask for more details on things and remind me to fill you on things (Fi users will often wait for me to bring things up, in case I’m not comfortable discussing them, whereas Fe users will ask, and that, to me, is a sign they care - if they don’t ask, I feel like they’re not interested in discussing it)\n\nHere are some things I’ve done wrong (go easy on the ENTP here!):\n\n- Telling others things he’s said - I read somewhere that Fi assumes something is a secret unless they hear otherwise, and Fe assumes nothing is a secret unless they hear otherwise. Know that an Fe user will talk about you and things you’ve said (and this is a way they show they care!), so don’t be disconcerted (they will keep the big secrets), but also help them out by saying ‘don’t tell anyone this’ where relevant, as the context may not make it obvious that you want something kept a secret.\n- Getting upset over a small detail in something the ENFP says - as a Ti user, I will notice a small detail, like a word choice, and think it’s significant (because I choose my words - at least my written words - very carefully, so I assume others do, too)\n\nThis last thing may not be an ENFP/ENTP thing (it may just be us!), but we have had so many misunderstandings (and some pretty serious ones!). And I don’t mean arguments - I mean we misunderstand each other ALL THE TIME. But, we’ve also been pretty good at resolving them - just make sure you ask for clarification on things if you’re not sure.\n\nGood luck!
3	I dated an ENFP once. We got along really well, but as we were both dominant personalities, I ended up reverting to my INTJ unconscious all the time, and it was not healthy for me or anyone around me. Just make sure you two are both able to be yourself around each other. 
2	You can only attract an ENTP, if you are interesting. \n\nAnd he will quickly find out, if you are really interesting, or just pretending to be.\n\nSo nothing you can really actively do, we're in general quite good at "judging" people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing: Be outgoing, show him your affection, be spontaneous, flirt with him, surprise him. \n\nWe like that kinda stuff...\n\n&#x200B;
2	Do not automatically take having a flaw pointed out as an insult. I butt heads with my F bestie a lot over this - personally if I point out a problem it's not to hurt someone's feelings, but because I believe the flaw is hurting them and that they can overcome it.\n\nA strong T may show they care more by helping you improve and expand your horizons then saying nice things that make you feel good. Likewise, actions mean a lot more than sweet words IMHO.
-7	Relationship w an ENTP is like being in a long distance relationship....all talk and no sex.
21	around an hour ago I wanted to do look up a function for a new mbti meme, this is what happened instead	
8	Maybe I’m just an outlier or something but I’ve never understood this stereotype. I hate having that many tabs open because it makes things ridiculously chaotic for me to maneuver through. My phone browser? Yes. Tabs are out of sight out of mind. My laptop? Hell no. That shit hurts my brain and makes me feel anxious.
6	Oof, too many tabs
3	I love this community 
3	seems about right. My tab looks like that at the moment.
2	This is a tactic. It's going incognito without going incognito. At least, that's my excuse for it.
2	Bro, how have you not learned to compartmentalize? If you can't read your tabs, you don't know which ones to close before bothering to look at them. You need a new window for every ten tabs, minimum, and try to keep them themed. You might realize you can close an entire window of tabs all at once. That saves a lot of time. Also, get an extra monitor. I have three. I still don't have enough. Highly recommend. 
1	I never have this many tabs because I think of my laptop as my child and its fans whirring turns me into protective mom mode.\n\nthat's why all my mobile browsers have 15 tabs minimum 
1	[Update](https://gyazo.com/7d239e5cd70737b883ca3b0c685a69f3)\n\nstill didnt finish the meme, but few others (that get downvoted af, maybe I attacked too many types (all other 15 lel) at once =D)

7	Getting Each Other To Do Work For Us.	ENTPs are good at allocating work to others in an efficient way, but why haven't we bonded together to get massive results? I'm sure we all have valuable skills. I'm sure a large portion of us run our own businesses.\n\nWhy not profit together? For instance, I am a skilled content writer for online publishers. If someone runs a website that needs blog content, then we could work together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your skills, and what types of skillsets can help you?\n\nI'm interested in seeing how we can benefit each other. Not just financially, but personally as well.
12	I think the problem is we all like to be the boss. 
4	I'm somewhat decent at graphic design, anyone in need ?
3	Pretty much half decent at most things. I start something, get bored, start something new.

2	Own a dental office with my brother. He's a dentist, I do the back end. \n\nI can help dentists with the back end side.\n\n I love to learn how to always better organize people and execute (which, as you can guess, is the biggest challenge).\n\n
2	I am a property developer/ project manager to all the clients I deal. The kicker is I don't know a whole lot about either topic. I'm more of a glorified salesman that delegates work to professionals and passes it off as my own, but for profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh well, pays the bills lol.
8	ENTPs, show me your sources for quality content	I'm starting to feel really disappointed with the Internet lately. I don't know if it's me acquiring better judgement or if it's an actual decline in the overall availability of interesting information on the Internet; the fact is I used to spend a great part of my time reading interesting discussions and posts in different forums, or watching series of documentaries that showed some serious work behind them, and now all I am able to find is oversimplified infographics that try to explain a complex and serious topic by bombarding you with tons of shallow and "interesting" facts or feel good phrases combined with a touch of "humour" that most of the time sounds cringy and makes me want to ask Youtube for a "Block this channel from my recommendations until the end of time" button.\n\nIt can probably be explained as an effect of the rise of social media and the subsequent decrease of attention span in the market that all the big companies get most benefits from by making shorter videos and making you watch more of them so you see more ads. However, that means the people who are not part of that market ultimatelly end up disillusioned with the lack of the type of content they enjoy, so they end up switching to a different platform to find it. \n\nThis is why I have decided to ask you about your sources. As an ENTP myself I guess you also struggle with this and maybe some of you have found a place where quality is still appreciated.

2	I used to have this problem here’s what I did to try to solve it. I developed a more philosophical mind by learning to ask the fundamental questions. It became a lot easier to distinguish bullshit content from content that actually says something. I don’t have a set place for quality content, there are individuals whom I’m likely to listen to because I can tell they’ve thoroughly investigated their topic. A great example of such a person is Jordan Peterson. The guy Is pretty popular. PHD psychologist turned into YouTube sensational self help guru. \n\nI guess what I’m trying to say is for me it’s a lot easier to have a tool set that can be resourceful with the information I’m given than hoping the content I’m given has quality.

61	[Request] Can we please change the description of this sub?	\[Edit:\] bruv, I legit just got "Silver", Idk how expensive (or not) it is, but anyway: thanks a lot <3 This will be the new first line in this post as a sign of appreciation of your sign of appreciation ;\_()\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**this legit is breaking my heart every time I see it.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwe are the fucking **E N T P s**, one of the most creative and innovative types so why do we have a description so uncreative and boring that even an ISTJ would tear up (probably not, check their [sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/), they have no description at all lel) ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes Mr INTJ, the content of our description is factually correct, but still. I feel like it doesnt reflect our nature at all and if any other type would come across that they'd probably think that we misspelled \[insert type commonly known as uncreative\] or something like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Examples from other subs:**\n\n>INFPs never seem to lose their sense of wonder. One might say they see life through rose-colored glasses. It's as though they live at the edge of a looking-glass world where mundane objects come to life, where flora and fauna take on near-human qualities.\n\na bit weird (I personally enjoy getting to the point without beating around the bush too much), but still, that's a fucking great one. another one:\n\n>For redditors interested in personality typing, specifically those identifying as or interested in Introverted iNtuitive Feeling Judging persons (INFJs). Keywords: Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, MBTI, introvert, cognitive functions, Jung, Big Five, enneagram\n\nI dont get the use of the keywords and it's not the most creative writing, but somewhat personal (speaking of "redditors", creating a connection to the reader because he most likely is a redditor (and therefor a virgin hehe xd) ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What my point is:**\n\nCan we please add some creative and personal notes to our description?\n\nOurs looks as plain as the description from the [INTP sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/), but for them it's not a problem since they are robots anyway. But we are not, we are independant human beings with a need to express our creativity =D\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Maybe something like:**\n\n\- "Home of the ENTPs, the best of the 16 types. You think otherwise? Have fun debating with us" (a bit provoking, but that's what we fucking are ??)\n\n\- a bit less provocative version might be "..., the most intelligent, creative and humble of the 16 types..."\n\n\- why not add a weird pun at the end? :D\n\n\- \[insert other idea\] (that means that I want your idea, of course you have atleast 1, sheesh you're an ENTP after all)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ok, what do you intelligent, creative and humble creatives think? ;)**

7	Core traits and styles of an ENTP	E, EN - we got no problem at all with good parties, great crowded events, we'd GO OUT  instead of staying home or with just 1-2 close friends (cuz crowds/strangers makes Introverts uncomfortable).\n\nWe are very imaginative, open-minded to possibilities, likes to try many different things, finds theories very interesting. We are curious as hell about all kinds of things. And, we have a pretty good intuition about things and people, often without facts we just are right on with these intuitions!\n\nTi - God, we think MORE than any other Extroverts, before we speak! We have Introverted Thinking as secondary function. Since the other one is a S,  not as curious as we are though. At a big party with many people, other Extroverts they like to keep talking and we listen more than we speak!   That also means  we love nerdy, geeky things MORE as if we are truly Introverted we go to Cons, play board games, computer lectures, line up for Star Wars, Superhero movie while other Extroverts go to bars and clubs, eat at restaurant, etc. \n\n(E)NT - Again, we think more than any other Extroverts. Also we value knowledge very very much. We are information freaks!  We go to as many intellectual events as possible to take in new information. We don't like, respect much of anyone who appears to be Anti-intellectual, dumb, and pure sheeps. We aren't shy when we disagree and argue! We don't easily yield cuz we think we would hurt or upset the other person and cause an awkward/uncomfortable situation(like Feelers do)\n\nWe like to respond, debate also often condescend and look down on those we find lesser rational, intelligent.\n\nWe are pretty straightforward and direct people, but some of us are more sarcastic and funnier than others in disguising such brutal directness.\n\nFe - No matter how much of a troll, Asshole we may be once when we were young. As we get older we completely changed to be way more sympathetic, understanding, and helpful to causes and things we care about. \n\nP, NP, TP - We have so MUCH interests we barely have time to get to them all. So, we don't finish a lot. We neglect some, or maybe most. We are very laid-back we don't tend judge or should I say pre-judge people much.\n\nWe are also messy, we aren't neat nor do we like to clean. We are not really good planners, we prefer to play by ears rather than agree to anything more than 2-3 weeks that feels too much of commitment. Something else better, may pop up, you know? We got so much interests there are OFTEN many conflicts.\n\nWe are either right on time, or late. Arriving 30-1 hour earlier that is a horrible concept to us! \n\n**We hate stupid ass rules. We hate people telling us what to do. We Rebel hard and bend the rules**\n\nSi - Our memory sucks! And we really hate to do the same shit over and over! We don't like redundancy.
21	[deleted]
19	> Ti - God, we think MORE than any other Extroverts, before we speak! \n\nNo. Just, no. This is so inaccurate it hurts. Us ENTPs *pride* ourselves for our quick wit, and being able to think fast. We *don't* think before we speak, usually. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> We are very laid-back we don't tend judge or should I say pre-judge people much. \n\nWe judge. We judge a *lot*. Every human judge's others, and maybe us ENTPs do so less frequently, but we still do judge. Although we do keep open minds regarding other people, regardless of what we judged others to be. \n\nFor example, if someone's being illogical, stupid, and prioritizing their emotions over fact in a matter which requires factual evidence to proceed? We judge them as stupid and stop inquiring for their opinions regarding that subject.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> We are either right on time, or late. Arriving 30-1 hour earlier that is a horrible concept to us! \n\nSure, if it's for something we don't enjoy. For hangouts with friends? Oh, we can't wait! Sure, I'll arrive 30 minutes early so I can chat with the other early arrivals while we wait for the rest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> **We hate stupid ass rules. We hate people telling us what to do. We Rebel hard and bend the rules** \n\nErm, yeah, not exactly. We hate when rules or orders limit our imagination and creativity. We'd follow rules or orders if we find logical reasoning behind them. Being Rebels would imply that we hate rules on the basis of being rules. Does that sound ENTP to you? For me, not. At. All.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLimiting us to lists is not something an ENTP enjoys. Especially if it's incorrect. I'm sure this would fit some ENTPs on here, but even if we are all ENTP on this Reddit, each and every one of us has a different way of thinking, acting and behaving based on the way ENTPs function. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven everything *I* wrote would be different for another ENTP and could be corrected just as much as yours has been.
6	> we got no problem at all with good parties, great crowded events, we'd GO OUT instead of staying home or with just 1-2 close friends\n\nNot necessarily true. EN means Extroverted Intuition. This has nothing to do with how much you like parties. \n\n> (cuz crowds/strangers makes Introverts uncomfortable).\n\nAgain, this isn't necessarily true. I vs. E describes your dominant function, not your sociability.
13	As a heavy entp this post aint too accurate lol
6	1) While I don’t mind crowds on occasion, or parties (mostly because the opportunity to interact with a lot of interesting people is higher) if I’m certain said party or event will not actually involve me having interesting conversations with anyone I’m more likely to decide to hang out with a smaller group of people who actually get my Ne going. For example, my undergrad institution was a bit of a party school filled with vacuous assholes so I had my select cadre of friends who I’d get drunk and stone with and argue about politics until the wee hours of the morning. Much better than hearing girls talk about Versace bags and other stupid shit. In grad school I went to a lot more parties, because the 100 or such students in my overall department, and the 20 or so in my cohort, were a blast of stimulating conversation. Also, I’m a bit of an ambivert and excel at canceling plans and hanging out, tinkering with my latest obsession in my house. I don’t need people, and actually prefer steering away from constant socializing as it does tire me out, especially if I feel I have to put on an “act”.\n\n2) 75% of the time I don’t know what’s going to come out of my mouth until I start speaking. In fact, I use discourse as a way of honing my thoughts, so I’m not often thinking before I talk. What Ti is for me, more than anything, is my ability to be driven by an internal system of logic. It’s about how I can be content literally day dreaming on my own for hours. My internal world of thought is rich, and complex, and not at all about thinking before I act. \n\nEdit: 3) P for me is more about prospecting as in having all the options open that I can toggle through to select the right one. I like possibilities and knowing the full spread and lay of the land. It’s about wanting to be flexible and not tied down to one course of action and being able to change and adapt with new information. It’s about thinking through the vast number of things that can happen, so you can move forward more efficiently because you’ve got a macro view of what you’re up against. 
10	I  see you have not met and conquered your shadow self yet. \n\nMassive development is yet to come
4	That first paragraph is gonna be a no from me, dog. \n\nI have an E in front of my NTP simply because my Ne is stronger than my Ti, not because I like going out to party and shit.
10	You just wrote a great description of an ESFP — with Te and Ni.
2	Our memory sucks? How did you draw the conclusion that this is a type-characteristic? 
2	This guy sounds like the nerd kid on the polar express. Fuckin spaz
1	Everything is me to a tee apart from the thinking before I speak (although at parties I will listen more than speak, tho depending on who's there on the rare occasion I may be the main voice)\n\nLmao I think of soo many shit jokes and I cant resist the urge not to say any one of them. Also alot of the jokes link really loosely related things together that people are often lost
1	Chill the fuck out
1	Speak for yourself, I can't stand a messy environment. 
1	Are you sure your Entp? Like all problems aside man, Im not super orientaded on /Entp but I hear Azdahak (sorry if mispelled) is kek in this, and you do seem ESXP , plus your arguements are almost entirely based on your prespective, youd be better preaching to a mirror man.
4	I feel like a moron.	TL;DR: After growing tired of the same routine of hardship and breakups looked into MBTI and discover, "oooooooh. That could be part of the reason you struggle with these certain things."\n\nRecently I've been on a self improvement kick and have been exploring many different avenues to better myself both physically and mentally.\n\nI've heard about the MBTI from when I was in high school psychology classes, but never looked into it further than getting what I needed to pass tests.\n\nI've struggled in certain areas of my life and finally decided to really go down the rabbit hole as to what's going on up inside my noggin and decided to revisit this and during one of our sessions I asked my psychologist to take me through the testing.\n\nNow, as with anything when it comes to the mind, I know nothing is cut strictly in black and white but I have strong indicators of ENTP and kind of used that as a launching pad for self reflection.\n\nHoly. Shit.\n\nWhen I read through the different literature available I look back on events that happened in my life, interactions I've had, etc and it's like someone pointing out all the reasons I misinterpreted relationships, couldn't stand certain jobs, didn't understand people's reactions, etc.\n\nI feel like I've gone through my whole life winging it (which I've done okay enough to go this long without seriously looking into any kind of professional personal development) but now after looking into all of this I'm just like, fuck dude. You could have made this so much easier on yourself if you had just understood more about how your personality may translate to other people. I hate to brand myself under a label but there is so much here that just immediately grabs my attention and I'm like, "oh. I didn't realize that not everyone prefers objective truths." And the like.\n\nI feel like such a moron for never investigating things from this angle and I feel like I've been trying to force myself through a locked door for hours only to discover I had the key in my pocket the whole time.\n\nIt'll certainly be interesting to look more into all of this and glean what information I can to be more effective at life.
7	It sounds cliché, but better late than never.
2	Yo man, sounds like your mom has forced you to obey rules your whole life. ENTPs hate rules. That's why your having a rough time. Man, I'd never voluntarily go to a psychiatrist to give me a bunch of rules to follow. I would be debating them on their life choices and advice.\n\n  \nDid you know that a majority of psych majors get a degree in that field because they are trying to understand what's wrong with them?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo snowboarding. Make some business deals. Find people to disagree with. Quit following the rules.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n( This is not medical advice, if you are a crazy nuttball, then by all means go to the head-doctor. You might just be a crazy person who is obsessed with ENTP without actually being one. I don't know, you know the truth. BUT RULES SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF US!)  \n
8	The Value of Nonsense. Thoughts?	
1	I paid $5 for my last bout of nonsense. 11/7 would try again. 
1	This guy has some interesting videos. Nice find!
34	This was done by a confirmed sociopath while they were waiting for an appointment at my mom’s clinic. What do you think?	
78	i'm annoyed that they're not symmetrical. I expect better from a sociopath.
51	I think you guys are reading into this too much. I would probably create something very similar out of boredom, although. Just because someone is a sociopath doesn't mean everything they do is sociopathic.
31	How many [Rorschach](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Pe71TSDnL._SX425_.jpg) tests was this dude forced to stare at?
21	Doesn't look like anything to me
18	Sociopaths struggle with impulse control and chronic boredom. They were bored and had the urge to make a pattern out of pins while they were waiting. It’s nothing particularly exciting, I’m afraid.
9	+1 for vertical colour symmetry, -1 for weak spacial symmetry, and -100 for not centering the bloody thing. 
6	Interesting amount of diffrent coloured pins, I though pin sets were usually more coordinated.
5	I dont get what's special about it (besides the fact that an ENTJ, I mean sociopath, did it)
6	all i know is it’s beautiful but asymmetrical
3	It's interesting how it is condensed in the middle and spread out at the edges. Did they mention why they made this design or what it was supposed to represent?
3	connect the dots
3	Colorful
3	I was immediately impressed for some reason. It's like a form I would never make in a thousand years. Looks almost like magnetic lines. And the color symmetry is astonishing. 
2	My favorite pin is the baby blue one in the middle colum. It doesn't have another one matching it 
2	Is it This??\n\nhttps://www.thoughtco.com/divine-names-kabbalah-tree-of-life-124389
2	Lolz, you guys kill me, I swear.
2	Literally made patterns indistinguishable from this
2	[removed]
1	Looks a bit like the Brand of Sacrifice from the Berserk Manga/Anime.
1	A ribcage + spine
1	I knew a sociopath once. He liked patterns... or maybe he just said he did cuz I like patterns? Dunno. They’re... like vacant cells of a person. 
1	Dragonfly. 
1	it looks like butterfly
1	Looks nice. I find it in interesting that both the left and right side are identical and the middle line separating them is vastly random and striking. Could be a desire of OCD or maybe a representation of thought that things tend to be the same, we just have a superficial line dividing us. \n\nAlso, the more striking colors in the middle tend to be unique pieces without doubles.
1	This tickles my brain.  I see a lot of geometrical patterns. Vesica pisces, tree of life, seed of life. Also see a toroidal shape. Soo interesting. I wonder what he was thinking when he did this...
1	That the one on the top-left is way too far to the top-left and that the bottom green ones, it's like he's not even trying.
1	Not pretty, but probably has nothing to do with it being asymmetrical. A white background, or swapping colors of some pins would help showcasing the color contrast. 
0	I think it's pretty far from perfect
0	Could be better 
12	Help Me Beat Social Anxiety	I don't know where to start. I'm a 15 year old ENTP, and my confidence in my social skills has hit rock bottom. Some people think I'm funny, but for the most part, I act like an idiot. I have no close friends, I feel really nervous/uncomfortable talking to people, and when I do speak, I'm probably just spewing random crap. I'm also a bit touchy, which can annoy people.\n\nIf you have any more questions about the nature of my problems, feel free to ask. I just need some advice, this problem has ruined my relationship with my friends, leads to constant bad first impressions, and is ruining my chances with a girl I've been talking to.
9	ENTP here and I went through the same shit bro. Bumbled through life alone making hideous amounts of mistakes.\n\nBest advice I can give is begin meditating. There are some good apps out there like headspace. Helps to reduce anxiety massively and find more peace. Also helps you to reflect.\n\nAlso, if you learn to pick through the memories of your mistakes to find ways to improve, then you are turning negative memories into positive lessons. Being able to turn what you thought of as negative events into strong positive learning points is one of the best things you can learn to do in life, it will make you strong of mind and an awesome person. \n\nThe effects of following this advice won't be instant but you will be walking forwards at least. All about that positive change, keep going lad. 
8	The best thing i ever did as a teenager was find something I cared about more than being liked. For me it was first music. Then it was art. As soon as I found my passion in that I stopped giving a fuck what Ms Popular thought of me. I  had bigger shit to work on. And the universal law of charisma is the less you care about what people think of you the more people like you. Suddenly I found myself having a kind of social gravity. Before I had chased people around desperate for their approval. Suddenly... people came to ME.\n\nStop caring what they think, by caring more about something that builds you up. Charisma is not giving a fuck about your social status. Its caring less about being popular, and more about being of value. That’s level 1.\n\nLevel 2 is when shit gets real good. When you’ve stopped being preoccupied with what people think about you, you suddenly have room to be genuinely emotionally available to invest in OTHER people. And that’s the key to a happy life. You’ll know you’ve arrived when you suddenly start noticing how anxious and insecure EVERYONE ELSE IS. And then can be the one that puts people at ease and makes them feel good about themselves. That’s not the secret to being popular... it’s the secret to being happy. \n\nThis is something I’m constantly learning and relearning over and over and I’m in my 30s now. It’s always a work in progress. But it’s worth it. 
4	This seems very common for your age group. It gets better. I would recommend reading the subtle art of not giving a fuck, and maybe models, both by Mark Manson. They will give you a decent stepping stone for life and girls, both things i was wondering about when i was 15, which is only four years ago. Try to find a group to belong to. Scouting was a lifeline for my social life and personal developement when i was your age. I dont know where you are, so i dont know what is going on in your area, but try to get involved. Make a concious effort to be open minded and kind to everyone, and yourself. Maybe do sports. Its healthy and social. Remember that everyone around you are going through the same internal struggles as you are. You might very well be extraordinary in some ways (i always hated being seen as average) but you are not alone in your teenage existential and social crisis. It’s okay. Good luck. Treat others like they want to be treated. Question what has no reason behind it.\nSlow down your speaking, and think everything through. Try to speak so slowly, that you eliminate all erms and such nonwords. Also, most people spew crap when they talk, especially when they are nervous. Being an ENTP you are naturally highly disposed to percieving the world around you in great detail. Use this to your advantage. The world is your playground, so test how people react in social situations, as an outsider in a conversation you might begin to see cause and effect in body language especially. Try to focus completely on any social situation you find yourself in. Focus on nothing else. If something creeps in, thats okay, just sweep it back out and continue
4	haha, I think every ENTP has / had this problem..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nENTPs are one of the very... special.. types and our rarety isnt helping either, even if people would try to understand us they would have a hard time because they first would have to find one of us. But in your age nobody gives a shit and people still havent figured out that other people are DIFFERENT, that's why most of us had a harder times than many other types.\n\nAs an ENTP you're constantly experimenting and a result of that is that you are going to eat shit a quite a few times, that's simply part of the process. Embrace it, because you'll learn with every time and get better and better. \n\nIn a few years you'll have a lot of experience and therefor your social skills developed and everything will become much easier then, you just have to let it happen and not pussy out or hiding behind (commonly accepted but bs) constructs such as "social anxiety" (bruv, you're a fucking ENTP, go fucking rock the world lmao)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nif you want we can text a bit because I can relate to what you're going through and don't want to see a fellow ENTP suffer :(
4	I was similar to you man. But the difference is that I learnt/am learning the art of not giving a fuck and only communicating with those that actually don't judge you for being in that awkward phase. Most people are jerks that like to undervalue others for kicks and laughs so don't give them that. Hang out with those that think positively of you. If the girl is avoiding you because of this, she isn't as good as you think she is. \n\nYou'll get through this.
3	"I act like an idiot. I have no close friends."\n\nHey man, I'm only a year your senior. But these sentences really hit my heart, because I'm in the same exact situation. I love talking to people. But often times I get ignored during a conversation, and I get the feeling that this isn't just because my voice is soft. Getting ignored is painful, and can cause a detriment in our social skills, because well, how can you develop social skills if people ignore you?\n\nI've been reading a lot about leadership. Obsessed with it, honestly. The thing you get out of learning about it, and studying the great leaders of our time, is that you slowly learn how to study and imitate their ways of communication. I feel like that's the key to everything, and to this issue. Just good communication. \n\nYou don't practice by continuing to hang out with the same people that ignore you. You practice by finding new friends. Those people aren't good enough for you. Find real friends. People that want you to succeed. You will know when you found these type of people when you do.\n\nGoing off on a tangent, it hurt especially bad when you described yourself as "acting like an idiot", because that's exactly what I do to get some attention because I lack so much of it. I get somewhat uncomfortably loud, act like somebody I'm not, and act like a total moron. This in learn just leads to unfunny jokes in a terrible attempt to get some reaction out of somebody. "Hey, did you listen to that Rolling Boulders album?" Haha, so fucking funny. /s\n\nIt's part of a process. Just know that you are NOT alone, and I'm going through the same shit. Maybe post update threads? Even if its super small progress, like you managed to find a potential good friend to hang out with. \n\nKeep being awesome, because you are. We're just developing.
3	You just described every young ENTP bro. Everyone else can just fuck off just listen to me.\n\n1/ Nothing is wrong with you. You are not socially anxious so get that thought out of your mind.\n\n2/ We , ENTPs, want to be accepted for who we are. If your "friends" don't like the way you are then they don't deserve your loyalty ( we are extremely loyal to people we care about). I was lucky to have INTJs ENTJs ESXPs IXXPs friends and generally people that can laugh at my jokes ,take a hit and realise that I have good ideas and solid opinions that they listen to and ponder about ( no ENTPs is an idiot ). My point is, pick your friends right. You don't need to put a mask to please people to be your friends. Your friends are those who accept you for who you are. If it gets lonely. It will be hard but don't worry it will get a lot better upon meeting your first INXJ, INTP or ENTJ ( any heavy N type actually ).\n\n3/ I'm 19 years old and I'm really good at the bad first impression thing. I know that you can't control your tongue when it starts rolling which is completely okay. Consider that a gift. It's how you filter shitty, easily offended people out of your life. EMBRACE IT, DONT HOLD ON ANYTHING. Trust me on that one. You will be so proud of yourself but also so lonely at first lmao.\n\n4/ The girls Hmm. OK. So what you need to do is to minimize the IRL interaction with her during the first period. Do texting. Let her know your less goofy side first. IRL, we fail to control ourselves for a long period of time.But restraining yourself while texting is a lot easier ( try not to get on that Ne train because she will freak out specially if she was a sensor.) Observe her, alot. Analyse the shit out of her ( You are good at that.) Stalk her on social medias. Know what she really is like. Try to type her ( it will help a lot ). And finally, if she can't accept you for who you are then she is not worth it. Just wait for your INXJ girl to come ( she will ) and you will forget about them all bitches.\n\nFeel free to message me if you need anything else.
2	Dude same here.
2	Don't worry, dude. Everyone your age is so self-conscious and nervous about they way they're coming across to other people, you'd be surprised how little people are thinking about you because they're too busy worrying about how *they're* coming across. The more you socialize the better you'll be at it, too, so just keep at it and it'll definitely get better. The less you care the more you've beaten the system.
2	I made basically the same post in this sub about a year and a half ago. Things haven't changed much but I found how to entertain myself through hobbies - mainly art and some hyperfixations. when that depressive episode due to no social interaction hits you, I hit up some pals on discord and the voice chat makes me feel immensely better\n\n(although thanks every other entp for answering on this thread, I'll definitely check out y'alls resources :) 
2	Start reading and writing a diary. I went through the the same shit as well. Meditating like someone has said before will help a lot as well. As an ENTP you probably have a lot of ideas, and a never ending hunger for new facts, this is what makes you impulsive. The touchy factor, you can simply remove it to mark your position, you don't need people to look at you, but rather make them look at you naturally. You are an ENTP, that will come naturally.\n\nSomething really important is, in my opinion, *STOP PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER* , like for real, that's a good trait, but if you try to do everything at once you will derail with time. Find things and try to make certain goals you want to do. Not complex ones, because those can be rather ambitious, so you can easily focus on the most *important points* instead of the random ones you were trying to connect. \n\nAround people, let your introvert intuition be itself. What I mean by this, don't be scared to stop talking to people, because the truth is, 99% of the people you will meet give you unnecessary information that you are most likely to not like. So be with the people that enjoy, your intelectual debates and curiosity. \n\nUse your curiosity to ask, not to say. What I mean by this is that you don't need to say anything that can occur to be an affirmative statement but rather gather the information by asking to then say such things. The better you get at this, the more organised your head and intituitive thinking gets. You can do this by simply disconnecting you from people. Because believe me as much I enjoy being with friends, the hard truth is that I'm better off with books and videos to gather information. So as a human social being, I only use "friends" to release the pressure of some of my ideas and arguments. I need to test them, and the best way to do this is to ask your friends if they like them and what not.\n\n
2	Good comments here. I’m an ENTP as well and I’ve found that the reason I was so nervous as a teenager and in college, was due to my lack of confidence. At the time, I did not know that and considered myself fairly confident. But as time went on, I realized I was influenced by people’s perception of me and the nervousness stemmed from a disconnect between how I perceived myself and how those around me interacted with me. \n\nMy advice: read thinking fast and slow, meditate, talk less and observe more, find skills that will give you confidence in yourself (I’ve been working on the fluidity of my speech, my ability to break down tough concepts, optimizing where I can, and picking up a programming language)— in a nutshell, work towards that smooth confidence (you’re in control, confident, and wont get easily butthurt because you’ve validated yourself through other means) \n\nGood luck! \n\nEdits: typos

2	For starters, don't [awkwardly repeat yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/ajwctw/help_me_beat_social_anxiety/). 
1	This is going to sound super corny but be yourself and find the people who like you for you. It took me a while to find people who got the kind of person I am but when I did it was totally worth it.
6	Tips on how to focus	I tend to be very distracted and all my work is done in short energy bursts. But now, I have this really important exam coming up and I need to channel my energy in a planned way. I get bored of things that I've already read/understood and hate having to memorize details. Unfortunately, where I'm from, a lot of importance is given to precisely those details and I need to be really thorough. \n\nHow do you all manage to focus or concentrate in similar situations? Any tips or techniques that I could try?
2	I give myself a pep talk, then I download an app to stop my phone for a certain amount of time, make myself comfortable, and start to study. Simple as that
2	I have ADHD, most ENTPs do I've noticed. Vyvanse to focus and keep stable. Fuck Ritalin though, turns me into a robot (ISTP lmao).
2	Meditation improves your ability to focus directly. 
11	Thoughts on yourself 5 years ago	For me naive, ignorant little shit. I feel like I would hate myself 5 years ago if I met today.
9	I like 2014 me, but I think 2014 me would hate 2019 me. My life isn't how I thought it would be, and I'm a lot more flexible and pragmatic than I was before. My past self would view that flexibility and pragmatism as a moral failing, probably. lol. I was quite rigid.
8	Run. Dont walk. Dont look back. \n\nHindsight is 20/20.
3	I would probably feel bad for her (myself), but also hate her. Made myself a lot more miserable than i had to be at the time
3	Troubled, confused, immature but still love her
2	I was 12 not a lot of thoughts. Was probably more intj then because of bullying 
2	holy fucking shit, I'd probably be a millionaire now if I would've known what I know today back then haha\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbesides that I can't really say too much, I think I was alright back then (ofc I wasnt but admitting ones flaws isnt the specialty of ENTPs)
2	Today's version of me is stronger: morally, psychologically, physically, spiritually, socially, and mentally.  \n\nFive years ago I was essentially the same person with the same goals, but with fewer milestones achieved. \n\nThere's still a lot I need to figure out, and I can guarantee that the next 5 years are going to be the most transformative of my life. Let's fucking ride. 
1	Yep.  Same.
1	I was an emo rebel, everyday was melodramatic, think typical ISFP. Today, I am quite mischievous and sometimes very sadistic (I derive immense pleasure from destroying opponents on League or OW). If I had to say something to my past self, I would say "It's okay to be upset and frustrated, but there is no need to destroy your laptop"
1	I don't remember alot. But I was much more task oriented.
1	Quite narcissistic but in fact insecure dude who was way too concerned about what others thought of him and therefore ran behind some societal ideals that were just not good for him. Good I managed to integrate that side. :)
1	I would pity her, yet also dislike her. Arrogant, lazy, and trapped in a toxic relationship. Needed to pull myself together.   \n\n\n17 year old me probably wouldn't be that impressed with who I am now, either. She'd probably think I was amoral and a bit of an ass, but... I'm way happier than I was back then and have achieved more than I ever thought I would, so who's the real winner?
3	Help me rip Astrology to shreds	I hate astrology because there’s no real logical integrity to it. It’s okay when you understand that it’s not absolute but when you have those people that religiously follow and swear by it, that’s what scares me. \n\nYou can try to pry into the inconsistencies but people will pull out the “divine forces/planets” card and completely disregard a practical explanation. All the evidence is anecdotal and everything is so general that it could apply to anyone. Most people talking about a sign are, in reality, talking about a group of people in THEIR lives that act a certain way despite the fact that their view is extremely minuscule in regard to the rest of the population that was born during that period so they’re grossly over generalizing. Finally, it’s not falsifiable. \n\nWtf am I missing??\n\nHow do the cognitive functions play a role in this?\n\n“Rip to shreds” as in strip biases and dig deep not “join me in hating astrology”
16	You’re just saying that cuz you’re a Gemini. Geminis hate astrology. 
9	I like astrology. And I don’t think liking it or disliking it has anything to do with cognitive functions. Change my mind.
7	I have genuinely interrogated astrology (as in the zodiac) with an open mind this past month and my conclusion is there is logic to it. The zodiac types are based on human archetypes. These are then projected unto our surrounds ( i.e. planets, stars, plants etc) with a little butter and grease you’ve got yourself a working religious model. \n\nEmpirically I think one can make an argument as to why these archetypes are so profound and have resonance in most religious text and teachings. \n\nI posted a statement today of my conclusive thoughts on the phenomena of mysticism (which very much includes the zodiac and most religions) on my page . I tried to stay open minded while keeping an empirical eye. If you care to check it out I’m sure we could have an insightful conversation. 
10	I hate this post because there's no real logical integrity to it. \n\n>You can try to pry into the inconsistencies\n\nDon't mind if I do. Let's start with this:\n\nIf you want to rip astrology to shreds, maybe don't validate it by saying shit like\n\n>It’s okay when you understand that it’s not absolute but when you have those people that religiously follow and swear by it, that’s what scares me. 
3	I used to work in a Vietnamese restaurant. The boss asked for my Chinese zodiac sign. My zodiac sign is known for being intelligent, mysterious and a hard worker, so he hired me for that. On the flipped side, my zodiac sign is also known as someone being secretive, liar and manipulative. So he micromanaged me because he believed I would steal money. It's ridiculous and I can understand your annoyance. But you know what, if it is already in their strong belief, it's really hard to change that or to reason them
3	Those outside of MBTI pretty much have the same view of personality type theory.  They think it’s bullshit like astrology.  
2	> Finally, it’s not falsifiable.\n\nThe predictions of astrologers have been proven false time and time again in legit studies.  \n\nThe problem is the theory is so vague that they just come up with ad hoc explanations for why the curtains don’t match the drapes — compare “entps” + enneagram add-ons, etc.\n\nSo I think it’s not so much a matter of falsifiability, as much as it’s the attitude that astrologers never accept that their claim have been shown to be false.
2	I utterly can't stand it. You're seriously trying to tell me that all people born within a certain time frame will behave & act the same way? Fuck the fuck off!
2	Oh fuck! I thought I was the only one. \n\nHere's my rebuttal of astrology\n\n1. If people are born randomly, then they will randomly feel astrology speaks to them. A broken clock is right twice.\n2. Enneagram maps to the Astrological planets.  I think MBTI x Enneagram gives us 254 personalities, but 12 is easier for people's heads and [8 is even easier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven%2C_Plus_or_Minus_Two).\n3. [Numerology](http://worldnumerology.com/) is even more horrid that turns wild coincidences into solipsism and love affairs.\n4. What is the Sun sign of a person born on mars ?\n5. If your birthday affects brain matter, then it should affect animals as well.\n6. Astrology has failed in innumerable experiments.\n7. The only enduring thing about astrology is that it accidentally maps on to twelve of the 16 personality types.\n8. It is better to divorce archetypes from astrology and study them independently.\n
1	i don‘t need further proof to clearly see the difference between me and all the other cancers i know. \n\nand most other cancers were people i got least along with (one ISFP one INFJ) except one i get along with better than most (an ENFJ)\n\nyou don‘t need to argue for something that is clearly infront of your eyes. it‘s inconsistent though i have seen minor similarities among same zodiac people. \n\nfor example most cancers are sensitive on the inside, but on the outside they‘ll show it differently, which also doesn‘t mean that other types aren‘t sensitive either.\n\nso to conclude, astrology is shit but i like the memes
1	As someone taking a personality theory course at university right now, it's funny to me you're saying this on an MBTI board. MBTI is only more valid than astrology because it's based on a test, but it still doesn't hold up to scientific scrutiny. But I guess there's no fun in comparing Big 5 scores, so do your thing. \n\nI think MBTI and astrology are both useful as a lens for analyzing personality; learning the astrological archetypes makes you think of personality differently and see new layers to people you didn't previously expect. The same goes for Jung's cognitive functions and the MBTI archetypes. 
9	What do you think about this statement?	The very fact that we can’t distinguish between where our internal reality stops and the external reality begins is grounds to the claim that deep in our psyche deeper than the instinctual drives that move us to survive is a decentralized zone where the individual doesn’t exist. Where there is no sense of personality or individuality. That realm in our psyche is what allows us to experience our internal reality and our external reality  in unison as one phenomenon. 
5	The premise appears to be flawed, because I can distinguish my external and internal realities just fine, thanks.  I actually have 5 different things in my body designed for just that (5 senses).
1	I immediately thought of [this](https://youtu.be/sxwn1w7MJvk)
1	Why is this an important hypothesis to ponder?\n\nAlso, you might enjoy this TED Talk... [Stroke of Insight by Jill Bolte Taylor](https://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight/up-next?language=en)
1	I don't experience my internal reality and my external reality as one entity or union. I'm quite disillusioned to my external reality and focus a lot more on my eternal reality. 
1	I don't really see why not being able to distinguish between internal and external reality would mean there is a mechanism like the one you are talking about.\n\nIt is impossible to perceive the totality of the information about our surroundings, so our minds have to work with a limited amount of information and create models which are good enough for our survival but not enough to completely describe reality, and by doing that creating an illusion of internal reality that is nothing more than an incomlplete simulation of the actual reality. It might feel real to us because we live locked in it, but something feeling real does not mean it actually exists.

8	How do i talk to people without arguing?	I can't seem to have an interesting conversation unless I'm analyzing something... which apparently hurts my friends feelings... so how do i do that thing that they do where they just agree with eachother and still have a good time? Or rather, what tactic should i replace arguing with? 
8	Start by listening.  If you are concentrating on *listening* to what your "friends" are saying instead of on what you're going to say next, then it's a lot easier to not argue.  Suddenly a conversation goes **from**:\n\nFriend: Ohmygosh this guy was so rude to me!  He did this and that thing!\n\nENTP: 1) that wasn't THAT rude and 2) you should have done x, y, and z differently, and 3) you should hear what a different guy did to ME!\n\nFriend *thinking -* did ENTP even care about what happened to me?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**to**:\n\nFriend: Ohmygosh this guy was so rude to me!  He did this and that thing!\n\nENTP: Wow, that's so upsetting! (you analyzed your friend's actions/speech and noticed that this thing is REALLY upsetting him/her)\n\nFriend: It was!  This is how this made me feel, and now I feel so much better for talking about it.  You're the best!\n\nENTP: I understand the feeling.  I had a similar circumstance and \*tells the story\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee?  Starts with analysis, then acknowledging their feelings which makes the friend feel heard (absolutely the most important part), AND you get to share your story in the end.  People want to feel understood.  You want to be better liked in a conversation?  Analyze their feelings and say something to mirror what you see.  An old co-worker used to tell me all about baseball, and I don't give a flying rat's pajamas about baseball, but I really liked this old guy.  I would listen to his feelings on the most recent baseball game and say things like, "Wow that's so exciting!" or "That must have been really frustrating."  We both went away happy.
3	Choose your battles, you don't have to agree with what they say but you could respond with a "hmm" or "interesting" and only really respond if they ask
2	Just accept that most people hate having their fundamental beliefs questioned.  To you or I, that might mean religion, politics... the deep shit.  \n\nTo some Fi users, the brand of toothpaste EVERYONE should use is a foundational belief. Remember that the debate is more for your purposes, and try to direct the discussion in a way that takes into account the fact that Jimmy will never abandon the belief that failing to launder his jersey gives Khalil Mack magical super-strength.  \n\nTL:DR : Don't try to win the debate unless its actually important to you.  Just be an active observer and glean what you can from it with tactful follow-up questions.  \n\nMy personal strategy: Love me or hate me.  I don't really care that much, and I'll only modify my behavior for money (IE at work.)
2	I have friends with whom I can argue out the wazoo, and friends with whom I know to keep my mouth shut about certain things. I think what every ENTP needs is an outlet. It's a novel concept, I know, but there's no need to argue about everything with everybody. You just have to argue about everything with *somebody*, y'know? Get it out of your system.\n\nAlso, tone matters, as does time and place. If your friend is telling you about her sexual assault or whatever, don't launch into a diatribe about false accusations or whatever. You've gotten some great advice on that front already, though, so I won't say too much more there.

100	We can do better- but we have to stop lying to ourselves	Guys, I recently had a come to Jesus experience, not literally, but in regards to how I see myself. This year I became friends with two other ENTPs, and it honestly blew me away. It was like seeing myself for the first time. My two new friends were brilliant, excellent communicators, funny, and well liked. What really stood out though wasn't their positive attributes, but how shitty they were. All our lives we hear the positive stuff- and we LOVE it. We drown out everything else. For people who like to think of ourselves as analytical thinkers, we refuse to accept many of our own flaws. And granted, we have tons of great qualities. But looking at my new friends, I saw everything about myself that I had refused to be honest with myself about for years. They were arrogant to the point of mocking and belittling others. They refused to accept their insecurities, and instead projected them on others. Their egos relied on others thinking that they were funny and intelligent. Despite incredible potential, they wasted it or settled for mediocrity. Most of all they refused to admit they were lonely, because doing so would mean admitting their crushing fear of being emotionally vulnerable. For the same reason, they had few if any genuine relationships, because having genuine interactions means being vulnerable with others, something they were always too scared to do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying all ENTPs struggle with these flaws, but I know that it took seeing other ENTPs struggling with the same things I do to come to a point where I was willing to be honest with myself about my flaws and work towards fixing them. I hope anyone reading this can see the value of doing an honest analysis of your own life: the good, the bad, and the ugly. We don't just affect ourselves, we affect the people around us. Let's do something awesome with our personalities, and let's start by working on ourselves. 
32	I find that almost every single time I see a flaw in someone else, it's also something I could do better with. Though it seems simplistic, "When you judge others, you only judge yourself" has a lot of truth.
38	I think acute awareness of my flaws is one of the causes of my self deprecating humor, and depression. Don't worry though, it is balanced by a huge ego.
11	That belittling others one has almost caused grief for me on several occasions.. I love my family and friends and I genuinely want the best for them, it just annoys me so much that they can’t think for themselves.. and I show my frustration. 
11	This post really hit me hard. I had this sort of revelation a few years back. I used to be an asshole, and I really mean it. So much of my humour depended on stinging comebacks and belittling my friends. Even though I always had a close of circle of friends, our relationship was strained at best and toxic/hierarchal at worst. \n\nI never studied for tests and while I got straight A’s I was never top of the class even though I could have been.  I thought putting in effort would mean defeat. \n\nI almost never apologized for my actions, it was the other person’s fault if they got offended, right? How could I, who has been told by everyone around that I’m brilliant and bright, be wrong? Outsmarting the people around me by pulling mean pranks and getting away with it was my favorite pastime. Sometimes they were funny, but they almost always ended in tears. It got to the point where I went too far, and I ended up losing nearly all my friends. For the first time in my life I was practically alone.  \n\nOn top of that, my grades were starting to suffer from a combination of studying and panic from lack of human interaction. \n\nI had a year and a half of reflection, I no longer had people left and right praising me. I began to look at myself more objectively (as much as you can at least) and started to see the flaws with me as a person (many of the things you mentioned in your post applied to me).\n\nI’m still working on myself, even though I’m failing a couple classes right now, I’m happy. I study for them, I put in effort. I have friends that make me happy, our relationship is positive now built on mutual respect and building each other up instead of bringing each other down (there’s still teasing of course haha). I’m more willing to accept my mistakes. Although I still have my flaws, I’m able to take a step back, look at myself, and listen to advice from others. \n\nI’m sorry this reply is so long, but this post is something that really hit home for me. As part of improving myself I’m trying to be more open about my feelings (yikes I know), so I guess telling strangers on the internet is my first step. \n\nTo fellow my ENTPs out there, remember to take a step back every now and then, look at yourself, and see if you can do better. There’s always room for improvement. Thanks for this post OP. 
19	This sub has a lot of ENTPs that are terrified to be vulnerable. Some can’t admit they have any flaws and look for any way to tear down others when they start feeling insecure. They claim to not be emotional, yet the look for the absolute worst/most negative interpretations of conversations...\n\nI swear to god I have met so many ENTPs that meet another ENTP and say, “That guy is a dick!”\n\nAnd all you can do is stare at them because you know anything you say will be met with a wall of defensiveness. The self insight is simply not there. Even typing this now I know I’ll likely get keyboard warriors going after me. \n\nDo I think INFJs are perfect? HELL NO. Being truly honest with yourself is very, very hard for all people.  Most people don’t do it. You’ve got to really want it because you see that the alternative has perverted your reality. One of the best things that happened to me in the last few years is finding another INFJ that really tries hard to self improve constantly. Being able to see a different version of yourself, outside of yourself, forces you to keep it real. \n\n
12	I was really happy reading this, I don’t see much complete acceptance of flaws on this subreddit(or any MBTI-related subreddit.... or just people in general.)\nWhile acceptance of the problem is the first step to solving any problem may I ask what concrete steps you are taking in this journey of self-discovery? Like, anything you wrote down, maybe you put a poster up in your room in order to remind yourself, I don’t know? \nAnd I’m wondering if you shared these thoughts with your ENTP friends, and if you did than what were their reactions? Were they open to it? I’m kind of just curious if hearing it from the same type helps at all, it usually does with myself in concern to INFJs. Or perhaps does one need an MBTI background in order to recognize these potential flaws(unless your friends are aware of the system as well?)
19	And everyone slow clapped *\n👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
4	Great post, i recently have felt the same way. It's truly sad how much a few flaws can drown all the virtues of a person. 
3	I've found that my ISFJ wife is the perfect balance for me. It took her a while to get the nerve to call me on my shit, but once she did I encouraged it(best/worst decision of my life). \n\nAs most of you probably do, I struggle with emotional intelligence and having someone who is emotionally intelligent around me all the time has really helped me gain perspective. I don't want to be a shitty person, I know I still am alot if times but having that check for me really works. Now I can catch myself before I do shitty things most of the time.
3	Sounds like a *you* problem. An iss- *you*. A George double *you* Bush did 9/11 problem. Catch my drift?
4	>Most of all they refused to admit they were lonely, because doing so would mean admitting their crushing fear of being emotionally vulnerable. For the same reason, they had few if any genuine relationships, because having genuine interactions means being vulnerable with others, something they were always too scared to do.\n\nHow do you know me? I literally wrote this in my journal today
2	>Most of all they refused to admit they were lonely, because doing so would mean admitting their crushing fear of being emotionally vulnerable\n\nFucking relating over here, maybe. \n\n&#x200B;
2	I wish I could turn off the analysis and the high strung haughtiness that seems to pop up every time I’m in a big group. I’m working on it, but progress is slow. I can be very judgemental towards the outside world, and myself
1	I definitely struggle with almost all of that stuff. 
1	YEP, just realized this two days ago. I suffer from my own pride, arrogance, and self-cherishing. All well being afraid of losing control / fearing the future [https://www.lamayeshe.com/article/self-cherishing-brings-all-unhappiness](https://www.lamayeshe.com/article/self-cherishing-brings-all-unhappiness) 
1	being aware of those and not, makes a huge difference. 
1	Huh. I can kinda see some of this. I try to accept constructive criticism as much as I can. Friends wise I have a large net with people im get along well with but I always have had people I can really depend on when I need. Totally agree with the emotional vulnerability thing
1	I wouldn’t say fix your flaws I would say integrate your shadow. Search the corners of your subconscious and find all those shitty things about you. Make them accessible to your conscious mind. Then integrate them into how you orient yourself in life. I find this more feasible and far healthier. \n  \nCarl Yung says-if you let the content of your subconscious remain hidden it will direct your life and you will call it fate. 
1	I think ENTPs realise the best what they're bad at and what they need to change. ENTPs take criticism very positively and think about it.\n\nBut way too many times, they just wanna shove those flaws deep inside because they don't want to deal with them and the problems keep on getting worse, we end up becoming worse and worse as people, even though at our core we definitely aren't.\n\nIt's just that, if you take self esteem away from an ENTP, you only have a depressed husk left.\n\nThats what I have become.
1	But let me ask the crew here: How should we behave then?\nIf I realize I am an arrogant dick, shall I say: Please help me I suck and I am insecure? Who would hire me?\n\nFor me it’s so difficult to be seen as competent (which is sooo important for ENTP), but not to be seen as arrogant. I am insecure, even though I think I am smart... \n\nDoes this make sense? 
4	Am I too "sensitive" or is it just my frustration????	So long story short, my mother is always leaving negative comments about everything and doesn't have any positivity in those aspects, so one day I felt frustrated because I think that complaining will not solve the problem, like for one instance it's bad food but it has already been served and it's only a bit saltier than usual. So I told her that and she got angry and told my dad and he thinks that I'm "going against her" and that apparently as a child I couldn't "talk back to a parent" and that I'm "too sensitive" about this matter. \n\nBut it has been going for so long and I've always been telling her this and she will start getting passive-aggressive and say that I find fault in her all the time and then I'll act like nothing happened and ignore the situation until it comes up again because I don't even know how to solve this\n\nSo, to those reading: Is it about my "sensitivity" to her statements or is it because of her negativity? I have no idea how I feel.
6	Nope that would piss me off too.  Whining is irritating and inefficient.  Much more is accomplished for one's emotional health and the world around you by being positive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHOWEVER, this is your mom and you can't change your parentage.  Doesn't sound like she's planning to change her ways, so you just deal with it or don't spend time with her.  Don't try to change her, don't say anything about it, just "ok mom" and change topics or move on.  Never have I ever known a parent to take correction well from their child.
3	Your parents are being jerks. You're not being sensitive. Your frustration is a normal response to their behavior. My guess is that their views on parent-child dynamics dictate that children must be perfectly calm and submissive at all times, while parents get a free pass.\n\n> I'm "too sensitive"\n\nTranslation: "It annoys me when you stand up for yourself."
1	that‘s the bully playing the victim role. got the same problem. you have all rights to say what‘s on your mind
0	I've seen a few cunts in my time and your mom is one of them
2	A hypothetical choice, obviously.	Okay, so when I was reading Game of Thrones ages ago I noticed that Tyrions POV kept circling around two main themes; when looking at the cause and effect of other characters choices. It wasn't directed at everyone, and not himself at all (I think he's an ENTP too). But it was basically these two phrases: wise and weak or brave and stupid. \nI haven't seen the show and I'm not sure if this is at all carried on their. It's not that big of a deal in the books either but it's something my mind keeps circling back to, even years later. \nWanted to know what you guys thought. The effects of these two traits in people, uses in the wider world, the people that favour one over another. That sort of thing. 
3	"When people are insecure, they'd rather have somebody who is strong and wrong than someone who's weak and right," - Bill Clinton
1	I mean does it have to be one of the other, can it be a combo off the both at different time periods and requirements in your life.\n\n I think he breaks it down to such simple terms because in his mind he is wise and weak and he looks down upon the Brave and stupid.\n\nThere are brave and strong and wise and wrong. Pretty sure his pwm inadequacies due to size and nihilistic view of the world make him not want to accept that anybody can be what he's not, his strength is intelligence so for someone to be brave and intelligent would devalue him too much\n\nHe may just be accepting that as fact because it's easier then making himself Brave comma even though in the battle in the second book against Stannis he is both wise and brave
3	I'm confused about my type	I've identified as an ENTP for around 2 years now and my cognitive functions do match with ENTP. Although- trait wise I don't relate to ENTP stereotypes much.\n\n1. I don't overly enjoy arguing with other people. Especially when I know that the other person is not going to change their mind or if my opponent is going to be too rigid to accept any other logic. I do like playing Devil's Advocate and debating things in general but tend not to direct this outward or in real life. And I also avoid offending people because of shit I say. What I'm trying to get at is- I love debating, but only with myself, in my own head. Stereotype: ENTP's love to debate and find fallacies. Often, they may not even realize when they offend others\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) When I talk, I tend to make up everything as I'm speaking. What that might appear as is that I don't really have a point. Stereotype: ENTP's are said to have reallly good communication\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) The way I remember things. If I'm writing an exam which requires me to remember details, say History, the page on which I read the facts appears in my mind and I write according to that. This isn't photographic memory though (how i WISH lol), it's just that my memory is visual. This doesn't really classify as a stereotype but I've heard from many other ENTP's that information gets stored in the form of interlinked concepts for them. Their memory isn't associated with any of their senses (auditory, visual, kinesthtic, etc.). I think this is the one thing that has me stumped. If i've always tested as an ENTP- how come this Si like trait is so strong in me.\n\nI had other points too but I'm lazy and it's really late and I should get sleep xD\n\nMy question is- Do all you ENTP's relate to these stereotypes and am I the only one who's an anomaly here?
6	As you said, it's a stereotype. I think your points pretty much defines you as an ENTP. Also, about the second point: That's Ne for you XD
2	I wouldnt let type limit you, I've met a handful of my type and weve all been different. 
1	You're not the only anomaly.  I am right there with you on the arguing, making it up as I go (credible bs), etc...  My memory is good conceptually but for details I need to write it down and then read it a few times.  You can be an ENTP and maybe be a little less strong in some areas.
10	difficulty phrasing thoughts into words/sentences	What do you think may be the reason behind this? I start off having an idea that I want to tell people of, and inside my mind there's an image of what I think (There are always images) but I just can't find the right word to use and look like a blubbering idiot esp in front of an audience when I'm not prepared. It may be that I have a limited amount of vocabulary to use, but I don't think this is the case. Other ENTPs don't seem to have this problem, so what else do you think it may be?
9	I am much better as expressing my thoughts in writing than verbally, as I will often go back and restructure sentences, add in brackets etc. I think it’s because I’m always trying to express like five thoughts, and I will remember some required context halfway through, so I pause to add that.\n\nMy mum is the same (also an ENTP), and I will always follow what she’s saying easily, but my INFP sister and ISTJ dad will be completely lost.
6	I’m like this when I’m around people who make me nervous or that I feel like I’m gonna offend.
4	This problem is normal, not only among ENTPs but among humans in general. It takes a lot of work to be glib. And even with a lot of work, you will still often fail. (Speaking from experience lol)
1	Never had the thing with images but sometimes, my brain is going through the ideas to fast for me to convey it properly
1	Good speakers/communicators are creative speakers/communicators. Speaking is like a painting to me, the words I can remember are colors on a palette. Trust you me I have fun every single time. Naturally because I have given myself the chance to experiment and fail again and again for years people find my speech pattern very refreshing. 
1	I would assume it involves two different skills. \n\n1 Being able to make sentences on the fly (even random ones for starters, just being able to follow a proper sentence structure and coherency at first), \n\n2 Being able to translate your thoughts in a clear and concise structure that you can combine with 1 to say out loud.\n\nIf 1 or 2 is weak, you might get bottleneck at somepoint. Practice both separetly and then unify them I'd say? Reading books can help for 1.
1	Exercising the precise speech brain region is something i remember doing when i took philosophy class. The teacher was really quick at precisely articulating his intended meanings and i was envious. Now i can type shit like this
7	i wanna hear your theories about space/existence.	First of all. the only entp ive (knowingly) met is my little sister, therefore she is the only one ive ever really been able to speak about these stuff in a really giving way. So i figured, what is a better place asking my favorite question in the world than a subreddit full of me's.\n\nso have you came to any own theories that you "accepted" about existence and space overall in your life. I just want to hear what you think. I dont care if its true or sound silly because nothing is really true in this subject since we know so little about it so far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\npersonally my biggest "answer" that i come to peace with is that everything we know and have ever seen anywhere is just part of a scale. A scale so big or so little that our brains just cant comprehend it. no matter how much we zoom in on something we allways find new smaller things. i think its the same no matter how much we zoom out there will just be infinate bigger things and the only answers we will get is that our universe is just one puzzle piece that together with  other pieces build something bigger and weirder. and if we succeed to zoom our more we will see that this bigger something together with other somethings of the same scale just creates something much much bigger.\n\njust look at the things we discover when zooming in at something.  small things put togheter just make bigger things. i dont think the search ends because there will allways be bigger and smaller things whatever they might "be".\n\nand i dont think our brains is capable of "understand" much at all of whatever we might find if we had the technology of zooming into the infinity. what we might find would seem absurd and create more questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsorry for a long text with bad english\n\ni know i would never read all this and taking the time to answer. But just one interesting aswer would make me happy. give me something to think about  from a different mind and angle plz :)
5	So you're saying it's puzzle pieces all the way down?
3	Actually they say the universe goes around in a loop. If you keep flying for enough light years, you’ll end up back where you started. Kind of like how the earth is round, except not at all. So they have a pretty good grasp on “big” things.\n\nSo that’s it for our dimension. If we’re talking theories on other dimensions, it gets tricky because our brains really can’t conceive of anything outside of the dimensions we can perceive. So they’re all just theories and best guesses. But I would definitely except some kind of multiverse to exist. Have you seen interstellar? It has a scene with the best visual representation of a multiverse that we can comprehend. But how many dimensions? Some suggest 5, some suggest up to 30. There’s no way to know.
3	>so have you came to any own theories that you "accepted" about existence and space overall in your life\n\n1. **I exist** \- I don't think that I can reasonably deny the fact that I exist; basically, I think therefore I am.\n2. **The universe exists around me** \- I exist as some part of the universe; I may not know what exactly the universe is, but it must be something that contains me.\n3. **Nothing exists outside the universe** \- I believe that, by definition, the universe is *everything;* everything that exists now, that has ever existed or that can ever exist. I don't think it make any sense to try to talk about anything being before, after, or outside of the universe.\n4. **Repeatable measurements are all that exist** \- If we are not able measure something, using some sort of repeatable process, then that thing might as well not exist. The only things that can be said to exist in any meaningful sense are those things which we can experience somehow.\n5. **Hypotheses must be testable** \- Carl Sagan's *Demon Haunted World* does a good job of explaining the concept of falsifiability and it's importance to separating pseudoscience from science. I've come to consider this notion a fundamental tenet of my worldview; which is that I don't have very much interest in theories that can't be tested at this time with finite time and resources.\n6. **It doesn't make sense to seek "Objective Truths" about the universe** \- By "Objective Truths", I mean statements about what the universe "really is"; example is the universe really a simulation or whatever. I don't think it makes sense to talk about making a measurement / experiment to establish this fact because you would need some reference point outside of the universe. I think that we should only be concerned with repeatable measurements, testable hypotheses and theories about our observations.\n\nI'm not sure I'll do any good trying to convince anyone of these statements, except to explain that I think they are reasonable, I haven't found much evidence contradicting their validity, and I think they are an interesting way to think about the universe.
2	Have you taken any physics?  \n  \nMost of my concepts/models come from scifi inspiration and physics experience making me accurate-ish.  \n  \n/u/negativegpa another interesting one
1	apparently ants can't percieve people but I don't know if that's a rumor. If it's true then 'nough said. 
1	Eventually everything with decay into thermal energy as entropy increases. Reaching a point of thermal equilibrium where literally nothing happens.\n\nTheory part - life just accelerates this decay into heat. It has been shown that non living molecules can replicate and by nature particles try to remain in a low energy and more stable state
1	Conciousness is the basis for everything.\n\nI don't buy the idea that conciousness is just an emergent property of really comex systems. It cannot be measured, it cannot be tested for, it doesn't even have a discernible function it performs in us.\n\nIf my nervous system senses pain and that signal travels through my brain and hits the right buttons for the right reaction, why does this subjective experience have to be there? Why do I have to actually feel the pain. Humans, as far as we can tell, are just biological machines, algorithms doing what they were determined to do. So it all could work without conciousness, but yet here we are, experiencing.\n\nConciousness has to be an intrinsic part of reality, how could it be anything but. Emergent Properties can still be understood as a sum of their parts, but conciousness cannot so it is not.\n\nIt has to be more fundamental and if it is, it has to be the bottom.\n\nThe seed everything else sprouts from.\n\nThis reality is a dream this fundamental conciousness dreamt up in order to experience something. Create Objects and Subjects, else there is nothing. The experience that a subject has of an object is all there is and all there ever will be an eternal now, subjects and objects colliding ceaselessly. \n\nIn my head, this makes perfect sense, put some holes in my theory.
1	The very fact that we can’t distinguish between where our internal reality stops and the external reality begins is grounds to the claim that deep in our psyche deeper than the instinctual drives that move us to survive is a decentralized zone where the individual doesn’t exist. where there is no sense of personality or individuality. That realm in our psyche is what allows us to experience our internal reality and our external reality  in unison as one phenomenon. \n\nThis notions if true has profound implications. Maybe those people who claim the universe is united in some divine way aren’t crazy after all maybe they’re really on to something.

6	replying to only the title - fuck joy, I keep useful pages, = providing new perspective = ok yeah they provide joy by reframing my life in some way. okay, you made me close 50 tabs out of my 5000. I call the mission a success

2	Actually a good show. She doesn’t yell at people to get rid of their crap just helps them have perspective of what is actually important.

1	But what if many of them are related to homework I’m procrastinating on
1	Isn’t this the person Tim Ferriss interviewed?
1	No thanks. I love one tab. And I usually come back to them... Eventually
2	Is self confidence overrated?	I keep hearing people advising others to be confident in themselves, but I've always been very skeptical about this advice, especially if it's just thrown out without nuance.\n\nAlso, I think certain type of self doubt is healthy, since human beings are too good at deceiving ourselves. There's a story about a Chinese painter who thought he loved dragons and would decorate everything with dragons, until a real one visited him after hearing how much he loved em and the painter ended up pooping his pants after meeting the real thing. How often do people find themselves in a similar situation when pursuing their passion & dreams full of self confidence, only to be dissapointed when they get what they want?\n\nAnyway, what are your thoughts on this type of advice? Is it overrated? Are ENTPs doing a huuuge service to humanity by questioning the status quo?\n\nEdit: Writing things all over the place was a bad idea.
6	There is a difference between confidence and cockiness. That’s the fine line you have to tow. Confidence doesn’t mean you are unaware of the possible failure, but you have faith enough in yourself that you will not fail. \nCockiness is a feeling on invulnerability and lack of awareness. \nAs someone who lives with constant self doubt. No. Confidence is not over rated. 
2	I think it's better to follow a passion or a dream and be disappointed once you reach it than to live your whole life with regret over not doing it.
2	Self confidence and overestimating yourself are not the same thing. Actual self confidence is being secure in yourself whether you're successful/right/sexy or not and being able to say "I don't know what I'm getting myself into and I'm okay with that."\n\nWhat you're describing is the Dunning Kruger effect.
1	No it's not overrated. If you're confident that doesn't imply dunning kruger. But you're correct that confidence without actual ability won't get you very far.
1	no
1	Not too sure on this one. I've been told that I'm quite a confident person and feel that way too. In general I believe that confidence is very important and a very good thing to have. As long as you're not cocky and being a dick then it's great.
1	Self confidence is a promise you make to yourself to become stronger/better/more competent no matter what happens. That’s how I see it. \n\nSelf confidence can never be overrated. It is how one develops an individual map of reality. 
5	What would you guys do if you had a creepy, obsessive stalker?	Just curious how ENTP's would handle having a stalker who claims to be "in love with them" when really they just stalk them and try to intrude in on their lives and hurt the people they care about.\n\nMy ENTP friend (female) had one. He was arrested a few months back after trying to stab me in the ribs. I and him were sleeping over at her house since she invited us over along with my girlfriend. Basically, he felt that she was getting too close to me and in a fit of jealous rage, he grabbed a kitchen knife and tried to stab me in the ribs while I was asleep. I luckily managed to escape since I had been awake at the time (I don't fall asleep easily). My friend heard the commotion and walked out of her bedroom, holding a rifle just to find me running for my life and her friend chasing me a shiny knife. Upon seeing her with the gun, he stopped in his tracks and dropped the weapon, surrendering. We called the police, and thats that. Funny thing is, he was her good friend. And he had just been stalking her without her knowledge. I suppose its due to his high intelligence that he was able to get away with it for *2 whole years*. \n\nNeedless to say, she was thoroughly frightened but handled it with bravery. He apparently had planned on killing me, then my girlfriend and then chloroforming and kidnapping her. Its just terrifying to think what would've happened if he succeeded. \n\nWhat would you guys do in a situation like this? I know I'd be scared shitless. 
17	I am not hot enough for that to happen to me.
4	Call the stalker out.  And tell everyone I knew and then call the cops.
3	I lived in a smallish town and had a nameless stalker. I'm 5'8" and as tough as a dude my size. This guy was well over 6 feet and 230 lb or more. \n\n\nHe was showing up everywhere for months including where I worked. I went to the cops, and the mental health unit that he was a regular at. The mental health unit couldn't give me information on him, and the cops wouldn't do anything until I had his name and phone number.\n\nThey told me to stalk my stalker. Who had mental health issues.\n\nI kept trying to gently tell him to go away, and one day he decided to grab a sword from the knife shop across from my work. \n\nI ran. Hid for half an hour. The manager of both stores called security and the cops and he took off and I never saw him again. \n\nYeah. I think that stuff is purely situational 
3	You are truly blessed to have survived that. Glad you're okay.\n\nI'm just curious exactly how did you recognize his lethal intentions in the dark, despite your wakefulness? \n\nWeird question to ask, but I'm just amazed you survived.
2	I can tell you EXACTLY how I handled that jackass.  1) I cussed him out in the parking lot, not once, not twice, but 3 different times telling him to leave me alone.  Then 2) I called his mother.  Yep, I went there and explained how her son was acting and advised her that my next step might be police.  Then 3) I called him up, told him that the next time I heard from him I was gonna bring a hellfire of legal trouble down on his ugly-ass head, and that if he ever showed up at my door again without permission he'd be shot.  Then 4) I bought a few more guns and kept one in every room of the house.  I made a lovely target with a nice little grouping, taped it to my front door, and wrote "Door locked for YOUR protection".  Didn't hear another peep for 4 years.  He contacted me to apologize, and told me he was ashamed and I said, "Good.  You should be.  I forgive you, but leave me alone."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNOTE: I'm lucky that he had enough sense in his brain to back off when I got serious.  I would have taken legal action if it had gone any further (or physical action if I deemed it necessary and believed that he provided an imminent threat to my health and safety).  I am very glad that my situation did not require it.  Honestly?  I was terrified.  I even went to the bathroom with a gun for a while, and it's only now in my new home in a new town that I finally been able to relax.  I don't react to fear well - I get angry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: the other one was when I was a teenager, and I don't know what happened with him.  I know that Dad put on his serious face and his boots and hat and he stepped out to have a word with the boy.  Then he came back chuckling and said the kid wouldn't be any more trouble.  That was that.
1	How hot is the stalker?
1	Had one. Got someone to smash his teeth in. Problem solved.
350	Im pretty sure the NTPs are the same	
97	Tl;dr: \n\nIf Ne = exploration and Ti is truth, and if the 2nd function of a stack is the grounding or "responsible function" then \n\nENTP's are truthfully exploring, while INTPs are exploring truth.  \n\n\nI'm still trying to get the system down to help highlight the differences between the I and e versions of types but you get the gist.  
33	Put an intp and an entp in a room together and you'll notice the difference pretty fucking quickly. Intps never get to the level of charm entps have and entps never get to the level of detail that intps do. Also intps are borderline autistic, especially when they're under 30
16	All roles have the potential to "flip" with moods and situations. Extroverts have periods where they enjoy introverted activities. Introverts can be extroverted in a crowd of people they enjoy and trust. \n\nINTPs and ENTPs have similar functions, just a different stack order. They'll think very similarly, but their functions "serve" each other in different ways.

60	The two types are not the same. A comprehensive literature review of Myers Briggs studies reveals statistically that, on average, ENTPs have a higher propensity for \*ruling\*, while INTPs have a higher propensity for \*drooling.\*
14	Insert obligatory "Introversion and extroversion don't refer to how outgoing you are or how much you like people. They refer to the orientation of your dominant function."
11	 XNTPs can have both their Ne and Ti developed fairly good. Their actions will look the same but their motives/ fear will differ so they will lead different paths with different issues. \n\nI went through that xNTP phrase too but ultimately I am an ENTP with a demon Si. Demon Si never changes for ENTP and Demon Fe never changes for INTP. That's where we will differ a lot. Sure entps and intps will get along well on a surface level but after some beers you will both think 'what's wrong with this guy, what a drama queen." Fe still sucks for ENTP,  and Si still sucks for INTP but they are not crippled dealing with them. Demon functions are our down fall however
41	Nah, entp's can do intp but not give versa. If they're indistinguishable it's solely due to the possibility that they're all entp
11	ENTPs should look more like ENFPs from the outside, until you really get to know them.  They should overwhelmingly, primarily, lead with Ne as a noticeable, defining, characteristic.   \n\nTo INTPs ENTPs should be conspicuously similar, and vice versa.  To most others they should seem extremely different.  
11	As an entp I find that INTPs, while quite similar, don't follow my Ne as much in a conversation, they tend to get caught up in details a little more while I jump ahead quicker to the end conclusion or some abstract metaphor.  I find on the surface my train of thought is more similar to an ENFP but then upon deeper analysis, the ENFP's reasoning and core motivations are way different.  I also think ENTPs have a slightly easier time reading people and playing a role, although INTPs are one of the more theatrical introverted types which can be deceiving! 
4	I have tested both. My I vs E is close to midline but I mostly test I. Those who know the test and me say I’m INTP. So, I guess I’m inclined to agree. 
5	The INTPs I know are really good at refining ideas... and they're obsessive about it. To the degree that they'll lock themselves in a room with a chalkboard for days. I'm *okay* at refining ideas, but I prefer exploring ideas instead. I use my Ti to serve my exploration (Ne).\n\nedit: deleted "as an ENTP" because it's on my flair and you probably would know I'm an ENTP anyway.
3	Gonna have to disagree.\n\nENTP's are far more extroverted with an obvious and recognizable presence. Maybe not enough to type a person as an ENTP, but definitely enough to say that a person is not an INTP. Although your proposition could hold true in short instances of interaction with either type, it would be easy to tell the difference if a good amount of time is spent around either type.
5	Some differences:\n\nINTP have holographic-panoramic cognition. They make static models focused on goals and try to reduce the total complexity. INTP’s are negativist in their thinking: “what’s not there?” And positivist, declaring in their feeling/sensing: This is what I like! I don’t like this!\n\nENTP are causal-determinist cognition. They make static models focused on process and add on complexity over time. ENTPs are negativist in their feeling/sensing (what does that feel like?) and positivist/additive in their thinking: This is this, stupid!\n\nENTP’s are more straightforward in their logic and are easier to ‘train’ like a dog because of their cognitive style. They internalize a logical process way of doing things, while their sensual appetites are more curious. INTP’s are very resistant to attempts at mind control given their cognition type is always looking for some alternative, simpler logical framework, while sensually they’re very particular and stubbornly refuse to change habits or relations they’re accustomed to.\n\nThere’s a noticeable difference in the types where they’re pliable and where they’re stubborn.\n\nWith the cognition styles, ENTP thinks more like INFP, ISTP, ESFP. And INTP thinks more like ESTP, ENFP, ISFP.
3	The functions work like different weighted dominos in a domino effect. The biggest domino for an Intp is Ti which needs to hit Ne for it to fall which subsequently needs to be heavier than Si ect. Say u put Ne in front of Ti and flicked it, it wouldn’t make Ti fall down because its lighter in weight. The patterns in which the dominos are set up are similar to cog functions. Therefore, you cannot be both entp and intp. You’re one or the other. You just may seem a certain way in different circumstances. I’m an intp who comes across as extroverted when I’m comfortable (i.e close friends around or I’m drunk) the types are not the same but similar. I sometimes feel like I quiet my first function (ti) which keeps me looking introverted, but that doesn’t mean that it’s been switched around with Ne, it just seems that way because I’m in a more comfortable state of mind. 
3	Online tests always peg me as an INTP even though I am more likely to be an ENTP. I think the reason is that they measure extroversion through parties and I don't like parties. I also have stage fright, so I don't like being the center of attention. However, I start to get depressed when I'm alone long enough for me to get bored and notice, and when I'm with friends I am always pumped. My friends think that I have infinite energy for that reason. On the other hand, I see some of my extroverted friends and think that in comparison to them, I am a complete introvert. I guess there may be some truth to ENTPs being the most introverted extroverts. So that's a way in which I justify my ENTP belongingness through extroversion/introversion.\nI don't know why I went on this tangent.
3	ENTP Chad vs virgin INTP
2	As someone who constantly qualifies as ENTP, I definitely love having time to myself and being introverted as well as being sociable and out and about. 
2	I was clearly (no doubt) an introvert back then (until 20), then I met the happiness of being an ambivert (until 28), then I asked myself why I keep all the power, glory and endless potential only to myself and released the dragon (after 30) and started using ENTP features to its roots.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for a long time, I haven't changed my role. My mood no longer determines my personality ( I am always no matter what an extrovert and I enjoy it, I have no thoughts to even go back to ambivert). Ok thanks bye
2	Idk, at least comparing myself and other ENFP’s to INFP’s the INFP’s are a lot more “judgey” than the ENFP’s when we meet new people or have new experiences.  Yes, it’s hard to tell types apart when people are in different moods, but that doesn’t mean their functions are the same. It just means they’re presenting a little differently 
2	My Ne and Ti take turns, but my Fe is definitely not my inferior function. It's definitely Si. 
2	You can always tell who is the ENTP, I disagree with the premise you proposed
2	Technically incorrect, but functionally accurate most of the time.
5	Incorrect. The entire point of MBTI is that it talks about how we process the world. The way you process things doesn't change depending on your mood.\n\nThat said, great shitpost!
4	As an INTP...why would I try to argue with an ENTP that comes right out and says their mind is made. Or another INTP for that matter.\n\nAll of this can be explained with a fine understanding of cognitive functions, which I doubt interests OP considering the nature of this post.
1	Anybody can pretend to be any other type, but the difference is in the 3rd stack function. Entps have Fe and for Intps its their 4th stack. That's pretty easily distinguishable. 
1	Entp to me seem like ferrari with gas for 300 miles, and intp like a jeep with gas for 400 miles. Hare vs turtle
1	Indeed.\nXD
1	I Am an INTP and I somtimes feel and act as an ENTP but that can be exhausting and would need time alone after.
1	Wrong, so so wrong. 
1	The main difference between INTP and ENTP still comes down to when socializing they prefer to hang out with as many as people at a party(and don't mind talk to any strangers), or only a select few closest friends  or new stranger-friend introduced by their old friends(even if they wouldn't shut up when with friends)?\n\nI am the former, 100%. And don't believe I am aware of any INTP broke this mold.\n\nAlso, maybe in the way of posting on social media, ENTP may do it more than INTPs? Not saying vs their friends, they are as quiet.\n\n\nBut other than that, I agree it can be hard to tell.\n\n\nENTP is no doubt the most Introverted Extrovert of all. And INTP is arguably THE MOST Introverted(#16). There is a huge difference between how both behave in party, concert, public events, even if INTP goes out to those, often they don't. But ENTP would!
1	honestly? i sort of agree since NE and TI aren’t opposite the way that intuition and sensing functions or thinking and feeling functions are. you can say TI>FE, because they are opposite, but it’s harder to say TI>NE because they aren’t opposite, ya know? and since the only different between the types is which one is first, they’re kinda the same. same goes for any mbti imo
1	Sometimes I seem to be an INTP, but if I get two drinks in me, it cannot be more clear that I lead with NE. I see Everything and switch from a thing to another within 2 seconds ( not exaggerating) and my TI goes aaway. Just a big shallow NE.
1	So...Fire Starter Bruce Campbell, did we change your mind?
1	That's the thing about MBTI and its biggest criticism. There is a harsh line in the middle between I and E. Exactly where most people are placed, statistically.
1	Introversion vs Extroversion are the most understood things about MBTI, even for those in the know.\n\nIt's not about "do you enjoy being around people." Your type isn't about what you enjoy. It's about how you process information world.\n\nIs it more effortless for somebody to perceiving / process information which is generated INTERNALLY or EXTERNALLY? An ENTP will SEE something funny which will spark them to alter it in a cool and unexpected way, but they may need more time to get their own thoughts straight. An INTP will THINK of something funny which will spark them to alter it in a cool and unexpected way, but may have a more difficult time integrating foreign elements.\n\nThis is why an INTP is an inventor/coding type and an ENTP is a detective/lawyer type. Our brains can work similarly after the information is introduced/internalized, but one of us has an easier time internalizing external information and one of us has an easier time structuring internal information.
0	Elaborate.
4	Advice for following through with ideas?	I find myself enamored with big picture ideas that I have, but I get extremely bored trying to flesh out these ideas from the ground up. I’d appreciate any advice or personal experiences esp. from ENTPs who were able to make their ideas a reality. How do I stay motivated? Do I need to think of how I work on things differently? Or do I just need to settle on something that I’m willing to devote all my time to? Thanks in advance for any responses.
5	OH!  I had forgotten what I was supposed to be working on today!  Crappola. thanksbye!
2	One of my friends calls my strategy "hustling", which is a term I've started to identify with. I procrastinate and get distracted until I reach a point where I realize that the shit's really gonna hit the fan unless I get it together. I immediately eliminate all distractions and focus absolutely all of my energy on the problem in front of me. By honing in like this, I can actually accomplish things in an effective manner... (although, admittedly, unless the repercussions from not following through are severe, I don't normally crack down like this). For me at least, it's all about self restraint and discipline which I've acquired over time.
1	If you have too many ideas and not enough time, the solution is to get rid of ideas until you have *just enough* ideas and *just enough* time. Decide which ideas matter the most to you, and dedicate some time to bring them to life.
1	It sounds like you laziness may be a reason to not follow through (it's easier to dream up another big idea than it is to follow through on the last one).  I've answered similar questions like this with my own story.  It goes like this:  \n  \n1. Be lazy and reckless  \n\n2. Get into financial troubles due to laziness and reckless decision-making  \n  \n3. Panic  \n  \n4. Be forced to work my ass off to recover from financial ruin for years, working full time while also a full-time student\n  \n5. Spend 2 years developing a hard-work habit because I basically have no choice  \n  \n6. Pay off debt and decide I want a nice car so I keep working hard  \n  \n7. Buy a nice car and decide I want something else expensive so I keep busting my butt  \n  \n8. Repeat cycle of buying expensive items and continuing to work hard  \n  \n9. Now it's just who I am  \n  \nEssentially just use the deadline technique but over a really long period.  It will train you.
33	Arguing with Ni-Te is utterly insufferable	i have three INTJs in my life right now and don’t get me wrong, they’re great, but disagreeing with them...about anything....automatically activated the purest form of low quality gaslighting and middle school logic. \n\nOk they start off logical, sure, calm, unemotional. \ni say something. \nThey tell me they disagree \nand i ask them for their argument. \n\n**Step 1: “You Said That Cup Is Red, I Say It’s Green, You’re Wrong Because All The Cups In Siberia Are Green**”\n\nwhat are they ever fucking talking about? i don’t care what other people say that’s the entire reason i’m stating that i disagree. i’m not automatically wrong because i don’t fit your criteria? if i fit your criteria...i wouldn’t be disagreeing. that’s not how that works lol. it’s all so goddam Te oriented. Their argument is normally a list of reasons my argument is wrong but they are never able to accurately describe, in depth, why they think a certain thing without using (usually unrelated) criteria. it is always an offensive justification of me being wrong instead of a defensive statement about what they actually think:\n\nit goes like this:\n***entp***: i don’t agree with this criteria\n***intj***: the criteria is right\n***entp***: why do you say that?\n***intj***: because your point is wrong because it doesn’t align with the criteria \n\nyea no shit? it’s a completely circular and nonsensical argument. like...what?\n\n**Step 2: “I Just Know You’re Wrong, Trust Me, My Ni Says I’m A Savant”**\n\n when i push them to give an individual argument as to why my argument is wrong, i am either met with a Fi dismissive, sensative attitude (at this point the conversation is a total goner). or i’m met with some complete and utter Ni bullshit. i know that everybody likes to pretend Ni isn’t the most absolute bullshit, egotistical, and frustrating function- but it is. it’s cute sometimes but when that Ni canon is firing at you i swear to god, the only answer is to run and hide. don’t get me wrong, all these NiDoms have the right to their opinions just like everybody else, but you don’t get to tell me i’m wrong and then refuse to tell me why and hit me with that “that’s just the way it is, i just know it, i understand how it works but i can’t explain”. and then go all Fi on me when i won’t validate your Ni-prophetic assertions about why i am a complete dipshit. \n\n**Step 3: “If I’m Right, You Can’t Be Right, So Shut Up”**\n\nnever expect them to validate your points. if it doesn’t fit their big picture it’s all wrong. “i see what you’re saying but it doesn’t match my opinion so it’s wrong.” i often tell people in arguments when i agree with smaller points they make even if i don’t agree with their entire argument. if they present a logical idea i will validate it. NiTe NEVER does this and will never be thankful for your smaller validations of their ideas because they want to win. and if they can’t win they will emotionally or intellectually tap out.\n\ni see so many Ni doms on reddit and in real life say that they like to explore ideas from multiples angles which is completely delusional. that’s Ne not Ni....they will explore the implementation (NiTe) or the motivation (NiFe) behind ideas like nobody’s business but once Ni says “jump” they say “how high?”. and NiTe says “how high exactly? what do i do after i land? everybody who doesn’t jump exactly like me is wrong, let me give them you unsolicited advice about how to jump like me.” and if you ask them why why they are jumping they wont answer and will tell you that you’re wrong for not jumping too. \n\n**Step 4: If You Don’t Agree With Me, You’re An Oppressor and A Retard** \n\nat this point in the conversation, i feel like i’m going totally fucking bananas! it’s either completely dissolved into Ni-horseshit or it’s Te hitting me over the head with facts that DONT MATTER, or its Fi shutting down like a child and thinking i’m a bully for asking you to prove why you say that i am wrong? and then they say they’re worn out or change the subject but will never ever admit to being wrong. ever. \n\nexcuse my rant & typos and shit, i’m just so peeved, \ni have been in several personal and  in-class discussions with INTJ friends lately and i swear to god it’s not worth it. its not worth the trouble. do not engage. walk away slowly. never look back. \n\ni find working with intjs to be such a wonderful fluid experience. but disagreeing with them might be worst than any of the other types.\n\n-	it’s not entirely illogical Fi stuff which tickles my Fe into just giving them a hug and realizing i don’t care lol. \n-	it’s not a fact/practicality based argument (Si, Se, Te) which is honestly refreshing at times. \n-	it’s not a Ti analysis of my Ti analysis which is always lovely. \n-it’s not another Ne expanding my argument and making me forget my entire point \n-	and its certainly not a criticism of my point from a more broadly empathic lens (Fe)\n\nit’s a shitshow combo of all my weeknesses, uses poorly, against me. which is...so bad. 
16	This is honestly hilarious and I’m sorry I’m laughing at your pain. I would love to watch this from a distance. 
10	Don't bother arguing with them.  I have an INTJ sister, and I absolutely promise you that it is a waste of breath and brain cells.  They can't handle being wrong about anything ever (I've seen her admit it maybe twice in my life), and if you value your sanity just let it go.  Her poor ENTJ husband has discovered this never-wrong trait, and has adopted a "sure honey" stance.
24	Sounds about right. My INTJ father got all pissed off in front of his computer. I went to see him, "Hey dad, what's wrong?". He said "It keeps saying wrong password. This website is bullshit." I said, "That's because your capslock is on" He said, "Shut up cunt, go back to your room." I said, "Ok, papa." So here I am, on Reddit...
7	I’m an ENFP that used to date an INTJ and this is a pretty good description of what our dynamic was in arguments. I became the flighty ‘irrational one’ and he became the objective ‘rational’ one. It was impossible for him to validate / understand me unless it fit his world view. 
6	Oh yeah? Try arguing with an ESFP. They're fucking vicious.
17	>weeknesses \n\nYou're wrong because it's spelled weaknesses.
4	Yep, fuck I hate that kind of processing and argument presentation from assholes, the volume at which I find people use that kind of logic is depressing.
3	Have you tried to tell your logic and not pressuring them having  to admit they are wrong? I noticed that very often when i had a discussion with the intjs in my life they have problems admitting straight away they were wrong. i would  just tell them what i think and then i would  not pressure them to admit they are wrong but instead let them process the data i have given them. After a while i noticed that they changed their opinion on that matter. \nYou see introverted functions  are way more stubborn than the extroverted ones. They need time to adjust their ni information Network to the new ne perspective. 😊\nJust be a bit patient with  your intj friends. 
4	It's me, INFJ. I have an ENTJ MIL and and INTJ FIL. They worked themselves up yelling at each other about the proper way to apply ointment to my son's skin, while I was in the room, when I was in fact the only one who had the specific instructions. I had to raise my voice to get them to shut up yelling just to disabuse them of their erroneous notions lol.\n\nI'll definitely pay on the "you're wrong, sorry I can't tell you why lol" Ni dominating thing. guiltttttyyy. I can't speak for INTJ, but I'd put it down to myself being a dumb, dumb, dumbass and just incapable of explaining anything in a nice clear cut manner, but hell I'm trying.\n\nWhen Nis are saying "coming at it from multiple different angles" it's true but not in the Ne fashion. \n\nNe is your dominant, so let me not be so presumptions to tell you, your own self, how you think, but if I'm off base, okay. I'm wrong then.\n\nNe brainstorms multiple ideas out from one idea. Ni collates multiple ideas into one single idea.\n\nSo the Ni is going to be very had to budge once they've made up their mind, because they really have spent a lot of time turning the thing over in their mind and have come to their conclusion having has multiple sources of "evidence". I'll put that in sarcasm quotes because there are probably plenty of Ni doms, me included who are just making their judgements based on faulty reasoning, superstition and let's be honest, seeing patterns where there are none. Prophetic assertions eeeeeeeee\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeculation time: I don't know if shutting you down because "you're a bully" versus maybe mental exhaustion because NiTe is just really bad at explaining to a NeTi in a way that makes sense, and having to double and triple check themselves is probably wearing. Especially for the introvert, after all that conversation, their energy reserves are probably so drained they just want to lie down and die rather than have to Te one more time.\n\nAlternatively, if the INTJs are all male and you're a thinking dominant female...  👀 ^(jam my tact into high gear I'm saying nothing else.)
3	This is so accurate it's hilarious. Two of my close friends are INTJs, and this is exactly what I go through with them
3	wow i NEEDED this post.\nyou articulated my exact thoughts on “debating” with INTJs.\n\nmy best friend is an INTJ, and whenever a topic is brought up and she says something that’s just... not... logical.. I can’t resist. I have to inform her why her reasoning makes no sense.\nShe of coursssseeee takes it as an attack and immediately resorts to bringing up side points that have nothing to do with the actual matter.\n\nCue the whole “YOU DONT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE *insert irrelevant point here*” and i’m just like ??? wtf? i gave you a perfectly sound reason and you give some half assed point back that doesn’t address the fact that your spewing nonsense?\n\nit drives me crazy... i get so pissed and honestly feel like exiting the vicinity just to cool off. \nit’s highly annoying because I feel it’s a common trait for INTJs to assume that having an illogical opinion (which they have, but never admit) transcends them. Like ~oh, can’t be me, has to be you then!~\nti: “why”\n“because i disagree and you just don’t know what it’s like”\n\nblah blah stupid back forth that goes nowhere, ending in the INTJ sitting there offended and resorting to their “Whatever. There’s just no way for you to understand”\n\njust WTFffffffffdfHAGFASVECAYYZ DWJBWVS A SHIT just fuck you. fuck you. genuine rage quit.\n\n\nanyway. \nthanks for writing this post. Makes me feel like i’m not alone. Sorta feels good that someone else has this experience\n\nmakes me wonder who ENTPs would really be suited for. i’m beginning to notice a trend in Ni-doms and the “my vision. the only correct vision. i’m so prophetic and absolutely no one can match my intuitive abilities so i will discredit all instances where others have expressed Literally The Same Quality”\n\n\nwhew feels good to unload all that lmao\ni’m sure i repeated myself like 82 times but whatever 
3	Sat here looking at my INTJ husband & he has no idea why I'm laughing at him.

1	ENTP and ISFJ comparisons. The most lighthearted types. ENTPs the most childlike type according to this INFP	
2	This guy once said if ENTP's stare at a pencil tip and focus on it for to long (like a minute or two) it will physically hurt them.\n\nI haven't been able to talk his videos seriously since then.
1	are you actually expecting an ENTP to watch a 13 min video? lmao
4	Mental Challenges and Detective/Mystery movies.	Hi fellow ENTPs,\n\n(What you are going to read, has no purpose and about nothing, I just wanted to share my feelings suddenly for no reason. I have nothing better to do right now)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmong all the things that make me happy, mental challenges are the best. I remember myself watching and searching for more and more detective, mystery-themed TV shows, cartoons, movies since my childhood. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI met with Sherlock Holmes like when I was 4 or 5 and immediately got in love with his methods and asked from my parents for more. I have been applying his methods in my life again since childhood. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I got around 15-18, my perception skills were extraordinary (I assume most of you were like that in that ages). Almost all of the inferences I came up with especially about people were perfectly correct. I had big and not so nice arguments about certain people with my family. I told them not to trust them where they did not agree with me but the truth was revealed later but they kept not trusting my skills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I am somehow in a condition of revealing the truth, I focus to it like hell. I can’t imagine what would be my life if I were a detective. I believe I would not sleep for weeks until I solve the case. This is the only time I can keep myself focused until the very end. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur approaching methods for any mystery-related topics is indeed unique. How admirable that we read the situation and people so quickly and so accurate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes it gets so absurdly incredibly that I solve the mystery of detective movies just from the beginning. I solved “Murder in the Nile” just in 10 minutes perfectly.(defining every single act step by step)  I couldn’t believe that solution could be found that easy (which is not for a non XNTP) I did not believe myself and still tried to figure out something else until the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe weird thing is; I do this for a very long time, so long that now I even don’t think very much on clues and don’t pay very much of attention to details but I “feel” the truth it when I come up with the correct solution. I think my brain does the thinking and correlating work in the background automatically. If there are multiple clues somehow I always pick the correct one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSolving the mystery is the easiest part, the trouble is to make people believe you about your statement :D \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. **(Spoiler Alert)** What do you think about True Detective Season 3? (Asking to those who watched all episodes?)\n\nI haven't watched the 3rd episode but I mostly focused on the wife of the detective after episode 2. Could it be her that caused detective got shocked after learning the truth? (Sorry if this was somehow revealed in episode 3. Maybe I should speak after watching episode 3.
3	Fellow murder mystery enthusiast, thou can't say it hone any skills apart from quick reading.\n\nMurder on the Nile is the easy one, kind of like Orient Express. How did you fare with other Christie's books? \n\nHow do you fare on other books, from my perspective it's the biggest insult to the book when I'm not even interested in the ending. I've gone halfway through so many books that I just cast aside halfway because it goes into pointless drama and boring character interactions that are supposed to give weight to the problem. I much prefer the golden age of crime novels then most of what is published nowadays.
2	I am an ENTP too and am interested in that particular genre too, can you suggest some shows or books you read? I'm done with Sherlock Holmes
6	What are your faults?	Do you knew about them all by yourself or someone told you and then you saw it?\n\nIf not ENTP please state type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I know I can get arrogant - hell, i'm arrogant but trying not to come off this way. I've had also people tell me about it when I asked them about what they think my fault is. Trying to keep this under control. I don't know really how to change that mindset but trying not to show myself from this side.\n\nAlso,I do push people's boundaries a lot. Again, don't really how to stop myself, it's like pushing till I get emotional reaction from them. \n\nThose are the two I can think of at this moment.
13	I can go too far to prove a point\n\n&#x200B;
11	I'm a smug bitch. Bad with practical details. A little flaky. What I sometimes see as the "helpful truth", others may be more inclined to view as "unasked-for criticism". I'm not overly in touch with my personal feelings. I have a hard time picking a path and sticking with it. I'm easily bored. I can sometimes want to rebel against "the man" to the point of actually screwing myself over. I don't like exercise. I have very poor self-discipline. Most of my hobbies are incredibly unproductive. I try to be empathetic, but at the end of the day, am actually a bit cold-hearted. I will not put my neck on the line for others and I don't feel bad about it. I'm clumsy as fuck. My taste in media declines each year. I'm also super bougie. I could go on.
8	I either don’t think about something or someone at all, or I overthink. I’m vicious in arguments (not debates, there is a very big difference) and I’ll crush you without even thinking about it, but I have been actively working on this and getting better about it. I take forever to cut toxic people out of my life and often times the longer I’m around them the more toxic I become. I’m really bad at saying sorry. I struggle to tell people that I care about how I feel about them. I can overwhelm a conversation and I think sometimes I speak over people when I shouldn’t. I procrastinate a lot and I’m honestly quite scared of failing even though I know it’s good for me. That’s some of the flaws I can think of off the top of my head. 
8	Yes, there is a fine line between self-conscious confidence and arrogance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm the godfather of procrastination as are most of us.
2	going way to far to prove my point or understand something.\n\nunable to cut toxic people out of my life because Ne says “what if” \n\nat times, very scared to succeed. \n\nqueen of indecision.   
1	INTJ (probably).\n\nI have a crippling unbalance on self-esteem that either makes me borderline arrogant or completely unmotivated.
1	Lack of empathy 
1	Criticizing others harshly but also isn't really a fault just something other dislike about me but I stand by it though. Cuz I base it on FACTS!\n\nDecline friends invites to attend other interests/hobbies, also not really IMO my fault!\n\nNot neat, messy AF\n\nOften late!\n\nVery forgetful!\n\nVery Rebel and argumentive against stupid rules IMO
1	No patience at all! I can’t wait that things change in my current situation (want a new job after 5 months)... and I get anxious and angry.\nIt’s horrible to be an ENTP sometimes...
1	I push boundaries... a lot. I also get obsessed with things/people and drop them in a hot minute as soon as I see something more shiny.
1	I am extremely arrogant. I contemplate suicide because of that
1	I want to hear more from people but can't seem to keep quiet. Learning how to better ask open questions probably will help.
8	Stream of consciousness cause I can’t sleep.	I was gonna put the educational flair but well... who the fuck am I kidding I’m not educational because holy hell I don’t even know what I’m trying to even articulate but the thing is I get an idea right and it’s a great idea, like, I get it in my mind, and HOLY FUCK I’m BRILLIANT right? Right? RIIIGHHT? \n\nLol jk it’s gone already so I’m left here sitting in the dark wondering what even happened. But I know what happened because I heard that unmistakable sound, ffffllllpppppfffhhtttffffpppptttthhhffff\n\n\nPllpplffflllttttffffttpppfftt\n\nMy brain just FARDED. \n\nIt’s no wonder I suck at making money ohmyfuck \n\nOh wait! Another idea, whoop I can start a business or some shit with this one I know it right? Yeah let’s do that focus thing that my ENTJ friend does like it’ll be easy right she makes it look easy so it must be easy right I mean come on it can’t be that fucking hard right I mean I never thought oh wait I forgot glass really does start to scratch at a level six because I swear my phone screen just got another goddamn scratch I hate my life oh and doesn’t sapphire have a hardness of like eight or something oh yeah isn’t that my enneagram type lol oh yeah it is I remember now because my ENTJ friend and I both got 8w7 or maybe it was 8w9 I forgot oh wait what the fuck was I even doing because now I’m watching some random shit about smartphones on YouTube and wondering about my fucking enneagram type omg what even is my life \n\nAnd did I just wait a minute nope o wait that wasn’t the point. \n\nFuck me. Not literally that’s not something I’d actually request over the fucking internet but metaphorically and in that existential crisis way? Yeah, FUCK ME. OMG.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I’m not actually smart like everyone says I am because holy shit I feel like a dumbass lol I can’t even with my life right now. \n\nSleep is a fuck but so is staying awake because well I forgot why staying awake is a fuck except it’s pointless because I have no current opportunities to actually OH NO NOT THAT SHIT AGAIN \n\n\nFOCUS. HOLY SHIT BRAIN WTF. \n\nLol if I could customize the location thing I would put it as something like “Existential Crisis Involving Existential Crisisville” \n\nBecause I have no fucking idea what I’m doing and it sucks but you know, life’s a ride so it’s okay I guess?\n\nBut sometimes I kind of want a hug. Not the stupid cheesy lame you see that dumb shit in movies kind, but like, a non emotional non complicated kind if such a thing ever existed or does exist. Sometimes. Not all the time or even most of the time. But, sometimes...

54	ENTPs: The end game lesson regarding MBTI	Hey party, it's been a terribly long time, someone reached out with questions regarding a previous discussion and I figured it was time to elaborate on what I think is the next step for ENTPs in the world of MBTI and to draw some perspective on those who are just now discovering 'my people.' \n\nI myself was obsessed with MBTI and learning who I was as an ENTP. That's great! It helps create that sense of a reference point and identity that we naturally struggle to understand despite our sometimes accurate ability to read others.\n\nIt's our internal desire as ENTP's to obsess in our en-devour to understand aspects of the world. Like INTP's we want to internalize vectors and break them down to build new structures for observing how reality works. For ENTPs, this also means we turn back around to externalize and try to apply and grow our vectors the world around is as a sandbox. This leads to stereotyping, making mistakes and returning to the drawing board. Then we return and make new mistakes all over again.\n\nBy doing this, we can not only alienate and confuse others, but also confuse ourselves. Remember, MBTI is only a theory, so apply it as such and your relationships with others will become a little less 'sociopathic.'\n\n**Here is the advice:** When learning how other people learn and communicate. Resist the urge to type them or apply a binary stereotype.\n\nListen and learn how they communicate, how they feel and their mode of action. Work with them based on just the primary function you observe, be it Introverted Feeling, Extroverted Thinking etc. Don't worry about how Fi interacts with Te or how that girls quiet collective Si interacted with your Ne.\n\nListen to them, feel with them, work with them and don't try so hard. Patience is key.\n\nAlso, self control. Avoid taking the lead and initiative until they are used to YOU.\n\nBuild that relationship first and that interpersonal dynamic and understanding will build naturally.
13	Resist the urge..... that sounds like a rule. how about, I'll decide what i think, and act accordingly towards the best outcome for me *^(And Everyone I Like.)* No Rules!!! Only improvement and less work!
1	> Build that relationship first and that interpersonal dynamic and understanding will build **naturally**.\n\nHow can you be sure of this? I understand the restriction on applying stereotype part since it won't encapsulate the whole personality, but how would the understanding be formed?\n\nand also... you said\n\n> Resist the urge to type them or apply a binary stereotype.\n\nbut then you said\n\n>  Work with them based on just the primary function you observe\n\nby knowing the people you observe use such function from observation, isn't that a contradiction, since you still basically put them in boxes of functions?
1	Basically develop Si? \n\nThanks genius dad (i actually agree with what you've written but it's condescending AF
1	>Remember, MBTI is only a theory\n\nI LIKE MBTI (as an USEFUL tool) think it's pretty spot on (or me at least) not that wrong, besides a few things\n\nI guess some people think MBTI gotta be perfect, Nah. It ain't gonna be perfect 100%.\n\nRemember, it's only 16 types not 64 or 128\n\nWith 16, it can only narrow down EACH individual so well until it becomes not as accurate.
1	Lmao, used to YOU ! 
8	Validity of the Literary Canon	Should high school students' reading lists come from the traditional canon?\n\nI used to fall firmly on the side of the canon. After all, cultural literacy is an important part of any education. In order to understand the culture, you also have to understand the literature that informed it. Knowing classic literature also gives you a path into the higher tiers of society (again, cultural literacy).\n\nBut then some professors and classmates started to change my mind. They reasoned that the goal of education was simply to educate. When you teach reading, you should teach kids how to read, not what to read. Any engaging reading material should be sufficient for teaching literature as long as you can teach reading, writing, and analysis through it.\n\nI thought about this a lot when I was in training to become an English teacher. But since I left that program to become an editor instead, I haven't thought about it much. Where do you stand?
10	If you can pick *any* reading material why not pick something from the canon anyway and teach cultural literacy as well?
8	I think it's very important to show students to canon literature as well as artefacts of culture in general. Without knowing where themes come from, their origin and influence on one another that comes from being exposed to those texts of culture, it's nearly impossible to be adept at analysis when you engage in culture. Even mass culture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example, my first BA was in system where people could elect which part of art history the wanted to learn. That was a horrible system because you'd be left with enormous holes in your knowledge without being aware of it and you wouldn't be able to fall back onto references to existing cultural text in your creation. These themes or structures are big part of creative work, and not engaging with them is a choice. Even if that choice is made for you by education.\n\nSo yeah it was following the same rule *'When you teach reading, you should teach kids how to read, not what to read.'* but in arts. What was the outcome, the students shows at the end of the year were basically 90% paths someone already done 50 years ago. Not in terms engaging with the idea that already exists in art as a conversation, just being unaware that such artefacts of culture and approaches exist. Creating another Pollock Jackson like painting because students figured out 'by themselves' that they can move, splatter paint and it has performative aspect , makes for interesting experience for that student but from outsider perspective it's 'inventing the wheel because one didn't know the wheel exists'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince we all partake in creating culture, either as creators or consumers, it is important to expose students to texts and art that will allow them as wide as possible range of participation and understanding. Especially ones that are less appealing because of being dated, hard or boring. They can still chose not fall back on that knowledge later  **by themselves** or have their own opinion on them, but not allowing for that exposition you basically strip them of the choice and equal role of an educator to being a good text-editor with grammar check.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI.e. one of books we had to read while in school was Antigone. Greek tragedies aren't the most riveting read. Yet, without knowing the common theme of unescapable fate that many of them are based upon, you're basically less able to interpret the topic of fate in later works of literature. You can of course Wikipedia it, but being exposed to text that shows fate as unescapable is much more on point then reading a line on a website. How can you explain the innovation of Shakespeare and the likes when there is no springboard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also hope it would stop people that are shallowly versed in cultural texts being hailed as new savvy philosophers. It's a pain that there is such a strong divide between people educated to engage with culture on analysis level and majority who are delegate to be passive consumers because they lack education and exposure.
5	From a slightly different angle, scientific literacy is important too. As far as choosing which works to read, I think it would be helpful to introduce students to scientific literature (even if it's at the sciencetoday level). Train them to handle reading something replete with jargon, and to parse through fluff. \n\nGiven the tech of today it might also be helpful to help students to identify memes or literary tricks (scientist find new disease, you won't believe which!) 
3	> Knowing classic literature also gives you a path into the higher tiers of society \n\nI couldn’t even hope to count the number of references I’ve seen to “classical” literature and music in the lower tiers of society — popular music, video games, non-art film, cartoons, tv commercials, etc.\n\nSome things are so familiar they’re just cultural bedrock, and the “educated man” should at least understand those. \n\n
3	I very much agree with the importance of learning how to read over the content of what you’re reading. That being said though, and I think it echoes some of the sentiments I’ve read, modern culture is littered with references to the “great books.” \n\nIt’s strange that we continue referring back to these dusty old books even though society has changed significantly on many topics (or not depending on your viewpoint). That point aside, I feel that I’m actually severely lacking in works of today because of such a focus on literary canon.\n\nI don’t know many fiction writing authors, I think I can name John Green off the top of my head, but that’s it for the most part. However, I can go on and on about the past and the great books. \n\nI think it’s the same reason we as a society still look to the Enlightenment, the Renaissance, the Romans, and the Greeks for philosophical inspiration. These were times of “great human advances” and cultural developments (for the Western world) that remind of us more enlightened times.
1	I don’t care, I’ve found some shit I’ve really liked 451, catcher, and flies. Had a great teacher who was really passionate about sci fi. Great times
2	What differences do you personally see when speaking to an INTP?	Although the two types are similar, what differences do you personally notice when speaking to an INTP? Are there any differences at all?
13	They use their past experiences way more than I do to validate opinions and observations about themselves, others, and things going on around them. Although I always take Si into account by default, it’s also important to realize things are constantly changing- sometimes I don’t know if INTPs take that into account until later on. \n\nINTPs seem way more self-destructive on a personal scale than ENTPs, while ENTPs seem more destructive on a social scale. They will push themselves too far and regret the hell out of it afterward and ENTPs seem to push others too far and then regret everything afterward. If I think something is truly dangerous for my physical wellbeing I won’t do it because logically it doesn’t make sense to fuck myself up and risk losing future possibilities. INTPs just don’t seem to care, haha...until afterward. However, even when I do fuck up I don’t particularly obsess over what I could have done or regrets I have, I just adapt(unless what I did screwed someone else over). INTPs seem to obsess over their failures to the point of mental debilitation. I do this sometimes too but mine come in waves and happen every few months.
5	INTPs are more similar to ESTPs and ENTPs are more similar to ENFPs. Talking to INTPs can feel like talking to ISxJs; extremely nitpicky. Talking to ENxPs feel more disorganized because of how scatterbrained they are
3	They tend to lack basic hygiene. Bad breath is a big clue, take note.
1	\nFrom my observation,\nLots of intp's will either avoid eye contact at all cost or will focus it in a really awkward way ,like trying to proove they are making eye contact .they look hella subconscious.\nEntp eyes are confident and they appear socially brilliant .\n
1	I have an INTP friend & I love the guy, but he is negative to the point of hilarity. I think we are more positive, personally.
1	I am far more likely to speak up in a social situation even if it is uncomfortable, while an INTP might prefer to keep their thoughts to themselves. 
5	How do ENTPs deal with office relationships?	I haven't dated anyone or wanted a relationship for the  last 6 years after a bad breakup, but now I like a colleague. \n\nI am 24 and getting to the point of not giving a fuck what others think... but I am still aware of the potential consequences for this confession of feels. We talk together every now and then and always have fun conversations (she is definitely an Ne type).\n\nDo any of you guys shit where you eat? Do you also go out with people you work with? How did this affect your personal and professional life?
8	I'm going thru it right now. Asked a girl out at work and she said no. Just dont be awkward about it and if it doesnt go your way dont be a dick about it and dont hound her. You should be fine. 
8	I went kind of backwards with it - There was a girl I liked; we got along great, had amazing conversations and I genuinely enjoyed being around her. I encouraged her to get a job in the office I worked in.  Lo and behold, a few months later I find myself single, and we ended up dating.  I was honestly convinced that I had found the person I wanted to marry.  \n\nIt wound up being a shitty relationship with a lot of fights, weeks at a time of not speaking to each other, and it was absolute hell for almost two years until I quit the job.  \n\nMoral of the story - you never know what you're going to get out of a relationship until you're past the point of no return.  There's no such thing as "what you see is what you get".
5	Hi 24 year old me. Don't shit where you eat.
5	listen to your username on this one
2	just send it m8
1	Depends entirely if you like a sprinkling of shit on your cake or not.
1	Roll the dice, lifes for the living. You cant eat after you're dead, and you can't be in awkaward romantic situautions either. You obviously think about her a lot. Just do it. 
1	I'm gonna keep it simple: I like both my job & money and I don't struggle finding girls outside therefore NO I DO NOT shit where I eat.\n\nOutside I have more freedom to do any shit I want with no impact on my job nor salary.
1	My favorite adapted saying. Don't dip your pen in the company ink... (my addition) Unless you are ready to sign. \n\nSign what you ask? Could range from a)resignation letter if it goes horribly wrong or b) marriage certificate if it goes well. Even if it goes well but you freak and can't do b) then guess what you'll be opening the door to a). And since you are are younger I would think b) isn't going to be happening. So logically as someone else suggested read your user name. \n\nI am older and have been there and done that. In hindsight I came up with that so you can guess how it went. \n\nThe only caveat is if you don't care about the job. Then go for it sometimes jumping in to the deep end is fun just to see if you can swim. \n
0	Well not the expert but if it will not work you can still not give a fuck and live your live till you will  eventually die and actually anything does Mather so yeah go for it. You can make some memories (they don’t matter too but you at least think they do). And after writing this I want to delete hole comment because it’s really bad but then I would feel that i waisted 3 minutes of my life (my life don’t matter) but still I would feel it does.\nLesson? Feelings make you unable to see how nothing you are worth.\nPs if you want to don’t give a fuck with her then just do it if not then don’t consequence doesn’t matter because if you want to be with her that probably means that she will normally move on after a break up and if no you can just talk to her. \nPs I hate my comment already don’t judge my skills of understanding this topic (I literally don’t have any) and i  we all will die so try to life \nPeace out
3	Ever feel like you're turning into another type?	I've grown a lot since discovering mbti. For a long time I fit pretty neatly in this box, to the point of feeling redundant and understimulated talking to other ENTP's. Lately, though, I've been looking at myself and seeing something closer to an INFJ. I don't know if it's just a slumpy phase or if it's supposed to be possible to change types, or if this discredits the theory, or if I was always INFJ. For what it's worth I go immediately back to the old self if I'm drunk or otherwise really feeling myself, but I wonder if that's just a remnant of the old self that's being transitioned out.\n\nThen again... I remember when I spent a lot of time in typing communities that the entp was one of the most likely types to entertain the notion that they were a different type, through force of Ne and lack of Fi I suppose. I remember you could root out the fact that they were an ENTP by seeing that they'd advocate for the type you suggested that they weren't, and their account of themselves would change to accommodate that type. Other types would generally want to commit to their first choice and run with it.\n\nWhat's y'all's experience
3	Sometimes I like to try to imagine how it would be to be another type for a few minutes. Kinda like clearing a headspace and trying to just feel the difference between mine and let's say an enfp or an infp. \n\nThere are some parts of me that I think act like other types naturally too. Like when I need a project done and I'm up against a wall I'll go into more of an estj mode to get it done. I think it helps to be flexible with who you present yourself to be while still maintaining who you are genuinely. 
2	In group social situations I sometimes feel an ESFJ or ESTP-like persona coming out.
2	I become more like an INFP or INTP when I'm nervous.  I dislike this about myself.
2	I become more Fi dominant whenever I hear the name 'Trump'
2	Oh yeah. When I’m very uncomfortable in a situation, I look like an intj-cold, aloof etc. When I drink I resemble an estp, when I am stressed or have another negative emotion I feel like an introverted feeler
1	I feel like I've tried to develop each of my functions better as I've gotten older. I was pretty much all Ne as a kid/teenager; really leaned into Ti throughout post-secondary; and have tried to up my Fe in a big way for my career. This makes me feel like an ENFP sometimes, although I'm still quite convinced of my general ENTP-ness insofar as I really do view Fe as a tool. Throughout my post-secondary, I did sometimes feel more like an INTP, which is consistent with leaning into my Ti. As I move forward, I foresee myself focusing more and more on Si. We'll see where it leads. Sometimes I do feel like an INTJ as well, but it never lasts very long - usually only when I'm concentrating hard on something.
1	Im an entp and my partner is an infj. My shadow Ni is starting to resemble hers and her shadow Ne is starting to resemble mine. So makes sense.
1	Is there really that much distinction between types? Or could it just be a small change of mood or other factors. I think this begs the question, what factors make us behave the way we do and how do those factors relate to MBTI.\n\nThen you can see if it is even feasible and even hypothesise why you changed your behaviour
7	Judgement clouded by emotional arguments	Why is that everytime I try to argue with somebody I can get affected by their side of the story and  empathize with them more than I can hold my ground and believe my side fully, without getting my judgement clouded by their counter argument? How do I fix being emotionally manipulated by arguments that hold no ground whatsoever? How do I become more detached in social interactions? I can argue online way better because I can analyze what the other person is doing - the text is in front of me and theres no immediate pressure for me to answer and I can argue logically without empathy getting in the way. I guess that the person I am arguing against is also a variable but I'd like to have an on/off button that I can press whenever I want to.
4	I'll agree to some extent with the views already presented, insofar as your inclination toward feeling over thinking when in the heat of an argument seems to indicate that you *use* feeling over thinking. That being said, I disagree that that thinking and feeling are such a neat dichotomy. I probably end up recommending Daniel Kahneman's [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/books/review/thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman-book-review.html) about once per week on Reddit, but it's a great foray into more intuitive, gut-instinct-based cognitive processing (described in the book as "System 1") and traditional "rational deliberation" ("System 2"). One of the key takeaways is that, contrary to being opposite to rational deliberation, intuition/gut-based cognition is actually very important to decision-making. I'll quote:\n\n>More generally, System 1 uses association and metaphor to produce a quick and dirty draft of reality, which System 2 draws on to arrive at explicit beliefs and reasoned choices. System 1 proposes, System 2 disposes. So System 2 would seem to be the boss, right? In principle, yes. But System 2, in addition to being more deliberate and rational, is also lazy. And it tires easily. (The vogue term for this is “ego depletion.”) Too often, instead of slowing things down and analyzing them, System 2 is content to accept the easy but unreliable story about the world that System 1 feeds to it. “Although System 2 believes itself to be where the action is,” Kahneman writes, “the automatic System 1 is the hero of this book.” \n\nFor me, and for Kahneman, empathy is generally part of System 1 insofar as it is instinctive rather than deliberate. However, that doesn't mean that it is necessarily wrong. In my view, empathy is important because it provides clues into what the correct answer might be. It is certainly not the only bases upon which to form a decision (which sounds like what you might be worried about). However, I disagree that it "gets in the way" of you assessing a conflict and coming to the "correct" conclusion. It is a useful tool.\n\nUltimately, I think you need to give yourself more time to process whatever information is being presented to you. You don't always need to respond right away in an argument. Moreover, empathy can be helpful in an argument to understand the other person's viewpoint better. They may not always be trying to manipulate you, but if you wish to persuade them, it is better to be able to figure out what their motivations are and why they think the way they do. \n\nFor me personally, I'm rarely emotional during arguments unless: (a) I just get frustrated with the other person not "getting it" (or refusing to listen), which may be different problem from empathy, or (b) the points presented are actually very personal and strike some nerve for some reason. The latter is actually a very good sign that I need to slow down my breathing and just take a moment to really try to understand why the other person came to the conclusion they did. I don't automatically assume their argument has no ground whatsoever, but that there may have been a miscommunication or an unspoken premise or logical leap somewhere. Finally, I try to keep in mind that it's not always about winning the argument, but trying to close in a more refined version of the truth. It helps take the "ego" out of arguing for me. \n\n(Of course, sometimes, the other person *is* just an asshole who wants to fuck with you. In that case, you're better spending your time elsewhere.) 
3	You're too empathetic.  These things do happen.  I have had similar problems in the past, and generally have to really care about or believe something before I'll stand my ground in it.  If this is a topic about which you genuinely care, then argue slowly.  Our first instinct is to jump right in with a response, but if you take a deep breath, mentally step back for a moment to get grounded, and THEN present your opinion, you will have a better chance of keeping your stance.
5	This is essentially described by the F/T dichotomy. Feelers in general value emotions in lieu of objective arguments — I.e. they're a factor the logical decision making tree that one undergoes. The process that separates Thinkers from Feelers is the ability to strip arguments of these biases and ignore them. That's what gives T types their cold interpretation (by F types who think that matters in a rational discourse).\n\nTo a thinker, emotions have a time and a place. Rational deliberation is not that place, and arguments are not their time. So when an emotion contaminates a rational argument (insofar as the thinker is considered), they'll either ignore it and plow forward, or simply shut down and disengage. There's really no middle ground there — thinkers abhor the notion that they'll "agree to disagree". \n\nI bring this up because your post suggests a feeler style of cognition on your hand, and you're essentially asking "how do I become a thinker?"\n\nI find the part of your comment about being able to reject empathy more via text fascinating. I've held the view for a while that Feelers types can *look* like thinking types, especially through text. Your description is a good description of this — the emotions don't get in the way, so you can synthetically do what thinkers do and strip arguments of that bias. I.e. it's easier to do online because the Feeling-oriented variables are suppressed. \n\nIn short, you really won't be able to emulate it in person without radically overhauling your style of cognition. Some suggest it's doable, but I'm not so sure it is. 
3	Emotions have a TIME and place for us Thinkers.\n\nWe DON'T get emotional just about anything small or medium(like a lot of Feelers do. They freak out about every little crap don't even matter). We only on these things that are really BIG and IMPORTANT... And it makes NO sense and very unfair about it, our way of logic got a PROBLEM with it, in order to invoke it.\n\nLike I often denounce Trump to the point of crazy, that isn't just pure emotionality, but based on FACTS, EVIDENCES of clear experiences that led to it.\n\nLike Trump is for a FACT someone who mocked/insulted Blacks, Immigrants, Women, Disabled, so those are indisputable facts I use to denounce him. It doesn't come from pure emotion that based on nothing concrete.\n\nIt's all FACT and TRUTH based... so\n\nKnow what I am saying?
86	Most posts on r/entp have more comments than upvotes	It’s the most argumentative and unsupportive place in all of reddit. I’m so proud of you all.\n\nIt’s quite interesting. Compare for example to the INFP sub
19	How dare you tell me what to do,
33	I never really bother to upvote or downvote.
10	Commenting is natural in conversation, up voting is artificial. 
11	We support only when we fully agree maybe?  Or maybe we are just too busy arguing to remember to support?  Or maybe we don't support because feelings are really not always our forte?  Thank God.  Mushy feelings crap bugs me.
5	I prefer to participate via comment that via upvote. \n\nDoes writing out my support of someone's idea make me less supportive than simply clicking the upvote button?\n\nIn the same way, isn't it better to write out a reasoned argument than simply to click the downvote button?\n\nI'd argue that our comment-to-upvote ratio doesn't prove that we're unsupportive, but that we're engaged.
3	Do people here also tend to have their comments downvoted a lot? In real life and on Reddit, I tend to argue on the less-represented side, playing devil's advocate, and that could potentially earn a lot of downvotes.
5	Did I upvote? Maybe\n\nNo harm in giving a little love. Famous last words
2	Oh yeah? Ever been to ISTP/ENTJ forums? 
2	Yea I can relate to that, I very rarely up vote unless it is for a very good cause that may be of some use to the world, mainly I just reply but my Karma isn't too good so sometimes I just type a reply than remember I have to wait 10 minutes but then just say "stuff it" and destroy the message draft and go find another thread.
1	Yeah. well, we don't see simple. Who likes simple, right? Ew Debate me, biachhh\n
1	And then u see post who ar not trying to say anything bad, or mean or stupid  and get downvoted without even an explanation as to why.
1	why are you like that?
1	The post being worthy of my comment accounts for more than clicking on a little arrow.   :*
1	Way to collect karma
1	Thought it was a decent place for conversation, dont need praise just intellectual input....or a fight
1	If I just wanted to upvote I'd waste my time on shitty youtube channel begging for money on pateon and attention whores' instagram profiles.\n\nI got a god damn keyboard that allow me to write then I do it!
1	I find myself commenting much more than to upvote or like in almost all social media platforms. I only upvote or like when I really like the ideas but cant think of anything to say. \n\n
16	Dealing With The Work Place As An ENTP. I Know You Can Relate.	I have some extreme trouble sitting down and getting work done on my own as of the last year. This is especially true when I obsess over rules and how i don't want to follow the norm of the ***"White Picket Fence and Then You Die"*** Method.\n\nI've definitely gotten the short end of the stick in a lot of ways. I was very Talented in skilled trade work, but was fired multiple times for standing up for others and doing things my own way. Including fighting Racism in the workplace. I used to follow the rules for the greater good. I used to influence rule makers to remember *the individual.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I went into sales and said to myself, \n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Why should I work my way up when people are making tons just sitting at a desk?" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I wrote a speech that took control of an interview for a very High-Paying sales-Position. Had them almost crying and they hired me on the spot with a handshake. Boom. ***I was in.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe average pay was 50k-150k. I had been living on less than 20k a year. It was a genius move.  *\[Highschool dropout with 140-IQ For The Win\]*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut here comes the Problem: **Superficial Crap Rules.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Contract:**\n\nI was self employed. I could work from home or the office. I could use their free-leads, or use my own. Their lead system Software was $100 a month.  Office space was $100 a month after training if I wanted to rent space. I set my own hours, and my only requirement was to make one sell every 2 months. I must pay for my own Business licensing And fees,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Performance:**\n\nSold more than Anyone in my position. I was a champ straight out the gates. I made sure my customers got exactly what they were looking for, or refereed them to someone who could help them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What These Bastards Did:**\n\nThey started asking all sales team members to attend a daily meeting online. Then in person. Then you had to make a certain number of calls on their system every day in the office.  A complete waste of time for a salesman. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***keep in mind***\- *No hourly Pay/Training Complete/Busiest Time Of Day/No W-2*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen they started cutting off the free leads that cost $100 a month as punishment. They were Forcing self employed sales people to sit through scoldings about coming into an **optional** office and using **optional** leads. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen People who disobeyed got the worst leads in the system as punishment. I quit participating *~~obviously~~*~~,~~ And I made more money from my own connections. \n\nThey cut off all my leads**. No problem,** \n\nthey gave me the worst leads to punish me. **Nada Una Problemo Amigo**. \n\nDid it to several of us. **Less Competition/Irrelevant**\n\nBurning deep from within their souls with a fiery rage of jealousy against me.------**GiveMeMoney/ThatFeelsGreat**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I pull in a big contract worth **a couple grand**. It was unheard of in this office for someone in my position. It opened a door to a circle of very rich professionals with massive returns. Paperwork was finalized, Contracts were agreed upon. More leads were coming in. Then in my most successful week I get a notice from the office manager saying he went ahead and turned in my resignation. \n\n**ON THE DAY I WAS GOING TO GET PAID.**  That also means he and an associate got my sale appointed to them by default. I had a couple hundred bucks to my name\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\[Insert ***Homelessness*** Here \]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that's how a multi-millionaire Swindled me out of a couple grand because of feelings and made-up rules *that go against what the actual company says.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The world is full of Crybaby bastards. Get Money. Show no remorse.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been unable to focus on making money ever since. It just really **erks my gerkin**, \n\nif you know what I mean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo Now, I Struggle to motivate myself. I work online/self-employed. No family. sleeping on couches for a year, Bought a motorcycle to survive which was stolen less than two months after purchase. Can I Get Some Strong Advice? I just hate being a part of a system. I hate routine. I hate rules. My way is better and smarter 99% of the time. I'm sure your plans are too. That's why I want  to know your plans. Cause right now, I'm a 1 percenter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you deal with it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Performed Successfully as an independent sales agent. Got "Resignation" Because Bastards make up fake rules as they go. My Erkin Is Gerked Now. Seeking Advice From Fellow Learned Travelers Of "The World of Bastards" and how to skew the numbers on these Paper-stacks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**You understand Me?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
10	Yeah you were a genuine star at that place, but it sounds like someone rocking Si and Te got into management, and decided to make "improvements".\n\nI did have similiar issues working at one of the bigger market researchers in Sweden, they were very rigid about keeping to script and doing everything in it's supposed order, I saw ways to imrpove the workflow by changing tasks around and/or combining them, caught a shitton of flak for refusing to follow routine.\n\nI asked them what the difference in end result was, my production and my colleagues were the same when it reached the bottom line, I just reached it in roughly half the time. After I had them admit to that they had no ground to stand on regarding wanting me to return to script, my way of doing things became the norm instead, Except they once again bastardized it, missing the point of the new system which again led to me having to make changes and on the rollercoaster went.\n\nMy take from it is stay well and truly away from larger companies, anything employing more than say 10-20 people i'm not touching with a 100 meter pole. Small firms will be tight-knit and personal, big companies you're nothing more than a cog in the wheel, and that cog is supposed to turn like it always does, not try and find ways to turn faster or better.
8	Sounds like you were in the wrong company. Most companies I've dealt with would love to have a salesperson like you. If the salespeople are making money, so is the company. Sounds like you might have a legit complaint with the labor board in your state too.
5	This is a lot of attitude for a 50-150k 1099 rep in software lmao
9	i don't have any advice but this was one of the better posts i've seen on r/entp
3	If stuff gets introduced that you don't like, make your opinion known early. Best way of protesting is finding the person responsible for the bullshit and publicly debating the BS in front of everyone. It doesn't matter who they are. Win the debate, humiliate the loser, reverse the BS. \n\nIf nothing happens and they haven't fired you yet find work elsewhere. \n\nIf you're hot shit, you'll be able to move in no time. 
3	Bite the bullet, and get a job.  Follow the rules in that job, and do your living in your off-time until you can find a new place or a new way of doing things.  Like you, I often see flaws in the system in my workplace, and could do things SO MUCH BETTER, but I do as I'm told because I *don't* want to sleep on a couch.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs smart as you are, my friend, your IQ will not teach you how to deal with people.  Society has rules and you have to understand the rules and the other people before you can understand the best time to break those rules.  Folks like you do not understand how deeply other people value their rules.  You get an ISTJ boss, and breaking his rules would be on par with shooting his dog even if those rules are stupid.  Bend before you break, and get a job that makes you want to cry for a while.  Save your money and keep working to understand the other opportunities that are available.  After 5yrs working in boredom, I now have the money to start real estate investing and have actually become a RE agent because I like being in charge of myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr: get a job to pay bills until you can figure out a more enjoyable money scheme.
3	**"White Picket Fence and Then You Die"** method scares me a lot. While I want the nice wife, Labrador, and kids - if I wake up at 38 and all I am is a pawn with routine I'll be inclined to jump out a window. If my title includes 'analyst', 'associate', 'corporate cock sucker' or 'director of useless dickwads' at 'Insignificant Piece of History, Inc' at 38 - window. I'm looking at these people in my building working for amazon corporate. They look so fulfilled like they accomplished all they could hope for.  \n\nThey have this steadfast, confident look in their eyes that says *'I have a coveted role at a prestigious company - I've made it'*. They're just pawns though! Mr director of *who gives a fuck* could go for the window and it won't change a damn thing. That's if it's the director, whose domain is narrower than his wife's 😺. If they're the programmer, sure they might be working with **AI** or **BIG data** or the next-gen jerk me off but they're literally such a cog in the system they're nobody. they can go for the window too and nothing will change. \n\nfuck the system, go build your own. don't be a piece on someone else's chessboard even if your the queen. Go make your own board. 
3	Not sure if this already got covered in the comments but it sounds like you were working for a scam company. They were definitely breaking labor/tax laws. If you are a 1099 employee, they cannot mandate that you do certain things at a certain time. 
5	Damn, just reading that made me extremely frustrated. I think this is why they keep recommending that we become our own bosses.

6	Self awareness problems in conversation	I often find myself in situations where I ask myself "is it too obvious?" when I'm flirting/talking or doing anything that requires me not being in my normal autopilot mode. I feel extremely self-concious during these thought processes and I can't focus on the task/conversation on hand. If I acknowledge that I am doing this I start being extremely self-aware, overthink everything to the extreme so I don't seem odd to the other party. I notice other peoples behaviours and how obviously they act like jerks and so on and I admire them not being so self-aware. It's getting in my way of becoming better. Can anybody relate to this  phenomena? Or better yet... know how to fix it?
6	What's the problem with being self-aware?\n\nI see this as one of my biggest strengths...
3	I used to have this issue when I was younger when I wasn't as confident. As I've grown older not only did my confidence increase, but my give a fuck decreased.... The confidence was key though. When I become self aware while speaking, as you described, I remind myself whoever is listening wants to listen or be a part of that conversation and if they don't like me and the way I present myself they can fuck off.\n\nAlso, toastmasters is a great tool for teaching yourself to power through that. It's a group you practice public speaking with. Really help build my confidence all around, because you self critique and are critiqued by the others constructively. 
2	Do you take silent victories when arguing with someone?	We've all argued with someone so hard headed, prideful or just straight up stupid that they wouldn't admit they were wrong. You definitely know a couple people who fit that description. Throughout most of my youth, I'd resort to calling people stupid or to get other people involved just so they can say that I won. The victories were important for me but after a while, it became exhausting and I stopped going the extra mile just to win an argument. Whenever I've explained my position to a reasonable extent and the other person still doesn't agree, I just take a silent victory and agree with whatever it was they were saying. I've learned that most people take it to heart when you tell them they're wrong so this is what I'm on now. 
2	*It's called wisdom...*\n\nProverbs 20:3
2	Eh, I don't take them as victories so much as I do a cost-benefit analysis in my head of whatever time I'm going to have to waste continuing the argument. If if it's not worth it, then I'm happy to walk away. 
2	I win if I know they'll be thinking of my points later when confronted with the same issue again, even if they don't end up siding with me after their thinking.\n
1	Just because they dont agree doesn't necessarily mean that I have won. Most of time I am more interested in learning something (I get excited when actually proven wrong), expanding all parties' POV, or the mental exercise. Those I consider personal victories. Agreeing to disagree is also a personal victory. If I am debating with a closed minded individual then I am probably arguing below my station. I try not to waste my breath on such people. If it's a situation where it is an arguement that cant be prevented, I am right and they cant see it then yes i take the silent victory. It's all situational, all the possibilities. \n\n\nEdit to add: Overall, I try to play nice with the dimwits. 
9	If you had to start a genocide and rid the world of one type, which one would it be?	Blah blah blah context, blah blah....blah context blah blah blah blah *cough* ENFPs *cough* context blah blah blah. 
40	ENTPs so I can finally die.
22	There's only two things I can't stand in this world. Those who are intolerant of other people's cultures... and the Dutch.
10	Hmmm... I start a genocide, but will I be able to finish it?
11	ENFPs are pretty entertaining and make the world brighter/more bearable.
23	Easy. INFJs. Literally useless emotion leaches with a superiority complex who suck the will to live or to ever be happy again out of you and everyone around them.....\n\n\n\n....😃
7	ESFJs. LIGHT UP THE OVENS!
12	I think getting rid of an sj type would have the biggest impact on society as a whole because there are so many of them - it would dramatically change society's composition, social norms and traditions would be weakened, it would be fascinating.\n\nLike as annoying as INFPs are, there are so few of them that getting rid of them would barely be noticeable... Can I split types and get rid of all the ESTJ males and the ESFJ females?  As they're the most common... 
5	Probably the SJs, but without them who will do all the mundane boring jobs? They are good obedient workhorses, can’t take that away from them. \n\nI think it would be better to introduce a social engineering program to control their population so that they become more accepting of intuitives & their ideas and steer them away from traditional and dogmatic societal and cultural practices. They are easily influenced anyways, so it shouldn’t be hard.
3	Defectors (in prisonner's dillema) = every non win-win personality type
5	Gd. This sub is so /r/iamverysmart
2	HEY that’s wrong👆*whispers between teeth*..all stjs...lol
2	The ones who are on the border of ENTP/INTP
2	Stupid people. 
2	Those that deny science, logic, and reason. \n\nYou can have religion, emotion, disagreements. But willful ignorance? Denying climate change? Archaic bullshit like genital mutilation and rape culture? \nEndangering others because of your dogmatic beliefs and prejudices? (Looking at the racists and anti-vaccination camp, this scenario is full of dogmatism harming people.) None of that would be allowed. \n\nBasically the opposite (edit: inverse) of the Dark Age just to see how that would turn out. A lot of people would die, but I’d call it the Bright Age.\n\nEdit: it seems I didn’t do a good job wording what I meant. Make no mistake: I do not think this would lead to some enlightened utopia, I’m merely curious what would happen if you took those Catholics and just sort of flipped em around. People often say we’d be so far ahead without the Dark Ages. So instead I want to see what would happen if you had a “Dark Ages,” but with different goals.
1	Would that mean that I, as a person who started genocide, would live through it? If so,I chose ENTPs. 
1	Easy, if I want to achieve the best score, look at the breakdown of each type and target the most numerous, hence ISFJ:   \n[https://www.careerplanner.com/Images/social/TypeInPopulation-500w.png](https://www.careerplanner.com/Images/social/TypeInPopulation-500w.png)\n\nKilling spree garanteed!
1	Literally any feeler who insists on being overly emotional when trying to solve a problem that should be solved with rationality. I don't care if this is how "It feels like". I get that every human has emotions. But there are times where you have to put your emotions aside and solve things logically.\n
0	Everyone who is not me because that'd make me God.
58	Literally....I have 47 tabs open	Hi.  My name is Stephen and I'm ENTP.  I literally have 47 tabs open on two Chrome windows.  If there was a way to look at the time they have been open it would be really bad.  I often find I just have to close the tabs cause I can't have more open whether I've completed what I need done on the tab or not. :(
23	Honestly... crosspost this to /r/entj and see what they think you should do
11	I just checked and I have 48. I'm on my phone tho 
9	When I search something on Google I open a new tab for every good looking website and watch them all. I have practised to close tab whenever I have done reading it.
18	Recently i reached 500 tabs on the safari app and i wear it like a badge of honour
5	Yep.  That's how we roll.
5	I used to have laptop with low specs, so I'm used to close the tab right after I feel like I don't need the content in the tab. The habit still continues even after I get better laptop.\n\nStill, I bookmark sites a lot though.
6	My phone stopped displaying no of tabs open on Chrome after it passed 100. Now it just shows :-) I've been meaning to clear off some tabs, but I keep delaying it. 
4	Rip RAM...
4	[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall?hl=es](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall?hl=es)
4	Get on my level, thanks https://imgur.com/a/cIiVPTf
3	https://imgur.com/8EpDi5m.jpg\n\nINTP checking in. This is just on my phone, and I clean it weekly. 
2	I had to buy an Ultrawide monitor because I'm a self proclaimed tab beast. 20 tabs is casual hour for me. 50 tabs keeps me spinnin
2	R O O K I E \n\n&nbsp;\n\nN U M B E R S
2	I use Evernote. I clip/save all the sites I might read/come back to later. This gives me the peace of mind to close tabs or, .... wait for it... whole windows at a time (GASP!
2	As INTJ I can relate, my 16 GBs of ram is used mainly by browser
2	psh i open a new window and automatically have another 10 tabs thanks to my pins in chrome.
2	This must be an intuitive thing. I'm an INFJ and my best friends and I, NFs and NTs, all do the same thing. It drives every sensor in my life nuts.
2	u/rvi857 can confirm I had 274 tabs open on 14 windows between Chrome and Firefox a few days back\n\nSomehow got it down to 7 tabs
1	The android version of chrome stops counting above 99 tabs and just shows a :D face instead.\n\nI doubt most people know this.
1	INTP and I have 93 open..
1	As a technically minded ENTP this sickens me, but I also get it. I sometimes get up to several windows with several tabs.\n\nWork related window with many tabs\n\nNon  work related window with a few tabs\n\nMisc I can’t make my mind up window with a lot of tabs.
1	77! 8 gb of ram on my one plus 5 I could probably have a  1,000
1	There's a new feature that most browsers have already implemented, maybe you haven't heard about it. It's called "bookmarks"
1	currently have 458 safari tabs open.... I'll get around to cleaning that up\n\n\n\neventually 
1	I feel like I'm the only ENTP in existence who always has 4-5 tabs open at maximum! Everything else just gets saved as a bookmark for me to revisit later (read: never). 
1	I have 53 and this is after a purge three days ago
1	Tabs Outliner is a dope chrome app  \nChanged my tab life
1	Holy crap. I keep myself at inbox zero and don’t ever have more than maybe four tabs at a time.\n\nThis would drive me bonkers.
1	So your telling me this isn't normal! 😦
1	This is why I have 64GB RAM. Six hundred chrome tabs across 5 split desktops for various purposes.
1	And how many unread emails do you have sir?\n
1	Use your introverted thinking now!!
1	47? I've had thousands open before. I don't remember the exact number but it was something almost 3,000 actively running at one time, on just one device. I didn't include any of my laptops or my phone in that. If I had more RAM, I'd have gone further. 
1	Install onetab, on average I have that open while constantly clearing with onetab, phone often gets to 100 tabs which chrome turns into a smiley face, probably a wink from other NTs at Google. 
1	6000 here
1	Lol, I have so many chrome tabs open on my phone that it's literally just a smiley face. Easily over 100+...\n\n\nYes I realize it's a problem
1	I have like 100 tabs opened with my 2 tablets, a cellphone, a notebook and a desktop computer, each installed with more than one browser. Instead of closing tabs I switch devices... 
4	Are you guys very touchy? Do you like/dislike being touched?	How do you guys feel about others touching you? Just wondering what all of you ENTPs have to say about it. I know INxJs aren’t usually fans of it so...
30	I don’t know about the others, but I’m like a cat. I want all the hugs and love sometimes, but other times I will hiss at you if you touch me.
10	I am touchy around a person I like. Like...super touchy. \n\nHowever, I’m not a big fan of people touching me if I’m not particularly attracted to them. Friends and family can give me a hug or something but I just don’t really like it when someone grabs or puts their hands on me. Makes me feel awkward and weird. My female xSFP friends do this constantly and it makes me uncomfortable sometimes. I just wouldn’t really put the effort into touching someone like that all the time unless I was into them.
6	I'm not touchy with friends, relatives, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm SUPER touchy with a crush/partner. I'm generally quite physical when it comes to relationsships, as it's a totally different level of communication. I could touch, kiss, hug my partner all day long.
3	I typically enjoy touch from people I like or if I’m consenting, but I don’t typically care for uninvited touch. Pretty reasonable.\n\nOverall, I’m not repulsed by it. (It is one of my primary love languages after all!) In a non-sexual way, I low key loved when the nurse did lice checks in elementary school. If someone’s knee touches me at a sports game or like on a bus or something, like accidental touches from close proximity, it doesn’t freak me out. \n\nIntention of the intrusion of my space matters.
3	Touch me daddy. But seriously I’m all about it. If I’m interested in you I want my hands all over you. 
2	I hate touch in any shape or form. I can barely stand being touched by anyone, including family, relatives, et cetera.
2	fUCK NO
2	I wasn't as a kid. Apparently my mother found it distressing because I wouldn't even let her hold me when I was crying about whatever.\n\nWhen I turned 16 I found some really great friends and made the conscious choice to learn how to be physical. Its actually been quite beneficial in a lot of unexpected ways.
2	Gross unless I actually REALLY like them (parents, SO, my dog). I don't enjoy fake affection.
2	here's my thing: I used to not be able to touch people at all. but I have been training myself to get better and become more humanoid. in sixth grade I created a game with me and some kids where every time we would see each other, we would try to "boop" each other's head. because of my competitive nature, I became more used to odd casual touches. this has evolved into poking, slinging my arm around friend's shoulders, etc. if I am tired, then my alertness decreases and depending on the level of knowing you, I may just cuddle you. this is extremely rare. hugging is remarkably awkward and a creation from the devil himself. not that I believe in the traditional ideologies of Christianity or something. what was I saying? oh well. basically touching is difficult but I'm getting better. also if I don't know you and you touch me I'll touch you but it will be my hand connecting with your face. what are you talking about I'm not aggressive
1	Super. I will cuddle anyone. 
1	cuddleMONSTER but i can’t stand having anybody buy an significant other or medical professional touch me. i’m slightly more comfortable initiating touch with others though. \n\ni hate when people just put a hand on my shoulder, touch my arm, even touching me to get my attention. i especially hate it when they’re doing it when asking me for stuff, it feels so manipulative. \n\ni just kind of freeze. i have no idea what to do and i visibly tense up. it’s very weird because i don’t have social anxiety at all & i can talk to anybody. but even when my best friends touch me i totally lose my train of thought. when strangers touch me i have a very bad reaction, i work part time in a cafe and when customers try to get my attention by touching me i feel like i’m going to punch them in the face. \n\nbecause of this i always ask before touching others and i am pretty bad at casually touching people. if my friend is sad and  i don’t know how to help i ask them if they want a hug. if they say yes it is very easy for me to initiate. i’m very good with hugs, extremely  generous. i probably hug like 3 people a day. i always ask first unless the situation is obviously appropriate like greeting somebody i know well. i ask about hand holding too, even with long term boyfriends. \n\n
1	And all this kissing on the cheecks... why is it absolutely necessary?
1	I'm a very physical person. I have no problem touching or being touched by almost anyone. With my partners I'm even more physical. Touching, massaging, kissing.. a lot. Luckily they all seem to like me a lot so it's never been an issue. 
1	I don't like being touched unnecessarily. I don't like being touched for the sake of touching. \n\nI start to like touch and physicality when theres a spin to it like increasing intimacy, comfort etc\n\nEdit: so actually I'm okay with touching if I find you attractive. You can touch me ( don't be inappropriate). Generally in terms of touching others I like holding hands occasionally. One thing i really do love however is being able to lay my head on a persons lap and talk to them. Real intimate shit 
1	Oh yeah I get uncomfortable even if my friends touch me randomly like THIS is my personal space stay out of it lol
1	Hugging friends is so strange. I always thought it was weird. There is one friend I'll hug often because I can relate to his tough situations in life.  I'll hug a girl I'm dating. I'd hug my Papa but, he passed away. Touching people is mostly strange. I always over think handshakes too.  lol most people stare at me funny when i first shake their hand because i have a giant scar all the way up my forearm. I'm also left handed, and would prefer lefthanded handshakes.

5	Does anyone know how to deal with an addiction from an ENTP viewpoint?	I've been struggling with a porn addiction for quite a while, and because I keep on failing, my self-confidence and motivation keeps getting lower. I've recently hit rock bottom, and tried every trick i could think off and found on the internet. You guys are inventive, what should i do?
6	If you want to stop, you will.  If you don't, you won't.  Suffer the pain of discipline, or the pain of regret.  There is no magic formula.\n\nAs an aside, porn addiction is difficult to maintain if you're having sex frequently.  Are you actively trying to?  If you're not, then committing to not masturbating or watching porn will increase your motivation REAL quick.
3	r/NoFap?  Might help?
3	If you take a vacation or otherwise place yourself in another environment for 3-10 days you should notice the addiction has been starved out
1	Get another healthier addiction. :D
1	It's simple: Stop watching porn.
1	Having outside sources help a lot. Go see a therapist, set up a system with a trusted & brutally honest friend whom you don’t want to disappoint where they can monitor your internet activity etc etc.
1	this might be weird but if I were you I would bingewatch shit about how porn sucks. like videos about how misogynistic is it is and how you won't get off as easily anymore and the toxic culture behind the camera. just make yourself feel like shit every time you watch it so it is fun anymore. also look up symptoms of masturbating too much to scare yourself 
16	That's how my girlfriend (I would guess an ISFJ) explained my ENTP-life 'in a nutshell'. I guess she has a point...	
5	Yep. When the to-do list just reads "everything" and at the end of the day, nothing has actually gotten done :/
1	This could apply to literally anyone with time management issues
1	But is there a cure 🤔

3	I like this, it reminds of some of the videos on YT back when it was just picking up steam. Make some more bro! 
2	Are ENTPs partiers? Is that the thing?

2	TIFU ENTPs are hyper-dopamized serotonin-deficient crybabies with chaos flooding their brains out of their ears:	
12	We're modern shamans without a role in today's society \n\n
3	Lol, amusing.  I just posted an article a few days ago that found there was only one factor which accounted for most of the variance.   I've notice in a few papers posted here lately that the correlation matrices for the big five traits often have significant cross correlations.  Apparently, this is a known thing which casts a lot of doubt on the credibility of the Big5 as a psychometric tool.   But then again, if you know how it was derived, it's not terribly surprising. 
3	Wow, it seems this community doesn't like core truth principles to be told. Maybe we should all flutter our assflaps to the ISFJ subreddit where truth is defined by the mood and thus the weather.
2	Can you please provide some reasoning to link the article to your title?  
0	BTW a lot of ENTPs are mistyped, usually ESFPs, so shush it. This is a definitely not a safe-space so STFU there's just a lot of meanies here.(the study explores as to why that is)
1	Can somebody please explain the hate directed towards this?
1	Could someone give a quick summary on what this all means chemical wise and etc...
15	Working on emotional warmth w/ an ENTP man?	I'm an INFP woman who started seeing an ENTP man. We're both in our late 20s and have good chemistry, he trolls me and it helps me not take myself so seriously (but I would never tell him this xD). The thing is that I need emotional support in a romantic relationship, i.e., words of affirmation, reassurance I'm doing well, and want to be upfront with him that this is a need of mine. (In the past around NTs I'd try to act tough and pretend I was fine without this but now I think real strength is being open about my weaknesses and needs.)\n\nI've known xNTPs who've been very empathic and emotionally reassuring, so know this is not strictly a type thing. He also comes from an Asian background like me and old-school Asian cultures can be emotionally closed-off, womp womp. Any advice for working through this with him? I've just started talking about it with him but was wondering if someone else had experience or tips. +1000 KARMA POINTS
16	ENTP gal here. I'd recommend learning love languages and the "platinum rule." Sounds like you might be familiar with the concepts already.\n\nMight be tough to disabuse him of the golden rule fallacy. \n\nKnowing ENTPs, maybe call the Platinum rule bullshit, so he'll argue for it?  :-)
10	I just broke up with an INFP(F19) (I’m Filipino M20, she was American) after 6 months. My experience:\n\n1) If he truly is invested in the relationship, he will tell you ALL THE TIME. Take him at his word and don’t be afraid to communicate.\n\n2) Be DIRECT. Fi-users communicate entirely indirectly (through *emotional* explanation of events) whereas Ti-users need direct communication (through *logical* explanation of events). If a problem arises between you, even if it seems really small and unimportant, you NEED to say something. He will be more open to listening than you think. ENTP’s are not mind readers; you will stress him out if you expect him to fix the problem without directly telling him what the problem is. (My INFP ex did this all the time; one of my biggest issues with her is that she shelled up at any type of confrontation or genuine talk whatsoever)\n\n3) It’s okay to let your Fi guide your feelings about the relationship. However, it is NOT okay to compare feelings you think you should or shouldn’t have to other people’s relationships. Your relationship with your SO is unique, and it will take its own time to grow and blossom.\n(My ex did this ALL THE TIME. “I don’t experience the same emotions with you that my friends do with their boyfriends.” And she never told me up front, I only knew she thought this after we broke up. This tells an ENTP absolutely nothing xD don’t be this type of INFP)\n\n4) Fi and Ti do not agree, solely due to the way they see the world. If your feelings are exploding, whether positive or negative, use your Ne to articulate to his Ne and you will have a much better chance of making it work.\n\n5) ENTP’s are needy as hell (in comparison to INFP’s). You have to be willing to talk to the ENTP and spend quality time to get to know him. If he can tell something is wrong (cause our Fe can tell when something’s not okay) he will try to get you to open up. DO NOT SHELL UP!!!! If you don’t tell him specifics when he can tell something is wrong, you will break his trust. The moment you shell up from him is the moment your relationship dies.\n\ntl;dr don’t make the same mistakes I made. Be OPEN and do not be afraid to trust him. He will only trust you as much as you trust him. I wish you luck, love is a beautiful thing (and so are ENTP’s:)
5	I'm an ENTP and I'm happily dating an ENFP, I also have had some romantic-ish relationships and friendships with INFPs in the past. I think that as long as you are direct about your emotional needs and he really cares, he should absolutely be capable of changing.  In my experience, being surrounded by a number of other NF friends and watching their open love for one another made me feel more comfortable sharing my emotions more openly and more often, and I am grateful for it.  Plus there are some great intelligent but emotional movies that you could try to get him to watch with you to get the ball rolling.  I'd suggest anything written by Charlie Kaufman (Eternal Sunshine, Anomalisa) or Spike Jonze (Her, Where the Wild Things Are).  They're intelligent and interesting but are also filled with so much heart.  Good luck!
5	Positive reinforcement. That‘s all.\nDo I get karma points now?
2	Empathy is a skill that can be practiced and learnt like anything else, it comes easier to some than others. I personally really struggle with it compared to others but it does come at unexpected times. The trick for an outsider would be to find something that he genuinely empathises with and then work out why and expand from there. \nN.B. There is also a chance that he does have significant amounts of empathy but struggles to show it. (This is the case with me too). So maybe think about that path as well? 
2	I'd straight up tell him exactly what you need.  I know that's hard for INFP's, but I have always appreciated when people give feedback on how to communicate.  You could even frame it as a challenge.  I don't know about the other ENTP's, but the implication or statement that I *can't* do something has always been a challenge to see if I can.
2	As an ENTP woman, Words of Reassurance is the love language that baffles me (and, quite frankly, annoys me) the most. I think having a conversation with him about why reassurance is important to you and times when it is needed might be a good place to start. \n\nTo elaborate a bit more, the frequent need for reassurance comes across to me as crippling insecurity and I feel like I’m an emotional babysitter. It’s not my job to find your confidence for you! But the context of a romantic relationship changes that a little bit and I think we all know it’s important to tell people that we love and care about them...discuss with him the ways he naturally shows affection so that you can receive that message when it’s not so clear, as well as telling him how he can make it more clear for you and meet your needs
2	Someone else already said it in an annoying way, but all you can do is practice positive reinforcement. Every time he does what you want, make a huge deal about it. Thank him a lot and find a way to return love the way he likes it. I’m sure you might have tried to guess at his love language already. \n\nAnd keep in mind that you can’t really change anyone. If someone isn’t doing what you like after you’ve started a relationship, the chance of them changing inside the relationship is very small. 
1	I am an ENTP and there is nothing more satisfying for me than solving my girlfriend's (or any girls' ... but I better shouldn't say that) emotional issues. However, I had to study what makes humans tick (i.e. the emotional part) to really 'get' how to act in a way that meets other people's needs. It requires intentional effort. A little hint: if you get him to believe, for instance, that showing empathy is a skill/habit great personalities have and that positively stands out in people, he will probably start working on it soon.   \n\n\nAnyways, the best thing, and I think that counts for any relationship no matter if you are dating an ENTP or not, is what you already did: let him know what you need. Even total empaths cannot read other people's minds. As much as he needs to know that he is 'competent enough', you have your own 'good enoughs' that needs to be satisfied, which is okay to say. So it would make sense to an ENTP if you said: 'hey, I am feeling down today and would need your comfort tonight'. Even though I am trying to be mindful about my girlfriend's emotional states, for me it is not always that obvious, especially when my mind is somewhere far away. If he really cares about you, he will do an effort and give you what you need. Just be aware that he might disappear in the library for a few weekends to understand what you are talking about... ;) 
1	I’m an ENTP (M) with an ENFP (F) which is pretty similar. We don’t really have deep conversations about our feelings  but I usually express myself through action rather than words and she’s fairly re-assured.\n\nIf he’s a younger ENTP he may not listen to his Fe. \n\nTi is ruthless 
1	I'm an ENTP woman who is very bad at words of affirmation/reassurance/etc. I can do it in the short term in a friendship context, but struggle in a long-term relationship context. It's why I've chosen to be with an ISTJ who requires almost zero emotional maintenance (of course, that comes with its own problems).\n\nThe difficulty I have with providing emotional support (at least, emotional support as defined by you) is that it often feels false. I am good at straight talk. I am good at providing a detailed breakdown of your problems and how you might go about fixing them. I am critical by nature. It's not because I don't believe in you, but because I do. I believe you are stronger than whatever barriers I've identified for you - if I thought you were weaker, I wouldn't even bother. \n\nAs I said, I can pretend to provide garden variety emotional support to strangers, even friends. However, in an intimate relationship, I want to be myself. While that does require providing words of affirmation, reassurance, etc. at times, I cannot do it on a consistent basis. I have trouble telling other people it's going to "be okay," because I honestly don't know that. I may be able, once again, to provide a detailed analysis of why it's *likely* to be okay, but I'll usually do this in a more "detached" or "objective" manner. This is a somewhat self-centered approach, because that is what would genuinely reassure *me*. \n\nI don't know if any of that is helpful, or if your boyfriend's views actually align with mine in this regard. I do concur with the above-noted comments about love languages, but those perspectives have been so well articulated already that I thought I'd chime in with something different instead.
6	MBTI "relationships"?	Either MBTI relationships posts are pretty much all BS or I'm nothing even resembling an ENTP. My closest friend is an ESFJ and the guy I've liked forever is an xSTJ. In theory I'm supposed to get along with xNFPs/xSFPs much better than I get along with them but really it's like I need to keep a fixed distance away from a majority of high Fi types or I'll go absolutely crazy. Or maybe I'm just terrible at typing people and I'm wrong about this.
7	I honestly believe any combination can work, so long as both people are relatively healthy. \n\nI find MBTI useful for assessing relationships insofar as it helps me articulate problems I might be having with (for example) an INFJ friend, or ISTJ boyfriend. I've learned over time that I really struggle with Fi, like many on this thread. At the some time, I've learned why I might annoy someone with high Si or Se, as I'm head-in-the-clouds as fuck, especially around my physical environment. It doesn't always have to be do-or-die - it can be an insight here and an insight there.
3	Nah, I have trouble with hi Fi’s too. So much DRAMA
6	Visual Imagination	Sometimes, I think that my visual imagination is not vivid. Like, I have lots of OCs and worlds I have just made up when i was on the bus or before sleep. But while I am reading a novel -especially fantasy novels-, sometimes I just struggle imagining the scene in my mind -Sometimes distraction causes it-. Yeah, I set up the scene in my mind but there are not significant colors or background. \n\nSometimes, it makes me think I am not an ENTP \n\nIs there anyone who has this problem too? 
9	This doesn't seem like an MBTI/ENTP thing. While N-doms prefer imagining fantasy worlds (unlike their S-dom relatives who prefer the real world, hence they're more experiential), MBTI makes no reference to the *degree* with which someone does it. For instance adrenaline junkies who bungee jump every day could be an S-dom much like someone who's constantly designing bridges as an engineer. \n\nThat having been said, \n\n>Sometimes, it makes me think I am not an ENTP\n\nI wish more people on the board demonstrated this type of self awareness. Maybe you are an ENTP, maybe you're not. It's a more valid statement than those who constantly say "I'm 100% an ENTP"
4	I don’t really think this relates to MBTI. I have a very good visual imagination and I don’t really struggle imagining vivid things. My mind is a heavy mix of dialogue and visualizing what I am thinking about (I mean it’s like this for most people, lol). \n\nHowever, I have read up on a disorder(?) called aphantasia. It’s where an individual doesn’t have a good minds eye and can barely use imagery in their head. I’m not saying you have it, but it might be worth it to look into it.\n\nhttp://aphant.asia/have-i-got-aphantasia\n\nIn the test presented in this article I can do all of the things listed with ease. What about you?
1	I have a really great visual imagination, but they are very poor in details. 
2	Help to solve my conundrum: Work on the sales / strategy side but dislike to serve customers	Dear fellow-ENTP,\n\nI would like to know how to solve this conundrum: On one hand as a typical ENTP I don't like the little details and the execution - which means for me as Engineer I need to move either to a Manager position or a Strategic (Sales&Commercial) position. On the other hand I don't like to bullshit or serve others and so I am not sure if sales is the right thing. I don't like it when other control me, serve them or if I am dependent on them.\n\nIs the only way to solve this to become an entrepreneur or CEO? Any advice?
5	I mean basically yes. There are few jobs where you dont have to deal with clients or answer to a boss. Sounds like you should try consulting. 
39	What's a time where you realized your opinions / ideas were more uncommon than you thought?	My example: senior year politics class high school, we're sharing opinions on abortion. There were some pro and some con but it was all pretty standard.  I raised my hand and explained that with how over populated the world is, why complain about a baby not being born that wasn't  wanted anyway.  Anything to fight over population, right? The mix of awkward vibes one gasp and uncomfortable laughs made me realize no one else thought like that. Anything like this happen to you?
31	> The mix of awkward vibes one gasp and uncomfortable laughs \n\nI don't think you got that reaction because your opinion was unpopular, but because you weren't afraid to be blunt about the unpleasant-sounding aspects of a common view.\n\n> no one else thought like that\n\nThey either hadn't carried their opinion on the issue to its logical extension, or wouldn't admit it out loud. 
15	I find more often that people think the right thing for the wrong reasons.
8	We were asked to in societal studies (politics with a dash of history, geography and what not) to create a utopia, first assignment of the class, i'm the only one to fail it.\n\nReason? My worldview was un-democratic, since my proposed utopia consisted of a single omniscient dictator with impeccable character and so selfless as to be incorruptible.\n\nYeah after that one I was branded the Nazi of our class. Good times.
7	But are we worried of overpopulation? I'm certainly not. In industrialized countries birth rates sink dramatically. For example here in Germany I think it's about 1.8 births per woman, we are relying on foreigners.\n\nSimilar thing happened to me. Teacher was talking about how there are more old than young people now (See, No overpopulation). He said that the last 3 weeks of a persons live often cost the most. I told him we could legalise it that when people don't want to life anymore their life support could be cut off. That would solve the money problem (because rent is expensive) and the people don't want to live anymore anyways, there are other reasons for it too. 
5	I realize that my ideas were uncommon the moment i started studying to become a creative and i was the guy to call if u were stuck trying to imagine a soluton for any problem in a project, i realize i just had to generate one idea, and people were going to be like woah thats amazing i never imagined, and im talking about fellow intuitives and extremmely creative people.\n\nAbout the abortion thing i think ur idea is just basic,and i dont mean it as an offense,one time i decided to partake on a debate about abortion and i went this angle, i told a history about a guy who  laced he girlfriend drink with abortive pills making her misscarry, and i asked for their opinion on it,and f course it was murder, so i asked for how much time in jail the guy should have according to their view, ar they going to give it a bigger sentence than murdering someone with ur car? why is that murder and aborting regularly s not? I was not trying to ake a point but to make them put their mental energy debating something i didint care, so i let it draw a little, and then said that well what were really disccusing is the liberty of the people,but i think is funny that americans debate this when abortion is not free there, u have to paid it, an were debating in spain about abortion because is free, there is not even a discussion about private abortion being denied, and went on a little rant about  the price of things, what is freedom and why america lacks freedom in general, and frm that momment on, i made them debate something absolutely different.\n\nSo what ur claiming as an original idea, i think is pretty standar idea aout over population but i see it just as one angle, u can create atleast 3  big different angles just from the idea u stated and u can turn that debate into other things with really a few words.
5	Similar kinda class except I said that I think the government should force people to have an abortion if the arn’t financially, physically, or metal capable of looking after the child \n\nThe look on my classmates faces, I will never forget. 
3	when the people started to use the word "normie"
3	On the abortion topic, If you are religious and believe that aborted babies go to heaven then in the US for the last 60 years more people have gone to heaven via abortion than conversion. If you believe the afterlife is eternal shouldn't it follow that more babies should be aborted since it's not worth risking that person fucking it up with a normal life on Earth?\n\nAddendum: I do not believe any of the above and do not recommend using this argument against anyone with religious views. There are much better, non-aggressive ways to debate a Theist. 
3	I think it's more of saying things that other won't say out loud
2	The book One Door Away From Heaven by Dean Koontz describes the bad guys as Bioethics Utilitarians, and I actually found their arguments persuasive.  Similar to OP's.  I read it in what was probably seventh grade.
2	I'm quite an individualist so... that thought never occurred to me, about accepting abortion... But yeah, I have these ideas that I voice out from time to time and some of them will be like, 'dude... wtf?' Or 'hahaha, that's really funny' that I knew they didn't take my idea seriously. \n\nIn some cases, my friend even gave me this deadpanned look and expressed how my idea is really far from common.\n 
2	Just so you know: overpopulation is a non problem 
2	Don't remember the first time, but last Sunday during a family dinner with all my uncles and my grandma I said that inheritance was unfair and the state should confiscate all your savings and proprierties after your death if you don't have underage children and use that money to boost welfare distribution and cut consumption taxes. Everybody started to freak out. TIL that my grandma was thinking about giving a part of his savings to my dad and uncles in advance, so they were worried that I could make her change her mind. 
0	That would be the day I said that I think Global Warming is over-hyped and not that big a deal.  Yep.  An entire room stopped, turned, and started yelling at me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the OP's post, I think if we were *really* worried about overpopulation in America, we could just take warning labels off of things and let natural selection do it's magic.  After 6yrs of customer service I genuinely wonder how some people have survived this long.\n\nEdited for grammar.
2	Nobody likes my libertarian free market capitalist views 
1	The 2016 presidential elections sent my world view into a tailspin lol.
3	ENTP and INTJ	tbh i dont even know what im going to be writing here,i have so many thoughts in my head and im just going to try to tell them neatly.\n\nso i just started my freshman year (and by started i mean its the end of the semester), i had a lot of friends in middle school, but because of high school, we all drifted apart (going to different schools and such). so that was the start of that. at that point i had always been an ENTP (first tested 6th grade).\n\nthen as the year progressed i became much more introverted and calculating, very different from my old self, at least internally. around people i could still achieve the same excitement i had once gotten before (but now i was much more picky on the people i was with, not picky in a "you have to be this way" more like i hung with a smaller yet tighter group (even though i have no friends in my new school, just like 1 or 2) but i would tend to get a bit exhausted or bored, more so bored) but the excitement derives more from the ideas at play more than the people. \n\ni used to be able to just do things on the fly, and really not worry about things at all, but now im very meticulous, well at least with some things, with other things im still very lax. i think this might be related to a time last year when some things i did in the past came back and bit me in the butt...hard, but as i think about it, i dont know, the things i plan out, and need to have a sense of control over are very diverse, i would think that if it was caused by the event, it would stick close to it. y'know?\n\nwhen i started to notice those things (in the beginning stages, they were distant, but still noticeable) i started theorizing, my mind bounced between possibilities. could it be depression? because along with what i said before, i've been numb and reclusive. i disregarded that idea since...i dont know, i didnt have any problems with my self image (i have a pretty strong ego) & as someone who has been close to people with depression, it didnt seem to be that (and i had always had problems with emotions and empathy, so i just counted its new prevalence to the introspection that comes with introversion). then i thought it could be just a normal change, y'know going to a new school and all, but i also discarded that idea due to the fact i have moved around alot and had never gone to the same school for more than a year until 7th grade (well i was on and off at school in 7th grade (i mean like months (homeschooling)) so if you think about it, i have never (up to this day) gone to the same school for more than a year). and the amount of change in so little time was too drastic to just be natural so i got to thinking (i still dont really know, it could be factors in my life and junk (ie the event i talked about earlier (but that happened a while ago, why would it kick in now) or maybe the introversion was natural (going to a new school and all) and then as i thought to my self i subconsciously started to change things about me....maybe?)\n\nfrom the beginning i had considered the idea of me possibly changing types (a given almost) i went through many until (recently) i reached INTJ, later i realized that ENTP shadow functions are Ni Te Fi Se, which is intriguing (maybe proof for the depression theory? (or maybe i could be putting up a subconscious wall to protect my self from the new environment (since intj and entp tend to be each others alter-ego's) or \*LE GASP\* i was putting up a wall in middle school, and this is my true form).\n\nnow (modern day) the new traits are basically me now, very introverted, analytical all that junky junk, and im kinda shocked, like ive changed so much, i kinda just wanna find out why and talk about how cool this is
2	Were you tested by a psychiatrist?
1	INTJ works mirrored ENTP.\nWhat this means is everything an ENTP would need input from (i.e. Ne) the INTJ would analyze internally (i.e. Ni) and vice versa (Te vs. Ti).\n\nNi-doms are extremely rare and it is very unlikely you have become an Ni-dom from an Ne-dom. What is more likely given your self description of your past (btw that’s some Ti-Si-heavy analysis that you’ve given; it was very driven on memories and past experiences) is that your Ne and Ti have actually switched in order of usage:\n\n*Ti>Ne>Si>Fe*\nrather than\n*Ne>Ti>Fe>Si*\n\nThis would make you an INTP rather than an ENTP. Albeit somewhat unhealthy given the Ti-Si loop you seem to be exhibiting.\n\nTry to find something new and exciting that interests you and see if that changes anything (activating your Ne)
1	ENTP here but I often act INTJ-ish and that's the reason I was mistyped as one.\nBut also doctor told me to go and check myself on depression so there's that. The shadow functions theory would fit in here

1	I tend to turn into an INTJ when I'm working hard on a project or "in the zone". Definitely not reflective of my personality 
1	Hi there - first time poster on this sub so sorry if it’s going to get me lambasted, but I’d encourage you to supplement this exploration with a study of the Enneagram 4w5, which sounds like your type. I’m an ENTP (similarly hellbent on self-understanding haha) and a 4w5, and I found that the Enneagram filled in some missing pieces for me with MBTI.
35	Simple article on the ENTP subtypes and how they emerge.

7	I'm usually the Goofball, and I'm having so much trouble escaping it. Occasionally I'll switch into the DJ and it feels amazing, but it's too rare to matter much, and I'll switch into the popularity seeker more often, so it counteracts it.

Then I began to get very excited because I was aware that I  was dreaming, which would mean that I was in the Land of Dreams, a  place that I imagined once and that you come by dreaming and that I was  thinking if it exists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I looked around and thought:\n\n\-I can't believe it!! I am really dreaming! Then the Land of Dreams is real ??! :D\n\nthen a tree that was nearby shouts at me angry:\n\n\-SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!!!!!! Do you really think that this place has a name as dumb as that? Only dumbfuck humans think that.\n\nI looked at him and asked him:\n\n\-Then, what is the name?  😐\n\nThen the tree looked at me angry and said:\n\n\-It's called...\n\nand then I woke up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI woke up so damn frustrated for not hearing the name, but also so happy because of the feeling that maybe there is a Land of Dreams. Does anyone else ever came to the Land of Dreams?\n\nim an infp so sorry for the crossposting but i just thought that this would be of interests for you
5	And what exactly about your story did you think would be of interest to an ENTP who‘s not your boyfriend? 
2	The name doesnt matter, the place is called...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand if you are not ready for it it's not. 
2	Just a lucid dream\n\nThe subconscious tends to make things sound and feel more substantial than they really are, which truly is the fun part of dreams.
1	>i just thought that this would be of interests for you\n\n[You've got another think coming!](https://brians.wsu.edu/2016/05/19/youve-got-another-thing-coming/)
1	It’s called Celephaïs.
1	"The Dark Knight"	If y'all fellow ENTPs haven't watched it yet, watch it. I feel like my philosophical veiws regarding morality are outlined perfectly by the Joker and it might be just a me thing but I think many ENTPs might relate. 
21	Don’t cut yourself on that edge.
6	The Joker is the epitome of the "enlightened nihilist."  It's ridiculously edgy and it was only revolutionary at the time because the whole "haha life is pain and existence is meaningless" mindset only became hip and trendy after 2010, with the Joker likely influencing such a phenomenon.\n\nHe's still a cool villain, but the actual absurdist claims that he makes is so overdone by maladjusted Internet gamers these days that it's hard to take them seriously when uttered by anyone besides the Joker himself.
6	It's not just a you thing.  All my friends tell me that if I were evil I'd be the Joker.  I'll take it as a compliment since he's a pretty cool villain.
1	Which aspects of his philosophy are you referencing? 
37	Can anyone solve this riddle?

14	I've been tricked by things like this enough times to know not to assume instructions that aren't there. So if it doesn't say my line can't cross through the walls, then my line is going to cross through the walls.
11	Instructions unclear, solutions aplenty. Perfect ENTP bait.
8	Did you just waste my time with an impossible puzzle?\n\n...
12	There is no solution possible in the plane.  There are 6 rooms.  The five shown, plus the outside.   Since the stipulation is that you can only cross a door once, you need an even number of connections to not get stuck in a room.   That means **at most** there can only be two rooms with an odd number of connections.\nSince more than two rooms have an odd number, it’s impossible to connect them all with one path in two dimensions.\n\nMathematically speaking, this graph doesn’t have a Eulerian cycle.\n

1	If I can start wherever I want that makes this super easy. I did this in high school seeing if anybody could figure it out and the rules I ran was you had to start from the outside, not cross a door more than once, and you had to pass through all doors and connect back to where you started. It actually is solvable in a super simple way that almost everyone overlooks if I'm not mistaken

10	It's not fair that only men had to go to the war. Change my mind.	So,opinions on this matter?\nI personally think that it's deeply unfair for men to be send to a war and risking their lives there - mostly for something that the government started. They literally had been drafted, lots of them didn't volunteer, had to leave their women, or men, kids, and then go, knowing that they may never come back. Why didn't women have to risk their lifes as well? (Talking here mainly based on WW2 but it mostly applies to the rest of it as well). \nOfc the best solution is the army based on volunteers, but I know that those people probably wouldn't be enough. 
32	Women did serve in the war, over a million of them. In the Air Force, Snipers, Nurses, Auxiliary. The Soviet army alone had over 800'000 women during WWII. 
12	On pure logical reflection, both should be drafted into conflict, perhaps with station adapted to physical capabilities (i.e favoring men in infantry for physical strengths, women in tech or genius?) but to be honest, I don't think the question is relevant in modern war. You're thinking of the issue in term of WWI-WWII "full draft" were it was an obligation and duty to take part to the war effort, either by direct national drafting or war- work. Nowadays, wars are not relying on the number of soldiers to be won but on the advance in technology and the ability to fight while sitting in a secured room. I'm very much open to debate on the subject. 
11	Has anyone mentioned that largely women weren't given opportunities to decide whether to go to war?
5	Think of it as the strategy of the country, not even considering that men are stronger physically (on average), \nA single man can have 20 kids if he has sex with 20 women\n\nA single woman, no matter how many men we give her is limited in the number of births.\n\nAs a result, countries couldn't really afford to lose their women in wars.\n\nThis logic still holds true even today... Sadly
4	The real inadequacy is in selective service, when selective service was first created the stated reasoning for women not having to sign up was because they could not serve on the front lines. Now they are able to serve on the front lines and yet women don't have to sign up for select service. I'm all for equal rights under the law but not picking and choosing rights. Granted the whole system should be done away with, service should be a choice not an obligation, but while we have it, it should be carried out justly.
10	It was a great injustice of the past that women were **purposefully excluded** from armed combat positions by the men who ran the army.  Even today, in 2019 USA, it is *impossible* for a woman to get selected for the draft. This situation is intolerable and some sort of affirmative action plan should be put in place to favor women in the draft and for front line combat roles to make up for missed opportunities.  I wouldn’t personally mind if they even *exclusively* drafted women or only assigned women for highly dangerous missions.  Until we start seeing a lot more women with blown off limbs and combat PTSD, we males really need to check our privilege.
5	How is war fair to anyone? Don't understand why you make it a question about gender.
2	I don't think fairness is the point my man. Practicality trumps fairness when you got have a war to fight (historically speaking)
2	with the exception of modern wars, what exactly do you suggest? if you send off your women to war and lose, well prepare for a civilizational collapse because your birth rate just hit zero. 
2	I don’t think anyone should be involuntarily drafted. They shouldn’t be forced into service against their will
2	1. Women were often barred from joining certain sects, if not all, of the military in historic US wars, so it's not like they had the choice anyway\n\n2. Early wars truly relied on strength because our weaponry was lacking. Women are weaker than men and have a lower cap in strength, especially upper body strength. Why spend resources to buff up a woman when you can use those same resources to buff up two men?\n\nBeyond WWI, I get your point though. There's not much of an excuse to not require FAFSA-applying women to sign up for the draft in this day and age of modern warfare.
1	1) Life is not fair.  It's getting more fair in that regard, but it's not 100% yet.\n\n2) Women go to war all the time now\n\n3) I'm not sure I agree with a draft either, so I can't change your mind on that one.
1	Its not fair anyone goes to war, couple of cunts running countries got beef, send the troops!
1	Fair based on what? If it’s based on our function in society, then it is fair because men are far more expendable when it comes to maintaining population size. If it’s based on personal benefit to any given dead man who would have lived had a woman fought instead, then sure - it can easily be argued that it’s unfair to him when both are citizens of the country.
1	>Male students who fail to register with Selective Service before turning age 26 are ineligible for Federal student loan and grant programs, including Pell Grants, Federal Work Study, and Stafford Loans. (Parents who want to borrow a PLUS loan do not have to satisfy the registration requirement.) Several states have also made Selective Service registration a prerequisite for state financial aid and for matriculation at public colleges and universities.\n\n>Even if you disagree with the requirement, you should register. Failure to register can have a serious negative impact on your ability to obtain a driver's license, qualify for financial aid, pursue an education, or obtain employment.\n\nAnyone want some of that [male privilege](http://www.finaid.org/students/selectiveservice.phtml)??
-1	Systemic racism doesn't exist in the US. Systemic sexism towards large, strong (ie scary) men does (which is why 96% of prison inmates are male). Change my mind.
-11	Because women are physically and mentaly inferior compared to men. The real consequence would be, that women learn to know, where their place is, like in older days. We have to go back to natural role models. 
12	When ENTP's try to see an idea through to the end ....	
2	I dont understand what you mean by till the end? Care to explain OP? 
2	Live and let live society	How do you think it would differ from society we now have? How would it all look like?
1	It has been discussed such matters in most ideology-based manifestos as that it is a possibility of humane actions when individual happiness is achieved in a collective manner while the happiness does not ever contain any harm to the rest of the society. Basically, this is how someone “lives and lets live”. \n\nHowever, and surprisingly(!), it can be achieved through thinking out of the box, meaning, imagining a revolutionary moment for the world to takover the current “not live and let live” society, to restore the one beautifully recognisable harmless society. \n\nMany has spoken, many more has written about this. The aftermath is, mostly, the problem is economic. Live and let live and by that, one must fix the repressive thoughts and actions towards others in order to gain superiority over them.
4	Have you met these date strategies? what about infj? :-)	check that https://hackspirit.com/youve-heard-ghosting-13-modern-dating-terms-need-know/\nso...?
33	How do you deal with friends trying to "find themselves" or the classic "I don't know who I am" mental trap?	The entire idea just seems so absurd to me and I can't grasp it at all. What do you mean you lost your identity? How do you even do that? Why were you identifying yourself as things outside of your person to begin with? What more do you need than "I'm a being who thinks"? Won't you inevitably change and therefore need to rewrite your overly complex identity constantly throughout your life? That seems like an awful chore, considering how hard you're taking it. \n\nI have so many questions. \n\nNot dealing with it right now, but I had a flashback to the time my INFJ I stupidly obsess over told me she didn't know who she was any more after a breakup that was a long time coming. This is probably the one thing about humans that I have been completely and hopelessly unable to fathom. You know how it is with us, we understand *everything* that we've thought about for a few seconds. Thanks Google. I can't even begin with this. 
39	  It's about realizing that the image you have of yourself doesn't match your actions, thoughts and emotions.
14	[deleted]
9	As someone who feels like he needs to "find himself", I believe it to be from living without happiness or purpose. \n\nI feel like I'm not living the life I should be
6	for me its more i don't know what i like or dont like yet, or how I'd react to stuff in person as apposed to on a theoretical level. I need to experience stuff and be exposed to new stuff to see what works and what doesn't. Like trying on a new jacket to see if i like the fit but instead its for life choices. And much like a computer you edit it as you go along. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou yourself chose myerrs briggs as your way to find out who you are, other people prefer practice to theory. Personally i try both.
4	Hi I’m an infj lurker because I’ve nothing else to do atm but INFJs that are unhealthy or to absorbed in their environment (people partners) due to unbalanced Fe( in laymen’s terms codependency) indeed it’s not normal or healthy
3	I feel similarly, if not totally the same. I understand needing to reformulate a plan when circumstances go awry, but my identity isn’t tied to things or people. Although, it may be tied to what I like to do... which is kind of everything, so that’s not helpful.
2	Is there a difference between, what am I and who am I? If so I think you don’t get the latter one, I find myself thinking of both.
2	I am going through this right now. I am an INFJ who was in a toxic relationship for more than 2 years with an INFP. This man emotionally and sexually abused me. The mind games he played with me completely fucked me over. Before I started dating him, I was a confident woman who was the top student in her department. I got job offers from the top companies, won a prestigious scholarship, etc. I also had a lot of guys hitting on me every day. However, I was also incredibly naive. I was a virgin, straightedge, very quiet, and gentle. Basically your stereotypical INFJ overachiever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy abusive ex learned my weaknesses and used them against me. He eroded my self-confidence, isolated me from my friends, and told me I was "selfish" for focusing on my career and not him. My entire relationship was focused on me trying to please him because he convinced me I was a terrible human being who was lucky to have him. He told me all my hobbies were "stupid" so I stopped doing them to please him. I stopped talking to my family (he picked fights with them), and stopped focusing so much on work and school, both of which were fundamental parts of my identity. I took pride in being good at what I do (professionally)!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I broke up with him, I had to work hard to find the woman I was before him. But see, there are somethings you just can't get back- like your virginity, your GPA, or the friends you lost because of him. I understand I will never be the woman I used to be...but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. I am getting a completely fresh start in life and this is the part where I figure out who I really am. I have started traveling more, hanging out with new people, trying different things, going to therapy, and radically changing my profession. I am no longer concerned with finding love. Finding myself is more important to me.
2	> The entire idea just seems so absurd to me and I can't grasp it at all. What do you mean you lost your identity? How do you even do that?\n\nEver had amnesia?
2	It's like pretty much a generally accepted rule that in life, you go through *stages*. So many of them, in all shapes and sizes, flavors and colors, on all these vastly confusing and different levels and plains. Maybe there's even some in parallel universes, I don't know but..\n\nWhen people tend to use behavior or terms along the lines of **I need to find myself** or  **I don't know who I am anymore,** I have found that an impressive percent of the time this is code for  ***Stage  transition***.  The rest of the times were on mild altering substances.\n\nI postulate these stages are due to the process of on-going time that inevitably results in an increasing acquisition of experiences to collectively draw from, which is ever surmounting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso this is pretty typical of a  post branch-swinger re-writing her life story.
2	I usually say the following: through service you find yourself. It's a way to make them get busy and stop pestering me. 
1	The mashroom aint speaking his mind tho 
1	When I hear "lost my identity," especially in terms of relationships (like with your ex), I assume that the person has suddenly found themselves at odds with their current context.  In a relationship this may be co-dependency, where a person maneuvers themselves into a life centered around another person and begins to identify themselves relative to that person (what the other person likes, what they think, what their habits are, etc.).  If you start thinking of yourself as one half a person, then to an extent you \*stop\* thinking of yourself as an individual, which can be really jarring if the two identities ever come into conflict (as they often do).\n\nIn a sense finding your identity is always about moving away from "codependency" - dependency on a particular job, on a level of academic performance, on a social status within a group.  Maybe you've always thought of yourself as the "most beautiful" (Mirror, mirror, I know... :P), but now you're growing old and others are taking your place - so, who are you now?  Or maybe you've always been a pro athlete but you break your leg - who are you now?  Or maybe you were valedictorian, but now you're barely passing at a name-brand school - who are you going to be now?\n\nNot saying I'm an expert on an identity, but I certainly can relate to not feeling like you have one.  When you think about it, it's probably essential - how are you going to change and grow with purpose if you never question your current configuration settings?
1	As someone who constantly overthinks himself and has a good connection to my thoughts and feelings, I obviously don't need to find myself.\n\nBut you have to accept/learn that not everyone is as self-reflecting as we are. Some people only analyse themselves from time to time, that's when they "find themself".\n\nWe constantly overthink ourselves, so we don't need to "find ourselves". (or we constantly do, depending on the definition...;-))
1	No offense, but you seem useless. When others are missing a piece that you say you already have you help them. If you’re so wise as to find self discovery absurd, your wisdom means nothing. Knowledge and wisdom are meant to shared. And when someone doesn’t know something that you know, you should help them.  This post makes me want to be nothing like you.
10	My mind about the world, can someone relate to this mess that I am?	
22	If you made this with the soul purpose of posting  it onto the subreddit then I am going to cringe.
2	What the fuck. 
2	One of them better say 'send nudes'
4	Everything is everywhere and the world is a disorganized mess. I agree. 
0	For those who are going to wonder what is wrote down, the majority is physics questions or philosophical questions wrote down. Some of them with plausible simple answers that came up with my mind. Everything is written in Portuguese as I need to educate myself and my mind to think in Portuguese as I will need to wait a lot of time before immigrating.

32	Lack of school spirit/company pride	I’ve never had school spirit/company pride or anything like that so I wanted to know if this is a personal thing or can it be attributed to my cognitive stack?\n\nIs this an Fi sense of identity or Si sense of tradition or Te group consensus? I’m really confused and haven’t thoroughly processed my stance yet \n\nIf this is too vague feel free to ask questions and I’ll answer 
33	Company pride is shit, I wouldn't worry about it. Unless you are the owner (or part owner via stocks) of said company, you're just a cog in the machine.
21	I'd think it has to do with Ne and Ti more than anything else. Recognizing the mob like, tribalistic mentality...the triviality of a school song meant to indoctrinate students/workers to becoming invested in the school. Like, it's really just internal marketing meant to control people from leaving the group and maintain power/authority over them masked in fun. Many people take all of these things for face value and just accept them and the "fun". They do not see the tribalism and group think of it all, but ENTPs are acutely aware or anyone or thing that tries to control them because we HATE IT.\n\nThat being said, it is entirely possible to participate and enjoy yourself without subscribing to whatever ideology is presented. And there might even be the chance that you find an organization down the line that really resonates with you that you have no problem being loyal to. This is how it was with a few of my sports teams (not all).
29	Personally for me when I was in high school, the whole school spirit thing never clicked for me. I believe as ENTP's we're just generally more self aware and individual. There's something that keeps us from truly becoming a part of the mob mentality. I'm always the dude picking the underdog or laughing at people who hop on the bandwagon. As a college student, I fully support my school and feel pride, but that's because nothing is forced on me and I worked hard to get to this place so it's different. I'm allowed to support my school in my own independent style. This is important to the ENTP I guess, we can't have stuff forced on us. \n\n
10	Probably. I'm a teacher, and type and school spirit are absolutely correlated. Interestingly, ESTP's care somewhat, but ENTP's aren't into it at all. The kids that most exemplify school spirit (and teachers, now that I think about it) are ESFJ. 
7	I never gave a crap about school spirit.\n\n1, none of us are here willingly. This is compulsory, if I stop going then either me or my parents will have men with guns show up at our home and force me to go. \n\n2, I will never see any of you again. Maybe one or two friends but that’s it. \n\n3, this is all so fake. The behavior that’s allowed in schools is not allowed in the real world (shove a student into a Locker? Sure. Shove a co worker into a locker? Fired on the spot.) Even the metrics by which we are judged is fake. You don’t get “credit for showing your work” in real life. \n\nYou darn sure don’t have minimum word counts. If my boss asks for a report on X and I take 2000 words to explain something I could have said in 400 words, I’m going to get yelled at for wasting time and if I do it multiple times I’m fired. \n\nSo yeah I don’t begrudge those who enjoy the school spirit thing but was never for me. 
5	I think to some extent it's beyond functions.  If you identify with a group, you're going to feel emotional affinity.  I personally don't give a shit about sports teams, and most school spirit seems to be tied into that.  I kind of resented being forced to attend rallies for the football team in high school.  I don't care about football, so I never cared if my university "won".    That said, if I'm playing a game with teams I will trash talk the shit out of the other side and use everything I see to belittle them for no other reason than they're on the opposite side.  To some extent I do that with the other 15 inferior MBTI types because I identify with the ENTP stereotype fairly strongly.  So I think it's really more about the particulars, although I can see ESFJs cheering on the other team as they score.\n\nType-wise all Ps typically hate conformity and distrust authority but for different reasons.  Fi can be suspicious of the motivations of others, seeing 'the rules' as being a personal affront meant to suppress them (you're limiting me with your rules).  And Ti rejects doing something without a reason, *especially* if one rule contradicts another rule or is seen as an unwarranted special case. (why does *he* get to go to XYZ but I have to stay home?)\n
3	I also don’t know what spirituality is without applying a psychological lens either. Like what does spirituality “feel” like...?
5	When I went to highschool, there was this thing, I wasnt special ed or anything but they put me in ot because I loved to talk to my friends and they said "I didnt care" truth be told I didnt, I hated the teachers and how they worked, I got along with anyone who didnt [not like me for being me] So I had a lot of friends, I went to the games and shit, just like, I didnt appericiate the school itself, and I hated prep rallies and such, I never did any homework, so over time I had  lost all my school spirit and the teachers were to blame, for intergrating politics and stupid shit into all the classes. Im gonna make a post about this too in fact, it makes me angry.
2	intps are like this too...  I just CANT get into something, show pride, or whatever. I've tried but it feels unnatural. I also can't be a follower of any religion, that also feels unnatural. 
2	Yeah. Company pride, school pride, national pride...Nope, none of that. In fact, all I did when growing up was mock all of the above. I've probably grown up to develope more of a healthy/neutral attitude towards them.
2	Definitely agree. I've just never related to the mob mentality I suppose
2	I think I have a fundamental aversion to tribe spirit, I don't know why.
1	Company pride meh. But when it comes to school or national pride I’m all freakin about it. I loved spirit weeks growing up and I used to hard core represent my sorority (even though I didn’t really enjoy being in it). No idea if it’s a cognitive thing, but I love that kinda stuff. It’s fun. 
1	I first started high school in an Urban place where I had grown up in. I loved it, it was amazing. I loved my friends there and the school pride was wild. Sophomore year though, everything changed. I went to a different school exactly 12 miles away from the last in a less populated place. Went from a 4,000 high school to a 2,000 student high school. \n\nIt. Was. Hell. \nNo student gave a fuck. Pep rally's were basically funerals for freshman. There was a fight every fucking friday (note: my first school was wayyyy more ghetto than this rural one and even then they didn't fight as often as that) And I only had like 2 teachers that were great and actually cared about a positive and fun work environment. At the end of the day my dean hated me (fun fact: that same dean was later arrested for hiring a prostitute but the prostitute turned out to be an undercover cop). \n\nAnyway though, it was a terrible experience. Any school spirit I had was crushed and ended up going to school events at my old school including prom. I should have never transferred. \n
1	I have school spirit when I am directly affecting the school's culture. Being in vital programs and clubs of the school and changing things through it makes me proud of my members and myself.
1	It's always looked like sense of community and group think to me (Fe and Te respectively, once I started learning about those things).  Either way, it's manipulative and, quite frankly, stupid and maybe even a little shallow (but this is coming from someone who has always been on the outside and had to learn that there are things more important than fitting in so any sort of community spirit/pride based activity has always left a bad taste in my mouth, starting with grade school assemblies).  \n\nThe short of it is that I have pride only in my own performance and that of my peers, if they are deserving, not some arbitrary institution that I'm giving my money and / or time to in order to do what I really want to be doing.\n\n--isfp (how do you put flair on your profile? lol.)
1	This is definitely a Ji thing. Individual thinking is a hallmark of Fi and Ti, and pride in a collective is a hallmark of Fe and Te. \n\n
26	Do any of you have an actual solid passion?	I always thought that I personally suffered from switching passions quickly, as a child I would be adamant in becoming a doctor then I wanted to be an actress then a photographer then who knows next.\n\nBut now that I’m older I don’t trust myself to make a decision, because I know I will always change my mind. I have this award-winning idea but lack the energy in executing it or I just get bored and all the wonder of the idea fades. \n\nI feel like most of you ENTPS believe that if we carried our ideas through we could’ve been scholars or millionaires.\n\nI’d like to know if you are experiencing the same ... or settled on your career aspirations/goals/passion to pursue.
50	Learning.
17	27f and still working on that. So far, I know I like cookies.
9	> I feel like most of you ENTPS believe that if we carried our ideas through we could’ve been scholars or millionaires.\n\nIf only I knew how to actually do the stuff I can imagine!  /s
5	Yes, classical piano
4	I have tons of smaller passions that come and go, but my most solid passion is business management. Even then my interest has come and gone substantially over the last 10+ years.
3	I have things that I’m passionate about that stay with me, but I still change interests. Like I love talking politics, but sometimes that isn’t my current passion and I don’t keep up with it. I know when I do go back to it I’ll love it just as much, but it’s not consistent. 
3	I'm 25 and except with music and computer stuff, that changed a looooot ! You should maybe accept this stuff as it is. My family took me for an alien because i'm so changeable and able of the best (or worst) but I don't really care.\n\nI'm only at the beginning of my career/life and i'm focus on the possibilities in front of me, my dreams and what path can I/we give to this planet and society ;)
3	I have a passion for being good at shit and having freedom
3	When I was younger, my interests changed all the time and I also thought I didn’t have a “passion” the way other people seemed to. Now that I’m older, I realize I have “cycles”. I dabble in photography, get bored, move to finance, get bored, read 3 books a day, get bored...\n\nIn my younger years, I thought this pursuit of new hobbies was never ending, because literally everything interested me and all my chosen pursuits were “new”. Now I realize that I come back to some of them - certainly not all - and I dive even deeper. I’ve cycled through enough times that I known what my “real” passions are, and am not afraid to invest deeply and let go when the cycle ends, knowing I’ll come round to it again later. \n\nIt’s also helpful because I can now *choose* where to direct my energy: diving deeper into the list of things I know I’ll enjoy, OR start something new. Sometimes it feels like we’ll never REALLY get good at anything because we run off to the next thing, but now I have the confidence it will work out fine and don’t worry so much about “quitting”.\n\nOddly, we pursue our passions with such intensity, that others can tend to think we have zero direction, but also seek our advice in the areas we have chosen to pursue. This perception of expertise only intensifies once you start to see patterns/cycles in your pursuits. \n\nDon’t be afraid to trust yourself. Make mistakes - they are often labeled mistakes by other types more often than they would be by an ENTP. Every job you have teaches you something new and exposes you to new people and new ideas. For an ENTP, that’s a success. If you’re looking for a degree and don’t want to “make a mistake”, go with something broad like business or marketing that can have many applications. \n\nTl;dr: You’re young and don’t realize that not all your varied interests are one time passions. They’ll cycle over your lifetime and you’ll find a few that really “stick”. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes, and don’t measure your success the same way an xSTJ would. You’re doing just fine. 
2	I was thinking about making a lemon cream cake today. I’m pretty passionate about that right now. If you have friends baking is fun.
2	A passion is something that you can't live without, not a childhood play fantasy which all children have.  \n\nI think most people are lucky to have one passion in their lives...or maybe unlucky because a passion or a calling can cause you a lot of pain when you can't fulfill it. 
2	Skateboarding is my passion,  not something i will probably ever make money doing but it’s like my reason to live. Winters put me into a depression without it haha
2	Continue to learn. For me human psychology was a team but the passion can be, a teacher, advisor, movie director, music producer, poletician etc. Try to find the core of your interst then pick the tools that works to bring what ever passion to life. Eg. if I am singer the music will be injected with psycholgy stuff. Pick fast so you can master it. Pick aleast four or five. No single road for entp. 
1	I’ve been djing for 5 months, I feel passionate right now and I love it and I’m really hoping that it doesn’t become boring like everything else. 
1	i've changed hobbies like underwear through out the years. the last couple of 2-3 years (which is a long lifetime for a hobby of mine) i've been very into working out (hitting the gym and running). that is something i hope to continue with since i need it for my mental health and not only as something "fun" to do. Im very into the science aspect of it anatomy, efficiency in training and nutrition. i love to read about it and apply it in real life, but i must admit i change goals and programs quite often lol... besides that i've been playing league of legends for 3-4 years now? lol. only thing i've been consistent with besides that haha. 
1	My passion is to be a polymath.
1	Nah not really. I like classic rock though 
1	> as a child I would be adamant in becoming a doctor then I wanted to be an actress then a photographer then who knows next.\n\nThat's developmentally normal! It would be weird if you *didn't* do that as a kid.\n\nNow to the present... this:\n\n> I don’t trust myself to make a decision, because I know I will always change my mind.\n\nseems incompatible with this:\n\n> I have this award-winning idea but lack the energy in executing it or I just get bored and all the wonder of the idea fades.\n\n"Getting bored" and "lacking energy" are not the same thing as "changing your mind." Unless I'm missing something.\n\nI think if you develop your Ti and Si—in other words, learn to focus—your interests and passions will become more sustainable.
1	I have a handful of things that I've always loved and been passionate about. I think they key is to keep chipping away at all of them with small goals until eventually you break that success barrier and then you start all over again so you can keep going.
1	Laughing, learning, and lovin’.\n\nI’m a passionate lover and I can’t deny it.
1	I have settled on the capability to make a difference in whatever I choose.  Everything these days needs an app.  I make apps.  I love it.  I am passionate about making good little machines which fit into other good machines and so on.  \n\nI have a lot of other passions and aspirations of course but without the external pressure of career and money I just sort of orbit around them.  Ultimately it doesn't matter.  My core goals rely on career progression and everything else is just fun really.  \n\n
1	Sports.\n\nEver since I was a kid. Active and passive.
1	It's totally ok to change passions. I used to ride motorcycles - 8 years later I am done. Now I bought a mountainbike and a camera. I can be creative and can get out into the nature.... If in 2 years I change - so be it.\n\nCareer is something I am more struggling, but the more I become good at something the better I like it. Just need my freedom and constant learning. That's it.\n\nMy recommendation: Try to do things with somebody / a friend. This stops the constant questioning and also you don't do things in extremis (rage buy or even dangerous ideas)...
1	I get what you mean! I just know I'll get bored so I'm planning my life so I can pursue multiple passions. There are ones that don't fit in though. I've spent countless hours not being able to sleep at night, redesigning how we think about cities and our school system. But actually implementing it seems next to impossible.
1	Songwriting, poetry, short stories, really any kind of creative writing activities are my shit. I'd say i'm pretty passionate about studying psychology and political science/sociology stuff, too, and honestly the social sciences in general. I also play guitar and occasionally sing (not well), but yeah music is a passion for me too. 
14	Does anyone else let their Ti steer their interactions with strangers?	I feel like every time I come across someone new, I am hesitant to use my Ne and be myself around them until I know them better. Is this normal for ENTP’s to psychoanalyze strangers with their Ti before revealing their Ne or am I just a closet INTP?
14	It usually has to do with the perceived status of the individual I'm dealing with. Higher status, Ti. Lower or equal status (or I'm drunk) Ne runs the show.\n\n\nEdit: This makes me sound like some beta-level dweeb. The reality is that Ti helps me identify things I should care about (threats, opportunities). If nothing's found I quickly stop giving a fuck and do what I want.

1	I'm enfp and despite reading a lot I still have no idea how Ni or Ti works\n\nLike, "what's the use of them" or at best "but Ti already does the same thing as Ni!"
1	Yes
4	ENTP/INTP unclear functions results	
5	*kewl...😎you broke it...*
4	I think we should make this into a teen movie
2	I’d probably say INTP just because your Si is higher than your Fe, but it’s just a test soooo
2	Do you figure things out while rambling aloud?  \n  \nDo you ramble aloud with strangers?
0	For me, entp and intp apply the same reasoning but in a different direction. For entp, the whole system under examination comes first, and is then changed/broken down to satisfaction.For intps, the building blocks of the system come first, and the system is built from them. 
3	The process for making various foods by hand (relaxing)	
1	Yeah maybe when I'm an old fuck. For now the first thing I will do after graduating is hiring a cleaner and a cook for a couple hours a week.
3	Need help. ESTJ girl dating ENTP guy	 \n\nhey.\n\nIm new to all this but wanted to get some advice really. Im an estj female in my 30s and have been seeing a entp man for just over 6 months. although its fairly new, the relationship grew quickly and we are exclusive. Neither of us tend to just jump into relationships so i hope that helps understand how quickly we bonded. Like he will often talk about our future, having children, etc. Basically planning ahead for the future including meeting his mum in nyc and i've just spent xmas with his family who have never met a previous gf before as he has been single 10 years. However, on the other hand, was very weird at the start about even holding hands in public, going to his place, going on dates, etc although he spends like 3-4 days of the week at my house.\n\nAnyways, I mentioned to this entp that i really don't like lying and whatever happens always tell me the truth. I felt he was doing this at the very start which was great, then started to feel like he started telling me half-truths or not being fully honest about things. He is pretty secretive about thing too as he considers himself 'private'. I have noticed some holes in some of the stories he would tell me. I also noticed he was flirting and chatting to some girls over FB messenger but lying about it or saying that they have been friends for years (although i know for a fact they haven't). The last convo he has with one girl was asking her 'what her type is' to be her matchmaker but i dont feel he had any intensions of being a matchmaker and just wanted to get some sort of ego boost or know if he was her type.\n\nI feel pretty uncomfortable about all this as i'm very very honest and loyal. I have tried to discuss my boundaries in general and why these are important to me prior to all of this happening so i almost feel hurt by this behaviour as its overstepping my boundaries. I was just wondering if there where any ENTPS do similar things, should i be concerned, and if you have any advice for me?\n\nI really don't want to end up in a situation where I have invested in further to this relationship to find out a few years down the line i've been messed around.
23	I don’t think this has much to do with the guy being an ENTP and more with him being an asshole. If you don’t like how someone is treating you, don’t put up with it. 
5	Someone's 'type' doesn't excuse flaws.  He seems like he's being shady.\n\nWas he taking chicks home during that 10 year single period? 
2	It really varies from ENTP to ENTP, because 4 letters don’t define who you are as a person, it just can help you understand your decision making, and habits. \n\nIm in my early 20’s been with my wife (dating) for 6 years now, married for 2 and a half. I do all I can to be extremely loyal, as she is the only woman I ever truly dated.\n\nThat urge to flirt with other women sure it’s there but you have to learn to get rid of it and I’ve found that when we are good the urge goes away altogether. \n\n\nI’m also the opposite of him. I’m not a private person I’m extremely wide open to the world, too much it pisses off my wife due to embarrassment at what I’ve said before. So that seems weird. \n\nAlso jumping into the relationship so hard and fast could go either way as an ENTP. We tend to keep pushing things along quickly so I can see that. \n\nIDK it’s highly suspect what he said on those chats to other girls and if you feel like that’s an issue then it is an issue. I know... and ENTP saying go with what feel. I mean think about it critically but if one thing I’ve learned with my wife is that their feelings are their perception. Even if it drives me nuts. So that said... if it makes you feel sick, if it concerns you this much to find other help even online, it’s a problem that needs to be resolved or it will eat at you, and no one should have to deal with that. 
1	> Basically planning ahead for the future...\n> as he considers himself 'private'....\n\nI'm wondering if you really have an ENTP there.  We're not exactly planners, frequent dreamers about things like a future family, or very private types, generally speaking. \n\nIt's not to say he's not an ENTP because I realize you're just giving a brief description here as you see him, but those statements struck me as more atypical.  So any "ENTP" advice here might not exactly apply if that's truly the case. 
1	Awww thank you. I actually do feel a little better from all the advice I got here first before confronting so I’m doubting myself a little less than I would have 😊
1	No one could tell you what's going on behind this dudes forehead save himself i'm afraid.\n\nOne anecdote I'd like to add however is that I don't flirt the same way as other people do. The quick jabs, the sexual undertones, the grin, playfulness and what have you is my standard mode, that's how I act with just about anyone in a personal manner (i'm slightly more cleaned up in a work enviornment).\n\nWhen I flirt with someone I want them to see the more serious side of me that I don't show too many people, so what would be a very normal conversation for some is intense soul sharing for me.\n\nBelow are two examples, one's for a friend and one's for a love interest\n\n"Hello hot stuff, what are you wearing? Wanted to go to the Cinema and watch X, but I figured if the movie's boring I can look at you instead through the film, How about 19:30?"\n\n"Hey, thanks for the walk last night I really enjoyed it. Your thoughts on human perspective were fascinating, I'd love to further discuss the topic sometime. Are you free this weekend?"\n\nPurely anecdotal, but what i'm getting at is what you percieve as possibly flirtatious behaviour might not at all be that to him, as for the secrets and halftruths? The world is explored enough that imaginative embelishments only serve to spice it up!
3	Brainstorming tiiime.	So we've a techfest coming up in uni and after a huge mishap with funds for ambience are extremely short on funds. \n\nWhat I'm saying is....do y'all have any cheap ideas for the ambience of a techfest? Stuff we can make with machine scrap that'd not look lame in the daytime? 
2	If you have *some* funds, make friends with LED uplighting. It’s cheap on Amazon and fills a space economically.

10	I want to improve my conscientiousness	I just did the Big5 for the first time.\n\nAnd when I saw how low my conscientiousness, I was like "If I could just increase that number I would be less stressed out overall"\n\nCan it be done?\n\nHow can it be done?\n
4	First, you can’t. Second, even if you could it wouldn’t make you less stressed. Trying to act more conscientious than you naturally are is probably going to stress you out even more.
2	How old are you? Data suggests that as you grow older conscientiousness level increases. To increase your conscientiousness level, from what I've read, just try to be more organised. Plan out your days and negotiate with yourself as to what you want to do. \n\nIf you want to improve your score, you should probably watch videos by Jordan Peterson. He has some pretty good suggestions
3	I think that discipline and hard work are actually some survivor bias bullshit bullying devices. When I took some substance, I actually loved what I was doing (cleaning the whole house) and I hated switching tasks or being smarter at my job because I prefered to just do - I can easily see how what I encountered during that time is a day-to-day reality for many people, of course to a much lesser magnitude\n\nImagine if after that drug fuelled craziness of conscientiousness I said something like "I worked my ass off and you are laying on the couch" - how cruel is that shit when you actually liked the job, it's some asshole bias quite often\n\nAnother example - while reddit definitely shows me how much my english sucks ass, I suppose I have the best english usage in my county in my age range (younger kids start earning at the age of 6, I started at the age of 12 so I can't compare). Yet other people praise me how much hard work I put into this - I put NONE, I just couldn't find anything good to read in my own language so I had to read in english, same with badly localized games. My time (apart from school) spent on memorizing some terms or grammar is probably under 2 hours in 15 years. \n\nThere is no white knuckling it if you are in it for the long term, and by long term I mean a month. And the answer to your question is probably ADDERALL. See, conscie-something has probably downsides too - lazy people may be more likely to improve their methods to be more efficient, while hard working people just get by doing 105% of the norm
1	Before you say something, think about how it will make others feel.
10	Meditation is terraforming for our minds	First off, what is meditation?  Meditation is mindfulness practice.  It is not a relaxation technique.  It cultivates understanding of reality by confronting reality.  It is not an escape from reality.  It is about focus, not emptying of one's thoughts.  If I have you intrigued already, feel free to skip the rest of my rambling and watch this playlist to learn about meditation and start your practice.  The first 3 parts of the series are essential and takes only half an hour.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLvU7ppM4vE&list=PL603BD0B03E12F5A1\n\nI've only taken on meditation for slightly more than a month, but it has already reaped tremendous benefits for me and has resulted in some major lifestyle changes.  The most obvious externally visible ones are that I've quit my 21 year old alcohol habit and who-knows-how-long coffee habit.  Internally, my thought processes seem to go down a different neural pathway - instead of always having an instant reaction to everything, I am slowly developing a more mindful processing of external stimuli.  This results in me speaking slower sometimes, not because I'm more dull, on the contrary, it's due to me processing my responses more.  And if I skip meditation, I go back to my typical too-fast-talking mode where I sometimes have no idea when to shut up.\n\nFor us ENTPs, we can get caught in an almost constant theorizing loop.  And I think this is how my drinking habit took hold.  At first, it was just a social lubricant, but as the years went by, it became a way to dull my consciousness to escape from myself and feel this false sense of "calm" and fun.  Even later, it became a way to drug myself out of having to think about, and therefore, deal, with my processing of negative events or just negative aspects of myself.\n\nMy use of caffeine started very early in life and I can't even remember when it started now.  I would drink Red Bulls or coffee to amp myself up for late night studying, gaming and later, programming.  With my meditative practice, I have now become very sensitive to the effects of caffeine and I can now see that drinking coffee regularly for the last few years contributed a lot to the anxiety that I feel.  Coffee creates this fight-or-flight response, which is why we stay awake.\n\nIt's interesting to notice how the sense of calm in meditators arise.  The calmness doesn't stem from dullness, it's not that we become walking plants or zombies.  The calm stems from this process of relaxed focus and equanimity.\n\nEquanimity, one of my favourite words I have picked up recently - "calmness and composure, especially in a difficult situation."  I used to think of myself as an activist for various causes and environmental activism was one of the causes I used to champion and work for.  But it's hard to deny that in spite of what one, and the entire community does, we are losing this war.  A decade ago, we are merely slipping, and one can see that every year, the statistics don't lie and in whatever way you wish to measure, nothing is improving.  Now, the planet has entered into a new age of a spiral that we won't be able to climb out of.  So how does one deal with this truth?  One of the things that I've read that changed my life forever was [The Dark Mountain Manifesto](https://dark-mountain.net/about/manifesto/).  When I first came across it many years ago, it felt like the most sensible thing to be written on the climate crisis ever.  But, I struggled for many years in putting this knowledge into practice.  I can see now, how meditation can fit into this puzzle.  Equanimity.  The new story we weave begins within ourselves.  We terraform our minds first.  And then, appropriate actions will follow.\n\nStay with the breath.  Rising, and falling.  Acknowledge and smile inwards at your arising thoughts.  Thank yourself for "waking up" and noticing those thoughts.  Return to your breath.  Rising and falling.
5	Meditation is pretty much mandatory for ENTPs if we want to accomplish anything in life without fucking ourselves up on Adderall. Read The Mind Illuminated for proper instructions and work your way to 30+ minutes a day. 
3	What kind of meditation it is when I lie in bed and instantly see some female silhouettes in my mind, get horny and do something with it? :)

2	> Meditation is mindfulness practice. It is not a relaxation technique. It cultivates understanding of reality by confronting reality. It is not an escape from reality.\n\nThree cheers for correcting misconceptions!
1	[http://etimologias.dechile.net/PIE/?med](http://etimologias.dechile.net/PIE/?med) This u may find interesting.
0	My first reaction to the video is that it'll be spiritual bunk, so I went into it with a skeptical eye. Immediately when he says that meditation has a similar origin to medication, that seems suspicious (insofar medication heals body, meditation heals mind). So I dug up their respective etymologies. \n\nMeditate comes from *meditor, meditari* which is Latin for "reflect upon, practice"\n\nMedicate comes from *medico, medicas*, which is Latin for "heal, cured, treat, dye"\n\nThey're different words with different etymologies, and the idea that they share a common *medi-*, and hence a common meaning  is fallacious. \n\nThe rest of the video is pretty bland - it just advocates for meditation (with a buddhist focus). This is something psychologists and western culture has already adopted as part of *mindfulness*. At least in psychological contexts, mindfulness is merely about raising self awareness and being more in tune with your body, emotions, and styles of cognition (for instance, recognizing cognitive distortions, which this monk's style of meditation can't tackle). \n\n> But it's hard to deny that in spite of what one, and the entire community does, we are losing this war. A decade ago, we are merely slipping, and one can see that every year, the statistics don't lie and in whatever way you wish to measure, nothing is improving.\n\nThere's an easy explanation for this as well. The short answer is that a majority of environmentalists and vegans are hypocrites. The number one way to reduce your carbon footprint is [not to have children](https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2017-07/FIXEDcarbon-footprint-reduction-chart.jpg), by a large, large margin. Yet you can see that even in communities like vegan boards, [there is debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/432yth/should_vegans_have_children/). \n\nThat person you see absolutely raping the environment by eating exclusively meat, littering, not recycling properly, and frequently flying, has a negligible contribution to carbon emissions in comparison to a family with one child (let alone multiple children).\n\n> So how does one deal with this truth?\n\nOne way is to give the hypocritical environmentalists a big ol' serving of reason to expose their hypocrisy. 
54	Do you consider yourself a nice person?	Personally, I really do. I'm always smiling, making jokes , trying not to make anyone feel offended ( sometimes I can't resist offending people ).. . I'm also loyal and honest with my friends. I might not be so emotionally supportive at times like if someone starts crying infront of me I would freak out and start sweating because I don't know what is the right thing to say. But it doesn't make me any less "nice", right? \n\n I really believe ENTPs can come across as the nicest people ever. Even if it's merely a "mask" because that's what being nice is IMO .No one is perfectly nice, only some people doing the nice act better than the others.\n\nWhat do you guys think?
63	I consider myself well intended, but not necessarily nice all the time.
33	I think I'm nice with an asterisk. 
22	Other people think I’m a nice person... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
39	Nice, but also very blunt and rude. 
12	Am I a good person? To the core. Am I a nice person? Probably not even close. 
23	Yes. \n\nI’ve dealt with enough jerks in the world that I don’t want to be like that. I’ve had loved ones die way too young to suicide and I’m deeply aware that under slightly different circumstances, it could have been different. And do I really want to have lived a life of being a selfish prick? \n\nWhile it is not my natural inclination to deeply care about other people’s feelings, I make a conscious choice to try to be the bright point of people’s day. Because who knows what they’re going through, if there’s even a .001% chance that my being a jerk was “the last straw” then man, it’s worth putting in the extra effort to be nice.\n\nPlus the nicer you are the people, the nicer they are to you. It’s a win win. 
15	We can work and achieve empathy\n*(In my case almost a dilpilating level)*\n\nBut Sympathy? \nNot so much..
4	I always try to be polite and nice, but my body language is pretty flat so most people probably think I'm being "fake" nice. I just can't be genuine in my words while focusing on how I look when I talk. Which is funny because when people talk to me I listen more to their body language than their words.
3	No because I tell the truth even when it is unnecessary (that’s definition of not being nice). But I always help friends and support them taking perspective on situations and giving it to people to so I’m helpful and understand-full of people wich I think is more important then being nice to then. Just telling the true is more important then being nice
4	Im nice and kind. But I am blunt and speak whatever comes to my mind because I want it to be heard.\n\n&#x200B;
5	No.  I try to be a good person, and I make an effort to be kind, but I shy away from nice.  "Nice" has always seemed fake to me.  Besides, I was being good and kind when I tried to warn my friend that she's dating a legit psychopath, but it was not nice.  She certainly doesn't think I'm nice anymore, lol.
3	My mask is nice, but I am an asshole
3	I’m super nice when you first talk to me. But I’m 1) a female so when I get lost in my thoughts plus my social anxiety gives me the RBF vibe 2) I’m brutally honest so I can come across as rude 3) I’m kind of rebellious and stubborn so that doesn’t mix well with other people. 
3	Nice? No. Good? Yes.
2	I say what I mean and I mean what I say. I don’t sugarcoat and I don’t like to keep my thoughts and opinions hidden. That being said, I can always tell when something is emotionally wrong, but I’m not the best at finding a solution without imploring my Ti and coming across as insensitive to others
2	I consider myself nice. I know I’m not actually very nice but, I see that fact I’m not an asshole to random stupid strangers as me being nice.
2	Sometimes. Depends on the time/person/situation. I can easily tell people to shove it. I can also easily tell people they have lovely eyes and are very smart. But no matter what I say it is always the truth how I see it and that either pisses people off or they appreciate it. \n\nHowever, to answer your question if I think I'm a nice person, I guess I'll have to answer yesi do because when I got a concussion my husband said I went on this rant about how so and so (this ex boss I had) hated me and I didn't understand because I'm nice. Lol so I guess even my concussed brain thinks I'm mostly good. 
1	Yeah, similar. I have gotten smarter about it over the years. Now i realize that anything kind or nice u do for yourself - for self-respect or values, unless u simply act on impulse or guilt, which isn't virtuous, it's just being urself. being "selfless" is mostly Bull. It's nice to love people though because you get the opportunity to help out and talk more, learn new things about ppl , which is what i like\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever in relationships, it's obviously caring about the person and wanting connection / to help
1	I think I am nice, yes. I in general want to help people out and make them happy. Im loyal to my friends. Im not always kind to strangers, but Im not exactly unkind either. Im indifferent. At work, I am bubbly, smiley, good at avoiding conflict, and great at figuring out customer and team member needs and meeting them. \n\nI got an ESTP at work to open up to me about his emotional and mental health issues, and helped him address them and feel better. He continues to approach me for help [and promptly clams up and refuses to talk to anyone else who tries to ask him what we are talking about] so I think I definitely have a trustworthy vibe. Others too at work have opened up to me [though they are less private than the "happy go lucky" estp]\n\nIn general people say I am charming, intelligent, funny, and kind. \n\nStill dont have many friends though, and struggle to get people I want to be friends with to engage with me. I dont know what it is that turns people off to wanting a deeper friendship with me. 
1	I work to actively be a pleasant person but I feel very robotic acting like that if I do it for too long. \n\nInstead of being an asshole, which is what has a tendency to come out when tired, I try to just isolate to get a quick mental charge.
1	I won Mr. Congeniality at my workplace. My non-work friends, my life partner, and even I myself was shocked. 
1	Overall a nice person at the core, yet I have no problem telling someone if their plan to get "rich" and "famous" isn't going to work. I'm blunt enough to come off as an "asshole" to most people, but if they give me a chance and actually befriend me they tend to find that I'm good hearted and overall a nice person.
1	I consider myself the nicest person I have ever known ( you know I am being neutral even about myself)\n\nI am loyal, easy going, just, funny, thouthful, helpful  etc...\n\nHowever people do not focus on these but only see me telling the truth no matter what the situation is and they -in some conditions - expect me to lie with them or act fake but i never lie and they consider this as a bad thing. Telling lies is bad, being direct and true are not.\n\nAlso when i start speaking what i do ( for instance my certain skills on a certain topic) they call me egoist and narcissist but all i do is telling them what exactly i did, just telling the truth.\n\nWhen i come up with an idea about people ( like, you know we read people so fast and easily) they dont like my predication and calling me mean and prejudiced. Again all i do is telling the truth. Then they say you were right.\n\nThats why we born to play Devil’s Advocate because otherwise we would lost our mind against this lack of understanding.\n\nI learned not to care about others’ thought on me. I know that i am a nice person.\n\nI can only be a bad person for bad persons because I quickly reveal their evil in a community and they hate me.\n\nAlso for people who doesnt like to “think” or “have intelligent converstaion”. They aldo hate me.\n\nAlso for people who are irrational and/or too emotinal. They hate me too.\n\nThere are so few individuals in my life who respect me and 2,3 person who think I am a super human ( because of my vast hobbies & talents, because i prefer being super productive to sleep )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
1	Define nice 
1	I think I’m pretty nice, but according to some people I’m a cocky asshole
1	I am a nice person, I can get along with anybody. I do enjoy debating of course, but I never get heated up. Everyone around me sees me as friendly. One thing that does get on my nerves however is how people refuse to acknowledge statistical facts and constantly get offended.
1	Yes, I do. But I can be an asshole sometimes, and it’s something I’ve been working on over the years to reign in. \n\nI also suck at sympathy and I’ve always been the type to fix a problem rather than listen and provide emotional support. I tend to get frustrated when it seems the person isn’t helping themselves but choosing to be emotional, which has gotten me into multiple interpersonal conflicts with people that I only want to help, so it’s something I’m also working on.
1	I try to be nice, and I suppose that's what counts. The ideal scenario is being around friends who you can be an asshole to but in a joking way.\nThe other way around it is taking the side of the underdog and just being an asshole to those who deserve it, but you quickly realise that most people don't deserve it and are only dicks because they have been hurt themselves or they're just brainwashed by the norm (which I'd consider a kind of retardation) 
1	Not really, but others do.\n\nMy tert Fe can do a lot of things, but most of them have at least a bit of asshole to them.
1	Not nice, kind.
1	Not sure if I'd consider myself nice honestly but kind, if that makes sense? \nI'm often very blunt and rude but in most cases I have kind intentions behind it. \n\nIt's like when my girlfriend shows me a drawing she just made with anatomy way off - I'll probably be very direct when telling her and maybe a bit rude but only because I fear sugar coating won't make her realise how bad failed anatomy makes a drawing look? 
1	Externally yes, internally no
1	I'm an asshole that always tries to do the right thing.
1	Yes. And almost everyone agrees with me aside from my ESFP roommate. \n\nBut he's fucking nuts, I've spoken about him here before. 
1	Nope, I'm an asshole. But I'm a sweet asshole.
1	I have two brothers; one is ENTP and the other is ESTP. I have noticed the ESTP is more blunt and rude because Se makes him impulsive. My ENTP brother is polite and well-behaved. However, I am an INFJ so I don't get offended when he argues with me, unlike all the SFs he encounters who think he's being rude when he picks apart what they are saying. With that said, I don't think SFs think my ESTP brother is rude. So I guess it's all subjective...
1	I’m not a nice guy I’m just a good guy
1	I don’t go out of my way to be nice, but I always try to smile to people when I lock eyes with them on the street. I generally try, successfully, to be nice. \nI don’t want to remove more value from the world than i give. Hurting people, especially when it’s done inadvertently, is a useless reason to take away happiness. I also find that it has a positive effect on my own emotional state. It feels great to do good things, and to make others feel better. 
1	If theres benefit to be gain or profit to be made, yes. Other than that i’m only nice to animals.
1	Nice No, But I try to be decent.
1	\nI'm prepared to apologize or have remorse for my actions\n\nI'm prepared to take direct criticism and honestly consider it\n\nBut I do have a harsh tone of voice and a very noticeable inability to give compliments or hold a convo if I don't really mean it or have no interest. I occasionally hold the door open for people, definitely cuss people out here and there, strongly express opinions dogmatically (and responsibly), make sure the ladies are not uncomfortable with my presence when walking home at night etc\n\nSo..... effortful(?) but not necessarily nice
1	I'm kind of a dick. Frankly, I'm surprised so many people want to be around me.
1	I do consider myself a nice person. I won't be mean to someone with no reason (truly mean, we don't talk about teasing here). I do think that life is easier if people are nice to each other, why would we want conflicts? It's tiring 
1	Been described as the nicest/angriest man someone has ever met. Many agreed with the summary haha. 
1	Yeah, I do. I'm not overly altruistic, but overall nice.
1	I flipped off a 10 year old kid yesterday so now I get to think about how terrible I am for that for the rest of my life. Maybe not so nice...
1	People sometimes see me as nice and sweet femal until they get close to me. I am a great human being but nice is not my goal. May be fair, helpful, smart and real. 
1	Naah I don't. Well intended yes but nice maybe not. People find me too direct or argumentative at times,lot of times big picture I see and pros and cons of every argument I seem to find they can't understand where I'm coming from and they find me negative I think but I can't help but point out flaws in an argument and they take it personally. I recently had a heartbroken that could be a contributing factor as well
1	My infj gf says I'm the nicest guy she ever met, then I reply by sending her something that angers her.\n\nIn a nutshell I'm a lovable asshole.
1	Nice to people I’m not close to, good to people who are close to me. Frankly I don’t think it’s worth ruining someone’s day or being rude (in their POV) just to prove a point. \n\nSo people who don’t know me closely assume I’m the nicest person ever.😂 But those who know me closely think I’m a jerk, but they love me nonetheless.
1	I see myself as more Chaotic good than anything else. I have been told that I am unapproachable and basically an asshole until they get past the exterior which I do not allow to very many people. 
3	Dopamine rush	What activities (fe. running, listening to bongo music) tend to give you a dopamine rush?
7	The normal stuff that gives most people dopamine rushes? \n\nRunning, music, painting, reading
3	It's straight forward really. How to get a [dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_(Third_Eye_Blind_album\))  [rush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_%28Rush_album%29)
3	doing coke\n\nbongo music.. not so much.
2	Outside of normal ones, rock carving. And it's less of a rush and more of a constant flow. 
2	Maladaptive daydreaming
10	Finding "the project."	I find myself looking for a long-term project.  Something I can focus on when I have to grind, that has a defined end-point and is actually useful to others in some way.  \n\nI don't think anyone else's answer will necessarily work for me, but how do you determine what to work on for a "grand project?" \n\nHow do you even begin to narrow down the possibilities past having that flash of inspiration that you know "feels" right?\n\nEither way I think I need to work on my first semi-long-term project now as practice for putting in the effort.  So I'm not quite ready to start yet.  But I'd hate to be ready and practiced and then sit around because none of the ideas sound good.
6	For me it's a balance between instant reward and outcome reward. I have a far too many hobbies, but some do not stand up well for enduring long term application for a project. For example, I'm currently creating/mostly created my own language but to focus on that for a year would simply be too dry.\n\nWriting (and for me recording) music offers immediate feedback and therefore instant reward, so aiming for an album's worth of songs is easily done in short bursts whilst still ending with a concrete product.\n\nAlternatively, writing a book is a complete chore, but as Dorothy Parker said: "I hate writing, I love having written." The outcome reward is amazing, the grind is not.
5	I totally understand your ambition because I too longed for the same thing. \n\nI arrived at my current big project through multiple "mini epiphanies". So I think you should expect your first project, which may come to you through a bout of inspiration, to not be your projects final form.\n\nFor myself, I found some YouTube channels were doing a thing that I wanted always wanted to do. There weren't many, but the ones doing it were really popular, however their content was far lower quality than the stuff that I made during my spare time. So suddenly, I was like "holy shit I could become the top dog in this field if I actually pursue this". \n\nHowever, I quickly realised that these other creators weren't making any money from this. So even if I became popular, being successful enough to quit my job & shit was a whole other ball game. So I enrolled in a course to become qualified in a vaguely related field. Now I am currently gaining clients & building a little business that happens to involve the cool thing that I originally wanted to do.\n\nFor reference, my hobbie is filming "virtual treadmill runs" of hiking trails & running races. I'm currently studying to become a personal trainer so that I can start an online personal training business that provides these virtual treadmill runs in addition to gym workouts & training plans etc. This is like 2yrs after my original epiphany. \n\nI spent 4yrs half assing my degree, but with this PT course I actually have a purpose in mind, so everything is different. I'm like a teacher's pet now, it's so weird.
3	Being you, I would pick any idea that sounds interesting, it doesn’t have to feel “right” or that it’s the grand “it”. Practice on that idea, try to break it down to smaller steps and try to see it through. The most important thing, in my opinion, is taking it one small step at a time. Also, sometimes halfway through you may realize the idea is no longer viable - I belive both in cutting your losses or trying to push through anyway. It’s good to try both at some point.
3	I'll chime in. My long term thing is that I want to build my own car(s). I dont just want to modify existing cars but I want to build my own vision from the ground up. I've learned many different skills over the years and still have stuff to learn but in 10 years this is what I want to be doing. 
2	I've done a free online challenge on this topic. It's specifically aimed at the more idealitic people, but maybe individual exercises will help you on your way.

2	Motivation gets fuelled by action so just starting somewhere and seeing where this could lead you might be a good starting point. Accept that finding this one project may take a long time of exploring.

6	Do you think Jordan Peterson is an ENTP?	I have heard this notion floated around a bit. Thoughts?\n\n( Where I heard it from recently, https://youtu.be/XH6-YoEfT5Q at around the 10:09 mark. Though people claiming Peterson is an ENTP is something I have heard mentioned a few times recently from other Dave's Super Powers "Objective" personality followers.)
24	Where did you hear that? He doesn't sound like an ENTP at all. 
12	Peterson uses TeFi. \n\nIf you watch his monologues, he often describes the world in a more carefully calculated and absolute manner than you'd see from Ti users, who are more flexible in their views. In ENTPs, NeTi will often fiddle around with many thoughts and opinions, but rarely will they firmly hold onto ideals. However, Peterson's words usually come out as very "*certain*."\n\nFor example, if you take a few of his quotes from his "12 Rules of Life":\n> [1] “It took untold generations to get you where you are. A little gratitude might be in order. If you're going to insist on bending the world to your way, you better have your reasons.”\n\n> [2] “Intolerance of others’ views (no matter how ignorant or incoherent they may be) is not simply wrong; in a world where there is no right or wrong, it is worse: it is a sign you are embarrassingly unsophisticated or, possibly, dangerous.” \n\n> [3] “So, attend carefully to your posture. Quit drooping and hunching around. Speak your mind. Put your desires forward, as if you had a right to them—at least the same right as others. Walk tall and gaze forthrightly ahead. Dare to be dangerous. Encourage the serotonin to flow plentifully through the neural pathways desperate for its calming influence.” \n\nI could continue copying and pasting lol... But this advice just reads Te - what he's saying stresses a particular way to live that reflects his set beliefs. I'd personally say that his thoughts are more pragmatic than what Ti would argue for.
8	 No, he definitely isn’t. 
3	I’ve heard lots of people claim him as an INFJ, though I’m not sure about that necessarily. He’s very introverted by his own self-analysis— and not everyone who engages in debates is an ENTP. I’m also pretty sure he’s gone on record saying it’s something he doesn’t personally enjoy even though he feels a sense of duty to debate the way he does.
2	Nah
2	INTJ imo
2	All i know about jordan peterson is that he's a cunt who sounded a lot like a nazi in one of his speeches
2	Can we just stop talking about this guy? I see him mentioned like every day on this sub.
-2	Jordan Peterson is obvious INTP. He is on the TI-FE AXIS. When you hear him talk to people that  disagree with him using logic(TI). He then responds to the disgreement with a example (FE).  FE inferiors do that to people just to get them to shut up. https://youtu.be/mTCXgL5e6Ac
17	What do you guys think of Ben Shapiro?	Do you guys think he’s correct on a lot of his views? What do you dislike/like about him? Pretty curious what you guys think of him.
35	The only thing I'm certain about is he's a grifter.\n\nAs far as his character,  I've known a lot of Ben Shapiros in my day and every last one was annoying to argue against because they would always redirect to bad-faith "gotchas."\n\nIt's like arguing with the high school "actshually" kid.  They're just arguing so they can try to show off how "smart" and "logical" they are.
31	Smart but way too conservative and litigious imo. Good debater as in the skill of debating and winning an argument. More like a lawyer than a logician if you know what I mean
24	I think he's right about some things, wrong about others, but overall I find him hard to listen to and generally speaking find him annoying so I don't listen to him much.
14	Intelligent ESTJ. Makes a lot of rational Te based analyses on the current political climate, but often has super rigid and blind Fi opinions. Sometimes that function combination will become annoying when he’s arguing a point and just defaults to authority. \n\nPersonally, I believe he’s interesting to listen to because his thoughts challenge the current liberal culture. However, I support a moderate view, and he’s a grounded right-winger, so I don’t really follow his extreme conservative views. \n\n\n
6	I asked him a question in person and wasn't satisfied with his response. Granted, he's an alright guy and a solid conservative speaker. 
4	Fiscally on point, socially a staunch douchebag.
5	I don’t believe in most of what he thinks is correct, but I constantly find myself watching dumb YouTube compilations of him. The way he controls every debate he’s in is astounding- and quite admirable.
2	Smart, bases most of husbands opinions on emotional, irrational moral priors, prideful and irritating, good debater.
3	ben shapiro is extremely high levels of epicsauce awesomesauce for the win. if you think his voice is grating just download the audio and drop it down an octave in audacity, and maybe add some echo if you want it to have an added layer of mysterious darkness and enchanting mystic sage wisdom (that's what i do)\n\nto be frank, i think he's actually just a boring neo conservative who is good at manipulating a conversation to his favor to 'win'. i've noticed the same thing with Stefan Molyneux, where he has moments of these bad faith debate tactics.
4	I think he’s an ass, and pay him no mind.
3	Brilliant. Extremely well read and educated, plays devils advocate well but seems to understand both sides to most arguments and tears down most opponents relatively easily. Very sharp guy. U? 
1	Like most of the comment before: he’s a damn good debater. Even if i don’t agree with some of his till watch and analyze how he control the conversations. He’s very talented at what he does even if his voice sounds like he just inhale a lung full of helium its still fascinating to listen to him. Again, i disagree with some of the stuff he says but a good tactician is still a good tactician no matter which army he belongs to.
1	Lolz Ben...\nHe definitely looks good debating against the moronic "intelligentsia" that show up to his events (apparently mostly idiot college kids). He would not do well in debating anyone very qualified. Fortunately, for the present moment, there is no one on the left with anywhere near the intelligence/knowledge/oratory required to debate him, except perhaps Chomsky. But all of this doesn't matter. He makes a lot of money doing what he does, and although he may not even fully understand his conservative arguments, the actual practical courses of action suggested by them are known to work, as opposed to pretty much everything that everyone else in this comments section/the internet/the msm probably believes. It's very dangerous to have people who actually believe that they understand things in positions of real power. Shapiro is a TJ, thus TE, thus heuristic thinking, thus things actually working.\n\nP.S. in re Shapiro's TE — I assume all his values have been derived by TE type experimentation, rather than arguments. He is certainly very proud of his religion, but I happen to know that he is almost perfectly biblically illiterate, can hardly pronounce Hebrew, and knows very little of any of the the rest of the Jewish religious corpus. Unlikely that he derived his opinions on abortion by reading the Talmud. He also has very poor understanding of philosophy, as anyone who listens to him lecture on the subject can readily discern.
1	#NEXT\n\n#MEME
1	His arguments are so strong. Whether you agree with him is not the point, the question is are his arguments valid.
1	He’s incredible at winning debates. I also respect that he uses statistical evidence to back up his claims. Sometimes tho he takes on fights for no reason, an example being responding to something random on social media.
1	He's sharp. Knows how to hold his own in a debate. I don't strongly like or dislike him.
-1	Give me a fucking break. He’s an extremely smart man who knows politics inside and out. If his intelligence annoys you then maybe you aren’t that intelligent
7	Seems like its impossiable to get over the loss of a relationship or romantic failure?	I found myself trying to find a reason to talk to a girl I thought I loved again, wandering around and finding exuses to see them, but Im sure they dont want to do anything with me anymore. This time I couldnt say anything to them and I walked away fighting a depressive episode, does this happen to anyone else and please for the love of god how do you fight it?
9	I have found I tend to get stuck on past relationships if it was a bad ending for me, and I’m not sure why. My ego, most likely. Overthinking everything.\n\nThe best way to get over it is to find someone else, honestly. I didn’t get over one of my exes until I developed feelings for someone else, and then that ex and everything I was hung up on sort of faded away into oblivion, and I realized I wasn’t really hung up on her I just had too much damn free time in my head to ruminate. Replacing my focus on something better and healthier made it all vanish, but only then.
4	Read or listen to "The Rational Male" by Rollo Tomassi. Hell, do it two or three times.\n\n That book single-handedly cleared up any relational problems I had: past, present, and future. It'll change your whole worldview. 
4	I know this situation, but I think in my case it's more of trying to cling to the image I created, and it will always end up a failure this way. It's just that the chance of meeting someone to truly get me, understand my mind and love me for who I am is really small, and every romantic failure reminds me of it,and I think that's the reason I can't get over it 
4	How old are you?  \n\nYou said you "found yourself" doing it.  I assume you weren't conscious that you were doing it in the moment?  \n\nOr did you choose to give in, and now regret it?\n\nThe only way I've found that works is find something else to occupy your mind.  I've never figured out how to kill the infatuation, only starve it so it's mostly dormant.
3	I have gotten over sooo many relationships and failures, and here I am, still standing. Friend: it is possible. 
1	I am in the same boat right now, last semester was pretty bad just due to mental health issues and I got really close to a guy for 7 days, 7 fucking days, and then it ended cause we’re better as friends and I probably had too many issues for him and regardless, I wish him well and I’m pissed that I keep thinking of him but I can’t go back to someone who doesn’t appreciate me for me. \nThat’s hard to say, I’m still working on self love, but I need to love and respect myself enough to not go back to someone who already missed their chance with me. \nSo, I say the same to you. No guarantees it’ll work. But at least if you think of her you can just shake your head at what she’s losing out by not getting to know you better and move on. The world has 7 billion people, there’ll be others. Good luck. 
12	Lean/Agile and The Ideal ENTP Workflow	I am looking for comments from ENTPs involved in startup spaces who know more about the Lean and Agile methodologies. I am very interested in the best ENTP workflow. For me, some of this includes:\n\n* ENTPs work by obsession - short bursts of amazing creativity, conviction and energy. Consequently, we should focus on getting a 'minimum viable product' out for whatever we do as quickly as possible, and then edit/refine/communicate once the 'high' is over.\n* ENTPs are logical - we the best think is to test subsets of our ideas against reality and then fully buy into that, instead of what people say about our ideas (usually hating).\n* ENTPs are empathetic - in the sense that an innovator understands the *needs* of people, even if they might be cooky/antisocial. Start with 'empathy' to give your ideas a context. Most ENTPs aren't that empathetic, but are more empathetic than they are 'pragmatic'.\n* ENTPs are simplistic in details - we don't have a preoccupation with details except those that really stand out (inferior Si).\n\nWhen I read about things like 'sprint' (work really hard on a core goal for a week), lean, design thinking etc, it matches with my personal experience in what works for me as an ENTP.\n\nWhat  do you guys think? 
7	The reason I sometimes stay simplistic with the details is because once I try to focus on them, they just grow into another big idea and pretty soon I’m overloaded with too many.
2	I agree. Our R&D department is led by 2 ENTPs and we basically run our development team in an agile manner.
2	I agree wholeheartedly.\n\nI have used some of these frameworks/methodologies formally in the workplace, but always found time-boxing constraining. If the product has optimal value in 4 days, I don’t want to find myself with a spare day before I can move on to the next iteration - likewise, if optimal value takes 6 days I don’t want to be forced to cut corners and carry a debt to resolve in a future time-boxed sprint. I want to focus on doing things in the optimal way without the constraints of time - which a lot of people like to organise themselves around religiously, even when it doesn’t make sense and they don’t need to,\n\nIn general, I think most things are improved with a framework and I apply that thought to things that others would find bonkers.
1	As long as you don't have a manager who's very controlling / always in your space about what you're doing, it's dope.
1	Agile works quite well for holding people accountable and not wasting too much time with useless meetings. The sprint system is effective and daily scrum sessions work alright. 
1	I love Agile, it keeps me encouraged to finish what I'm working on instead of moving to the next thing (ticket based system). Daily Scrum is annoying though.
3	(Survey) Relationship Between Personality Type and Drug Use	
5	What was the point of us telling you our type if we can’t even see what each types drug of choice is?
1	I smoke a lot of weed. Not as much as my STP and NFJ friends though.
9	What does it take for you to end a friendship with someone?	Not the “get bored of the other person” type of ending where things just sort of fade away, but intentional, blantant cutting of the ties? I haven’t really seen a lot of ENTPs who do this, and they tend to give people way too many chances.
15	Once I’ve come to the conclusion that the issues I have with them aren’t fixable, that they don’t care about their own growth, that they have made it clear these issues are now part of their identity, and when all of these issues impact everyone around them in a negative way. When they start fucking others over is when it really happens. All of those in combination with each other is exhausting.\n\nThis has only happened like twice for me because it’s really difficult for me to get to that mindset, lol. It’s also hard to keep me caring enough to actually keep them out of my life. ESFP and ISFJ were the types.
13	1/ Negativity. I would let them go easy in this case.\n\n2/ Disloyalty. Mainly when my friend isn't honest with me and talk shit behind my back with ill intentions. I either ruin his life or confront him without causing much drama which is usually the case.\n\n3/ Finally, I hate when being told what to do. If a friend tries to control me and force me into doing things or doing things his way then it would usually end in a conflict and us splitting.\n\nI really don't have very high expectations for anyone that's why I'm rarely disappointed and letting go people can be easy at times and when it happens I can forgive easily.
3	If someone is overly narcissistic, or generally rude, or has made decisions I have warned against of don't agree with, I typically distanced myself, but maintain some level of contact, usually requiring them to be the initiator.\n\nBut to completely cut things off with someone, they would have to harm, threaten or be blatantly disrespectful to me or someone close to me.
3	Personally it takes a lot for me to cut someone off, but when I do it’s for good. There are no second chances. My father and I are very close, and if you speak ill of him you are not going to be in my life. I won’t even tell you why, I won’t try to stop you, in that exact moment every ounce of care I have for you is gone. I also cut off people I consider to be toxic. If I feel like I’m a worse person when I’m around you or I feel like you’re holding me back by bringing me down, you’ve gotta go. If I find out you speak poorly of me behind my back, you’re gone. I’ll be civil if I see you, but we won’t be friends. 
3	Lies. Lies are probably the only thing that makes me drop someones ass in the blink of an eye. \n\nDrama Queens too. Like I get it, there's drama everywhere every now and then but if I get dragged into some kind of unreasonable drama every second weekend I'm out. 
3	1. When I can't be sure of them - they constantly cancel plans, don't do what they said they would, they aren't reliable \n2. When they make we feel like a total weirdo (in negative way) and I feel like I can be no longer myself around them \n3. If we clash on some important ethical aspect (like for example they'd be homophobes or racists) - two ways here. One, they stop themselves from making any negative comments on this topics, don't insult anyone because of it and generally keep quiet on it, and I try not to project my views on them. Two, I cut them off.
2	Consistently being an asshole, no regard for others at all unless it somehow benefits them for the moment. I’ll drop your ass on a dime and forget you ever existed if you act that way. 
2	Behavior I'd consider deeply immoral without showing true remorse (I'm talking rape, torture of animals, that sort of thing).
4	Toxic, unreasonable behavior that includes being abusive to myself or others. \n\nI don't care how abstract, awkward, smooth, quirky, weird, normal a person is, but being hateful and acting on it, is a friendship ender. 
1	They are insecure about things that they should be secure about because I told them to do so and I dont lie. They prove to me constantly that our friendship means shit. If I want a conversation, I have to pop up. They never do so
1	Their effect on my mood. If I feel like absolute shit after I hang out with someone, you bet your ass I'm going to stop hanging out with them. 
1	Oh. It takes too much time. I can't tolerate the following,\n\n1. Telling the same problems over and over again. I tolerated those for months. One relationship and one friendship ended. Really toxic people.\n2. Telling lies. One relationship ended, I thought about it for one month. I just don't care lies that my friends tell if they are just for once.\n3. Bullying me, yelling at me in public. No one has the right to do that. I counter bully them. One friendship ended in a harsh way. I tolerated for several weeks.\n4. Lack of any fidelity. Social circles are always changing, but it is so great to call old friends to meet up for once or twice in a year. Simple birthday celebrations or "Hey, what's up buddy?" texts are also enough. However, my friend asks help from me and he/she does that over and over again, then he/she becomes an old friend for me with just good memories and nothing more. It depends on the situation that how much longer I can tolerate this situation.
1	They either: \n1. Hold me back from achieving my goals\n2. they waste my time/energy or purposefully frustrate me w/ no attempt to fix their behaviour.\n3. They complain about their fucking lives/problems and have no ambition to change it\n
1	Physical assault. One of my "best friends" hit me one time, not really even badly, but that was enough.
1	I rarely force myself to dump people and be an asshole that ignores them. I'm more of a person, that passively ghosts people and makes them forget about my existence with barely noticing that.\n\nI mostly cut the ties with people, when I do feel that the friendship is good for nothing or is exhausting to me. Also when people act like scumbags or pushes me to act like such, and have unbearable attitudes. Occasionally, I cut the ties with others because of them forcing their own political views, whiteknighting, and sexism/feminism.

2	Can I get a TLDR? 
15	How to get past addiction	I am addicted to porn currently and want to know if there's any ways specific to entps to overcome addictions
15	Oof that's a rough one.  I've always conquered my addictions cold-turkey style.  If I try to ease out or give in just a little, I fall all the way.  I am a weakling in that regard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: my addictions usually aren't as strong as a porn addiction.  That one actually can produce more extreme neurochemical addiction effects in the brain.
5	man just everytime you want to watch porn,  put 2 girls 1 cup .\n\nplot twist: you only watch 2 girls 1 cup hahah jk
3	Just like everything else. You don’t quit one day. You have to decide to quit everyday. Everyday is another opportunity to overcome.\n\nI have a very addictive personality. So far I’ve quit Cigarettes, Alcohol, soda. It’s not easy. You have to decide over and over why you want to quit. Why you don’t want to give in. What you want out of life and how your addiction is holding you back.
4	Please clarify what you consider being addicted to porn. Just curious.
2	I've battled the same problem as you for years and years. I first discovered porn at a very young age and didn't think anything of it, but once I got older I realized it had been this weird crutch I would use anytime I was bored or wanted some kind of stimulation. \n\nDon't listen to anyone saying looking at porn is not a big deal; it is. Sure, masturbation on its own is fine and healthy, but unfortunately once you've developed a porn addiction, those two kind of go hand-in-hand together. The problem with porn, in my own experience, is that it desensitizes you to real world stimulation and kills your drive to find sexual partners. Sure, if they fall in your lap that's one thing, but why go through "all that effort" (and it is effort) when you can just open your browser and suddenly have instant access to your biggest fantasies with the most attractive women willing to do anything on camera that you'll never have a chance with? I would purposely avoid sex with my girlfriends during my addicted times because my sex drive was fucked up.\n\nFor me, I also find that the desensitization I experience really kills my ability to have a 100% strength erection without looking at porn. It doesn't make me impotent, but when I'm actively looking at porn, most girls I sleep with can only give me a 60-70% erection and then I have to close my eyes imagine the latest hot scene to orgasm. That shit is not healthy, and I'd be curious to know how many porn defenders (men) can honestly say they don't visualize their favorite scenes when they're sleeping with a woman. Once I reach a month or longer without looking at porn, I'm back at 100%, sometimes cumming and going right back at it again for seconds. The whole experience is just way more exciting, and I'm way more lustful and captivated by it all.\n\nEveryone has their own opinion on the matter, but having been in your position (and still battling it daily) for the last 10 years, I can say I'm pretty experienced with this. \n\nHere is what has worked for ME:\n\n1) Cold turkey or nothing. Once the dam breaks you're fucked and it's back to the start.\n\n2) It might not be a "healthy" approach, but I've always found the ONLY way for me to kick-start my porn-abstinence is to decide when I'm ready to quit, and just go crazy on that day. I'll jerk it like 6 times to the point that it's not fun or exciting. The purpose is that on the following few days I have no impulse to do it. If I can make it past the first 2-3 days, the rest are a lot easier. If I don't do this, trying to stop without "overdoing it" just leads me be thinking about it a lot and I usually cave on day 2 or 3.\n\n3) Don't bother blocking websites, you'll find a way to reach the images or videos no matter what.\n\n4) Talk to your friends about it (if you can). Me and one of my friends challenge each other to see who can go the longest without breaking the streak.\n\n5) Date girls. I have wayyy more motivation not to masturbate if I know I will be seeing a girl in a few days and I want my performance to be optimal.\n\n6) Don't masturbate at all. Like I mentioned before, once you have an addiction the two go hand-in-hand. You might get a good wank or two in without porn, but pretty soon it'll be consuming your mind as the two are intertwined in your brain. Plus, once you stop masturbating it usually helps you have a healthy sexual life, which defeats the need to masturbate.\n\nAll in all, I've found in my personal life that once I stop masturbating, girls pick up on it. It gives me confidence and I feel like I have more "life force" or whatever. There is definitely some kind of pheromone reaction or something, similar to how experiments have shown that a mouse who is getting laid is more attractive to other mice. I think it is similar with masturbating, such that once you stop, you become more attractive in the eyes of women. Don't ask me how it works, but I've been watching this play out in my own life for 10 years as I combat this addiction, fail, and combat again.\n\nGood luck, you're not alone!

1	Are trying to quit porn only or fapping too?
1	This isn't answerable through an MBTI lens, because it was never designed to tackle addiction. Go to /r/nofap (as much as I think that sub is ridiculously stupid, it allegedly helps some people addicted to porn, which to my understanding is one of their alleged mission statements). Look up if there are any local meetings for porn addicts. But above all, therapy is key. 
1	Ti = know why it's objectively dumb to do it. If Ti says: "it's fine and healthy" then why would you stop? If Ti says: "it's stupid and unhealthy" then maybe you can stop?
-1	If you are at the stage where you want to quit then all you have to do is believe you can quit
0	Firstly, write every "action". I use notepad file in start menu autostart folder, so it's opened every time. Looking at these you can see improvement.\n\nSecondly, dont browse for it online, download some pieces - you will eventually get used to them, less excited with them and watch them less
14	Have any of you guys ever cheated on someone before?	I see a lot of people saying that for ExTPs are more likely to cheat than others...do you agree with this? Why or why not? Just wanting to head your side. What were the circumstances?
23	I avoid getting into relationships that would end up in me getting bored and cheat. I have an ESFJ that is all over me. I like her, but I'd rather not go through the shitshow of getting bored and moving to another person. I think I would also just break up with the person I'm with if I get to cheat. I see no point in keeping an ongoing relationship with someone that you are not fully into. It's either a fuck yes or a no.
16	Never, had two exes accuse me of cheating when I broke up with them. They were... stunned that anyone could actually break up with them because they were dissatisfied with them as people.\n\nIt takes a lot to push me to break up with someone, but when I finally make up my mind it's done. I have no problem telling them. No need to cheat.
42	I don't really see the point of cheating. \n\nIf I told someone we're exclusive, I'm going to honor that commitment. If I'm no longer feeling the relationship, I'll just break it off before doing anything with someone new.
11	I concur with everyone on the ‘whats the point’. I’d also add that it’s immoral, the epitome of deceitful, and almost every word in the book. It’s a horrible thing to do to someone and so ruthlessly inconsiderate. If you cheat you clearly have no principles or sense of higher self and you’re a top notch piece of shit.\n\nI’d venture even further to say I wouldn’t ever fully trust a cheater let alone allow them any emotional vulnerability. It seems they have some proclivity to pursue such a thing, and even if they developed principles after - why bother with someone who is inherently higher risk. Let them date the other cheaters n turds\n\nEDIT/TL;DR: if you cheat your mate credit score is downgraded significantly. You’re rejected from a loan on ma heart and anyone with any sense should probably do so as well.
9	I couldn’t have imagined cheating before. I was like you all “Why wouldn’t I just break up with them first?”\n\n\nAnd then I found myself in an abusive relationship with my child’s mother who intentionally hid all of her narcissistic tendencies from me and later admitted to it once she got pregnant, because she was “scared of losing me.”\n\n\nThink about that. You date for a year, and they get pregnant and follow that news with “I’ve been lying to you about everything,” literally. That is how she said it. What followed was an extremely entitled and manipulative pregnancy where “hormones” and “mom brain” was used as an excuse to call me “worthless” and “a pussy” for objecting to outrageous demands.\n\n\nI thought I could last long enough for the first couple of years of my kid’s life just to secure a stable home long enough to deal with the hardest parts of parenting (hundreds of doctors’ appointments and special needs issues) while just weathering the worst manipulation and emotional abuse for the kid’s sake until things were stable enough for me to kick her out without worrying about hurting the child during their most delicate time.\n\n\nBut then someone showed me affection completely out of the blue, and I went for it immediately, and it was... amazing. It honestly gave me the strength to keep up the charade. She found out, and I acted contrite, but I honestly never felt guilty about it. She pretended that it hurt her feelings so that she could wield it against me like a cudgel for the next year (but really she felt relieved that now she had an excuse for her awful treatment of me). I honestly hated her, and she knew it, but reveled in the position of power it gave her.\n\n\nOne day almost two years later she came home, upset about a problem that she invented because she just wanted someone to put down after an unsatisfying day at work, and the lightbulb went on in my head. “Today is the day!” I thought “I made it!”\n\n\nIt was glorious.\n\n\nI will never cheat again, but only because I will NEVER find myself in that situation again. My ability to spot abusers has never been more keen.\n\n\nI will say that cheating is bad, and I don’t condone it, but it’s worlds better than putting a gun in your mouth and leaving your children to be raised by an abusive narcissist.\n
14	I once cheated on myself by dating a girl. 
12	I’d actually like to make the claim that ISTPs are cheaters. \n\nFunny how people always make promises they never keep.... shout-out to u/ba4nell. It was really great watching the ends of all our Netflix shows *alone* after you promised that you wouldn’t watch ahead each time we started a new one. 
9	Personally, I think that I would probably break up with someone I wasn’t happy with before I would get the chance to cheat. I just idk...don’t see myself really hanging around someone once I get sick of them to the point that I would fuck them over that hard.
6	I never have, and never will, cheat on a partner. I am extremely loyal, and it goes against what I believe in.\n\nBut I have been the home-wrecker that’s cheated *with* someone, and felt no remorse.
10	why the fuck are people downvoting commenters 
10	actually i think that Fe doms or aux are more likely to cheat because they don't want to offend the other parties
8	Physically - once when I was 14, got very close to kissing a friend. Came clean to my boyfriend the same night.\n\nEmotionally, more often. I tend to go in self-denial mode when that happens.\n\nThese days, I no longer do monogamous relationships. So those problems are solved.
3	No and I very highly doubt I would ever do that. If I could get away with it, I would kill most cheaters I encounter.
6	Yes. \n\nThere was an opportunity. I didn’t want to miss out. 
3	Why are we more likely to cheat?
4	I'm technically cheating on 2 people right now
5	Nope.  I'm against cheating.  I'll break up with someone first.
4	We either cheat or break up to not cheat. 
2	I haven't been cheated on myself as of yet, but my sister cheated on my brother-in-law and I cut her out of my life completely. You really can't trust someone after they... break... trust... \n\nShe also has a long history of lying and manipulating even within our family (me and the other sibs). Truly a class A narcissistic piece of shit. \n\nIt really should not take half a thought to break ties with someone when they display themselves as deceitful and manipulative with no morals.
1	Yee, was in a toxic relationship in high school. She cheated on me, so instead of just breaking up with her I revenge cheated. We were off and on for a while, then got back together, then kept cheating on each other until I finally broke up with her just after our 3 year anniversary. That relationship definitely poisoned my view of commitment and I haven't had a LTR since (23 now).\n\nIt's heartening to see the other comments in here, seeing some people still have values. It seems like in my circles everyone cheats, so it's nice to see some people are still capable of secure attachment. 
1	I like the idea of not cheating but realistically I have. Now I only enter into non-monogamous relationships. 
1	Loyalty and integrity are two of my highest valued attributes. I cant stand spineless people. I believe I have been cheated on at least in two of my relationships so far and that's probably the quickest way to burn the bridge.
1	If anything I'd say other types are more likely to cheat with ExTP.\n\nI don't agree this is true and speaking modestly as an ENTP we are loyal motherfuckers and would rather pass up sex and almost anything else for that matter, than betray a valued partner in crime/real friend.  We will definitely toy with the idea but hardly ever expel any energy to act on it, the loss of dignity wouldn't warrant it 9 times out 10. \n\nMy principals usually don't allow me to betray people or do something really devious without proper cause, which isn't easy to achieve, trust me! I hate being manipulated but get a huge ego kick out of being chased/desired and turning them away or not complying and ignoring them for my own ventures/friends. Turned down ALOT of chances to cheat and even more opportunities of seduction/intimacy/sex in favor of my own interests. \n\nWont even get into a relationship until after a long vetting process, which most show their crazy-side or give up before finishing.. Next.\n\nNot keen on responsibilities like keeping a dirty secret that could be used against me later on.. and never really got hint's or appreciated them. I prefer a challenge and I'm all about that chase and adventure. \n\nOnly once when I was 21 and had a fight with my partner just before I went overseas did I cheat. Was pretty annoyed at them and it was assumed they had been infidel in this fight. Needless to say a couple weeks gave them ample time to come up with a good excuse(and then some), which I oddly enough, didn't deconstruct and error check rigorously, at all.. . That was quite early in the relationship too might I add, barely scratching post-honeymoon phase. At risk of seduction exploiting Ne opportunistic impulses when we are stressed I guess. \n\n\nOn the flippidy flip side been cheated on heaps! Infact all my LTR's have ended like that I think. All-though that might just be apart of being a male these days and the state of society, it's like a hypergamic mine chamber I tell ya! \n
147	Have you ever stepped back and realised how lonely you really are?	Not just from an intellectual point of view, more like for example, sitting in a bar with your friends and realised that you’re not actually paying attention to anything they’re talking about.
86	Yes.  That's how I spent the majority of my teen years.  Not fun.  In my old age I make a point of NOT stepping back, and allowing myself to live and be and enjoy a good moment in life.
42	Yes. I am an extroverted person, but only with purpose. Small talk, gossip, mundane chat...it takes a great deal of effort for me to engage and afterward I feel very, very tired. If, however, I'm with people wh ok are fuxking goofy and like to talk wild shit about anything and everything, I can enjoy myself. I just never meet people like that. There are a lot of people that I associate with who become upset with me because I sometimes just leap directly off the radar. No FB, no texting, no messenger or Viber or phone calls...nothing. I'd rather read about black holes, or find new controversial subreddits where I can try on new ideas, or duck around with new painting techniques. I wish I had friends where I could just call them and throw out a fucking batshit thought and say: "DISCUSS." Or they could call me and do the same! Instead it's all: "So what's happening in liiiiiife," which is tolerable if we're theorizing about Jenny's boss's motivations for saying the weird thing, or if we're analyzing pros and cons of Sally marrying Pete, but getting to that point requires so many tedious steps from uninteresting prattle, to more focused prattle, to localized points, to bla bla. \n\nOnce j get INTO talking to people it's ok, I find the rapid readjustments exhilarating! And when I MUST talk to them, I kind of "turn it on" and I become an acrobatic socializer. I just would rather d ok something else most of the time. 
32	All the time, especially at parties lol, that shit sucks.
17	I love an existential crisis.\n\n&#x200B;
14	It's best to run away from this thought at full sprint. 
11	I'm at this exact point in my life. I'm 34, have a wife, two young kids. In touch with my closest, albeit weird family. Have dozens over dozens acquaintances I know personally. I've never been so lonely my entire life. I feel no connection with anyone. Except one person, which I can't be in touch with. A long and sad story.
8	I used to feel like this, then I trimmed off all the fat. With the select few relationships I still maintain, I never feel this way. Always enriched by their input.
7	All the time, i just stopped focusing on building anything with most people and see it all as a neccesity to get more of what i want, i socialize out of potential, i use potential as to why go out with people is not about the people i go out wtih but about those i may met.\n\nWhat they may hold, any girl i met what may happen with them, what kind of things the future may have in store, i feel no attachment to most people whatsoever and i despise the dread of the same old faces, i dont need familiarity or comfort i need possibilitys, so ill go out jut because of that, sometimes i need to remind me of it all. In social interactions i focus on the potential as a means not to get bored,whay may happen if i do this or that, what may happen if today i decide to do this, what kind of interesting people ill met?. \n\nIm extremely utylitarian regarding this matters, which acts as a motivator to be focused when needed, if no i turn on automatic mode and not really pay atention to those around because is dreadfull.
6	Could you not do this to me right now? I’ve been a potato for two days and don’t need an internal crisis at the moment. 
4	Things have changed dramatically after 30. 
3	I'm aware of it, but I don't consciously focus on it. It's not a *huge* problem as far as I'm concerned, but a problem I'll fix eventually nonetheless.
3	Yes, especially when I'm in the midst of a depressive episode.
3	Yeah I’m like that sometimes too. Usually with people I don’t know too well. I’m not good friends with people I wouldn’t have good convos with since I have high standards lol. \n\nBut I get what you mean. It’s like sometimes everyone else seems to talk about things that aren’t inspirational. I like staying in the idea realm. If I’m fired up about a topic, it’s generally some awesome new idea or theory. But most people like to talk about sports, entertainment or the sorts. It bores me, especially when no one has anything new to say.
3	Seeing this comment section from the outside should probably lead to the instant conclusion of being a sociopath.\n\nAlso yeah i can definetely relate. 
3	Yes, and I don’t mind because I’d rather be a strong independent individual than just someone who talks.
2	Yes. A breaking point in my life. Loneliness to me is just a word for withdrawal from societal addiction.
2	Yes cause the great majority of people don’t really think about anything of great consequence. Small minds. I don’t want to live on this planet anymore.
2	That’s why I don’t do friend groups. I’m mostly not interested in the topic or I don’t bother to make a comment. I am a very talkative person tho, so that upsets me,
2	In the past. Right now, I have this really amazing group of friends. I had a rough week and they were there for me so much. I love them. 
2	Also whenever I imagine something I start to feel emotions that I would feel in this situation   
2	All the time.\n\nStill haven’t figured out how not to.
2	For me the opposite. I think that because i dont really engage in small talk and gossip that im more solitary than i think. But when i look at the bigger picture i realise that i get along well with nearly everyone i know. 
1	Yes.....*sigh*
1	While I am often alone, I dont find myself particularly lonely. Why? Internet.
3	Who do you get along with best in your family (including extended)?	Just wondering who you guys get along with the best out of all of your family members? What do you think makes them the ones you get along with best?
1	There is *a lot* of Fi in my family, and I honestly think out of my idk...40-50 family members (cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, sisters, parents) I am probably one of maybe two or three NTs. \n\nSurprisingly, my ESFJ aunt and I get along really well. I’ve never met a woman who is so driven, ambitious, dedicated, and genuinely wants to understand people more than she does. We just click really well. Typically I can’t really stand a lot of ESFJs because I feel like I am one slip up away from being part of a gossip train. \n\nI also get along really well with my ESTP cousin. He helps me push myself to really “live”. We went skydiving last year and it was great. I really admire his will to just do whatever he wants without becoming a complete fuck up.\n\nI get along well with my INFJ cousin (although our friendship only really recently started to actually take hold and I do think INFJs are literally useless 😉), and also my INFP cousin.\n\nI would say the one I get along with the least is my ISFJ cousin. God, I just cringe every time works come out of his mouth. I also don’t really get along with my ESTJ cousin who is like 45 and dominates conversations. Can’t stand him. \n\nIt’s weird because although I get along with them best, I’m often hanging out with my ENFP, INFP(different one), and ISFP cousins but our whole entire relationship feels a bit superficial...sort of like they’re just entertainment or something. 
1	My mom and sister my mom is ENTP and sister INFJ 
1	I get along well with my INFP mother and ENFJ brother best.  Mom is sometimes annoying because she's stubborn as heck, and my brother gets sooooooo wrapped up in his own internal drama, but overall we jive pretty well.  I go through spats with dad (INTP).  Sometimes we get along really well, and sometimes we get annoyed at the other for just breathing the wrong way.  It's either great or awful.  As adults, we now hang out when it's great, and make sure to separate if it seems leaning towards awful.
1	I actually get along best with my parents and my two stepsisters, and the further the degree increases, the less I get along. It feels like only my core fam and their friends are on the same wavelength, intellectually.\n\nNo, I'm not narcissistic, it's just that my parents are rather atypical, but in a cool way, and we otherwise hail from a very heavily christian breed, so obviously that whole "we black sheep gotta stick together" thing has been actively cultivated for our humble little offshoot dynasty(-ies).\n\nAlso, IIRC my mom tested herself as ENFP and my mom-sis something else with NF. Don't know about dad's and dad-sis' MBTI, but I'd wager it's something along INxP and ENxx respectively. At any rate, intuition is strong as heck among us, and you can feel it. pun intended.
1	My dad for sure. He’s an ENTP as well. I’m like a mini version of him. 
4	Debate Memory	What is the best debate you have ever had? What is one argument you have made that has made you feel good about yourself?
1	Oh that's a hard one.  Can I pick 2?
0	29 year old INFJ male looking to meet ENTP females for dating?	Hi Everyone, \n\nSo I was over on the INFJ subreddit, and their has been a series of posts about how compatible ENTPs are with INFJs and I was a little curious. I am not a big believer in Myer-Briggs, but I do continuously test into INFJ, so I kinda identify with the type. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, everyone says ENTPs connect, and I was curious to see how true that can be? So for the sake of the experiment, I was like... well let's go to the ENTP subreddit, and be direct. So, I apologize if this is against the rules.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI live in the New England area, and would be willing to chit chat, and at the very least make new friends. I'm super busy from now until may, so I don't know why I am saying dating, but I am really curious. At the very least, it would make me less skeptical of Myers-Briggs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheers.
8	Yes, our personality types tend to connect very well.  Not sure if it's great for long-term, but then again there are so few INFJ males and ENTP females that it's hard to have a proper sample to study.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\*I don't date INFJ's, because they have too many feelings.  It's tiring.  I find them wildly attractive, and then I run away.
9	Hey sexy cutie patootie!!! Hit me up sugar doll. Let’s “chit chat” as you call it!!! 
7	I'm a straight dude living in the new england area, but we can grab a beer and find some sensors to flirt with.  
3	I’m a female ENTP. I’m not interested in dating you, but if you want to talk about MBTI we can. 
3	Come on, don’t do this my man. The Myers Briggs type is just a suggestion, it’s not a box for people. If you want to date someone, meet someone you like in real life. Get to know them. Learn their communication styles, the way they like to have fun and evaluate if you two match afterwards. Don’t go on to an ENTP(or others) subreddit to date, would this ever truly work considering the probabilities of someone being in your area and not strange!?
8	I’m not in New England.  I’m not a girl.  But I *am* an ENTP.  I’ll send you dick pics** to see if you can find that magic soulmate feeling....you know, to help you decide if you want to believe mbti is real.  \n\n** actual product may vary from photo
9	Wdyt : letter from Captain America to Tony (civil war)	" My faith is in people, I guess. Individuals. And I’m happy to say for the most part, they haven’t let me down. Which is why I can’t let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but – maybe they shouldn’t. I know I hurt you Tony. (...)  I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you were only doing what you believe in, and that’s all any of us can do, it’s all any of us should."\n\nCan you relate to this? What do you think? Expecially about first and last lines. Having faith in humanity vs having faith in individuals? Which one do you relate to?\n\nAnd this part : "I know you were only doing what you believe in, and that’s all any of us can do, it’s all any of us should." Your stance on it?\n\nIf not entp, and no flair, then please state your type.
5	People suck. For the most part, they've let me down time after time.   \n  \n\n  \n
2	EDIT: Well, I meant to reply to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/ahd0bz/ca_civil_war_were_you_team_cap_or_team_iron_man/) instead so removing previous wall of text on the Cap vs Tony debate as it's a little OT to be left here.
2	Being an ENTP, I feels it. This is what I want from a friend. Not someone to just give me shit it or so, but to understand. And that's why I have no friends ¯\_(ツ)​_/¯
1	Captain America was complete trash to me after the Civil War in the comics. He literally makes no sense and his character contradicts itself. 
50	Apparently ENTPs are obsessed with memes...but I’ve notice that this subreddit doesn’t have nearly as many memes as the INTP or INFP subreddits.	If we are supposed to be all about memes and shit, how come there are rarely any on here? I almost never see them and when they are posted they are hardly upvoted.
52	Although this subreddit can often be a shit show (really it just fluctuates), and although I give users like /u/Azdahak shit for making obnoxiously long comments because I secretly just want them sexually, I would honestly say this subreddit has always been idk...superior to the other MBTI subreddits? Even though it’s an ENTP subreddit, I see a lot of different discussions on here and honestly I don’t think there’s nearly as much circle jerking on this subreddit as the other MBTI subreddits like /r/INTJ or /r/INFJ....\n\n....Although this is sort of a redundant comment since I am sort of circle jerking /r/ENTP right now, I honestly think it just has superior conversations compared to the other ones and people come here *for* those discussions, not the memes. If this were just relatable meme land, I probably wouldn’t come here often. Idk if any other ENTPs relate to this, but I really don’t get where the fuck everyone gets this idea that we are meme lovers? Don’t get me wrong, I post them, but I’d rather just read discussions and shit. It’s INTPs who seem to just eat memes up like a fat boy at a candy store, tbh. However, I do love funny gifs. I send lots and lots of those.
22	i like memes, I just don't like following rules for making memes. 
8	We are all on our best behavior lol. And I'm sure we all already have an established friend group who are subjected to the brunt of our memery. I know I do Haha 
15	ENTP's spoke in meme's before memes were even a thing, so we don't have to use a dumb picture behind our words and we never did as we're allways painting one and adding funny one liners or puns anyway. \n\nI noticed this recently actually about myself and wondered why i never got carried away in memes/had a higher expectation. \n\nIn-fact half the funnies I crack(usually abruptly in the middle of conversation {to many's dismay I'm sure) I usually follow up with, "Hey, that could be a meme!"
3	I shared memes with friends irl. And they are introverts. So they probably have a harder time with real life social skills. I could be wrong tho.
3	I enjoy a meme that is unique, expresses some new idea, and in a new way. But most memes that get posted and upvoted here tend to start recycling the same tropes and structures, ad nauseum. I don't want this to be a meme farm where people try to learn what works or what doesn't.\n\nI would much rather have less memes overall even if it comes with the risk that I might miss out on a very good meme. We've been through phases when this sub was basically a trash heap of low-quality, repetitive, cricle-jerky shit memes. I like the balance we have now.
3	Because entps also keep a refined taste in memes aren't easy to impress on that front. Also they like seeing memes, and generally forget that someone has to make them.
5	Are you kidding? This sub is full of memes and meme-tier content and the memes posted get routinely upvoted to the top.\n\nAlso why exactly are ENTPs supposed to be obsessed with memes?
4	Because this subreddit is full of trash spam from INTPs and INFPs\n\n
2	I get ideas for memes, but i procrastinate doing them and thus never do, but also memes is usually lowtier creativity and humor so im not interested.
2	"Apparently ENTPs are obsessed with memes..."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell there's your problem.
2	There are subreddits for memes, this sub is for the collective circlejerk we all deserve.
2	Cuz we visit other subreddits to laugh at the memes there.
2	I think that has less to do with being an ENTP and more to do with how millinials and Gen z'rs like to joke, relate and communicate. Most of us like memes. 
1	I like filthy frank. Memes too but we're too lazy to make entp memes
1	*We had the idea first at least... Just getting around to doing it..yeah..* I'll call you..
-2	NEED MORE MEMES NEED MORE MEMES
-2	Let's make more memes
6	When you have many hobbies that all have to do with one catagory.	This dude and his one-man-band skills are insane - https://v.redd.it/2l0sdbhb87b21
1	Hell yea G video games and whatever im currently obsessed with
7	Anyone ever have a mentor?	I don’t know about you but I have never had one and it may be due to being too proud and arrogant.  Especially when I was younger I assumed I was more enlightened than most and thought everyone else was full of shit.\n\nPretty much always felt a need to reinvent the wheel versus following tried and true methods.  In my old age I sometimes regret this and felt like I missed out.  \n\nI ponder about the possibility that I could have been more successful both financially and socially if I would have humbled myself and been open to someone mentoring me.  
5	Hell man everyone’s a mentor to me. I always pick apart people I know and dissect their flaws so I can improve myself. I always look at them and say damn they suck at one thing I’m not going to do that
3	My grandfather is my most memorable mentor.  He encouraged me to use my smarts to the fullest and make something great of myself.  I think he was an ENTJ; he was an electrical engineer and even in his 70s before an freak accident killed him he would always get called back into work at an industrial plant after his retirement because the younger crews couldn’t figure things out so he’d have to go help them.  I didn’t always listen to him but he shaped who I am and I will never let his teachings and vision for me be in vain.  He taught me a little bit of knowledge about everything; he was very forward thinking about computers, photography, physics, astronomy, etc.\n\nI had some teachers in high school and college who were my biggest fans and I thank them for that.\n\nCurrently my mentor so to speak is my INTJ coworker.  I respect him more than anyone else currently in my life, and I strive to listen to him and follow his lead even if I want to slap him sometimes (I don’t like being told what to do or that I am perhaps not doing something the best way, imagine that).
2	Books can be your best mentor. A writer spend years gathering knowledge that you can equally get in few weeks tops. It's pretty awesome when you think of how useful a book is.
2	> Anyone ever have a mentor?\n\nYep! Over the past few years, I've met several older women who I click with really well, and who are really smart and stable. Since my mom is an ISFJ, the things that I think about never even cross her mind. So I assembled a network of auxiliary moms. :)\n\nYou don't just ask someone to mentor you. I mean, you could, but that's an awkward way to approach it. In my experience, a mentor is just an older friend.\n\nOne of my mentors once had a girl approach her and formally ask her, "Would you be my mentor?" She said, "Sure!" The girl never called her back, and the "mentorship" went no where. On the other hand, I never formally called this woman my mentor... I just kept reaching out to her. I kept asking her to grab coffee, texting with her, asking her for advice. You know, just like you'd do with a friend your age. (It wasn't just one-way, of course, but older people sometimes feel weird about asking a younger person to hang out, so I needed to do most of the initiating at first.) She's one of my most trusted advisors now, and I talk to her before making most major life decisions. (She's an INTJ, btw. Love that compassionate bluntness!)\n\nIf you meet an older person who feels like a kindred spirit, foster a friendship with them. It doesn't have to be formal! :)
15	Idealizing people you like?	A very sweet INFP has started working with me and I like her. However, I notice that all my thoughts towards her are positive, and I am willing to go through things in more detail with her than with someone else. \n\nI dislike in myself the way I treat people being so dependant on my feelings towards them. Especially so because familiarity with people often leads me to dislike them.\n\nAlso does anyone have any experience with INFPs of the opposite gender? I would like to ground my thoughts a little, as I am captivated by essentially everything she does\n\nThanks \^-^
10	Ne doms are characterized by tons of excitement up front about pretty much everything.  I have managed to keep that excitement and admiration for some people, after the initial phase of "WOW YOU FANCY!", but generally I get disillusioned as you say.  Romantically I have learned to try to slow things way down (in terms of the shit I think, say, and do).  \n\nAnyways INFPs are often hot, very intelligent, say weird interesting shit, are interested in my sometimes bizarre ideas, enjoy learning about pretty much everything, are cultured, humble, kind, and very sincere.  They are also present in a way that only Ps really can be, and that Fi means they respond intensely to a great many things.  That wide range of intensity is fun to watch.  Not only is the range and depth of it something I covet, but a little of it infects the Fe.  \n\nI think most of the ExxPs who talk about their beloved "INFJs" are really talking about IxFPs. \n\nNow... IME Fi is pretty shit in relationships compared to Fe.  I have mostly been with NFPs because yes they're often absolutely mesmerizing.  The ONE Fe user I was with treated me better than all the Fi users combined.  No contest.  Fe is constantly looking for ways to make the people it cares about comfortable, happy, feeling appreciated, etc.  Sounds nice in a relationship right?  Yeah it is.  Fi does that when it feels the urge.  Fe always feels the urge.  Your choice really.  
4	I don't have this problem.  I actually have the opposite problem.  When I start to like someone my brain goes into hyperdrive trying to figure out what is wrong with them.  Only once I've fully identified, labeled, and categorized their flaws can I then sit back and decide if I like them anyway.
2	I went on a date with an infp, it was casual, I thought they were attractive, they thought I was funny, I hadnt really crushed on them, but we went on a date anyway, we went to BK and Mejier, just hungout, take my advice, a date with them ought to be a coffee shop or some shit like George Webbs. Mine was casual but aim higher than I did.\nAnd yes I idealized the 2 women I loved like nothing else, I recon its an 'entp thing' but thats just me.
1	So ur fancying an infp uhh?\n\nand u want to hear  thougs on them?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis has to be a bait.. I told myself today i was not gonna rant and now i read this adashdashdhas
9	ENTPs, what is your love language?	When you are romantically involved with someone, what are some things you do to express your love and care for that person? I am interested to see answers that go outside of just sex, because that seems pretty universal to me (INFP). \n\nEdit: doesn't necessarily have to be the 5 official ones, I would prefer more detailed responses of something specific to you guys
14	Going by the five love languages, my top one is quality time, and right below that is physical touch. I notice I put my hand in people’s shoulders or I’ll do a pat on the back a lot to people I love. I also enjoy setting aside time for those I love. 
11	... Outside of sex... hmm... Food, definitely food.
6	For the 5, my main one is gift giving followed directly by quality time. I think I may have physical touch as well, but like high fives/fistbumps etc. as opposed to hugs or whatever.   \nA more obscure one that is out of the five is making fun. The closer I am to someone, the more I know their boundaries and such and so I can bully them with affection >:)
6	words of affirmation and acts of service 
4	ALLLLL about that physical affection. I am like a cat, constantly rubbing myself against my boyfriend. Also, I do love gifts, mainly because I’m not used to getting them. 
3	For the five basic ones, acts of service. 
3	I have no clue.\nNever been loved and never loved.\nWhat is love?
3	Physical touch, words of affirmation, and time for my ENTP, but I'm pretty sure anything to do with food applies too
2	Touching and sharing
2	Words of affirmation is my biggest one. Touch and gifts are my next two.
2	Physical Touch followed closely by Words of Affirmation.
2	Physical touch.  I wish it weren't, but it is.
2	Acts of service followed by quality time & words of affirmation. 
2	I like to draw flowers and stuff for my gf. Buying gifts feels phony and like a chore, whereas drawing is actually something I enjoy doing and she likes the results. 
2	My love language is language, I'm very verbal and physical in expressing affection, I say exactly what I think and feel about someone I love, directly and without hesitation.
2	I actually just did the test today, my top love language is touch and then quality time. But honestly I like just knowing someone likes or cares about me. Any effort that shows that is appreciated, because I can’t stand second guessing myself and feeling like I’m the only one invested. In order for me to stay interested I have to feel like they’re interested too. I like when people think about my interests when doing things for me. For example, I’ve been seeing an INFJ and I really love Christmas and Christmas lights. He doesn’t celebrate Christmas to that extent, it’s an over monetized holiday to him (he’s right) but one day he came over and asked me to get in the car. I didn’t know where we were going. He took me to this place nearby that was covered in Christmas lights and had a Christmas tree that would change colors based on music. It really meant a lot to me because he specifically thought about my interests when picking it. It was simple, but it showed he really cares. 
2	Memes.
2	Acts of Service. 
1	Acts of service followed by physical touch. 
1	All I know is that I want my ideal guy to make me feel special. I want him to bring me out to interesting places and to spend lots of time and affection on me...So i guess quality time?\n\n  I tend to spend money on romantic partners though. So there's that too.
1	Words of affirmation, quality time, and physical touch are mine 
4	How to Achieve Your Most Ambitious Goals | Stephen Duneier | TEDxTucson	
4	CA : Civil war. Were you team cap or team iron man?	We all know that Tony is ENTP. So my question it, did you agree with him? \n\nI agreed with Captain America on this one, I feel like Tony was too blinded by guilt and he wanted somebody else to take responsibility for his own actions. \n\nI'm also aware that Cap was strongly biased because of Bucky - hell he fought against 117 countries and his own friends just to save one man. But I still think he was right in this one.\n\nSo tell me your opinions.
3	Tough one, I think not letting the govt get involved is where I stand ideologically (with cap) but iron man and spider man are the dopest, so yeah.. tough one\n\n\nClassic entp indecision
7	I agree with neither. The idea of the Sokovia Accords only works if you think Enhanced still obey the laws of humanity. The Avengers has literal *gods* as part of the team, like Thor. The arrogance of humans to think these Enhanced individuals should obey certain human doctrines. \n\nIf you read through the known Sokovia Accords conditions, it states that no Enhanced individual can act in a country that isn't their country of residence without approval from the countrys' subcommittee. I see how this is a good idea from human perspectives, but from superhuman perspectives it weakens them. Which I suppose is the point. \n\nIf Tony followed the equivalent of the Accords in Iron Man 1, he never would have been able to destroy all those weapons other countries had. It would have been acts of war, but his actions deterred war. \n\nA better option would have been a selective service program. *If* you choose to, you can sign up to serve the military/government as an aid on spy, espionage missions. Basically if it's a government issue, you have to volunteer to help, and only then do you obey them. But you're still a free agent able to quit at any point. Otherwise you're not at liberty to interfere, since it's a humans issue.\n\nThis is why i disagree with both Steve and Tony. Because you shouldn't need *permission* to do something (hence Tony is wrong), but you also shouldn't unilaterally interfere with things humans can handle on their own (hence Steve is wrong). If and only if you choose to volunteer to work on govt missions do you sign a non-binding short-term tree contract. If you consistently break contracts, what are they going to do, imprison Hulk? Lol. \n\nWhat they can do is stop you from volunteering because you become untrustworthy. If an Enhanced individual frequently meddles with affairs that a country views as actively harming them, they're more than able to declare war (on the Enhanced). \n\nIn summary, I'd basically say each Enhanced becomes their own independent sovereign "country" in a way. So it's partial Tony and partial Steve. But really it's Team "I'm a god. Good luck."
5	I saw the validity of both sides of the argument.  Having worked with the government before, however, I'd side with Cap.
2	They're both wrong. Tony because he wants to pass off authority to someone else and avoid his personal guilt for the Ultron fiasco, thereby compromising the Avengers' unique ability to be a nongovernmental, rapid-reacting force for good, and Steve because he believes that a bureaucratic system of "normal" e.g. non-superpowered oversight should not under any circumstances call the shots on what the Avengers can and can't do. What they should have done is draft up some concrete and non-negotiable rules of engagement, specify that their missions must be justified on the basis of adherence to the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with solid evidence for rights violations as a pretext for intervention to be presented *after* said intervention rather than before (to avoid the delay in aiding those in need that would occur from having to obtain UN or individual government sign-off on EVERYTHING), and turn the squad loose to mete out justice as they see fit. Not vigilantism, more like (if you'll pardon the loaded expression) a well-regulated militia. Note that as much of the Avengers' mission is defending Earth from extraterrestrial threats, slapping some minimal amount of red tape on their intervention in human v human conflicts would not significantly diminish their ability to provide overall societal benefit (assuming we're looking at the Avengers as an organization with a fundamentally utilitarian outlook, at least w/[r/t](https://www.reddit.com/r/t) humankind. We can debate this assumption, for sure). Bottom line is they were both too extreme, and a compromise solution to the oversight question would have been most effective at addressing the very real problems with superpowered interventions that had surfaced prior to Civil War while also maintaining the independence and agility that make the Avengers so valuable.\n\n* But the UN UDHR is a dumb and arbitrary moral framework within which to operate!  \n\n   * Let me know if you have a better one. I think it's a pretty solid starting point. Keep in mind that just because the Avengers *can* intervene under this system, doesn't mean they *will*. It may be a violation of my universal human right to property as stated by the UDHR if someone steals my wallet, but I doubt that's the most important thing the Avengers have to deal with right now, so they probably will not show up even if it is within their broadly defined jurisdiction. Local law enforcement can continue to handle situations like this.\n* But how will "solid evidence for rights violations" be presented if not in advance?  \n\n   * Iron Man definitely has a camera embedded in his helmet, right? Record that shit as it's going down, including an initial argument for why they're getting involved, and actual footage from the battlefield/engagement/aftermath. Then have a special expedited legal process for challenges to each Avengers involvement, with some strict-ass punishments if/when missions are deemed to have been undertaken without appropriate justification. For example, any Avenger participating in an action deemed unjustified by legal review based on the UN UDHR must share a cell with Peter Quill for a month at first offense, a year at second offense, and until Quill finishes converting his whole tape collection through CD to mp3 at third offense.\n* But the Avengers will still continue to serve primarily Western geopolitical interests, which is unfair to all the countries who don't have superheroes to perform acts of superpowered favoritism on their behalf!  \n\n   * Correct. But we should apply this regulatory regime to all superpowered individuals (and here we raise another issue that I'm not quite going to confront here, which is how to define superpowers), not just the Avengers. You're telling me the US (almost everyone), Russia (Black Widow), Sokovia (Scarlet Witch/Quicksilver (RIP)), and Wakanda (Black Panther) have a monopoly on the world's superpowered talent? Not buying it. When superpowers come from superior tech/medical advancements (Iron Man, Captain America), then plenty of people/nations have the intellectual capital and manufacturing ability to create superpowered individuals -- but these individuals cannot be directly state-sponsored actors and must be governed by the UN as provided above. This is again a blurry line since you could argue that the Iron Man suit is more of a straight up weapon and less of a superpower... yikes. As I said, a discussion there's not enough time/space here to fully unpack. Anyway... alternatively, when superpowers come from inherent natural abilities (possibly as a result of genetic mutations?), that's just random chance in the gene pool, right? Given that [most genetic diversity is found within rather than across populations](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/10/genetics-history-race-neanderthal-rutherford/), it doesn't make sense that naturally-occurring superpowered people would only exist in certain populations. It's more likely that they're everywhere, and just haven't gotten as much publicity/been as involved in world affairs to this point.\n\nTL;DR, they're both wrong; the answer is "Goldilocks" regulation that preserves significant autonomy for Avengers and others like them while also drawing well-defined boundaries for what constitutes a permissible intervention.
8	For all of the long term ENTPs of this subreddit...	Do you guys ever wonder what will finally make you leave? What will be the breaking point or if you’ll still be lurking on this subreddit like...10 years from now?
12	Funnily enough, I do think about this time from time. I *long* for the day when I don’t feel a compulsion to check this subreddit or just anything on Reddit at all. I feel like I waste literally all of my time on this fucking website. I’ve never even been on the desktop version of Reddit...only the app. Someone please shut it down already for the *LOVE OF GOD*. End my SUFFERING!!
4	>Do you guys ever wonder what will finally make you leave?\n\nI dunno, getting laid?
6	I don't want to be on Reddit 10 years down the road. \n\nI've been on this sub for a bit more than three years. I initially stayed because I liked the community and engaging content. In terms of both, this sub was far better than all of the other type specific ones.\n\nThere have been plenty of complaints about the state of the sub by regular users in the last couple of months so I won't regurgitate them. The one thing I will say though is that I miss some of the regular that were active when I first joined. Out of the people that started posting regularly since I joined only three or so I'd consider a good addition to the sub.\n\nI'm out the next time this sub gets taken over by 14 year olds that can barely form a coherent sentence but feel the need to spread their nonsense over the internet. There were a few around last summer and that prompted me to stay away for a month or so. In general, I've been spending a lot less time and effort on this sub. 
3	This sub had a phase about half a year ago where it was overfilled with shit memes and shit discussions. It made me not think about the sub for about 2 weeks. When I got back the shit was still there but the quality discussions started to reappear.\n\nThis sub would be dead for me if the quality of the discussions would go to complete shit. I see other MBTI subs filled with shitty repetitive content and this sub is the most qualitative MBTI sub out of them all. I love this hub of diverse discussions and the community that surrounds it. Over populating the sub with newcommers will definitely damage the quality of the content over the years but I really hope it passes the test of time in terms of quality.
2	I popped my head in after being gone for I think over a year and it was like an ISTJ had knocked up an ESFP and it aborted a feeling baby, onto a pile of shit-memes, in a gas station bathroom covered in misogynistic and thinly veiled racist grafiti.   The bowl had been missed by a long shot.  Te was Ti, Ne was Se, all F was Fi, and the content might as well have been written in shit-crayon on the walls of said bathroom.  \n\nMy goal is to be able to say this place sucks less than it did then... by a wider margin lol.  Then I'll probably focus more on work and side projects with this time investment.  Not to say of course that if it does improve that's on me.  I just want to try to help with that.  
1	If the nazis on reddit make it to this sub I will leave. 
1	Hey folks, here is my life!\n\nHaven't posted in 10 months, suddenly back here today for I don't how long.\n\nHey folks, this was my life!
1	Ill probably get focused on something else and slowly post less and less,then lurk less and less. \n\nsome new users will come, troll a fucking lot, then leave, some others will take the mantle, some will do pr on here, there will be a ban wave in less than a year from now where a lot of regulars will quit, in less than 2 years this subreddit will be a total diferent place than it is now with complete diferent user base and vibe.\n\nAnd im not saying this as a fantasy of destruction, im saying all of this because how things have being going lately,  and general because every action has a reaction and people tend to be oblivious to it all until it explodes in their face.\n\n&#x200B;

2	ENTP - impatient / high expectations from my job	Hi all,\n\nWhen I (mid 30s) look at my folders that I saved with my job applications I found I have been in a job hunt mood since the last 5 years. Eventhough I was always employed with decent jobs. Why am I so unsatisfied / impatient all the time? I am trying to get the perfect job that fully corresponds to my strength and if I don't get it, I feel stuck / anxious and even angry at everyone and then at myself.\n\nAs ENTP we are according to the text book impatient, unreliable (I would challenge that), quickly bored, extremely high standards for ourselves (I have this regarding my job). I am a hard working person/did a good job - but I was never happy in my jobs. In my new job - 5 months in - I knew it was not perfect - but I am already looking further.\n\nHow do you guys stick with a job? I have not yet reached my target job and I keep applying... people tell me that I destroy my reputation and career. \n\nPlease help.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Probably shouldn't just change for change's sake but aim at a purposeful move that meets your requirements. Find what are your priorities in life and find a job that allows you to reach those goals. Moving because you're bored is only going to lead you in the same situation. Be picky.
1	Just here to say I completely sympathize with this. While I’ve been with the same large organization for 6 years, I’ve had three different roles. I feel like I’m in a constant state of job hunting. I compulsively look to see what else is out there, and part of the reason for this is I never feel totally satisfied. Once the novelty wears off and I’m not feeling challenged, or I get frustrated with my portfolio of tasks, I start looking again. On some level I know this is unhealthy, especially because I’ve received a lot of offers from other organizations I’ve applied to that I’ve then turned down (mostly because they couldn’t match my pay), and I sometimes have wondered if I’m weirdly addicted to the hunt and chase for the next thing, even if I don’t take it. Yeah... it’s a bit messed up.\n\nSo, recently I started looking again, despite only being in my newest role for 8 months. But I haven’t put forth any applications and this time around I’ve decided to focus my energies on finding other side pursuits both at work and externally to hopefully fill that need-to-be-challenged void. I joined an innovation round table at work and have put my name forward for a few voluntary opportunities to serve on committees, etc. Hopefully this will stave off my need to flee? The downside is I risk overextending myself, so I have to be careful. I’ve done this before where I’ve taken on a bazillion side projects and can’t possibly do them all to a reasonable level and end up dropping a bunch of balls.\n\nI dunno... was any of that helpful? 
1	I'm in this position now. The only reason I'm still at my job is because I literally haven't found a better option nearby that pays as much. If I had the choice, I'd definitely still be job hopping and probably would've avoided the mental breakdown phase I had. For your personality type, I don't see why you should fight it. Use your personality to your advantage and diversify your income streams! Go a more entrepreneurial route. "People" tell you, who are these people? Is there actual evidence that your reputation and career are getting destroyed? Time and time again I see people leaving their jobs for things like Ebay reselling, stock trading, freelancing, and they say they'd NEVER look back. And guess what, they're usually intuitives. \n\nOf course, this should be done responsibly. These jobs you get should be looked at as tools for money, stepping stones towards your ultimate goal. Lots of side hustles are getting oversaturated and more difficult but there's still pockets of success within them to be discovered. Until you have a track record of income, you'll need these boring jobs, but then the pressure of them to be flawless is lifted. Your only goal at that point is to find a job that doesn't drive you crazy enough to rage quit. If that still doesn't work, job hop. Do what you have to do. I can tell you being stagnant as a high Ne user leads to a mental breakdown and depression (living example). I'm only better now because I used Lexapro for a bit and that seemed to reset my brain enough to not be snapping at my boss/coworkers.

8	It was quite good. \n\nJoe- INFJ- a really fucking delusional one...haha and that’s saying something.\n\nBeck- INFP\n\nPeach- ENTJ or ESTJ\n\nBenji- ESTP\n\nBlythe- ENTP\n\nPaco- ISFJ...?\n\nKaren- ENFJ\n\n\n
3	agreed. Joe strike me as an intj or infj and beck is an infp - ennea 6 counterphobic
-2	No. 
24	Debate: ENTP is the best type	Of all the 16 MBTI types, ENTP is clearly the best one.\n\nI have many reasons to support my position. 
44	True.\n\nI have many reasons to support my position as well. \n\nI win the debate.
29	An ENTP that has their shit together is the best type. 
20	I really was expecting to see a better debate here... or at least better comedy.
17	No, no, only I am the best 
47	counterpoint: ENTP is the worst type. My evidence is the existence of this thread. 
10	I've always thought when you break it down \nE is better than I\nN is way better than S\nT is more practical than F\nP is better than J 
23	"ENTPs are the best type."\n\n-- Jung, *Psychological Types*
8	I love how this Sub is basically just r/shittyMBTi\nThank you for being the best trolls
3	It can be best type, but does it really matter if you suck as a person? The answer is no, it doesn’t...
3	Can I see at least all of them?
3	Are we practicing necromancy here?\n\nIf so can we revive the Sun meme pls
7	No,ENTJs are.\n\nTe-Ni always wins.
4	Nah ENTJ, INTJ, ENFJ & INFJ are the best types. We’re NP’s, 2nd tier intuitives let’s face it. \n\nSociety just isn’t ready to listen to and implement everything we say. And we’re too lazy to implement them ourselves.\n\n
3	No it’s ENTJ let’s be real
3	I refute your argument on the basis of subjective reality. "The best" is not real. Nothing you say is based in objectivity because objectivity doesn't exist. \n\nTherefore I argue that ENTP is instead the sexiest type.\n\nI have many reasons to support this decision.
2	Sure, if that makes you feel better, we can say that. 
1	Nice
1	not really... I mean, I'd say, yeah, you guys are pretty good at attracting people and making them like you, but you guys gotta stop bullshitting sometimes too
1	Thanks we appreciate¡
1	Well then go and list your reasons. The burden of proof is on you, not us.\n
1	Lol no
1	The best? Idk I don’t think there’s such thing as a best or worse type. Every type has its pros and cons. BUT the most interesting? In my book yes. Also have you ever met an entp irl? Every one of us has either tons of complexes, a personality disorder or simply is a “messy bitch who lives for drama” type. Now everyone has their own criteria and different criteria for what’s considered “best”🤷‍♀️😛
1	It's true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthat comes from INTJ
0	You would say that😉 (❤️ an INFJ)
-4	"winning a debate" imo, means convincing the other party . ENTP is not that good at that as someone getting angry after all his arguments have been ruthlessly smashed to the ground has likely not changed his opinion
12	How do I make deep but new relations? Without seeming desperate or intimidating	My best and closest friend just traveled and does not know when or if* he'll be back. \nMost of my friends are not close friends I connect deeply with. Some of my friends I'm with because I don't have "better" options they don't really challenge or develop my intellect (only the events we go to). \nThe few people I feel like I click with and could be close with has established their "VIP" friends group, which I can't seem to enter. \nI know the people I'm referring to actually do like me, but with everything they got going they don't like me nenough to prioritize our relationship nor do they need another relationship since they feel strongly connected to multiple of their friends. I'm assertive and find it really easy to ask someone out, but I have been rejected over and over again. Where I ask hey do you want to xx tonight and they're like: I would love to but can't because xx, but let's talk next week. \nAll my friends I've met through my boyfriend think I'm popular and are so happy I have joined their international startup group, but we are only together in groups and most are couples, so I don't feel that I could hang out with only one of them also they are busy people as well.\n\nHow do I find interesting people to connect with and make long lasting deep relationships? How do ask them out without seeming desperate or like too much?\n\nI live in Copenhagen where I study cultural science at University, work a little as a student journalist, work as a yoga teacher and will soon be a part of the university's start up community. \n\nI'm 99% extrovert, so I need to be social a few times a week outside of work, study and boyfriend I live with.\n\nOr is it just extremely hard to find people and form such a bond.. I can settle for what I have if necessary, I just prefer not to.\n
6	People find other people to connect with primarily through shared activities.\n\nIt sounds like you have a lot of varied interests. Do you participate much in any interest groups? Even if you don't stick to going to the group, doesn't mean you can't steal some of them for your needs.\n\nDeep connection isn't common and requires a lot of different factors to align between two individuals. It's worth it when you find it but there is no recipe. What you can do is put yourself in places of opportunity and jump on the opportunities when you see them.\n\nAlso, let your Ne shine! It's what makes you unique, interesting, and attractive. It will filter out the people who won't understand you and attract you to the people your soul is calling out for. 
3	Can you clarify your first sentence? How often do you see your bf? Where‘s home? How long have you been in Copenhagen? How long left? \nMy sympathies. Get into some good books for now 😬
4	How do people know when they're in their "shadow" or "unconscious" parts of the mind?	I don't know how people always say that they were 'stuck' in their INTJ shadow. As an ENTP I am curious how people know that. I guess I am not that great at determining which functions I am using at any given time, other than the ones I use the most. Any light you can shed?
3	> **unconscious** \n\nIf it unconscious and it becomes conscious is not unconscious anymore.
2	I doubt anyone is 100% clear at what they are using at the moment, as for 'intj shadow' I suppose mostly people describe depression of sorts
2	I’m always aware at all time. And I just know that certain parts of me fluctuate. I know who I am at my core and I know when I’m not feeling like my typical self. But not to the extent of cognitive functions shifting and knowing which is which.
2	> I don't know how people always say that they were 'stuck' in their INTJ shadow.   \n\nThose people are over simplifying and warping jung's work, along with the rest of psychology.  They're really telling you "I was acting like an asshole, but don't know why... i read a thing once on the internet about shadows.  Yeah that's it..."  
6	Anyone who can share their fav music?	I had these two darlings.\n\nWe talked about our favorite music and then at one time, they told me that whenever they have a band they adore so much, it takes them months listening to the same band over and over.\n\nAnd then there's me...\nI LOVE MUSIC, SONGS, whatevs...\nBut I'm quick to changing band and genre to listen to. Like after a day or two, I'm already done with this music or album and jump to another. I never really thought about it but I guess it's normal for us to lose interest quicker than another person. But of course, sometimes we go back.\n\nI have my fav band, but I don't keep myself hooked with their music.\n\nAt least I can check and listen to 'maybe' new music if you share yours.\n\nLots of thanks!!\n
7	When I was younger (early to mid teens) I definitely had a stronger tendency to deeply root myself in cliques of music, there was the MCR phase, EDM phase, classic rock phase etc. And each of these phases were quite strong and lengthy.\n\nBut as I got older I no longer tend to fall into these lengthy patterns, I'm barely capable of repeatedly listening to the same stuff without switching to something new. I especially love reexploring old shit.
5	Sufjan Stevens, Carol & Lowell. You will not regret it.
3	 dude i‘m exactly the same. i love music and i love discovering new genres and anything new. i also have my fave band but i can‘t be stuck listening to the same music all the time. so here are a few songs. different genres. different languages. i’m all about the vibes btw, so the lyrics of some might stuck\n\nmy favorite songs atm\n\nhttps://youtu.be/U30gw1Mlk-M Milky Chance - Running (indie)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9wA_S8TlLu0 Low - Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me (alternative)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EgV8UIDLRY0 The Gazette - Tokyo Shinjuu (japanese - rock)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_Tz4UHtR6H4 SINCREA - Hazed Over (jap - rock)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/f6E4VGkvh1Y DIAURA - Human Noise (jap - rock)\n\nmy alltime favorites\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1C1rUo20vUw Deathgaze - Forsaken (jap - rock)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MNQfd6v_nD4 DIR EN GREY - Dozing Green (jap - rock)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/S1_woqQ7rPg deadman - dorisu kara no tegami (jap - rock)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/krGMw7MWJv0 Eccentric Agent - Kamikuro (jap - rock)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9Fi5wddyJfw ScReW - Duality (jap - rock)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HCkAJtVTb28 TRAX - Over The Rainbow (korean - rock)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/RiAfSjlttOE SuicideBoys - LTE (trap)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kGScxakv49Q KILLY - Killamonjaro (trap)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6d_cUb6wRxU BIGBANG - This Love (korean - pop)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/liGOhaPoN0o Okasian - Get That Money (korean - trap)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/M4wxPOiXa9c Ski Mask - Gone (trap)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wI-C-0ccXSI XXXTENTACION - Valentine (alternative)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CMLBvqSAOb4 XXXTENTACION - Find Me (alternative rock)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7RW8n4iXZbA Mor ve ötesi - Bir derdim var (turkish - rock)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/W-ZBDizUaI8 ling tosite sigure- Replica (jap - rock)\n

Years ago.
2	I relate strongly to what you've described. I definitely have my favorite artists, (Eminem and twenty one pilots), but if I listen to either of them for too long I get bored :/ like most entps I believe, I get obsessed with stuff for a short period of time. Now I download an artist's entire discography and obsess for a short time before hopping to a new artist
1	I gotta say listen to some Rush, Boston, or RHCP
1	I ss the whole page... Hah
6	Since you are the debaters: What if people become what they wanted to be when they were children...	... but on a different level? Like an astronaut, in a way it's a person that exceeds limits and explores. A princess (gee I'm all full on the clichés), in the sense they need to be rescued (like in fairy tales).\n\nThe hole in my supposition is that lots of children copied adults they looked up to. "My dad is an engineer, so I'm gonna be an engineer too!". But then, what if they grow up to be people who always go after superiors to become like them?\n\n***so, in essence:*** is the way the child deals with their future going to be the same way (or reflected) they'll deal with other areas when they grow up? if they wish for y, and utilize x method to achieve it, is it something that's in their core? I wonder if psychology has an answer to that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How does this apply to any of you?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI remember kids used to be quite ambitious (compared to adults). Some falsely so, due to lack of knowledge on what was needed to achieve their dreams. Like those kids that give up playing a game after failing twice.  They don't want to play the game and succeed, they want to win without the effort. But there were kids that really worked hard to be recognized. I wonder what happened to those.
9	We’d have a lot of firefighters and train engineers, and basically no janitors. \n\nEdit: on a serious note, what I wanted to be changed nearly weekly. Over the course of my childhood I wanted to be: a journalist, an actor, an ornithologist, a school teacher, a professional baseball player, a sword-fighter, an author, a politician, a lawyer, and a psychologist. I do none of those things, but I do have graduate degrees in sociology and communications and did work briefly as a journalist in radio production before I realized it was a lot of soul-sucking work for no money and I am bad at kissing ass to get ahead. I’ve since had a super-varied career, which I think just goes to show I still don’t know what I want to be when I grow up (I’m 35).
4	Im like the opposite of the stereotype, i wanted to be a laywer but instead became a fire fighter and paramedic 
3	So I wanted to be a tank engineer, manga artist, bounty hunter and a power ranger.  \n\n\nI am now working on commissioned comic book. Def. prospect seemed more fun when I was 7.
2	As a child, many of the careers I found interesting were of the exploratory sort [literally or creatively] in one way or another. Marine biologist, Musician, Mangaka, and Author are a few examples. \n\nI dont think I want to be any of these now necessarily [perhaps I would if it was not difficult...] but I still find myself very drawn to exploration. Im interested in anything novel or unique.
2	Since I was a child I wanted to be a journalist. Now I am a student journalist beside studying culture science at University and teaching yoga. It doesn't sound like an adventure, but it truly has been. I have dreamed about being an adult as long as I can remember and now that I am it has truly exceeded my expectations. \nDespite the fact that I actually have become what I dreamt of. \nPeople who have known me since I was a child saw me as pretty "wild" to be fair I've worked a lot beside school and traveled all I could  since I was only 14 y.o. and met so many diffent people while coucsurfing even in Morocco, I've worked as a topless dancer when I was 18 at the most expensive club in Copenhagen (with nice rules). \nIt's hard to believe for people who don't truly understand my motives, that objectively looking I go to University and have lived with my boyfriend for two years now and work as a student journalist like I said I would and much more.\n\nI don't think it's unusual for people to have an idea of their skillset as a child. \n\n\n
2	I used to want to be a journalist in war zones, a lawyer against government, a psychologist, an AI developer but now I just wish that I had just wished to be happy as I’ve grown. So, that’s that. Oh, and I’m becoming a data scientist so almost a combo of a few of my youth interests. 
1	Everyone would be fire fighters, astronauts, policemen, and doctors
1	I could never settle on just one because I didn’t want to miss out on anything. I wanted to be everything. \n\nAt 30, having had three distinct careers and about to embark on a fourth, I’m very much a Jack of All Trades and a Master of None.
1	Heh, I used to tell my parents that I wanted to be either a puppy or a grape when I grew up. Bless those Sensor parents (Dad ESTJ, Mom ISTJ) for never telling me that kids can't grow up to be either of those things, despite probably thinking their kid was crazy for wanting to be either a canine or a fruit.\n\n>!It actually worked out because I achieved my dreams and am secretly a puppy with internet access!< ([LINK](http://assets.media-marketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/na-internetu-niko-ne-zna-da-ste-pas.png))
1	I wanted to be a pikachu sooo??
1	Well didnt really pan out with the whole firefighter and police thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAstronaut is not far off from what i now want to do and neither is an automotive engineer.\n\nCurrently working on getting into an Meng aerospace course
5	Any comment ?	[https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang\_en/zirayu-spencer/](https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/zirayu-spencer/)
5	What is your view on life,universe and everything ?	 \n\n## \n\nPhilosophically speaking are you existentialist,nihilist,absurdist,stoicist,theist or something entirely else or your own ?
7	This has been previously answered: 42.
3	The philosophers I like the most are the Stoics and Wittgenstein. - the second of which suggests that if you are asking questions such as “what is the meaning of life”, you are asking the questions wrong. 
2	Absurdist with pantheistic views.\n\nThe existence of my pantheistic believes doesnt interefere  with my absurdist views on the slightest.
2	Atheistic nihilism. Nothing really matters, I exist for the sole purpose of flexing on others and dopamine trains...
1	a slightly adjusted version of a religion
1	A deist.
1	I have no set view.  The older I get the less I box myself in and want to identify with any label or faith; when I was young I thought maybe I needed to find that as I felt so unlike others who did have that and seemed content but that desire subsided with age.  As new information and awareness comes to me I think of new possibilities.  There is no religion created by man that could possibly have all the answers; perhaps it’s a good guideline for how to live a good life for the people that need that.  I am a bit hedonistic but to no extent that interferes with the public, I acknowledge conscience as an intuitive guideline I was born with so I should follow that. I could not identify 100% identify with any philosopher or philosophical viewpoint, though I’ve entertained existentialism and nihilism.  I feel the same about political preferences as well.\n\nI identify most with the scientific truths of physics and the intangible truths of psychology.  There’s many disparate things connecting us all and I find the possibilities of them being connected intriguing.  With physics you have the laws of energy and entropy, such as energy cannot be created or destroyed, it simply changes form.  I haven’t cared enough to really delve deep and formulate an type of theory but on the surface it underlies what I believe to be true about life.  Then there are the things you can’t explain why they occur, such as love, dream symbols that are universal to everyone, that people operate based on cognitive functions.  We know they exist but can’t explain why they occur, they just do.  Miracles and tragedies occur everyday; having kids has made me a bit more at ease with these types of unexplainables.  Planet earth gives us clues to life just by us living on it.  When I sold stone slabs it was awesome to see millions of years cut out and placed in front of me.  That tangible sight of eons of earth, having moved and changed and evolved is the kind of thing that speaks to me.  Those things combined help me formulate a sense of “god”.  I enjoy pondering how all those dots could be connected.  I cannot see any higher power as human like whatsoever.  I have no idea what that makes me philosophically, if anything at all.  
1	Agnostic/Atheist with an appreciation for stoicism.  
1	Well,hear it is: when i was little,u used to think about the meaning of life,death,universe so much.and some days im very convinced that it all is meaningless that i became depressed and suisidal.one day i read a short story and a sentence in it changed my life.it isnt a importqself help guide or such thing.just a story.i dont remember the name now but will tell later. What it basically said was,"dont think too much.when you live,live happily and when you are going to die,just die." Yes it may not soind like a big thing to you,but it matterd to me.and it helped me live.later when i start to think about this things,this is what i allways thought.what if a ant in a ant hall gains a human intelligence and start to look at his and other ants lifes and history as a human would  do.after it concluded that evrything every ant done from the begging didnt matter a single bit compared to humans,it would self destruct.thats what happens if we think about universe too much.think of life as a simple man do.just live happily.and you will be able to sleep peacefully.
1	Theistic evolution, objective/universal morality, and human life is of paramount intrinsic value 
1	Philosophy is an evolving discourse. The only rules I hold sacred are the ability to change your beliefs, provided appropriate evidence. Error-correction is my only God. \n\nOne of my long standing perspectives is that life is a search for meaning. And, as in the existentialist point of view, it is not a given that you will find one or that you have one. But I believe it important that all humans SEARCH for the meaning. And further ideas that follow from this starting point.\n\nI find it relevant to search for motivation at the deepest level. For example, if I went out to get coffee today why did I do that? I try to reconcile those fundamental motivations with my current worldview to be consistent. 
190	Found online - Humans are Adorable - human appreciation post	
10	Where can I buy one? Are they expensive? Do they need a litter box?  Are they good if I put them in cages in the basement?
39	Also occasionally we get nuclear weapons pointed at some countries,drain oil,kill,steal.We are just hairless apes with enough smarts to destory ourselves.
18	Humans are not adorable: human condemnation comment.\n\n1. Humans say 'fuck' even when they're not upset. They say it for a multitude of reasons, despite it being a vulgar expletive. \n\n2. Humans collect tons of plastic objects which rape planet of natural resources\n\n3. Humans have significantly contributed to the eradication of the ozone, which can melt the polar ice caps, exterminating many land species.\n\n4. When day breaks, a human begins wasting resources with long showers and preparing to drive their coal burning vehicles to work.\n\n5. Some humans burn down other humans nests out of vengeance or delusion.\n\n6. Some humans dye the ocean black with oil, often even dyeing the animals within said ocean.\n\n7. Humans are very selfish and often abuse pets because they don't recognize the care such pets require.\n\n8. If a human sees an individual in distress, they can commonly be observed refusing to help out of self preservation or deindividuation.\n\n9. If a human hears a catchy sound bite, they'll mindlessly parrot it in front of others to the point of annoying them.\n\n10. Coughing is completely involuntary, and condemnable. Especially when the human doesn't properly cover their mouth to prevent spreading of viruses.\n\n11. Humans love sweets!! Some more than others. Many humans will not save these treats, and eat them all at once when they are need of comfort or reassurance. As the need for comfort increases, the volume of sweets increases..\n\n12. They're learning to build more sophisticated weapons to hurt each other. They're looking for another planet to inhabit because they know they're making their home planet uninhabitable.\n\n..... :D

22	Feel like you can do anything in life as long as your Will is strong and you have optimism?	Does anyone not feel limited by life at all? As in, whatever you want, you can get with enough effort and that ultimately everyone is living the life they want to live. 
10	> ultimately everyone is living the life they want to live. \n\nHehe this is a separate idea really, and "no".  \n\nI don't think I am nearly as limited as most by circumstance, or in some arenas by talent.  I am lucky that I can achieve most of what I actually want to achieve, and have so far done so.  I have learned a great deal over the years about how to choose realistic goals, how to manage myself, how to learn etc.  However I am older and a lot of doors are closed to me now.  The world is unknowingly bereft of the best ballerina/olympic squash playing astronaut it never knew.  \n\nBut yeah I am generally really life positive and feel empowered and capable.  Rawr.  \n\nOne needs a lot more than willpower though.  Besides I think it's generally a good idea to consult statistics and the experiences of those who have gone before.  Part of actually being capable is doing the work of planning... Not just considering what might be possible. 
3	This HWPO and "I can achieve anything" is very American (no pun intended!). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd obviously, it is bullshit. Yes, talent matters. You will very likely not reach the Top10 or even Top 100 or 500 in tennis, even if you put in 100000h of hard work.
3	I agree with what you're saying, but I'd like to add that there is one limiting part. It's other people. To accomplish some things, you need other people to believe in themselves. Confidence is a rare gem in the modern world. But then again, you can overcome that by improving your charisma and leadership qualities.
3	In theory, I guess... But I KNOW my body can never perform a typical elite gymnast's balance beam routine lest I want one of my balls cut off.
2	Yeah, pretty much
2	Yeah I feel that very hard! When I am interested in something and really WANT it, I am convinced that I will get it (and my life showed that this is true). The problem here is, that when I lose interest, there is no way I am going to put even a little effort into anything.
2	Yeah! I'm gonna fly off a building tomorrow - my will is strong enough to fly. 
1	Ruminating on the philosophy of your reality would lead you to some cognitive bias more than anything (WittyOriginalName pointed that out for you). Better be introspective and ask yourself: what is limiting me? why am I feeling like this? what can I do? what can I not control? This type of questioning focus directly on your needs instead of your wants. Wanting can be a good source of motivation, but wanting too often can leave you constantly unsatisfying 
1	Yea... when you are young and your balls are not yet broken into someone else's idea of how you should exist.
1	I used to feel that way when I was younger. But I realized that you shouldn't do anything just because you can. I've achieved some pretty cool/crazy things in my life that looking back, I wish I wouldn't have wasted my time with. It was all ego/pride. Now I tend to priorities and am more at peace. 
1	yeap, but I am a lazy fuck in EVRYTHING
1	I do feel limit by life all the time. Most of my projects, ideas and actions failed, some more miserably than others, and some of them succeed. But thats the thing, anything is possible but life will try to impose its limit on you, you just got to remind life that its a bitch and bitches cant keep winners from winning. I am positive about my outcome but sometimes during my struggle instead of driving myself with positive energy bullshit i imagine the life i’ll have to put up with if i failed and that rage, anger and hatred alone pushes me forward. Life is limiting, but its all about whether you gonna let that bitch limit you or you gonna do something about it instead.
7	LOST: My Mathematics Education	Hello everyone, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recently came across a really interesting piece written by a mathematician (I think? He doesn't have a Wikipedia page) named Paul Lockhart that is a criticism of the modern education system's take on mathematics. It really resonated with me, and in reflecting later I realized that my math education was as abysmal and lacking as he described. I remember very little from my math classes, and it is a hole in my education I would really like to fill. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, I don't want to just buy math textbooks since the ones I've encountered are extremely boring and lack any background nuance (precisely the problem Lockhart identified). So I wanted to reach out to my mathematically intrigued fellow ENTPs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn short, if any of you have good articles, guides, interesting papers or books, etc. that would help me to broaden my knowledge about mathematics generally and the history behind it, would you please share? Would very much appreciate any help! Thanks in advance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink to the article I mentioned: [https://www.maa.org/external\_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf)
6	As a mathematician I empathize with the position in the article.  But it is not a criticism on a “modern” take of mathematics.  It’s a criticism on the traditional way mathematics has been taught —for centuries.  But I don’t generally agree with the author’s main thrust. \n\nMathematics is truly an art rather than a science.  It can be said to be the art of patterns, but what are the materials of mathematics — the canvas, the ink and the paint?   It’s not simply *ideas* as the author suggests, it’s *logic*.  And logic is a cruel taskmaster.   Unlike painting, and music, and literature, there are no *happy accidents* in mathematics.  You cannot make a mistake and be correct, even if you get the “right” answer.  There is a necessity for the argument you are making to be rigorous, otherwise you are really just guessing and not doing mathematics.\n\nThis strictness and simplicity of the rules is exactly what allows math to have such seemingly infinite depths.  But those depths get forever more difficult to plumb. \n\nFor instance, when talking about the triangle in the square, the author says:\n\n> If I chop the rectangle into two pieces like this, I can see that each piece is cut diagonally in half by the sides of the triangle. So there is just as much space inside the triangle as outside. That means that the triangle must take up exactly half the box!\n\n“I can see” is not the same thing as “I have shown”.  In mathematics “seeing” is **not** believing.   Just because something *looks like* it should be something isn’t a convincing argument.  How does the author actually *know*. Incidentally the word mathematics comes from the Greek word “to understand”.\n\nFor example, take the pattern:\n\n1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ....  \n\nWhat does this add up to?\n\n(1 - 1) + ( 1 - 1 ) + (1 - 1) + ....  = 0 + 0 + 0 + ... = 0??.\n\nOr \n\n1 + (- 1 + 1) + ( - 1 + 1)+  (- 1 + 1) +  ....  = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0... = 1???\n\nTo answer this in a meaningful way needs a lot more rigorous logical machinery, otherwise both answers can be said to be correct....the most unforgivable sin in mathematics.\n\nLater, when the author talks about crossed lines he makes a similar statement.\n\n> In other words, the angles on both sides are the same. Well, duh! The configuration of two crossed lines is symmetrical for crissake. And as if this wasn’t bad enough, this patently obvious statement about lines and angles must then be “proved.”\n\nAgain the author here is actually *hijacking* physical reality for his argument.  It is a *fact* of Euclidean geometry that such a symmetry condition will make equal angles.  Since a sheet of paper is Euclidean, it’s *impossible* to draw it otherwise.  But in the very first paragraph, the author argues that mathematics is about *ideas*, free from the constraints of the physical world.  \n\nYou can’t have your cake and eat it too. \n\nThe truth is we don’t teach *mathematics* (the art of it) in grade/high school because many (most?) students are not equipped for such art.  We teach the basic mechanism of manipulating abstractions, like the “x” of algebra.\n\nThis is like learning how to draw. You first have to learn [how to see](https://artofsharingart.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/kitten-shapes1.jpg)\n\nBut those basic manipulations also serve a *practical* reason — which is why mathematics is also more than just an art.   \n\nMathematics is also a *language*.  It allows you to phrase and answer questions.  Before calculators, learning how to add and multiply was an important skill.  Even people working cash registers had to know how to “make change”.    Today such skills are all done automatically by the computers built into everything.  \n\nWe still teach them because they are the necessary foundation for more sophisticated ideas.   The *biggest* problem people have in learning calculus isn’t the *ideas*, it’s doing the formal algebraic manipulations because that lack facility in “solving for x”.\n\nTo you questions,\n\n> I remember very little from my math classes, and it is a hole in my education I would really like to fill.\n\nExactly what hole are you trying to fill?  What do you want to be able to do, that you cannot do now?\n\n> that would help me to broaden my knowledge about mathematics generally and the history behind it, \n\nIf you’re just looking for an overview of ideas, a sort of pop-sci version of math, then there are several good books.\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/183761.Concepts_of_Modern_Mathematics\n\nThis one is strait forward and touches on some of the neat ideas in mathematics without actually “doing the math” \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel,_Escher,_Bach\n\nThis is more fanciful, but excellently written and elegantly weaves together a lot of interesting ideas. \n\nThese will open your mind up to new ideas and will require you to think, but they won’t teach you how to do mathematics and they won’t give you more than a surface level understanding of the concepts.\n\nIt’s like trying to learn quantum mechanics from a pop-sci book.  You’re getting the ideas and the descriptions, but not the reasoning and derivations.  \n\nAnd in retrospect, it seems that’s just what Lockhart is lamenting...a focus on the “facts” of mathematics (like a description of a concept) rather than the understanding that comes from actually seeing how it all works.  \n\n\n\n\n
2	Little digressing here, but if you want to learn mathematics in a new approach you might want to consider computer science. Its built on logic, just like mathematics, and it does have a lot of links to different kinds of mathematics, and you can also code something to bring your maths and logic alive. If you are more interested in the logic side of things, competitive programming algorithms are a good place to start. 
1	Hi, depending of your level you will follow different approach... Actually I am a student (in computer science and passionate about datascience) but before that I worked as a chemist and had looooots of stuff to learn in mathematics.\n\nI can advise you to follow Khan Academy's math class, if you need some basics that's perfect until university, after that maybe you should follow your own path depending of your interest ;)
1	I am very interested in mathematics and how it applies to the world. \n\n**Get A Copy Of Euclid's The Elements.**\n\njust browse through it. you're need to brush up on math will be satisfied every single time you open this book. I got mine used for like $1 as part of a 20+volume philosphy bookset that I purchased Locally.\n\nOnline it's like 30-50 bucks new. I suggest you find a used one.\n\nHope that helps!
1	He mentions primary sources of mathematics. I did some searching and found this page, are there any others which may be more complete?  \n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/jeffsuzukiproject/guide-to-online-primary-sources-in-mathematics

4	Do ENTPs tend to badmouth people behind their back?	To give the question context, I'm crushing pretty hard on a colleague who is almost definitely an ENTP. (Sorry, I know 'relationship advice' posts are tedious.) I am pretty sure he feels the same, due to his blistering eye contact, teasing, occasional touches and regular calls/showing up in my room for no real reason etc. It could be casual flirting but I get the feeling he's into me. He have some really good conversations about a range of topics and I really enjoy the challenge that talking to him provides. However, this afternoon as I walked away from a brief chat in the hallway with both him and another colleague I heard him make a derogatory comment about my appearance. Assuming it had been a joke I turned back to counter with some sort of witty comment but the expression on both of their faces made me feel as though it wasn't intended to be heard. I'm not particularly sensitive about my appearance - objectively I know I'm quite attractive as I've worked as a model in the past - but I also don't put in anywhere near as much effort as the rest of the women I work with. Regardless, it stung a little; probably because I want him to find me attractive. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, my question is as above. As a generalisation, do ENTPs tend to be two-faced or bad mouth people behind their back? I dig the teasing but it's totally upfront. Would you typically comment about someone when they were not present?
35	Anything I say behind your back I would also say to your face. 
8	> Would you typically comment about someone when they were not present?\n\nYeah, sure. Everyone does. My thinking about other people doesn't stop the moment I don't see them. And I will share my thoughts when the context calls for it in conversation. No matter if it's good or bad.  \n\n\nWill I say them to someones face?  \n\n\nIf it's negative or could be hurtful, most likely not. Why would I bother the person with my subjective view of them, I'm not entitled to their time and listening grace to voice my judgment just because I have it. Unless of course they ask or it comes up in a context.  \n\n\n>Anyway, my question is as above. As a generalisation, do ENTPs tend to be two-faced or bad mouth people behind their back? \n\nIs sharing an opinion bad-mouthing. I thought it was more like making up shit about other person not having an opinion. Using derogatory expressions about coworker is unprofessional so wouldn't do in work setting. 
6	Ask.\n\nI rarely talk about people. More about ideas and possibilities instead.\n\nAs someone else said, if I say it about you, I'll say it to you. In this case, I'd have find a wife by now if girls I liked didn't make me wonder if I liked them. 
13	I’m badmouthing you right now in the entp clubhouse.  We have a special section just for INFJs which I’m assuming is what you are. 
5	from my experience, yes\n\nalthough I only know of two ENTPs and one is my dad, so I guess that one is bound to be true. The other was my BFF from college so, you know ...\n\nI don’t know if it’s an ENTP thing in particular though, I think that’s just what humans do. I can’t really verify the human part though because I’m an INTP, sorry.
7	I’m ENTP, I rarely speak about other people behind their back unless it is the topic of conversation. I try to not say bad things about people cause there’s no point but I think it is human nature to talk some trash. 
2	He probably wasn't joking about his opinion.  Perhaps that's something about you that bothers him.  One thing that I have found myself doing is verbally processing to person B how I feel or what I think about person A.  It's easier for me to understand my emotions if I talk about them, and that can go all the way down to physical appearance.  I usually do it when I've got a crush on someone.  *However*, being a somewhat decent human being, I usually go over those thoughts and fears in privacy and in confidence with someone I trust to be a good sounding board.  I sure as hellfire wouldn't do that in the office.
2	Just ask him out on a date. Be brave.
2	Ah, I'll put forth a slightly different perspective. I think we do, but without any intention of duplicity. We're just gossips - ENTPs are generally very curious about people and like to debate their strange decision-making. That being said, I agree with other posters that we're very unlikely to say something behind your back that we wouldn't also say to your face, should that topic come up. Generally, it's not so much that we're trying to undermine you, so much as you've done something weird and we're trying to figure you out by testing our personal theory about your weirdness on some other poor bastard.
1	The only time I talk about someone behind their back os to figure out if I'm reading them wrong or let off steam if they've pissed me off. Other than that, I don't shit talk, have way better things to do with my time. 
1	What did he actually say? \n\nPerhaps he was just nervous and said something stupid to cover up the silence betraying his love for you. \n\nIf he actually thinks you're ugly well that's his loss.
1	I’ve always said this is behavior of an ENTP with an enneagram 3. \n\nThey tend not to openly bad mouth others because they don’t like the idea of shaming people, but because it’s only naturally for everyone to talk about everyone, it comes out behind people’s backs unless they’ve consciously tried to correct this tendency. 
1	I would never talk shit about someone behind their back\n\nUnless they're a cunt in which case i dont really like them face to face\n\nBasically wouldn't be two faced
1	I do it every day to almost everyone. I trash everyone I know. Its not because I dislike them or have any beef. For me it allows to to gauge where other people are at in relation to their own personalities, their own convictions and is also a comedic output for me. The huge plus side is I fo not have very many arguments with people because any frustrations are vented elsewhere and I get over the issues.

7	How To Be As Productive As Warren Buffet - 5 Highly Effective Lessons	
1	Some good ideas here, some... less so. I think this is a great list for people who want to get rich above all else and are willing to sacrifice other aspects of their lives for that. ENTPs, who generally thrive on the new and different, are less likely to fit neatly into this model of personal development.\n\nAdvice I liked/will use: Narrowing down the 5 goals and eliminating the other 20, minimizing commute time, saying no more often to preserve your own time/sanity, focusing on deliberate learning 5hrs/week.\n\nAdvice that misses the mark for me: Saying no to anything that can't be justified as a "productive" activity, avoiding decision fatigue by dressing and eating the same every day.\n\nVariety is the spice of life, and my productivity and interest dip when I'm stuck doing the same thing over and over, so why eat the same damn breakfast every day or have a closet full of only blue oxfords and gray slacks? There's a place and a time to mix things up and remove oneself from the ruthless productivity mindset for the sake of one's immediate enjoyment of everyday life. I may not be a billionaire in 20 years, but I can still kick a reasonable amount of ass in my professional career while leaving time for family, friends, having a beer on a weeknight, taking a walk in the park just because... right?\n\nInterested to know others' thoughts on this.
5	For curiosity sake: Cat or Dog person?	I want to know the numbers of cat person and dog person that are ENTP. Type your answers below. You can also type Both or Neither if thats more your thing.\n\nThanks.
9	Cats and *sometimes* dogs. Dogs are just usually too smelly, gross and needy. The majority of people I know who have an inside dog have a house that smells disgusting. Plus there’s a cult mentality surrounding them that annoys me.
9	Cats
5	Dog
5	Dogs always. Cats are less social and always seem resentful that they need someone to take care of them, while dogs feel more like friends and less like reluctant roommates.
5	Dogs for sure.  I don’t mind cats, I have one, but a litter box is disgusting and cat pee is the foulest thing on earth.
3	Cats.  Dogs are so freakin needy.
8	Dog, and I simply can’t understand how people aren’t dog people. 
3	Owls.
2	Cat's 🐈\n\nDogs are too needy.
2	Cats - maine coone and norwegians. I love the floof. I like dogs too but I would prefer the smarter breeds
2	I like dogs more but I would rather have a cat since you don't have to walk it everyday! Takes too much responsibility.
2	Dogs! easy to train, useful to have around. 
2	Dog person all the way
1	Octopi have always captivated me. Something about their out of tank pilgrimages to off themselves.  Dogs also hold their own. They just don't kill themselves. Missing out on that Japanese honor the octopi have. Dogs are just doormat relationships for humans. \n\nI guess I sort of like those relationships though...
1	Love dogs, and WANT to love cats, but I’m allergic. Big disappointment.
1	Cats
1	I like cats more because I think felines look fiercer, are more independent and seem smarter tbh
1	Get both, create a pet army, conquer the world. 
0	Cats. I hate dogs
-1	In my mind it'd make sense to ask, for instance, cat or rabbit, but not cat or dog. The human-canine bond is culturally just on another level. So I would say both, although I would want them to be around for different reasons.
22	I HATE myself for thinking I’m smart.	So basically I’ve been called gifted and creative all my life and at first I didn’t believe it and then I noticed “everyone around me are idiots” and I’ve started to think of myself as smart. \n\nI usually see myself as intellectually superior to most people I meet. My three closest friend (that’s not saying much) are definitely smarter than me. But I always deem myself of higher intelligence when I meet someone new unless I instantly see them as geniuses. \nIt’s like a certain type of human in my head gets to be smarter than me and the rest are idiots.\nI’ve lost a close friend to this behavior.\nAnd I’m starting to hate myself because I don’t seem myself intelligent enough to be able to judge my own intelligence. I don’t trust myself even though I sometimes see myself as a god (not really but figuratively speaking).\n\nDunning Kruger effect says that the competent man will deem himself as less competent and the incompetent will deem himself as more competent. \nFUCK I HATE MYSELF HOLY SHIT.\nI can’t stand the fact that I am stupid.\nI should see a psychologist or something.\n\nI’m 16 and English is my third language I apologize in advance for typos.
41	> I’m 16 \n\nTime heals all wounds.
11	Eh, make more friends. Also I believe there are different kind of "smarts"-- there's the really common one, book smart and street smart, but I think there's way more than that. Social smart, skillset smart, et cetera. \n\nThere's often some things you learn from meeting "stupid" people too, so although they are "stupid" you still learned something. For example, now you learned that if a red flag of a trait X comes up, you should probably not waste your time, etc.
8	Self-awareness is always a step in the right direction.
4	Same. However most people forget that the Dunning-Krueger Effect begins to go up again as experience increases. In my experience, awareness of the Dunning-Krueger Effect itself doesn’t put people in that highly concentrated low-experience tier.
6	Just use this as motivation to go find some smarter people. High school is tough. Honestly, I think a lot of people pretend to be far stupider than they really are at that age.
4	I feel the same way about myself. The hatred doesn't go away lmao. Just be a good dude and give people credit and assume the best until proven otherwise. As you get older you start to realize how smart people are doesn't matter too much. How you treat people and if you can accomplish things matter way more. Be greatful people praise you and try not to prove them wrong. 
3	This is honestly a problem I’ve been going through lately glad to know not alone haha 
3	I think we are very curious beings and it is fucking glorious when discovering something true that relativises so much that is common bandwagonry. When people are not convinced by our discoveries we can isolate ourselves. \nThe problem is accentuated when we get insecure about the accuracy of our opinions and begin to judge ourselves. We have to be content with where we are while steadily keeping to a balanced routine to further meaningful goals.
3	Some great advice in these comments. I’ll add my (not so?) brief two cents:\n\nWhether you’re naturally very intelligent or not, you don’t have a ton of control over that natural ability. Dumb people don’t *choose* to be dumb. With that in mind, it doesn’t make much sense to use the “smart-dumb” framework to judge people or evaluate their worth. I’d suggest you try to shift your thinking towards the “disengaged-engaged” or “unambitious-ambitious” or “lazy-hard worker” spectrums, because, while also somewhat innate to an extent, these are qualities people can and do change about themselves. Take it from someone who’s been there: Learn to embrace a [growth mindset](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/), i.e. consider yourself as a constantly changing (hopefully improving!) individual whose success is dictated by the work you put in, rather than a fixed finished product who just happens to be permanently good at some things and bad at others. And see value in other people not for who they are right now, but for what they want to become and how hard they’re working to get there. In my experience, there are plenty of boring “smart” people and plenty of interesting “dumb” people, whereas ambitious people (“smart” or less so) are almost always interesting and intellectually curious, because they *care* about expanding their knowledge/abilities. As a typical procrastinating ENTP, I also find that surrounding myself with friends who are hardworking and passionate about something helps me go from head in the clouds fantasizing to actually executing those ideas – whether that’s fear of being left behind as others accomplish great things, or just having good influences. :)\n\nTL;DR judge people not by natural ability but by what they do with it, and judge yourself the same way.
2	[deleted]
2	Immediately judging everyone you meet is natural at 16. Cheers on your self-awareness :) yes, I have been there! "I hate myself for thinking I'm smart!" But every smart person knows self hatred does not get you very far and doesnt help anything. You might as well forgive yourself for being arrogant, accept the fact that you are highly intelligent, and just be as gracious as you can with your talents and intellect.\n\nI have had friends and sisters who get irritated if i use a big word or offer too much information... But I just started telling them, I'm sorry I'm smart. It's not my fault, it's just the way I am. (Basically, deal with it.)\n\n The older you get, the more variety of people you meet, the more intelligent and interesting people you will meet. When you are in school, intelligence, grades, competition are always on the surface. When you leave school you see people from different perspectives. Just remind yourself that less intelligent people usually have other valuable qualities you can look for and appreciate. And there are different kinds of intelligence--I can remember everything I read, but I cannot tune a piano or replace spark plugs or build a house. Lastly, remember that your intelligence is part of your person, not your entire identity. You also want friendship, hard work, patience, humor, and many other qualities that will define you as a person.
2	I've learned that what really matters in the end is your ability to learn new things. Even from the "the other half", the half that aren't so bright. Hangout with them, talk to them (without being arrogant or seeming superior - very important), share knowledge with them and you'll see that there's always some new stuff to learn about. At minimum, you'll be passing your own knowledge forward, and I guess this is always a good thing, don't you? Anyway, that's just my two cents. Hope you find your way on this matter.
2	Hating yourself accomplishes nothing.  Therefore hating yourself is not logical and not smart.  \n\nYour logical is "I dislike my behavior and I'm smart therefore my behavior is because I am smart" that argument doesn't hold. \n\nIf you don't like your behavior then find a way to change it.  Most people have something you can learn from them.  Emotional maturity, street skills, etc.  Pick the knowledge that you think will help you change the behavior you don't like, apply your intelligence, and learn it. Gratitude, appreciation, patience, humility, etc. \n\nThis is how I started keeping friends that I at first deemed less intelligent than myself. 
2	A lot of great comments here. I'd like to add, if you find yourself being judgemental, just take the time to rationalize with yourself and challenge your own bias. People have their own intelligence type [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory\_of\_multiple\_intelligences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences) and ways of perceiving the world around us. It's also important to note that just because you can't perceive their use of intelligence doesn't make them dumb.  \n\nIf I'm aware that someone thinks of me as inferior, I no longer view that person as being worth my time. I just label that person as a dumb twat and only engage with them on a superficial level.
2	> I don’t seem myself intelligent enough to be able to judge my own intelligence.\n\nThis will fluctuate. There will be days or periods of time where you are the smartest person in the room, and others where you will be the "least-smartest". It all depends on the topic of discussion. If it is something you find valuable or interesting or already know, you will feel very smart. Paradoxically, if it is something you dislike or do not find interesting, you will not feel as if you are contributing to the discussion.\n\n> I’m 16 and English is my third language.\n\nHow many other 16-year-olds know 3 languages??? \n\n
2	The biggest problem with ENTPs thinking they're very smart is one of the main things that leads us to being lazy. We think we know it all, so why try as hard as others at something that comes easy to us?\n\nMix that in with the million thoughts a day that could go somewhere one day and you end up being a very stressed out, lazy ENTP. I've found the best way to counter this is to do basically what you're doing with keeping smart friends, who are smarter than you, and remember that you are never a smart as you think (even though subconsciously, you know that's not true). But I've found that's what motivates me to get things done. The fact that anything anytime could happen and I wouldn't be able to handle it. 
2	Same here. 21 y/o, and I still often feel guilty for things that happened in past, and development of shitty habits. Also have occasional PTSD of shitty things that happened in past, while such things as home and family make me cringe and go on passive melancholic trips sometimes.
5	ENTP's crybabies, INFP's not crybabies, claims INFP. Thoughts?	
4	My best friend is an infp and let me tell you, she started crying when she thought she broke my already-broken chair. This was two years ago. We're 25 rn....
6	Infps and im talking of my experience ar sensitive to what theyre feeling and theyre so in tune with it, that it gives them a dettached and chill vibe, like if they were stonned all the time regarding emotional issues.Of course they can feel hard, and get this sad or emotional states where they literally retreat from peopple, but theyre fucking used to it, they have being goin trough it their whole lifes,when ur doing something ur entirety of ur life ur good at it would be illogic to think otherwise, and ask anyone do u think what u believe about something giving new input is less volatile that what u feel about any given topic?Or with good input ur able to change ur mind and think differently from what u did before? Isfp and infps ar both extremely chilled out because of this they put the enfasis of who they ar on theyre feelings, this gives them a very sensitive approach to everything but also sensitivity when coupled with creativity gives them a very detached and complex perspective, it does help that infps tend to be on the smarter side of the population (atleast on my experience).\n\nWhere do u think the negative estereotypes about infps came from? From them? or actually from peopple who knows theyre not a fighting type so they pick on them? Is like the negative estereotypes about entps and the judgements, they came from people who lack our creativity who lack our jack of all trades approach to pickeing new skills, most times when u see this kind of criticiziment it cames from some subjetive view the one making the critic have, it cames from inside of them, theyre projecting some insecurity or some problem they have, i have had this convo with my enfp and esfp friends and at first i thoug theyre were full of shit, but over the years i see it more and more most times people criticize others is because they lack something those others have.\n\nI dont know maybe ill start lurking their subreddit and pming every single one of them im extremely surprised about how much people dislike that type.
2	Yeah that’s about right with her.  The idea of looping does kinda sound stupid but I’ve researched it enough for myself and it makes sense.  Basically when you are really stressed out, emotionally unhealthy, etc. and the second function becomes underused so you can find comfort in the “ten year old” tertiary function - basically even if you have this little birdie saying “maybe stop and think about that” you decide no, I’m just going to do what I’m doing; tunnel\nvision that inhibits growth.  For an ENTP that can look like a real shitshow without logic to uphold interactions between Ne and Fe (I was insane in college, truly wasn’t thinking at all sometimes, surprised I survived actually).  With Fi-Si, INFPs can lose sight of possibilities and hope when they get that far down in their funk.  For instance she’s been in a bad way lately and we talked for a while and I asked her about it and she admitted she wasn’t interested in doing anything new or exciting, she was just retreating to the same old daily motions and everything is dictated by her stress and feelings and feeling needy but ignoring branching out to try to snap out of it even though she knows that would help.  In years that have been better she has often been the one to organize events and come up with really fun ideas and ways to be close to her favorite people and she seems to have just completely lost that this last year or two.  Hoping this get together will help get her creative wheels lubed up, if you will, so she can move forward a bit more.
1	This is complete rubbish. Crying emotional outbursts?! \n\nThat would never happen ..\n\n\n\nDamnit I need a tissue.. brb
1	Absolutely 
1	Because INFPs would never delude themselves....
17	Debate Proposal: You can care without having an emotional attachment	I was talking to another ISTP who was essentially saying that empathy is a useless skill because it just gets in the way of logical thought. While I disagree, he finished off by saying "you can care without having an emotional attachment." I'm not sure where I stand on this and so I thought I'd bring it to the experts.  So have at it. Do you agree or disagree and why?
13	See English isn't a great language for this type of discussion.  There are different kinds of caring.  One can care emotionally, and one can care intellectually.  I care emotionally about my family.  If they get hurt I am also hurt due to that emotional connection.  On a smaller level, I care emotionally about grammar, and I get quite irritated when people text me, "Wat r u doin?"  It *bothers* me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI care intellectually about starving children on the other side of the world.  I don't want them to be starving, but I'm not going to cry over it.  I intellectually care about my outfits when I get dressed in the morning.  I like to look good, but in the end I'm satisfied so long as I'm clothed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes that help?  What do other folks think?
5	This is *precisely* the argument that Paul Bloom proposed in his book *Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion.* He essentially wages war on empathy, calling it *innumerate, myopic, prejudiced, insufficient* and even *selfish*. It's quite jarring at first, but then he begins to paint a picture of all the ways empathy fails us as a society, and can often be harmful to society, or worse—weaponized.\n\nSome examples are that many deeds that are morally good don't stem from empathy, E.g. voting and picking up litter. Hence there is another guiding force behind moral actions that *aren't* founded on empathy. \n\nBloom even argues that many acts founded on empathy ate harmful. For instance, a parent who refuses to let their child suffer short term for long term benefit (hence spoiling them). Even further expanded: if a doctor were performing surgery on you, you *want* a detached doctor who isn't crying while feeling your pain. \n\nAs such, he claims that emotions cloud the underlying rational principles that guide our morally good actions, and should be absolutely thrown away with in the realm of morality. \n\nHere's [a review](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/06/against-empathy-paul-bloom-the-empathy-instinct-peter-bazalgette-review) if you're curious, I highly recommend the book. Here's a [summary](Https://brandgenetics.com/speed-summary-against-empathy-the-case-for-rational-compassion/) as well (again I still suggest the book itself)
6	I think the ISFP is wrong. Empathy is far from useless as it will allow you to succeed in life. You CANNOT be an effective leader without empathy.\n\nHowever, the ISFP is right that  "you can care without having an emotional attachment." and in fact you should care without having an emotional attachment. When you are emotionally attached to an argument it devolves the issue into baseless ad hominem attacks. Sadly I witnessed this behavior on this very subreddit when Jordan Peterson was brought up. Some people have little control over their emotions and it hampers their ability to engage rationally.
2	A little of both. I agree that you can care without having an emotional attachment; for example, if a friend’s family member passed away, I would care but not experience regret or really any sense of loss for my future.\n\n\nI don’t agree that empathy is a useless skill at all though. In fact, it can be useful no matter what the intention is. People will do more for someone they trust, and someone who clearly makes no effort to understand/relate to others is generally not considered trustworthy. Why try to work or be friends with someone who makes no effort to understand you? It’s exhausting.
1	I think the key separation here lies in weather or not your 'caring' comes from a sense of justice or fairness, rather than morality or harmony, sympathy.... Ie, weather or not you step outside of a problem, or inside of a problem, to fix it. The latter - in both instances - implies an emotional attachment (while the former does not). 
1	It depends what you would call emotional. \n\nEmotional attachment being love or anger, then yes. You can care without emotional attachment if that is what you mean.  \nIf you say emotional attachment on psychological level, then I'd argue no. In a very stripped down explanation - emotions are way to structure importance of everything one experiences. For example you will not attach any emotional value to choosing a pen to write with, but will attach overly big significance to your crush looking your way. In that sense not only emotions would be hard to separate from experience of oneself, it would also make caring equal emotional investment in whatever the stakes are.
7	Social Hierarchy: Conform?	The way I view social hierarchy is that it's a scale of most influence - least influence, and if it's an already-established hierarchy then I will continue following it while any new ones are fair game. So back when I was younger and was a social recluse and believed I was nothing but an introverted nerd, I was clearly towards the bottom of the hierarchy. Even until now, whenever I'm with a group of people from that stage of my life, I tend to act more withdrawn or try to avoid such a situation entirely. In a situation containing mostly strangers however, I think it's up to me to decide exactly how much influence I want to have over that particular group of people. I'm not great at talking (grew up as a recluse) so I'll never be top dog but I'm fine with that, I prefer to know everyone individually by reaching out first so that, should I ever need to, I know how to play my cards right. I can't deal with social hierarchy drama though, I find it tedious and a terrible waste of energy, so usually I end up being the person that doesn't obviously have a lot of influence but somehow knows enough people/knows to ask the right questions that I can exert that influence when necessary.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?
3	I always aim for the top positions.\nWherever I enter, I want to be at the top spot so no one can stamp on me.\nMake a few friends of different sorts and then push yourself to the top by branching out.\nOr by showing that you are loud or tough, people normally seem to back down enough for you to control the situation. I do this at school and cadets.\nMy size also helps in this power struggle.
1	Depends. If other people fight for the top spot, and I respect them, then I don't bother.\nIf other people fight for it, and I can't stand them, well, I make very sure to get there first.\n\nSame, if there is an established hierarchy, and I respect the ones at the top - fine my me.\n\nIf they aren't fit for the position, I won't even climb to their level, I will just fly above them. 
9	ENTP x ISTJ relationship?	Okay big question time, what do you think of those types in relationship? Have you ever had one? If so, then what is your experience?\n\nPersonally, I've never been in relationship with ISTJ but I find myself drawn to them quite easily. I feel like they're quite analictical and have things under control. It'd be very helpful expecially in moments when my hypochondria takes over and they don't panic and I don't panic that much too cause I'm usually quite sure that if something were to happen, they can handle the situation and do what is needed.
8	Don’t listen to the negative people. My wife is an ISTJ and we have been together for 12 years. We have two kids together. She is awesome and she keeps me grounded. I couldn’t imagine a better type for me as a wife. 
5	#no. \n\nAn ISTJ will drive you absolutely nuts. The one I dated was a "special" case, but I can see the personality conflict even with a healthy one. They are very rigid, by-the-book, literal thinkers. Unless they are very understanding and hands-off about your desire to mix things up and be spontaneous, you'll very quickly start to feel boxed in. If you get with one that is even the least bit controlling, it's pure hell. 
5	I was in a relationship with one for 3.5 years. It was a really stable relationship and we never fought, ever. We could have great discussions  and he really found my enthusiasm endearing. We also didn't ever do anything, and had no adventure whatsoever (something I crave). When I brought up needs that involved him breaking out of his shell he pretty much shrugged it off and was unwilling to change at all. He was 100% content with every day being exactly the same and was really not great at expressing affection (not flirty at all). We're still friends and we get along pretty similarly to how we did in the relationship, which kind of speaks to why we broke up. That's just my experience though; anecdotal.
6	I've been a romantic relationship with an ISTJ for 5 years! Obviously, as with most relationships, there are challenges. However, there's a great benefit with me helping him come a little more out of his shell (as well as more open to experience), and him helping me be more realistic and grounded.\n\nISTJs are definitely pretty analytical and in-control. I like their calmness, their steadfastness, and their practicality, particularly since I'm so lacking in that final department. Are they perhaps a little rigid? Yes, but there's a spectrum. I'd say my ISTJ is quite rigid in some ways, and more open-minded than others. He responds very well to a logical argument, so it's easy to get through to them in that way. I find that if I'm able to present facts to back my arguments, he's usually open to listening.\n\nThe real rigidity lies, IMO, in certain habits and certain emotional postures. I'm definitely an ENTP, but he makes me feel like an ENFP. In the immortal words of Hermione Granger, he has the emotional range of a teaspoon. I find this quite astonishing at times, but also helpful. His lack of emotional insight means there is little room for change in the way that he deals with emotional situations. However, his lack of emotionality more generally means significantly less emotional maintenance, which is good for me, because I really cannot take care of someone's feelings for an extended period of time.\n\nThe biggest conflict is definitely Ne/Si. Contrary to popular opinion, I do think ISTJs can be curious - they're just curious about the particular type of screw used to fasten a bolt, rather than whether the tower of turtles goes all the way down. Sometimes, this is great. I lack Si, so it's extremely relieving to have somebody make sure I do my taxes right and purchase the correct groceries. Also, to make sure I don't run into traffic. \n\nOther times, it can be frustrating. He is utterly confused by my endless abstract hypotheticals about, for example, government surveillance by way of robotic pets, meaning that those types of conversations can very easily (and do) reach a premature dead end. I think that if I didn't have as intellectually demanding of a job, I'd probably run into problems with boredom. As it stands, I listen to people yammering about hypotheticals 10-12 hours per day, so... coming home to him is the biggest breath of fresh air because it's no bullshit.\n\nAlso, he takes care of me! Way better than I take care of him! I consider myself extremely lucky to have found an ISTJ. It really does help, I think, that he's on the more laid-back end of ISTJs, while I'm an ENTP who at least *tries* to get her shit together. I'm also quite introverted for an ENTP, which means we enjoy a lot of video and tabletop gaming nights together :)
2	They are a more stiff version of INTJ. They are more present-oriented instead of future-oriented (INTJ). INTJ and ENTP goes well together because they are both open-minded and logical. They like to discuss and learn in order to figure out of things. Other than that, I do not know much about the match except they score a little bit low in the MBTI compatibility. If you are an 7w8 (type 7 with wing 8) I would like to guess it's more likely to succeed together with an ISTJ than the other enneagram types and wings. \n\nISTJ goes well together with ESFP and ESTP because unlike ENTP, these two types does not need all the logical questions and answers as ENTP normally crave. Another type of grounding if you may. INTJ ground the ENTP often on pure logic and ideas. In many cases it seems like the ENTP appreciate the intellect. ISTJ follows the book almost regardless of discussions (stubbornness), that can perhaps be tough in the long-run? I'm not an ENTP. That's up to the ENTP to decide. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese were just my thoughts.
2	Im an entp, dads an istj. Nice guy but dealing with his thought process is pure hell for me. Again, he’s a nice guy
2	They're great for ENFPs.  I wouldn't worry so much about what type either of you are.  You might be wrong about both, and pretty much everyone is wrong about everything on the internet.  If you dig spending time together then do that.  If you wanna touch each other's special bits, then do that.  
2	ISTJs are not necessary cool in an emergency situation. They can panic.\nThey follow the rules, don't really see the fun in breaking them. They are loyal and organized, and in many ways 'safe'. They can be very judgemental, but in a way I personally find fun and liberating.\nIf you want a mindmate or a soulmate, don't go for the istj. If you want a safe and easy relationship, with no drama and with someone who will always take care of you, go for the istj. 
51	Game changer for an ENTP	Dear fellow ENTP-A's.\n\nAfter I found measurable and valid scientific arguments, I have started doing mindfulness and incorporated it in many daily situations (conversation, when overthinking, when being annoyed by ignorance, before I talk in crowds etc.) and it has been a real game changer. \nMy mind is much more focused on what's important, I don't overthink, I'm a way better listener, because I'm actually present. When I study or work I'm able to concentrate on the goal  (before I would use much longer time on fx writing a scientific paper, because I would end up reading and thinking a lot of unnecessary science only mildly linked to the paper). When contemplating my next move, the "contemplating "- part I have found to be more solid, because I now can almost fully stop my first thoughts, and truly percieve other options before deciding. \nBefore I would more often speak my mind even if it was a unwise choice. \nPeople around me has noticed and even commented on it, without knowing exactly what has changed, I seem more "balanced" and "calm". \nI only wanted to share my experience after almost a year of positive experiences both in relations and work/study life, simply because I wish I had done it years ago. \n\nPlease correct my English! 
36	My unconventional mindfulness and meditation is called “smoking weed”
10	I think mindfulness IS good for our type. How do you, personally, start mindfulness and incorporate it into your day? 
7	I tried it, it's kinda hard for me to be 20 min doing nothing.
4	I am puzzled about the difference between mindfulness & meditation. Are they really the same?\n\n I'm a calm person but when I even start to download a meditation app it makes me a little angry. Over the years each attempt at meditation left me anxious. I thought all ENTPs wd. rather curl up in a tight ball before quieting their mind. So I congratulate you if you've learned to meditate. And self discipline is not a huge part of some ENTPs. We all vary within types. I'd really like to hear from other ENTPs. Maybe I alone have a problem with meditation.
6	I think mindfulness is incredible important for all intuitive doms since we tend to be in our heads too much. I am an INFJ who will be starting practicing mindfulness this year. It's good to hear success stories from fellow N doms!
2	I agree. Adopting mindfulness practices as a way of living (which is quite not the same as sitting down for a 10 minutes meditation session in the morning and then forgetting about it) has changed my life as well. Some people would argue that I am less 'striving' now but I guess that was exactly the point of my inner transformation. Most profoundly, mindfulness enabled me to switch my focus from *what* I want to have (accomplish) towards *how* I want to life. 
2	The Calm app sounds good.
2	ok so how do you do mindfulness... 
2	headspace is a good app for this. you can get it for a year for like 10 bucks if your a student
2	Good answer that meditation is about inner state which is about emptying the mind. I think an introverted intuitive might thwart anxiety and achieve a higher plane of thought while meditating, but as a hard core ENTP, intuitively I feel wouldn't. I think it's a blind spot I don't see or can't see similar to color blindness.\n\nMindfulness is a different place that I like quite a bit. I differentiate the two. Anyway my body & mind & intuition say no so far to meditation, strongly no. \n\nI listen to my intuition. I think about something first then check my gut. It's wrong sometimes but mostly it's not. I believe the reason I don't want to meditate is that I scored higher in thinking than intuiting. I think emptying my mind a bridge too far for me.
1	\n\n\nfor mindfulness I suggest trying one or more of these:\n\n- https://wakingup.com (free & paid app)\n- https://www.headspace.com (free & paid app)\n- https://palousemindfulness.com (more comprehensive 8 week course, free but no app)\n\nfor non-directive meditation I suggest trying:\n\n- https://www.1giantmind.com (free & app)
1	Starting a mindfulness meditation has helped me a lot. That and regular daily (and FUN!) exercise.\n\nNow trying to make meditation practice a daily habbit. God damn that is hard.
1	As an ENTP-A , I've got to say that I absolutely hate obeying standard rules of doing things. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a even harder time convincing myself something is even worth doing, *unless it has legitimate future-payoffs*. I can see the benefits of being more balanced, more calm, using my strengths to get more done, and even improving my weaknesses. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems like everything *I'm expected to be*, is what I don't feel like becoming. That's probably why I left my **Real Job** to work online. That's probably why I also decided to **become a pirate.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**There's one hindering fact in my life:** I don't want to be like ***them***. I don't want to ***conform***. I hate ***~~useless rules~~***. I particularly dislike maintaining a ***public appearance***. I want all the benefits, but none of the change. There's no driving passion. I enjoy overthinking. I like putting things off. I enjoy jumping head first into every idea. \n\n**"Do You Want To Be Great PuhPuhPirate?"**\n\nYes, And i want to be the best version of myself.\n\n***"Do You Want To Follow Other's rules To Do It?"***\n\nNo, Most people are failures. Most rules are erroneous. \n\nIt's all just about how much money you can make. That's how people judge you.\n\nThat's what 90% of people are trading their lives for.\n\nSo I'll do things my own way. Even when I fail, I still Feel like a winner.
10	So what exactly would be the difference between ENTP-A and ENTP-T?	I don't know how it has blown past me because I thought I knew the differences but this and r/mbti subs have given me mixed information so I'm just profoundly lost. 
20	T is for Turbulent (like me).  We are ENTP's at our core, but tend to mold our personality to whatever is around us.  I am an ENTP, but I'll act differently depending on the situation.  A is for Assertive (not like me).  Assertive folks are their type in any situation.  An ENTP-T might act like an INFP or an ESTJ if the situation required it.  An ENTP-A will always act like an ENTP in any situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI acted like an INFP around a previous boss, because convincing her that I was a bit air-headed and shy was absolutely necessary to my survival in that hell of a workplace.  I act like an ESTJ or an ENTJ in emergency situations because I know how to take control and make decisions (and I get sick of people screaming).  I'm an ENTP-T.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy brother-in-law is an ENTJ-A.  He is an ENTJ in EVERY situation and cannot change himself to adapt to circumstances.  He is an ENTJ when my sister is pregnant and crying about ice cream (a gentler approach might be better), and he's an ENTJ when working on a group project (even if nobody wants him to take charge).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's my understanding of it.
16	ENTP-A = liking ass\n\nENTP-T = liking tits\n\nSo which one are you? 
13	From what I understand, the difference is that someone with the T (Turbulent) has higher neuroticism. It’s not actually part of the Meyers-Briggs.
2	I wonder how you would help a more turbulent ENTP to develop so s/he becomes less turbulent. I mean, is there anything positive in having higher levels of neuroticism? 
1	https://www.16personalities.com/articles/identity-assertive-vs-turbulent\n
8	Career strengths?	Is it just me or is the whole 'chaotic nature' thing very helpful in a workplace or paid hobby? Like Im just curious, Im a welder in college, and Ive been giving a couple awards for my skill in welding, (family of welders) but what sticks out to me from the others is this apperent "Yea ------ just makes his own ideas and rules and it just works" and it does, i love it, but does this occur in other places of study?
4	I think it helps you come from a family of welders and basicslly grew up in it. Thats a lot of extra time/knowledge/experience most people dont get.\n\nDont think it has anything to do with your personality type
2	I think it depends on a lot of things. I can narrow down to two...\n\n1. the culture / environment of your workplace and especially the people you work with day to day. Are their work styles compatible with the scatterbrained and typically disorganized mad scientist style that works for us? Just because we’re getting our own work done doesn’t mean that conflicts won’t arise based on different expectations of communication, progress updates, frequency of check-ins, e-mail response time, etc (clearly I work an office job)\n\n2. The nature of your work - again, this must be compatible with your natural work style. If the daily grind makes you miserable and you feel like it’s just busywork, you’re not gonna perform. You’ve got to find a work situation where you can have your own strategy and people trust you to have your own process and still produce good work. Unfortunately in a lot of jobs this is not the case 
1	I still don't know how to use my hands so I doubt it's a personality related thing. You grew up in a family of welders, you have seen how it's done all of your life so naturally ( Si ) you will become good at it.
1	I’ve had jobs where my own ideas and work style did not mesh.  Even now I have trouble doing paperwork properly or on time (ugh paperwork) which can cause issues on occasion but I work in a hardware store/lumberyard now where I do a variety of tasks including design and sometimes hands on stuff.  I have more “just wing it” opportunities that my employers/co-workers can appreciate, sometimes delving happily into situations that they do not want.  Truth is though, if I had more freedom to do things like build furniture we could sell like vanities, etc. I would be using my abilities to the best and we would make money that way, but no one would invest in my whims and carpentry/design skills (I’ve definitely got them by being taught by others over the years (Si) or by winging it/you tubing/reading to make it work (Ti)).  Too bad they need me for things I prefer to do less, but they still otherwise let me do it my way mostly because if it was too rigid an environment I would say peace out and they know that and they would not at all want me to leave.
1	I work as a Relationship Banker and the job keeps me on my feet and fairly motivated as of now, but I just got into the role. I’ll hit my year with it and will be well into being thirsty for something deeper.
1	Personally, as someone who's worked in marketing, you described me perfectly at my last job. I had no formal education and was just doing my thing, yet I was really, really good to the point of also receiving awards and such. I really love my passion :)
5	You Get 86,400 Seconds Daily (Time Management Tips)	
4	Big 5 vs MBTI	Which is more consistent? or reliable?\n\nWhich would be more useful to predict behavior or interests? (career interests)\n\nwhy do you guys like the Jungian model?\n\n[https://www.psychologistworld.com/tests/jung-archetype-quiz](https://www.psychologistworld.com/tests/jung-archetype-quiz) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
7	I hate the Big 5 and MBTI but I really hate Big 5 because when MSM says 'these are the personality traits that will ..... ' and they use Big 5, its really obvious shit. e.g. 'Agreeableness will get you to be liked more!' Like no way! MBTI is fun because of the community but I hate it when people use it as horoscopes.
5	Big five is the only empirically useful of the two, however it isn't really useful for choosing a career.  Mbti is a product designed to be used in selecting a career, and there is some other interesting data besides...  However it's a shit testing instrument so you might want to bring a big salt shaker.  \n\nIn terms of understanding yourself and others from a psychodynamically derived personality model, I strongly suggest you focus primarily on Jung himself.  He lamented that mbti missed a lot of key ideas, and the shit that came after is even gnarlier in my opinion.  \n\nJung was really about developing a model for understanding the psyche, expressly for the purpose of treating people who got STUCK in a rigid or disordered type.  Types were things that people tended towards, but personifying a type is a diseased state.  He believed that people should think more fluidly, and that healthy people should be difficult to type without extensive interaction and discussion.  It's not really different from what big five is for, but big five is again empirical.  \n\nContrast that with people attempting to make his model fit every aspect of human experience.  Warping function definitions, making types a supposedly rigid construct, etc.  If you look for a few minutes you will find plenty of mistypes rampantly making shit up about the functions and types, using themselves as a model.  The short version of jung is in the sidebar.  \n\nAgain in terms of exploring how personality might be empirically related to relationship/personal growth, various mental disorders, problem solving abilities, etc, big five is really the best. But you can't easily figure out someone's big five without a test, or gain useful insights without a fuckton of study.  Real people are extremely complex.  
0	I score the highest on openness and lowest on agreeableness. The other three are roughly the same. Would be good to hear what other ENTPs get.

8	How do you ENTP's complete your tasks	In my family we have these certain kind of thing we do every year (I'm pretty sure some of you do too) and that is writing our New Years goals/dreams/whatever for that year... The thing is I'm terrible when it comes to do them but, when it comes to writing those down, damn... I can fill a whole page within a minute or two. And every year I get upset because I can't complete even a couple of them for different reasons like: O get too excited when writing some of them, maybe I get bored of doing them or (my personal favorite)  I Just keep postponing them.\n\nThis Last one really makes me mad because, eventhough it isn' t something hard to do, I Just can't start it.... I feel frustrated afterwards and Just keep repeating the procesa every day until I give up on my intentions of starting it....\n\nBesides that, sometimes I do the things I'm supposed to do like homework, chores, hobbies or even going out w/friends because I feel somehow foreced? Or obligated eventhough I chose those tasks by myself because I wanted to do them initially... So help me please :) 
7	Pressure. Work hours. Novelty. And curiosity.
5	Pomodoro method. And nootropics. 
4	The worst thing is we are aware of our procastination.\n\nMe: Okay, this task is very important, you have a limited amount of time to complete it.\n\nAlso me: Lets watch some Ben Shapiro debates, wont do any harm, would it?
3	WHY DO WE PROCRASTINATE SO MUCH GAAAH

2	Lists. If something is on a list I have to do it. Also managing different lists and categorizing things ist super fun, because it brings the much needed order in my life.
1	I complete my tasks... Tomorrow. 
1	Just because your type is an ENTP, this doesn't mean that you are excused from developing discipline and good habits. I am into personal development and I don't care about my type limiting my goals. Of course since I am an ENTP my natural tendency is to procrastinate and not finish things.\n\nBut discipline can be developed by every type. In fact as an ENTP your critical parent is Te which will always be a pain in the ass for you. This function will get you to be disciplined and organized.\n\nIt is not about your type but about your development. Maybe it is not natural for us to complete tasks, but if we know that the task is important and has a reason, we can push ourselves to completion. It takes willpower and discipline.

26	Smoking weed just ONCE could change a teenager's brain	https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6590927/Smoking-weed-just-change-teenagers-brain.html\n\n> They found differences in the volume of grey matter in the amygdala and the hippocampus.\n\n> These sections are involved with emotions, fear, memory development and spatial skills – changes to them suggests smoking cannabis could affect these faculties. \n\n\nMaybe this is why there's so many ESFPs.
20	so basically it says almost nothing except for "we are not sure, but it's probably bad"
10	Honestly, teenagers will always smoke weed. It’ll never stop, just like a study on the impact of alcohol on the developing brain will never stop teens from drinking. I think what’s more important is simply making teenagers aware of the psychological/emotional issues that are clearly present and that can arise when smoking weed. Instead of saying “You are going to become STUPIDER on weed!”, I think we should be paying attention to the fact that weed can cause anxiety in some people or even a psychotic break in people who are predisposed to mental illnesses.\n\nPersonally, I know weed caused me to have panic attacks and that’s why I don’t smoke it. However, if I saw an article with the title you just gave and then read through it in High School I would probably have blown it off and thought it was bullshit because of the lack of sufficient evidence- same with most other teens I know/knew. I’m not saying it’s correct, I’m not saying it’s incorrect- all I’m saying is that until studies can be more specific and less vague about things such as using “smoked once or twice”(literally why once or twice? If it is so, so impactful that if can mess up the brain once, why are they grouping the ones who did it twice into the group that did it once? That doesn’t make sense)...or enunciating on the word “ONCE” like it’s literally the worst thing on the planet, the majority of teenagers and even adults aren’t going to listen or give a shit about this.\n\nAll this article does is make fear monger parents which in turn makes teens want to rebel more. 
3	That article is bad, it says nothing concrete.\n\nHowever smoking weed once is enough to trigger the manifestation of underlying psychotic conditions in some people. That doesn't mean that those conditions wouldn't arise later in life, and also doesn't mean that some people has propensity to manifest said conditions but never really experience them in their lifetime (even after smoking and abusing weed).
4	ITT: *totally* reasoned arguments for why weed isn't bad for you 👌🏻 great use of Ti, fellow "ENTPs" 
2	Oh my stars!  My precious identity as an intellectual paragon!  \n\nI'm not promoting the idea that teenagers should get stoned.  I am promoting the idea that being so concerned with one's identity as a temple to intellect is divorced from the experiential nature of Ne.  \n\nIt would be very hard to argue that drugs don't fuck with your neurological development.  Had I kids I would hope they held off from using pot through 25.  I would council them to do so.  However why is this here?  Lol.  Like post 25, especially if one isn't on track to really do some remarkable shit at that point.... I really hope my kids will get high with me in their 20s.  Life is too short to get hung up on Fi bullshit like delusions of precious special intellect.  
3	Literally doing anything changes your brain. 
1	Sugar changes the brain too! Chocolate is the gateway drug for food /s\n\nHaving said that substance abuse causes serious problems like psychosis and depression. Plenty of people can freak the fuck out on grass. \n\nKeith Richards is still alive.\n\n\n
1	I'v not read it but i believe this to be true. My memory used to be.....perfect, it was incredible. I tried weed at 14 or 15 and it changed almost instantly. I smoked it occasionally after that and now in my mid 20's i haven't smoked it in years. 
1	Can't read the study unfortunately because it's behind a paywall, but a key point to emphasize is that this was most likely an observational study (probably cohort) based on what the researchers said in the article. \n\nThat means there could be a number of underlying factors that could help explain the difference in brain matter composition, not necessarily the (alleged) use of cannabis. To simply ask some teenagers whether they used cannabis or not and then doing a compare/contrast of their scans leaves a lot of questions unanswered. But, I understand there's only so much the researchers can do considering the substance is illegal; they can't administer it to the kids themselves to have more control over variables. \n\nThe strength of evidence is not especially noteworthy considering that the consensus based on meta analysis over the past few decades in academia has been that cannabis is kind of a grey area (no pun intended) when it comes to psychological affects. I'd like to see studies based on stricter methods to show stronger evidence for the correlation that's being claimed. 
1	Could ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
1	In a bad way or good way?
1	Well, we can't stop the young uns. But I think as long as they're functional and not being a stoner stereotype (not going to school / work, failing classes b/c can't stop being high etc), I really don't care. My uncle drank and smoked often in high school and 20 years later, he's the richest one in my family (high 6 figure salary) & owns a business & does whatever the hell he wants, and he's def not an ESFP- very ENTJ. \n\nTLDR; Maybe the reason why there's "so many ESFPs"-> maybe ESFPs are more vulnerable when they hit the joint for the first time?? idk, am not a scientist, but now very successful ENTJ Uncle was a smoker and drinker in HS
1	Anyone else here feel that weed helps you to avoid wasting excessive time on something?
1	I smoke a ton of weed, have since I was a late teen.\n\nI still test as XNTP.
1	I smoked excessively in my teens and early 20s and it certainly did some damage. My memory sucks and there's all sorts of other stuff that I won't go into detail here. However I still test 130 IQ and can absorb complex knowledge faster than most so it's not like you're irredeemably fucked if you smoked once. \n\nStill, I would be a completely different person if I never smoked weed. If I had kids, I would do everything to stop them from doing the same mistakes.

6	Some Questions About Some Specific Manifestations of My Cognitive Functions	Hey fellow ENTP's. I should start by admitting I am fairly novice in my understanding of this typing system as a framework for describing people, so bear with me. \n\nMy introduction to this whole arena started with the 16 Personalities MBTI test, which I now understand is not known to be particularly accurate or precise. \n\nRegardless, I originally tested as an ENFP but revisiting the same test later I was placed as ENTP twice consecutively. Following this everytime I've taken it I have gone back and forth between the two and my Feeling/Thinking scores always come out as, or very close to, 51/49 or vice versa. \n\nAfter using other methods which isolate more specific functions the results almost always show that my Fi and Ti are much stronger than both my Fe and Te, though my Ti has been a little stronger than my Fi on many occasions. I can relate strongly with many ENTP stereotypes like our slightly autistic/obnoxious personalities, but I find myself, more often than not, defining my life by and seeing the most meaning in my emotions. I can also very easily identify with the trickster archtype which seems to be the domain of the ENTP. \n\nAs would align with this, I very often am last in thought and am greatly intrigued by abstract thinking, however I have noticed in myself somewhat of a fixation on the aesthetics of these ideas. By which I mean that though thinking and ideas are important to me, more often than not it is the way these ideas *feel* that guides the way I understand them. Additionally, if it makes any difference, I have noticed that I have a very strong tendency towards INFPs and that these are my most successful relationships.\n\nAll of this has been on my mind lately and I hope some of the better versed members of this sub can help me better understand the system in general as well as where I fit in to all of this.\n\nTL;DR: Many signs point in conflicting directions and I am struggling to understand whether I would be an ENTP or ENFP or something else entirely
5	>though thinking and ideas are important to me, more often than not it is the way these ideas feel that guides the way I understand them.\n\nThis here really highlights your preference. This is *de facto* feeler logic. The thinking/feeling dichotomy can be defined as object-oriented logic vs people-oriented logic. Thinkers will attempt to strip any emotional biases that they see as clouding their logic. Feelers will embrace emotional coloring of logic as meaningful to the full picture. \n\nThis is what gives thinkers their often cold impressions, especially to feelers. It's what gives thinkers their stereotypical *rational* side. Though feelers are also rational as well—that is how Jung defined T and F, as rational functions. So it's important to distinguish what Jung meant by rational (judging—reasoned functions) and colloquial rational (thinking domain—the stereotype of logical, strict logic).\n\nPerplexing to me is how you begin your post by suggesting you're ENTP (beyond testing as one, you speak of "fellow" ENTPs) yet the rest of the post highlights uncertainty. This usually indicates Feeling colored logic. \n\nI'm fairly confident in suggesting you're an Fi-user, and hence an FP type. I see evidence of N as well, namely\n\n>I very often am last in thought and am greatly intrigued by abstract thinking, however I have noticed in myself somewhat of a fixation on the aesthetics of these ideas.\n\nThis seems like an N statement colored by feeling logic. Highly indicative of what you see in NFP types. As for I/E, I wouldn't worry too much about that letter. I consider it the weakest dichotomy in the test (I.e. INFP and ENFP often look like twin types, and their difference is small). You seem like an ENFP though.\n\n****\n\nAs for seeing descriptions of ENTP that fit you, be wary of Barnum statements. It's the effect that makes astrology so meaningless. They're vague statements that everyone will identify with. You get an effect where people will typecast themselves based on descriptions, as you're discovering. \n\nWhenever you read something online about an MBTI type (including my comment), be skeptical of it. Question the *reasoning* behind it. Ask if it's founded on well defined dichotomies, and how each description provided falls into the dichotomy. \n\nFor instance in my justification for you being a Feeler, I defined the dichotomy and explained why your rationale falls into it. It's a self consistent, reliable metric which others can replicate. \n\n****\n\nI've avoided discussions on functions in the preceding part of this comment, and that's intentional. Many will tell you that 16personalities is trash (tho personally I find it far better than most of the purported type descriptions online, especially on Reddit). It's often suggested that places like 16personalities is a great stepping stone, and you should look to the cognitive functions for a deeper understanding and more reliability.\n\nBut I'll caution you here. That's a higher order field of knowledge in MBTI. Rigorously, the MBTI types are built off dichotomies (N/S, F/T, E/I, P/J). You can *derive* the functions from the S/N and F/T dichotomies with some care, but it's a care thats often neglected. \n\nThe idea is that instead of defining a P/J dichotomy (which Jung would call irrational vs rational) you instead allow each of the aforementioned S/N and F/T dichotomies be split into functions guided the E/I dichotomy. You then recover the P/J dichotomy by asserting a function stack. \n\nIn this way, both models have 4 degrees of freedom (hence you can derive a 1-1 correspondence between them). But recognize that the function description of types requires a solid foundation of well defined dichotomies. Because otherwise, in invoking function stacks, you're really at the mercy of general Barnum statements with so-called loops/shadow functions/socionics, etc. \n\nIn deriving this 1-1 correspondence between the dichotomies and the functions, you really observe that each type is governed by *two* leading functions. In the ENTP case this means NeTi. Adding in the existence of other functions (FeSi) is a higher order process that requires even more delicate care in defining the functions (namely invoking the work of Jung, such as how Ne and Si are dichotomously opposed).\n\nBut that part (the existence of sub-functions like FeSi) is certainly up for a strong debate. The only thing that's reliably true is that if we draw a correspondence between the dichotomies defined in Mbti and the cognitive functions is that each MBTI type is governed by *two* cognitive functions. There are some theories that functions come in pairs manifestly (like how Ne really means NeSi and how Si means SiNe), and that's how you can derive four-function model theories for Mbti.  So we may say an ENTP is an NeSi TiFe, and then reason how to order this stack by well defined rules (E.g. frequency with which you use a function)
9	That tightrope between always striving for better and being too complacent.	Not a "Help Me" thread, but rather an existential thought experiment wrapped into a convoluted and personal stream of consciousness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a kind of weird and meta problem that I have, insofar that I completely lack any data or reference that I could reliably use to help me with this, but I have the intuition that some of you folk's input might actually help me get a  better picture on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem is as follows: I myself am convinced that I achieve happiness by constantly evolving, improving myself, seeing and understanding as much of this world as possible in the short time I am given on it, and I'd rather be rich in knowledge and experience than in money and material. Sounds like a nice and acceptable, fortune-cookie-valid life goal so far, right? Hell yeah it does!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n But what if I set myself up for disappointment there? What if I've already had so many beautiful experiences and already know so much that I could be proud about it right now, and not in the future? Or at the very least make much more use of what I already have instead of always renovating the facotry, so to speak? I of course think that's hogwash, for I know that I know nothing and all that, but then I do fail quite often to appreciate what I already have because I am "too good at seeing how much more it could be". (Friend's quote)\n\nNow, I think that it doesn't bother me, and tell myself that the journey is the destination, and whenever I find or learn something new it's like a flower of light is blooming in my chest, it is amazing, I am unashamedly addicted to that feeling, but then when it comes to mundane life, there is hardly anything new to learn or find, that's simply how it is on this bitch of an earth, and my friends all seem overly concerned that I am in fact incapable of feeling joy over anything that I can share with someone else. And if I play their advocate, I must admit that in a way they have a point, I oftentimes refused some of the pudding for want of the whole pie, and ended up empty-handed, sometimes literally, usually spiritually. I then always interject that it's a bargain I gladly took, but I'm starting to doubt that I was really that glad to take it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean, as much as I'd rather not be, I'm still a human being in the end with weird chemicals coursing through me making me desire to fulfill needs that I cannot just think away. Damn, this sounds convoluted and haughty, but what I mean is, maybe I should try out being happy with what I have, on occasion, just for mental hygiene? But then, how would I go about that without losing my hunger? How can I satisfy myself with "less", or with the imperfect version of a perfect form, if you put it in platonic terms? And taking this to the meta level: what if my fear of stagnation in fact makes me stagnate just the harder? Do I have unrealistic expectations?\n\nI don't think any of your are going to be able to concretely answer this for me, because there are so many opinions on how to live life as there are lives lived, but I am convinced that in all of us lies a "seeker", and that us ENTP's more willingly fall into that role, and thus are at the very least capable of saying a little more on the matter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:\n\nShould you really stay hungry and foolish or are you just gonna die starved and stupid if you do?
7	Finding a balance between the two is the right goal, I think.  Ne will constantly keep us hungry for the new and for more; harnessing our Ti and even Si to keep us from running wild is important.  Taking note when you can sense that you need to settle down a bit and finding the logic in why you shouldn’t go go go with every idea all the time.  Finding some things in the mundane everyday that comfort you and make you just happy to be present right now instead of constantly thinking of what’s next.  I’ve been meditating (with guided meditation, lord knows I’d never get anywhere meditating in silence) and it has helped me a bit to breathe and appreciate the moment; to slow down the incessant forward thinking that keeps me displeased with where I am or what I have right now.
3	This sounds more like ENFP strife with life. 
3	I've always enjoyed Aristotle's [take on this matter](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/#ThreLiveComp), which, essentially, is to allow yourself to be satisfied after a particularly good tasty meal, and then to become hungry again. \n\nAdditionally:\n\n>The happiest life is lived by someone who has a full understanding of the basic causal principles that govern the operation of the universe, and who has the resources needed for living a life devoted to the exercise of that understanding.\n\n(Not a quote from Aristotle, but from the SEP.)
8	Do you like sociology /psychology / or social psychology ?	I just want to know , I invite you to share your own thoughts and ideas.  All ideas are welcome, everything will be discussed socratically (not shure if this word exists).
9	I got really obsessed with shows like, Lie to me and Sherlock. I wanted to develop same kind of deductive powers. I thought understanding people would be an important part of that. So I got really into psychology. And while a lot of it was interesting I found that a lot of it was sort of intuitive to what I already knew. The only real challenge was training myself to be more in tune with people's body language. I find that there's sort of this moment when I "get" a person, where I understand how they think and process things and can generally sort of emulate their thought process to make pretty good predictions.\n\nI find also that there's sort of weird irony in humans. Where you can logically follow their train of thought. But at the same see that it is an entirely illogical.
6	I said current psychology is somewhere between bad philosophy and bad science the other day. Go figure.
4	I like psychology, sociology and social psychology are okay I guess. They make nice read anyway but one has to be vary the problems with replicability. Anyway favourite read so far was 'Obedience to Authority' by Milgram and 'On the Nature of Love' by Harlow.
3	I enjoy these topics in an informal setting, and considerably less so in an academic one (way back when I took freshman sociology and psych - too much of a predefined perspective, IMO). I love reading new sociological/psychological studies, theories, et cetera. They always represent an interesting observation of habits I've either personally observed, or that are entirely alien to me. Often, it's fun to look at the underlying methodology to figure out what a study is lacking, or how people are misinterpreting the relevant data.
2	C. All of the above.
1	I am a sociologist by training, but now do something completely different. Anyway, I loved sociology. Loved reading social theory. The analysis of power dynamics and social construction I find irresistible. 
10	ENTP career - not sure what we want / scared of wrong decisions	Hi all,\n\nYes - I am an ENTP and have multiple interests. I already had 5 different jobs in the last 8 years. I don't want to be a job hopper, but I recently changed jobs after my Linemanager was horrible (yes, I overreacted). But now I am in a new industry I dislike.\n\nWhat shall I do now? I know what I want but can't express it: Product Management, Consulting, Software Sales, Engineer - I like technology but like business as well... \n\nAre you ENTP also scared of taking wrong jobs? Doing wrong decisions? Having a hard time to say what you want? \n\nI put myself under massive pressure to find the perfect job now, but scared to make wrong moves...\n\nThanks
6	I wish I could help you but I'm in a similar conundrum. I started as a researcher/scientist and tried to go the gradschool route just to realize how exploitative and poorly paid it is. Luckily I've also worked as IT and developer on the side so now I'm in a difficult position. If I stay true to my career and pick a job related to my science major I'd be digging a deeper hole in my CV and forever be trapped in a poorly paid unemployable spiral, whereas getting a job as a developer/IT might be more difficult at first due to my lack of formal knowledge but in the end building experience and CV leads to a much better paid and higher employability career.
3	Finding somthing that provides \n\nmental stimulation\n\nA situation where you can be the critical thinker. We tend to be fairly good at optmzation of proccess. \n\nA situation where you don't have to be the one to bring the optimized processes to reality. Or at least be in a position that you can be hands on enough to come off as a leader. But also seek stimulation elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\nAs I'm going to school in hopes of becoming a therapist. I have found myself near the top of a local non profit organization here in town. Honestly I feel as if I just suggest obvious courses of action with a little more enthusiasm and confidence then most. . They then go and take action and I get paid for "better defining and implementing our mission" \n\nWe are very good at convincing others that the course we plot is the best way to reach the destination. Just don't trust us to be the one to keep the boat on that course. \n\n
2	I don’t worry about it much. Find something decent that you can stand, and stay there until you figure out what you really want, or something better comes along. Just make sure you’re doing something.
2	Lol, I relate. I’ve realized over the last few months that my best bet is to just get involved in an industry that revolves around project oriented work with lots of different subjects. This is why I am in film, writing, and sing as a hobby. I am also starting to take interest in video game writing. Literally there is so much to do. 
2	Ok so this might not be the best in terms of advice, but I was also really bad at deciding what job I wanted, so after some deliberation I went into bio and am now doing research into longevity. \n\nIf this goes well I'll be able to try out all the jobs. ^If ^not ^^I'll ^^be ^^too ^^dead ^^to ^^care\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/QDYNC3m.gif
1	I had a hard time determining what I wanted to do, as I always had 3+ areas that was of interest. I beat myself up over and over, thinking of the pros and cons of each discipline and what I'd get out of it. But to be honest, after a few months I just jumped into it. After a year or so, I knew this discipline wasn't the right one. However I was grateful for all the stuff I learnt. I hopped for another year, but I always made sure I grew in that area to take with me. I'm now in an area that is of full interest to me, and I have so so much to learn and grow. So I think you're getting closer to what you really want. Your discipline is pretty niche, so I'm sure if you put everything you learnt, you'll know what to do next. \n\n 
1	Do software design and start a business with people you meet-preferably types with a bit more follow-through. End goal is being able to fund whatever pops into your mind and have people that can make that come to fruition e.g. Elon Musk’s life is goals
1	Find the highest paying job you can tolerate. The earlier you retire, the earlier you will be able to do whatever you want.
1	The thing that took me forever to learn: your first job is not necessarily going to be your dream job. in fact, it would be shocking if it were.\n\nI think you take the right job for you at the time and then you try to learn as best you can from it. Then, when you're ready, you move on to the next thing. When it feels right, you'll know - and when it stops feeling right, you'll have to let go.\n\nThat being said, you've hopped a lot of jobs in the past 5 years, as you've said. That indicates a problem. In your case, I think you may need to be a little harder on yourself to stick it out. Most jobs, frankly, suck, especially at the entry level, where it sounds like you've been at for... well, the past 5 years. Given that you're uncertain about your career path, I'd say think about how you want your life to look in the next 5-10 years, and then find the job that best suits that lifestyle. If you want some degree of money and prestige, there's no way to avoid a job that has shitty hours and a high-pressure environment. If you want to travel, pick a job that encourages you to do that. If you want a chill life with tons of hobbies (that provide your intellectual and creative stimulation instead), pick a 9 to 5 office job that you leave behind as soon as the clock's up.
21	So... How do you guys act around the person you admire?	Welp... Let's just say, I'm stuck if I should actually do something about it, or just stare at him/her without him/her realizing.\n\nThen I also have this mood swings where I totally can't deal with anyone and just stare into nothingness, drowning in fantasy in my mind. This thing makes me forget I'm near to him/her.\n\nDo tell me your wisdom, mah dear fellows.
22	I make stupid jokes and get really quiet
12	I ignore them completely, blush a lot, and stutter if I try to speak.  Thus my never having dated someone I actually find really hot.
9	When I am talking with someone who I am not interested in, I am super relaxed and I can keep the conversation up.\n\nBut when it comes to people I admire, I just act weird. Like, I cannot be myself. I just try to ask questions and learn about them.\n\nAlso, I admire the other ENTPs (ENTP-As actually) so this usually happens with them. It can happen with INTPs too tho
15	How do I act around the person I admire? Well on a semi-daily basis you'll find me brushing my teeth in front of them, or shaving my face, or plucking my unibrow. It's really comforting to know you can be yourself around this person, so much so that they become a part of your daily routine. \n\nYou can flex in front of them and they always compliment you. They always give you a realistic perspective on how you look. And this makes it easy to practice conversations. They pep you up before you have to go to work. See, they're so awesome I started talking about them instead of me!\n\nSo I'd like to extend a big thank you to my reflection. I'll admire you always and forever. 
6	ENTP-A: Trying as hard as possible to make them not notice that you are focusing on/trying to look at them.\n\nENTP-T: What /u/nowiwantchocolate said.\n\n

3	Are we talking about admiration in a romantic context? Professional? Interpersonal, but platonic? I tend to react to these in 3 very different ways:\n\n* Romantic: Introduce self, make a good impression, get a number/make plans, and then get the hell out of there before they think I'm crazy\n* Professional: Get super jealous of older/more accomplished people, wonder how I can get to where they are, finally realize I might learn something and engage them with questions about their life, experiences, advice for people lower on the corporate ladder\n* Interpersonal: Introduce self, make a good impression, talk their ear off about something, learn a little about them but never in as much depth as I would like, leave the interaction wondering if they were bored to death by my stream of consciousness and random topic jumping
2	Interesting that most people seem to be responding about romantic admiration - 'twas not my first instinct.\n\nThat being said, I generally react the same way to people I admire romantically, personally, professionally, etc. I'm more on my best behaviour, or rather, I try harder to be my best self. Therefore, I'm a little quieter, more contemplative, and more thoughtful. I speak less because I'm more concerned about sounding like an idiot. 
2	Not much eye contact.. only when reading said person's reaction to my reply or statement. \n\nAsk a shit tone of witty thought provoking questions.

2	1/ Observe a lot.\n\n2/ Ignore them as much as possible without being rude while analysing them completely. Stalking them on social medias. See what they are really like.\n\n3/ Planning every possible scenario on how can you approach her to start a real deep conversation in which you can excel at.\n\n4/ ATTACK.\n\nGenerally, I'm uptight at first because I really don't know what's the socially acceptable thing to say and what not because for me everything is alright . Then, when I crack a joke or two based on the reaction of the person I'm talking to I proceed. It's like checking if the water is warm enough for you before you dive in. If we talk a lot, I usually drop the act and be myself while trying to not offend her because I'm really good at that or rather people are really good at being offended.
1	How I should act: suck it up and tell em how you feel. it’s not the end of the world if they say no and ENTP’s typically don’t have much of a filter anyway so what could it hurt?\n\nHow I actually act: Make fun of them because I’m shy and tryna flirt but the indirect flirting + my shit Fe = being mean and they get mad and think I’m a douche

12	TLDW at 2x speed:\n\n\#1 Make tons of empty promises - Anecdotes: examples of flakiness\n\n\*Literally 8 min later....\*\n\n\#2 Need constant mind stimulation - Anecdote if there's a huge attractiveness gap in a couple it's with an ENTP because we like a challenge\n\n"Um I'm sure I have more but that's all I've got for you today" \n\nWtf you had literally 2 observations in 14min and the second one doesn't tie attractiveness into mind stimulation. \n\nI give this video 5 dumbs out of 6. 
2	NATHAN GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER
4	After 1:20 I stopped a) because I didn't have the patience to watch her enjoying herself in front of the camera (seriously) and b) I can't believe how shitty she started off the video (I love dates but, again, seriously...).
2	Youtube spam?
1	There are stupid rambling videos but she is definitely a good storyteller and has an interesting perspective. Obviously didn't watch the whole thing but I don't get the hate.
1	Lol ... well, I've seduced a 10 once. I had an identity crisis after that. Sex does annoy me. Like an ENTP dude is trying to seduce a 9, at this point I can literally sweep her away from him. \n\nBut yeah the empty promises are definitely a thing with xNTPs. Come on people! Reminds me of something I have to do and another thing I have todo for with an ENTP.\n\n\- ISTP

14	Sarcasim is never to late	
17	Burnouts?	I just need advice on what to do, I guess Im recovering from a depressive episode that happened for a few months but now Im just burnt out.
17	I always start out by getting little things in order. Make sure I’m cleaning my room, and myself. Then I graduate to making sure my finances and simple obligations are taken care of such as bills, taxes, (homework and loans if in school). \n\nYou may keep your life together during depressive episodes more than I do, but if you don’t, getting all the little things done helps build my confidence back up. In my experience depression and anxiety are all about having a critically low self esteem, which is only perpetuated by the apathy and laziness that comes with depression. \n\n1.	Start taking care of things TODAY. Not tomorrow, tomorrow never comes.\n2.	Just don’t kick yourself while you’re down by sabotaging your hygiene and responsibilities.\n2.	Take. Your. Meds. If you have meds they are your friend, you need them and thats ok. I cannot stress this enough bc I do it to myself constantly.\n2.	Don’t think about the future to much, just think about what you need to get done today and do it, even if every cell in your body doesn’t want to. \n3.	If you fail, it’s fine. Just keep trying.\n3.	Rinse and repeat until it becomes habit.\n\nThis may seem obvious but I always need a reminder. 🤷‍♀️
7	I have been burnt out and borderline depressed for ages.\n\nI will never actually be depressed I have to many great things in my life.\n\nBut I definitely feel trapped. I value my free time very highly and having to work full time to pay off a mortgage starts to take a tole on your mental health.\n\nConstant frustration with this is slowly killing me. Being a drone is slowly killing me.\n\nI have a great family but I tell you what being forced to spend 80 percent my my weeks daylight in an office fucking ruins me.\n\nFinancial freedom seems to be the only viable option for me to actually be happy.\n\nI don't want a career or a job I want freedom.\n\nLife is not that generous to most of us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy advice, Try and get exactly what you want. My goal is a little harder but your goals may not be.
5	Personally, though I’m not an ENTP, I like to get far away and do somewhere new. I think a change of scenery can help you get out of a rut and put things in perspective. There’s something about being away from the same old same old and having new possibilities 
3	Hmm I’m still trying to pick up my own pieces but maybe what you need is to just take some time look at yourself and pleasure yourself (yes that way too) it depends on the person i guess... best of luck 🍻
3	Drink lots of water  \n\n\nTake a really cold bath for up to 30 minutes, followed by a hot shower  \n\n\nOrder a bunch of healthy take-out (if you can afford it), so that you can focus on other things while you straighten yourself out.  \n\n\nI also find flying to a new country helps me reset (removes all the associative regressions and environmental feedback loops), but I'm weird.

36	Is sarcasm the least creative form of humor?	I encountered an ENTP the other day. Having dedicated my entire life to studying these superior creatures, I was ecstatic to have finally found one. I communicated with him verbally and was taken aback when he repeated a phrase I used in conversation in a different tone. I was informed it was an attempt at humor commonly referred to as "sarcasm". It surprised me, as repeating a sentence in a different tone through "sarcasm" does not seem very creative. Being the creative genius-level intellectuals they are, one would think the ENTP would not partake in such primitive humor. Please help me understand this "sarcasm". I have lost much sleep over this issue.
73	Well look no further, your post is a prime example of it. It is indeed the lowest form of humour.
31	I feel like sarcasm isn't really humorous at all, or it is but not in the way a joke is.\n\nSarcasm is a tool to use to point out the irrationality of someone's point. The humor just stems from the fact that you are kind of making fun of that person.\n\nI feel like most sarcasm is therefore misplaced like if you just want to trip up someone whos naive or if you make a stupid troll post on reddit that helps nobody.
23	Are you trying to dethrone Adam Sandler?
10	There's levels of sarcasm, from mundane to creative.\n\nHowever sarcasm is like the weak cousin of cynicism if you want to be mean and belittle someone else. If you want to be funny, cynicism is also more powerful because it establishes a context due to repetition, although neither should be overused. Combine with cute dad jokes to be likeable and you're golden.
9	Sarcasm isn't a joke or form of humor as much as a communication style. People that get sarcasm often are able to immediately banter with one another easily because it alludes to the fact that both parties are not going to take offense to the other poking fun at them or something less tasteful. I find it to be a great tool to get to know someone and small talk with them but only if they themselves are also sarcastic in nature. 
7	I'll answer seriously as your post taken humorously fails spectacularly\n\nIts an inferior form of insult. Hit and miss form of humor
14	Do you think sarcasm is less creative than toilet humor? 
5	Gr8 b8 m8
3	Maybe it was them being ironic. I use sarcasm like this for thought provokative irony mainly.  \n\nHowever it’s probably just an attempt to catch you by surprise being as *one would think the ENTP would not partake in such primitive humour*. 🤪
3	Sarcasm, dry humor, and shock value are the easiest ways to get reactions which is why they are generally the go-tos that people use.
4	I think Oscar Wilde called it a tool of the weak witted
2	Good shit post.\n\nBut it is obvious that some Personality types do not appreciate sarcasm as much as we do.
2	So many **woooshes** on this thread
2	So sorry for your loss
1	idk about everyone else but for me it sounded more like „sarcastically mocking“ instead of actual „sarcasm“. it is the lowest level of humour however i accidentally do it myself too sometimes (usually when sth is so dumb i just have to make fun of it) but i refrain myself from doing it bc the person infront of me feels made fun of. and it is low level so yea

6	The Myth of Sisyphus; Does the realization of the absurd require suicide?	
3	Meaninglessness is perfectly feasible. A man can live without meaning, a man can live without consciousness.\n\nThe true reality, if one can imagine, is something that cannot be put into focus and math. No beginning, no end, no edge, no time, no goal, no cause, no motive, no will, no this, no that, no thing, but endless permutations of an endless nothing.\n\nSuicide is accounted for, the body dies, new body begins, no loss, no gain, no escape.
2	I’m going save this and listen to it when when I have some spare time. \n\nCan you give me your take or at least something to make me want to listen to this. It’s sounds very fascinating, specially with suicide being involved and I don’t want to lose interest by postponing it. Can you provide some reasons that make this 2 hour listen worth it. \n\nThis is something completely new to me and had never heard of it until you posted this and did a quick Wikipedia search. There are reasons that make me want to listen to this due to how relatable the theme might be to my life so that helps too.
2	You can only see certain things from certain perspectives, and I claim that in this respect, to have realization of the absurd, one must have seen life from it's edge, if not literally then at the very least internally, or as Camus calls it, philosophically, but then obviously have come back from it, because the suicide wasn't executed in the end. This is also the reason why I've never quite managed to form a concrete, "marketable" opinion on suicide, and whether it's acceptable or condemnable. I know both sides and see the validity, and brutal as it may sound, necessity of each.
2	Some nights ago I had a panic attack. I was expanding on an idea I had found the same day and suddenly asked myself the question "The goal of life is to reproduce and keep existing, but what exactly pushes it towards that goal?" We have dopamine, which pushes us towards it, but the very first lifeforms did not have it and still they reproduced. Why?\n\nThis is what triggered the panic attack. I was unable to come up with a logical reason. After about an hour of furious thinking I came to a simple conclussion. There was nothing pushing it. I believe life started as a chemical reaction that was altered in some way by an extremely rare set of circumstances and events which gave the reaction the "choice" on how to keep progressing. Think of it like fire having the choice where to burn towards and/or to regulatee its intensity. If nothing stopped it, the fire would keep going until it managed to burn all the available fuel.\n\nSo that is what I personally accept as an answer to the meaning of life question. The meaning of life is to keep existing, and that's it. It just does it because it can. All else is your own mind rationalizing the ultimate choice you automatically made when you were a baby, which was to suck on a tit and enjoy it.
1	I got distracted at 10 minutes. I will save it for a long bus ride or something, otherwise it's too much for me.
1	Not gonna lie, I misread that at first and thought it said the "myth of syphilis", and was like, um I'm pretty sure syphilis isn't a myth. 
1	We are on a big wet ball. Orbiting a bigger HOT ball. In a universe filled with countless bigger wet,hot,dry and gassy balls. All of which form some sort of system that will never even be relevant to us. \n\nThe universe has no meaning assigned to us. But we all have the ability to use our Finite moment of exsists, to find meaning in the sand box our universe is.\n\nBut satre points out that in This sense "freedom" is our greatest curse. When we accept that our happiness or success is strictly determined by our actions. We can not blame anyone else for our failer. Making it nearly impossible to achieve a sense of contentment with our situation. \n\nExistentialism is seeing beauty in the absurd. I think This is true. When you accept the absurd. You are able to find value in the act of being a  Conscious, living being. I mean the odds of existing are very low. We won the lottery of the universe (or at least or solor system). \n\nSorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes 
8	Monthly Mentoring Thread - January 13, 2019	**The purpose of this thread is to help /r/ENTP participants to self organize into mentor/mentees, masters/apprentices.**\n\nPost a bio or check out the bios to see if there is someone who is a good fit for you, and send them a PM or reply right in the comments. Mentors, you can edit or delete your comment after you've found what you're looking for.\n\n**In the comments, post a short bio with:**\n\n* Your life story, but not too detailed for your stalkers,\n\n* The stage you are in your life,\n\n* The type mentor you are looking for,\n\n* The type of mentees you feel comfortable mentoring.\n
5	Life story- mid 20s yo male in sw America currently teaching 6th grade at a charter school, looking to get a masters in the next couple of years not sure in what area, I have a bachelors in criminal justice \n\nStage of life- as mentioned above mid 20's male single looking at were to go from "here" in life and work, working on finding my defining purpose and what steps i can take progress inline w/that purpose \n\nType of mentor- Some one who can help me work on my long term plans and who I can hone my rhetoric and writing skills \n\nWho I can mentor-  Younger entps trying go figure out how to do life, develop their own philosophy , and working on basic self development, or anybody that wants to argue;) 
4	* Your life story, but not too detailed for your stalkers,\n\nLate-20s from the Nordics. I have a wide range of interests. I love the nature, going climbing, skiing and hiking. Books, computers, history and the cosmos have always been my interests. Avid photographer. Through the 20s I've also developed a great affection towards psychology, philosophy and religion - all these rational and "irrational" aspects of the human psyche. Probably why I'm here too.\n\n* The stage you are in your life\n\nJust graduating from Uni with a Machine learning/Neuroscience degree and got my first "real job". I also got recently engaged, so "maturing" real quickly in the last years. I feel like I'm now transitioning from youth into adulthood (which probably what I'm struggling with).\n\n* The type mentor you are looking for\n\nSomeone with experience and insight into this stage of life where I am. Especially career and work related advice are appreciated. On how to "settle down".\n\n* The type of mentees you feel comfortable mentoring\n\nSomeone who has anxiety or worries transitioning from high school/teen age years into college. On how to choose what to study or how to find hobbies or friends. I would say that I'm also quite good at working with highly emotional or private things as well, such as breakups, sexuality or any other heartaches.
4	I was raised in a strictly  religious home and have complex ptsd from it.\n\nIm a 21 year old male with infp gf. Not in college. Dont have much self direction. Work retail.\n\nIm looking for any mentor that would like to message me. I need help processing my own emotions and taking them seriously. Also need help with prioritising and sticking to projects. \n\nI am a very high empathy entp, so if you are an entp that struggles with empathy I can possibly help you at least develop sympathy. Im very understanding and a decent listener. \n
3	* Your life story, but not too detailed for your stalkers,\n\nEarly 20's guy, born and raised in Las Vegas, moved all over the United States (for higher ed and work), was fortunate enough to travel all around the world.  I love Technology, Politics, and Philosophy. My undergraduate studies were in Computer Science, Engineering, and Logistics.\n\n* The stage you are in your life,\n\nCurrently unemployed and am looking for work in tech. Also potentially looking to start a business. \n\n* The type mentor you are looking for,\n\nAnyone older and wiser than me. Someone who can inform me on the best ways I can improve myself, network more effectively and efficiently, and just live the best life possible. \n\n* The type of mentees you feel comfortable mentoring.\n\nAnyone struggling through high school and or college. Being an ENTP in those settings can be both horrible and amazing all at the same time. Through my time traveling and in college, I learned a ton of ways to effectively leverage bursts of energy and interest to get the most out of experiences.
3	 \n\n* Your life story, but not too detailed for your stalkers,\n\nBorn in extreme poverty on the East Coast USA. Family didn't even have a car till I bought one at age 17. Excelled in school as top of my class consistently, but dropped out of high-school \[against my will\] I did odd jobs for construction work.Then My father died, and I had no one but myself. I slept in a van for two months while working full-time. I Worked in skilled trades, until I had to choose between my integrity and a paycheck. I had few  months worth of rent at this point. Then I focused on sales positions. I believed that the only thing separating me from the richest men in the world was knowledge, and the right words to say. I got a very prestigious sales job by writing a speech to interrupt  the standard interviewing process mid-stride. I was hired on the spot, and almost had them crying. Outperformed all other sales agents.  I was self employed and 100% independently Contracted. Then they screwed me over with made up rules. I've been a freelancer online since then. \n\n* The stage you are in your life,\n\nI'm at the point where I'm greatly hindered by circumstances. I know I'm capable of succeeding against all odds. I've proven it to myself many times over. Losing everything takes a toll on anyone I'd imagine. Right now, I'm just looking to regain my ridiculously Confident Mindset. That's where a lot of my strength came from.\n\n* The type mentor you are looking for,\n\nMy ideal mentor would be someone who has achieved financial success. A mentor who knows how to find opportunity. Someone who has taken poverty, and beat it into the ground. Someone with the keys of experience that's looking for an apprentice.\n\n* The type of mentees you feel comfortable mentoring.\n\nAnyone who refuses to be anything less than the person they choose to be. You'll have my support.
2	Your life story, but not too detailed for your stalkers - Early 20's, male. Live i Sweden. I have no specific hobby but am interested in basically everything. Sports in general, hiking, psychology, philosophy, basically everything I get my hands on that I can get better at, or obtain more knowledge of. I work in real estate, but with systematic fire protection (direct translation), and I love it. I work \~10 stressful hours a day, learning something new everyday.\n\nStage of life - discovering myself I think. If you can ever stop discovering yourself... it's very recently that I got into psychology, philosophy, and just "thinking my own thoughts" about everything. If you can put it like that. I'm at a stage where I fucking love life and love discovering what it has to offer.\n\nThe of mentor - here's the kicker. I'm a pretty "feely" type, in the regards I am very aesthetic. I am very musical, love drama, dancing and get emotional towards many things, I think. Around people, even people closest to me, I am always the upbeat, emotionally stable guy. Who's always there for everyone, AND I MEAN EVERYONE. It's now like people wouldn't be there for me. I think people would take every chance they get to be there for me. But I don't let anyone help me. I know it is because of my child hood. There wasn't much room for being sad.. but I don't want this be a rant about that. I just want to know how other ENTP's "get vulnerable", because I rrrrreaally wish I could.\n\nWho I can mentor - teenagers or early 20's people who have a hard time procrastinating. My child hood basically taught me how to "grow character" and stop procrastinating so much. I still do. A lot. But I know what to tell my self when I know deep inside that I really want to do something. Among my friends I am the most "masculine", but I'm the still the one taking dance lessons and who loves nerdy stuff. Or just message me if you want to talk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(I'm new on reddit so may take some time to respond).
1	* Life story\n\nI am mid-20s, female. I've traveled a lot through my youth, up until now. Pretty much have been having fun, exploring the world, figuring out what I'm passionate about. I've studied a huge variety of things such as illustration, animation, graphic design, cinematography, and documentary filmmaking. For most of my youth, up until now, I've never really thought about making smart career moves. I've mostly just been exploring my interests and seeing what I like. I had a ton of fun. But now I'm sort of suffering the consequences of that and am finding it hard to find solid work or a career trajectory that can bring my stability. \n\n* Stage I'm at:\n\nI just graduated with a Master's in Media Studies (emphasis in filmmaking). But, it's been extremely difficult finding a stable job. I've mostly been freelancing and contracting. Currently I'm contracting at a tech company (office role) while applying to a coding bootcamp. I'm hoping to get in and become a software developer, but if I don't get in...I'm not really sure what else to do. Overall, I feel like I'm unfocused and unsure where my life is going. \n\n* Type of mentor I'm looking for:\n\nDefinitely someone older and more experienced than me. Someone that has been through a similar situation as I am, like not really understanding what to do with my life or what is the best way to move forward in my career if I'm not exactly sure what I want to do. \n\n* Type of mentees I feel comfortable mentoring:\n\nI'm comfortable mentoring people much younger than me. Also people going through college or even still in high school. I'd be happy to share my own experiences as an ENTP so they don't make the same mistakes as I did haha.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	My life story- A high school kid, with many nerdy interests. Academically, and non academically. Currently focusing on college and my career plans. Despite being very spontaneous and having a tendency to procrastinate, I have a good-ish plan form me in the future with set variables that adapt to change and different possibilities \n\nMy stage in life- Hard to say really. I'm still young, so I'm trying to focus on my future, learn more about myself and I really want to try and accomplish something. \n\nType of mentor I am looking for- someone who can help me try to get plans into action, improve socially (especially with girls), help me stop with the procrastination, make me\nMore hardworking. If I had to say in terms of functions, I'd like to develop Ni, Te and Fe. Ni to help me get better at time management and less ADHD like, Te to carry out my plans and ideas and actually get work done, and Fe to develop socially. Eventually I will work on Se to asses any current environment very well, but I'm already asking for a lot and I can develop that later \n\nThe type of mentees I'd like- well, honestly I'm fine with any age either way. There's a lot I can teach people older than me, and a lot I can learn from people younger than me. I'm very good at analysis, academic subjects, and generally more brain oriented stuff. Can also help people become less emotional. \n\n
1	**Life Story** \- Korean-Japanese, grew up in Korea but currently living in the US. I enjoy digital art and character design, along with story writing and plan on creating a webcomic and game. I also like to prank people, which seems kinda childish but it's pretty fun. I despise boredom and believe people should have fun with life. I am also into psychology and neuroscience, but only research those topics as a hobby, as I plan to go into art or design as a career. I also like to sing, and I know how to play violin and piano. I've been told I'm fun to be around and am entertaining.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Stage in Life** \- I think I'm in a good stage right now, I just want to have a life that's interesting and not boring in all honesty, so I do things that I enjoy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Type of Mentor** \- I would like someone who is experienced in art, character design, or story writing/creative world building. I want to be able to get some feedback from an experienced individual so that I can improve more in what I am truly interested. I would also want someone who is less serious and more fun, and it would be pretty cool to meet another person who enjoys messing with people and pranks as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Who I can mentor** \- I'm not much help when it comes to emotional issues, so I'm comfortable with mentoring beginner artists and people just starting in art. Personally, I prefer people who are more social and outgoing, as I find it difficult with working with people who are too socially awkward people. If people are interested in any of my hobbies and interests, I'd love to chat as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also like Hypnosis Mic and Vanitas no Carte/The Case Study of Vanitas, but I highly dislike most other manga or anime related media so don't expect me to talk about any sort of media unless it's one of those two, but if you like one of those or both, I'd be up to talk about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt would be nice to meet someone else who is Korean or Japanese as well
1	Life Story - Early 30's - kinda all over the place in life until recently were I finally received the opportunity that I had been waiting for awhile....I finally think I am ready to be mature. \n\nStage - ready to take the stage and be my best self, I have had a lot of let down and once I was willing to let the overwhelming anxiety of being the best go I started to find my footing and getting what I wanted out of life.\n\nType of Mentor - Just another people who I can connect with\n\nWho can I mentor - Anyone that feels down and lost .... I have recently made it something of a mission to reach out to those that need a bit of a pick me up and have actually followed up to make sure they knew I care. I sometimes come off as someone that does not.
1	\*Your life story, but not too detailed for your stalkers:\n\n\-Early 20s, Male, Medical student, I've always been an A+ student, always top of my class,  I've also always participated in extracurricular activities which made me an awesome public speaker and an excellent communicator with great interpersonal skills. I'm quite knowledgeable and always absorbing new information about almost anything and everything. I recently discovered that I have a relatively high emotional intelligence and self-awareness, which also make me a good listener in addition to some good observation and deduction skills that have served me in countless situations. I'm socially charming with an original sense of humor but I've struggled with keeping in touch with people, I rarely ask about many of my friends and relatives which gives off the vibe that I don't care about them even-though I do. My main problem in life has always been procrastination and discipline, I've always struggled with it but it never stopped me from reaching my goals until I got in med school. I read a lot about procrastination, why we procrastinate and even the neuroscience behind it, so I know how to beat it but I still somehow can't, I think I just lack accountability and structure, every time I create a structured routine for my life I always end up ruining it, therefore my grades in med school are suffering. I'm also struggling with staying in shape (diet &gym) due to the same problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\*The stage you are in your life:\n\nI'm probably in one of my worst stages in life, I may be exaggerating about this but my med school grades and my recently obtained sedentary life style are saying that I'm not. I know exactly where to go and how to get there, I just lack the discipline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\*The type mentor you are looking for:\n\nI desperately need someone to push me and keep tabs on me. Someone who will hold me accountable for not putting in the work and effort that needs to be done. I don't need guidance as much as I need follow-up and routine check-ups.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\*The type of mentees you feel comfortable mentoring:\n\nI had some issues with depression in the past, I went through some dark times through which I came out from a lot wiser and mature. I'm a lot better now and the experience and wisdom I obtained from that period are incalculable. I can't say I've found the meaning of life (because I don't think anyone has) but I did make peace with who I am and I became very good at giving guidance to anyone suffering from any emotional or psychological problems. So I'm comfortable mentoring anyone going through a rough patch in life (emotionally). I'm also comfortable mentoring any high-schoolers/teenagers who are interested in medicine.\n\n&#x200B;
56	Is it normal to not feel anything, even when I try to?	Alright, so I'm pretty fucking sure that I'm not depressed because well.. I love life. But recently, I've noticed that I haven't experienced any strong emotions, and it's starting to alarm me. One of my friends dmed me tonight, because she noticed how I've changed from being a loudmouth to a loner in just one week. I'm also not interested in anyone, I haven't been, for almost a year now. I've been to a couple of dates since last month, but no one seems to interest me. With friends, I used to make plans and start stuff, but know I've just lost all the motivation to do so. I'm not sad or suicidal, just........ emotionless. What is this? 
40	Dude , that Describes my fucking life perfectly.\n\nI have been like this for last 3 years .\n\nAnd believe me, do something for it or it will start to really hurt you.
22	Do you have any goal in life? Or responsibilites?  \nI've been in your shoes serval times and  noticed it always happens to me when I just live from day to day, without any big plan in the end or goal. After some time I'm starting to develop apathy as there is nothing driving me forward. \n\nWhat really helps me is to disconnect, go for a trip or hike to realise that there is much more than daily life. Have a good time with your friends by doing something new. (Its crucial do do smth new, as that is the way we work, we need a constant novelty otherwise we are bored out of our minds and nothing seems special anymore. )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS. If your are overusing something to elevate your dopamine level(drugs, masturbation, constat rewarding or even sugar), please stop. Let your hormons and all this shit regulate itself and you will notice groundbreaking change after several weeks. 
13	Let that Fe flow dude. Care for the world & emotion will come if you let it. Feelings are fun, and can help you learn so much about yourself. Feel --> analyse = growth.\n\nAlso, this is a skill. It must be practiced. Labeling one's emotional states is the first step. You may not "feel," because you're oblivious to the fact that you truly are feeling. [https://imgur.com/gallery/tCWChf6](https://imgur.com/gallery/tCWChf6) is a helpful tool.\n\nIf you find you've gone numb, I suggest seeing a therapist. I was depressed & addicted to weed for 4 years through high school. It's been two years since I was diagnosed & next year I will be attending university. I feel the beauty and the sadness of this life, and my relationships are better than ever. 
8	Not all depression is expressed as sadness or suicidality.  Unfortunately, that is the dominant message, but many people suffer depression in the way that you are suffering it.\n\nIMHO, ENTP personalities have a very good ability to compartmentalize their feelings and thoughts, so when the symptoms of depression come on they don't experience many of the more obvious emotional features right away.\n\nNot a scientific explaination but regardless of the what actually causes depression, once it starts there is a neurochemical part of it and your brain is actually not functioning properly.  This is hard for an ENTP to admit sometimes, but the human animal and brain needs a few things to keep running well:\n\n* Air/Water/Food/Shelter etc. all the basics\n* AND, we are social creatures and we need to maintain our self-worth, we must connect with people, our brains need to have an identity and engage with the world.\n\nDepression withdraws you from the things that keep you healthy.  I sought therapy for depression many years ago and was having a similar experience as you did.  She said a powerful thing to me:  Withdrawing is suicide by other means.  What is suicide at its core, it's ending your engagement with the world. \n\nSeek therapeutic help, this is hard for an ENTP because we are convinced we are best suited to help ourselves. Depression is the dragon we can't slay by ourselves.
8	Sometimes it happens. Take care of yourself and take a time out if you need to. 
5	Well, me today. I really enjoy life. I really hate how I'm living it, mainly because I'm gradually losing connection with people around me, inlcuding my closest family.
4	Look up anhedonia.  
3	At least for me, I only feel through other people. I really care for other people, but I don't ever feel independently.
6	>Alright, so I'm pretty fucking sure that I'm not depressed because well.. I love life. But recently, I've noticed that I haven't experienced any strong emotions, and it's starting to alarm me. \n\nSo.. you haven't experienced any strong emotions, yet you "love" life (which is arguably one of the strongest emotions out there). You can't say you simultaneously don't experience strong emotions while also loving life—its contradictory. That means one of them is a lie you're telling yourself. \n\n>I'm not sad or suicidal, just........ emotionless. What is this?\n\nDepression. Depression has varying degrees and will manifest in different ways (suicidal ideation usually comes from moderate to severe depression). Mild depression sounds like it describes what's going on with you. Depression isn't a waft of sadness. It's a dampening of emotions. \n\nObligatory I am not a therapist. You'd be best advised to seek a therapist to sort out what's going on in your head. 
2	Tbh OP could be an edge lord.  He said that this transformation only happened in a week.  I’m no psychologist, but it could be a multitude in things ranging from diet, amount of sunlight, changes in exercise routines.
2	I know that state well enough.\n\nBad news : it will hurt in the long term as you won't really appreciate anything anymore\n\nGood news : it's a good state for changing your habits, your motivations and views.\n\nIf you ve got something you re not confident about, now is the time to rethink it as\nYou re currently painproof .\n\nOnce you ve suffered through enough bad emotions, you will be back to normal.\n\nAs a gay guy I took advantage of this state of mind to come out to my homophobic parents. And that helped me tremendously. \n\nAfter my parents and religion started destroying my life , I started to coldly plan my death. (If not for the state of mind, I would ve done it in a heartbeat)\nWhich led me to reconsider my values.\n\nThe shock of rethinking my values cured me of the emotion proof state of mind .
2	I noticed that I become like that if I sacrifice feelings of excitement for the boringness of everyday life. I suggest you start new hobbies that make your adrenaline levels spark. Suggestion: sport climbing, mountain biking, join a debate club, ...
2	Maybe, it's because, you know, as an extrovert you'll need to talk to someone to recharge a little. I'll make it a little more scientific(lol).\n\nI'm an INTP, and given the fact that I could easily hoard up inside my room for ages and never see anyone (and possibly die of starvation), there's the fact that you need another person to touch with emotions.\n\nI've met a few ENTPs in my life and they're all crazy but sometimes they just go quiet and it bugs me to death. Just, I dunno, try talking to or do something with anyone close to you, not necessarily a group.\n\nOr just relax, these low emotion points come and go, Fe isn't your dominant function, give it some time, if it doesn't, KILL YOUR EMOTIONS.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk.
2	Hey dude, ENFP here, and I've been here too believe it or not. In my case, nothing seemed to excite me anymore, and even though things were going smoothly in school and at home, I almost was numb to all pleasure and pain.   \n\n\nMy biggest advice would be to "jump into the deep end"; that is, throw yourself into a completely uncomfortable situation. If you prefer not to do something, do it, and let your body process it. Once that equilibrium gets shaken up, you'll be able to have highs and lows in your emotional equilibrium again.   \n\n\nChallenge yourself in any way you can. Don't just resort to watching TV or going on the internet. Enroll in a freaking hard course, or an unbearable physical training program. Get the hell out of your apartment, and don't get mired into that Si-comfort. Upset your outer balance, and your inner balance will be upset as well.   \n\n\nJust make sure to have a good support system behind you before you do it.
2	What changed a couple of weeks ago or so?
2	For me it's not that I don't feel anything. It's more of me lacking the "intensity".
2	Yeah, happens to me regularly. It seems to come with complacency in life. Definitely, need to try new things, travel new places, read new books, do whatever people do in montages. \n\nSecondly, I and everyone else in the world, recommends meditation. Watching your mind works is just so illuminating when you're trying to piece together these sort of mood swings. \n\nThirdly, I've come to respect my loner periods. Really, it's healthy for ENTPs to go into their own space and learn (Ti) and emerge with new ideas for the world.\n\nLastly, we are Fe not Fi, so we won't be feelings anything from within. If you want to feel stuff, be around other people who feel deeply (Fi). We often hate this because then we have to feel bad too, but it does help us grow as people.\n\nHope that helps.\n

1	Too much dopamine from social media / ur phone? Might numb you to real life good things
1	but maybe your eating bad or doing drugs or over surfing the internet. I bet you will be fine if you improve your phisiological condition. Be cautious of food. try to eat healthy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbesides, feelings are a consecuence that make us to do something to survive. if you're living a city, without any danger or challenge, then why would you be feeling something?
1	Could be fucking anything. Just do not overthink it.
1	I'm in a weird spot in life and I think my emotions turned off to protect me. I feel a lot like you are describing and have had several friends comment about it too. Usually I'm making jokes and dropping terrible puns everywhere but that's completely stopped. \nI'm not unhappy at all but I've noticed I'm much quicker to snap at someone. I assume when my stuff resolves I'll go back to "normal". 
1	I'm going to take a wild guess that you do coke. Stop that
1	well to be honest thats not how i experience emotions mine ar short lived and intense and tend nothing, u may look anhedonia and deprresion because thats how it sounds like for u, not every depression starts the same way or develop in the same way.\n\nU need to get check because this introverted state ur experience surely doesnt seem as the norm of who u ar, and is better if u get some help that may guide u, instead of letting it affect u more.
1	You sound like someone with a porn addiction. Like no joke\n\nA couple months ago I was addicted to porn and marijuana, and I was just like this. If I wasn’t using, my emotions were totally flatlined, and it sucked. \n\nIf that’s you, get the monkeys off your back
1	Yah, that's called depression.  Do you also feel like you're living your life form the outside looking in, and you just don't have it in you to care enough to argue?  Depression.  Get some sleep and take care of yourself.  If it doesn't fade, go see a doc.
1	Intp visitor here, and we don't any solution about it as well... though we carry a polite/friendly skin around to avoid drama.
1	You're wanting more of something you're missing maybe?  If you suddenly want to be alone you're reflecting on something deeper probably, It's not always bad for a little while, go over the things that matter, the fundamentals. This could bring a change that you need depending on where you are at :) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://youtu.be/ZqNTT0E\_T70](https://youtu.be/ZqNTT0E_T70)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease take just 5 minutes to watch this guy \^ he's the bomb, he has a lot on this topic! 
1	Just adding a data point here: It happens to me as well.  I'm not sure if it's a cycle.\n\nSometimes the ennui seems to exist to repress emotions or stress I'm feeling.  It's not always an immediate problem either - sometimes it's existential fear or a thought that recently occurred to me.  In those cases I try to relax and knock whatever it is loose (drinking helps, but I'm sure there's a non-drug equivalent).\n\nINTPs seem to experience the same.  My INTP friend and I joke about the difference though.\n\nINTP: *Everything is meh and meaningless, and I'm okay with it.*\n\nENTP: *Everything is meh and meaningless, and I'm not okay with it.*
1	Every so often I remind myself it's normal--for me-- it will go away. I do best when I wallow in it. That works for me. Hope it's the same for you. Know this approach might cause howls of disapproval, but I'm slightly higher on the Ti scale rather than Ne so I blame it on lopsided strengths. Or the moon.
1	Yo this is basically my life. I'd say just wait and don't try to be like others i.e. expressing emotions  the way others do. You are different my boi you do it differently. You are very picky and that is understandable. \n\nI'm going to give you good ol' ENTP advise and not tell you how to actually do it: you need to see more people. Go out and get involved. You are not seeing enough people.
1	First of all you can't "try to feel anything", it's just something that you feel. What you seem to be experiencing is some sort of desensitization of your reward system, which might have many causes from endocrine to exogenous. Either way, it's normal as one ages to get accustomed to certain stuff and increasingly search for more exciting stuff until you reach a threshold of what's possible for yourself. At this point, whatever activities used to be fun for you (which might have been becoming increasingly more intense) will simply feel boring and, where you earlier were able to shake things up or increase intensity, are simply unable to do so anymore because you've exhausted your reachable options. The only thing I can say about this is that, it won't last forever, it might take a while for your reward system to become more sensitive again, but on the meantime it would actually be better to focus on completely different activities, introspection and stuff that you used to find boring. Maybe go out less and read more, try to learn painting, or a musical instrument, etc. You seemed to have been a very extrovert person that thrived socially and this saturated your inner balance, therefore to detox from that you might need to deprive from what no longer makes you feel good until it makes you feel good again.\n\nI hope this makes sense to you.
1	Its normal. Thinking is way more important than feeling. Acting on feeling is what inferior and primitive creatures like monkeys do. 
0	Haha, wish I couldnt feel anything. My life would be perfect. I don’t consider this a drawback.

15	Are there some ENTPs with social anxiety or not very social ?	Hello\n\nMany years ago I think I mislabeled myself as an INTP (I was like 19 or something) but now I started digging into MBTI again and I seem to be very ENTP, my friends say I engage into endless debates without any clear purpose (I even agree with them sometimes but act as if I didn't just to break them arguments), I like to dab into many different subjects but get bored when I have to reach the expert level (it's ok when you're above normie level but don't want to become a master because that means I'm missing everything else), also I think it's a disservice to yourself not to look the part and dress accordingly, it's a tool that INTP/INTJ and the such don't seem to understand. However the only piece that doesn't fit the puzzle is that I'm not very social, I think I have social anxiety, or maybe not, sometimes I don't want to go out but when I do it's not that bad (sometimes it is though). I used to view myself as very introvert but when asking friends some of them say I talk a lot and that by no means I'm an introvert. What usually happens depends on the group, if there's too much loud people (too much extroverts) in their own groups I have it harder, but when it's a more quiet group of introverts I end up having more spotlight. \n\nWhat really confuses me is that I still think being alone is very necessary, I need it to research new things and learn new stuff, therefore I spend a lot of time alone and I feel refreshed after it (not very extrovert), whereas too much social interaction seems to drain me.
14	I was literally just struggling with this last night. Here's my conundrum: I have a great time going to a bar alone and swapping stories with strangers; I even frequent the same bar and see the same people every week. But I have a miserable time drinking with friends, especially in bigger groups. I don't know if it's social anxiety or depression or something else. It's gotten to the point that I'm not sure I even like having friends.
11	for me i hate going out and i barely initiate hanging out with friends because i love being alone and at home. but after i do go out, i don‘t wanna go home anymore.\nalso i love meeting new people/strangers etc but sometimes anxiety hits me and i‘m stuck in my head and over analyze everything until i force myself to come back to reality and see things how they are without exaggerating them\n\noh and i love big groups but i hate small groups or 1 to 1 convos. they seem so intimate and personal to me that i just wanna fucking run. but i hate crowded places, if that makes sense
9	Yes. I struggle with this all the time. I think all NTs are not so social by nature. ENTPs are party-batteries and have charisma but in our downtime I like to think we function similarly to INTPs, with perhaps a small circle of very close friends that we enjoy our hobbies/activities with. When I have my small, selected, highest quality group of friends around me, I function as my best and I am most happy.
5	I'm an outgoing social party animal, until I'm not. Everything shuts down fast. I need to retreat to a quite place and be alone. Sometimes for days. If I don't get it I turn into a complete asshole that no one wants to be around. I'm actually in that right now. I ended up getting a hotel room last night and isolated myself for the night. It wasn't enough so I'm still hiding. I have to start adulting tomorrow so I hope this ends before then. 
7	ENTP here (surprise, surprise). ENTPS are often described as ambiverts. People who don't know us might say that we are shy or introverted, but in reality we are just more reserved and the unimportant smalltalk bullshit will not get our tongues going. You're talking about that football match last weekend and about your favourite team? Wow, so much intellectual stimulation. Another harsh reality is that we just don't like to talk to people that we don't find interesting. If there is no common ground then why even bother, what's the sense behind it? Another thing that prevents us from interacting with people is when we sense that they are talking bullshit/lies as we can see through people quite decently. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust like you, I love small groups of friends and hate bigger groups, birthday parties being a good example. I love to travel alone and I love to go clubbin alone, which always results in me making new contacts. INTPS and ENTPS are very similar and ENTPS often doubt their ENTPness, thinking that they might be INTPS. The best way to see if you are an ENTP is something I have read on here: "The difference between an ENTP and INTP is that the ENTP knows how to comb his hair". We are both somewhat nerds, but ENTPS tend to do well at adapting to their environment–we know how to dress well, we know how to meet our peers' expectations, where as the typical INTP is reflected by the programmer genius who arrives at the job interview in shorts and t-shirt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast but not least, don't care too much about the ENTP label. MBTI is a good way to see how you function and to analyze yourself, but don't let your identity merely rely on four letters. You are you and that is important. I wish you a good year.
3	I don't have social anxiety, but I would consider myself an introverted ENTP. It's funny, though, because my friends tend to view me as a social butterfly, but I stay home a lot more than I go out (choice). I find large social gatherings overwhelming and un-fun - the only way to make them tolerable (IMO) is with drugs and alcohol. I think a lot of NTs, including ENTPs and ENTJs, get sensory overload at parties. We may have Fe, but the hyper-extraversion can be a lot for our Ti to take in all at once.
2	I think level of introversion, for some types more than others, can depend on life circumstances such as age and Sex, as well location, family life, popularity in school, etc.  For instance (warning: long story), I grew up in the deep south at a Catholic school where athletics were paramount and I was surrounded by a lot of people I thought were stupid.  I was known as the bitchy weird smart girl. I had some friends/friend groups because ultimately as an Extrovert I needed some time with people; sometimes those relationships were strained, and I valued my alone time just as much.  I also have anxiety and bipolar II disorder which at times made me (still does to some degree) very introverted, or else being the bull in the china cabinet life of the party crazy person). In the younger years Fe wasn’t very much developed for me, as it usually isn’t for anyone by that point in life and mental illness definitely made it more confusing.  Do I hate people or love them? As I’ve gotten older, accepted meds and a bit of therapy, and also worked in sales, I am more comfortable dealing with people in general.  I used to hate small talk but I’ve learned to adapt and try to find common ground with anyone.  I will always try to lead the overall discussion though, and occasionally I push it too far or it’s so boring I will not be able to continue.  But sometimes I am very sensitive and anxious about my environment, maybe too much sensory overload, or I can sense the people and weird vibe in the room and do not want to be there at all like f all these people I need my couch now.  Mostly with strangers but occasionally with a big group of my friends.  It really just depends on my state in life, sometimes I need breathing room from people to recharge but I can’t do that forever I have to get out some.  Like the introversion/extroversion is on a sliding scale.\nI could see myself mistyping myself as INTP when younger (or I/ENFP perhaps during my depressive/hypomanic phases) but I don’t think I could say the same for my INTP friend.  An old friend  and I spoke the other day, and I had not yet talked to her about my foray into personality type/cognitive functions.  She guessed INFP for me (since we haven’t seen each other more than once a year in 12 years).  I only discovered I was ENTP at 34yo and there’s never been a doubt in my mind. I had typed her as an INTP this year, which she verified is correct. We definitely fit in with each other and no one else in elementary school (she had to be correct and prove it even then and it did not endear her to others).  We can both talk to each other for hours about anything, though she consistently prefers to delve into mainly intellectual subjects and I am overall more interested in both that and a variety of subjects of all kinds.  She likes an environment where she can hone her few areas of interests and expand slowly into related areas, but I’m a jack of all trades first that needs an environment where I can do a bunch of different things any given day and then delve deep into the few areas that I can’t stay away from. She’s an attorney (but switched to working on a phd in clinical psychology) who wears khaki pants and a button up shirt 95% of the time no frills anytime, just utility with clothes.  I can be dressed way down all the way up to flashy sometimes and generally know how and want to dress up for different occasions; I don’t mind the attention and sometimes crave it whereas she does not like to be in the spotlight.  She keeps way less friends/acquaintances than I did then and for sure less than I do now.  She loves to travel alone often and has one partner that she spends almost all her time with at home; I would get bored traveling alone that much.  There’s more likenesses and differences but I’ve written a book already...
1	I don't  Necessarily enjoy going out.\n\nI feel like that guy that just walks up and down the beach with a metal detector sometimes.\n\nIf I go out and no one makes my mental stimulation buzzer go off. I just spend that time in  " Paralysis by analysis" \n\nBut if I get that ping.. man.. I don't just come out of my shell. I open my wings, ignite the rockets and prepare to fire a balanced stream of witty comments and thought provoking questions. \n\nThe golden goose for me is to hear " I have never thought about it like that.." \n\nMy thoughts on drinking though.. don't debate or intensely discuss, drunk. I personally have a wide yet shallow knowledge pool. When sober I can connect dots found in the most obscure subjects to make my point relevant or at least make the others less so. But drunk... I loose the damn marker and just end up cursing at the ignorance or absurdity of others.\n\nSorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes 
1	I don't have social anxiety but I do have a hard time getting friends. I get bored with small talk and I'm pretty intense when it comes to strong opinions and obscure interests. I've been told that people have a hard time relating to me, but I do genuinely enjoy learning from other people. I do make people laugh, though, but when I talk seriously sometimes people don't know what to say. I usually only get along with SPs and other NPs who have a good sense of humor and care to keep up. 
7	A final decision has been made. Or, at least I think so.	For the past few months I have been quite frequent on this subreddit. It has mostly been about how to deal with the place I'm living, and the people here. As well as my practically chronic existential crisis since moving up here (Northern Norway). \nIn the beginning it was rather fine, however, there has been the mental challenge after the other, which has left me drained. I also had the question as to which of the two types of I/E-NTP I am. After some dialog with a ENFP friend who has studied this for much longer, I have come to the conclusion that I am probably an INTP, so apologies for the misinformation. However, the solutions many of you came with has been of great use.\n\nI have reached the conclusion that the current environment is doing nothing for my ongoing depressions (going 10 years stong this year) and that it is about time I leave and put in some serious effort into my recovery. \n\nYou might be asking yourself, or the screen for that matter, why I'm writing this here. One one hand, I'm not sure, kinda just felt like it. On the other, I think it might be a habit by this point. Also, I do like the potential feedback on my thoughts.\n\nSorry for the lack of questions, but I just wanted to air my thoughts to the strangers on the internetzz. \n\nPeace. \n
5	Good luck on the change.
3	It would be appreciated if you were to share your and his/her reasoning as to why you are an INTP.  
6	My thoughts on what you need to actually accomplish your goals	
2	I understand getting a reward without much effort is desirable, but doesn't that just breed laziness?
47	ENTP vs an INTJ debate,share your experience.	For me it was quite a disappointement.\n\nThey are intelligent, rational and have a variety of arguments/counter-examples but sometimes they get emotional about the debate? Like they don't see it as a debate, they see it as me attacking them and they get all paranoid. They think that my intentions are to make them look stupid or to just prove them wrong while I only want to have fun lmfao. They go in these tangents at the climax of the debate and be like " You are trying to prove me wrong but it's not working well for you haha". Also, I have noticed that most of the times they jump to conclusions. Like they assume you meant something with that argument and quickly try to answer while you still didn't fully express the idea WHICH IS SO FUCKING ANNOYING because it takes them a while to actually accept that you meant something other than what they had in mind lol.\n\nMaybe the 2 INTJs I have debated are unhealthy I really don't know. All I know is it was the same experience with both of them.
16	My intj friend is exactly like this. It starts off as a debate and then, if it lasts more than like 10 minutes, it usually becomes personal for him. He has said stuff like "you are assuming that I'm wrong." Like, as opposed to what, *assuming* that you're right? I think intjs love to *give* knowledge, but don't like to have their knowledge questioned. They take it personally. The idea that they could be wrong seems almost incomprehensible to them. \n\nDo you know that problem where people think that they know more about a topic than they actually do? Like they are overly confident? I think intjs sometimes suffer from this problem. If they have read 10 books about African history, and the opponent has read 100, the intj will *insist* that they are correct, because they just assert knowledge they read. Even if the opponent has a more nuanced and in-depth understanding. The intj will just say "no you're wrong" to anything that contradicts their limited understanding. I personally suspect that it is partially influenced by how "smart" they think their opponent is. If they look at you and think that you look dumb, then they will just mentally discredit anything you say.  It's as if the debate is secretly about "dominating" the other person. This could explain why they get upset when they start losing: perhaps it's a "how can I lose a debate to a guy who wears skinny jeans??" (or whatever). You know what I mean?
14	I just want to point out, yes, they are Fi third so they can be emotionally attached to their own beliefs and ideas and get more easily offended BUT ENTPs need to take responsibility for getting easily triggered by other people expressing emotions. We're always like 'How dare someone express their feelings (Fi) cause now our feelings are triggered (Fe) and we don't want them to be, Why can't you just feel nothing internally like we do (Ti)?' Ya know?
8	I've actually had the same experience of INTJs re. debates. They're clearly VERY intelligent (and frankly, usually better at it than me because they actually took the time to research all the facts), but being against an INTJ in a debate where they're losing is painful. I think a lot of INTJs have big egos (bigger than almost every other type, including ENTPs) about how smart they are. I think a lot of INTJs also need to feel like they're in control of every situation/argument. Ergo, a bit of spiraling when they're on the losing end. The INTJs I've known have been a bit more mature, I think, than the person you're describing, but you can definitely tell that they're Not Happy about being (even just potentially) wrong. There's always at least a *little* bit of lashing out, that they probably don't even realize they're doing.
8	I’ve always found ENTPs to be very level headed. It doesn’t surprise me that you view us this way with arguments.\n\nWe tend to seek out topics in very serious depth, for our own purposes, and not for the purpose of argument. Said another way, I know a lot of things but I may not be able to prove them to you in a 15 min debate if you disagree with me. Sometimes it can be tough to put into words my understanding of something. \n\nAnd yes, I can be wrong, but it’s not common. And so I imagine this is why we get stubborn and shitty. Not out of arrogance, but just for having the burden of proof on us. INTPs like to argue far more than INTJs.
9	In terms of logical argumentation, they fight on even ground. So choose your battlefield wisely. Speed and powertalk, however, are ENTP's best weapons against INTJs. Use their thorough and concise thinking against them. Overload their brains with information that's plausible enough for them to initiate their analytical but slow thinking. Meanwhile drive them nuts with rhetorical instruments. You have to go full Saul Goodman on that Mr. White. Save your best argument for the final blow, right when their precious mind is covered in your fog. 
4	Trying to beat those bastards in debates is very hard. You have to pick your battles against them very carefully due to how calculating they are, as opposed to how scatter brained we tend to be. One wrong move and your entire argument is gaslit or defeated. \n\nGood luck with that.
8	Nah, I've had some of the best debates ever with my INTJ buddy. We trade wins all the time and I've never seen anyone get emotional or throw insults unironically. \n\nWhen he loses, it's like snatching a toddler's favorite toy and watching them stand there aghast that you exercised power over them. When I lose, I usually change the subject and try to beat him at the next point of contention. \n\nBoth of us have changed our minds on a ton of issues based on our arguments. When two smart people beat each other up for sport, it results in a greater level of understanding that either could achieve individually.\n\n
4	holy shit\n\ncolossus with clay legs\n\nforum users are jumping off the cliffs after their kryptonite has been revealed to the public
4	(ENTP me) Replying before reading the responses. I'm an ENTP with INTJ partner so you can see we constantly have these 'debates' like this.\n\nIn my experience INTJ (not just my partner, but at least 3-4 others I've known fairly well) don't get "emotional about the debate" (are you sure of the typing of 'your' INTJ?) They are more rational than I am if anything. Like the discussion is a game of chess, their move is "pawn to D4" or whatever. Constantly with the next move, the overall argument, far from emotion.\n\n " You are trying to prove me wrong but it's not working well for you haha"  I don't think that is an emotional response actually. More calling out that 'I see what you are doing and I raise you a dime!"\n\n" they assume you meant something with that argument and quickly try to answer while you still didn't fully express the idea" Yeah I get this. I get 1/3 of the way through what I am saying and the INTJ already anticipates it. (Was that person correct with their assumption about your idea, btw?)\n\nI think you are interpreting their motivations wrong personally.
3	Oh yeah, the paranoid thing: so much!\n\nAnd then there's these amazing arguments...\n\nI once had an INTJ friend who told me: "You know... I just spent 6 months in therapy and there were a lot of complicated cases there and I was able to get through to them and I don't think I can do that with you and so that's clearly on YOU, not on me."\n\nUhh...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
5	It is a combination of a lot of things. First the Ni Se imbalance gives INTJ's an inflated ego when they have all these ideas and theories that makes sense in their mind buy fail when exposed to this thing called "reality." Combine that with Fi that most INTJ's done fully develop and they get defensive when others press their idead because to them it is us attacking the very thing that makes them them. Finally, throw in a lack of social awareness/prideful edge lord qualities and you have yourself  the perfect storm of pseudo intellectualism.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm going to bed 
2	I've had the same experience, but that's when you need to channel your ENTP spirit animal and not take things personally at all, even if You Feel Attacked.  Remember, that even if they really were to call you an Ignorant Son of a Donkey, it's up to you to feel offended.  This also applies to debates with INTPs.\n\nWith NTs in general, the speed in which we arrive at ideas can be deeply unnerving, especially to S types who think we are being overly judgemental, but sometimes to fellow N people too.  This feeling of jumping to conclusions that you noticed is exactly this.  For what it's worth, with all my NT friends, I've come to realize that often times it's best to let things slide because in time, they come to see the error of their ways of thinking and eventually come along to what I've been saying all those months/years ago.  :-P
2	ENTP wins with trickery 
2	My best friend is like this, but she claims she's not. There are times I had to back down just bc I realized she was getting in her feelings since she really thought I was questioning her intelligence instead of her belief system, which is purely subjective to begin with. It happened more in the beginning of our friendship, but after being around each other for so long, we started rounding each other out, and she stopped thinking she knows everything and I stopped acting like an ass for fun (mostly)
2	89% of my bad debates happened because I failed to express what I really mean by what I was saying, and yes, 100% of them would have gone fine if my opponent was capable of the same level of open-mindedness and metathink that I was, but then it's still my obligation as a good debater to make them understand from their perspective, no?
2	I would like to point out that the tag team of these two types is an absolute power house. \n\nThe intj lays down the facts on the bored. Then we come in and connect these hard facts to some obscure, yet oddly relevant peace of information.\n\nThe difference is the ENTP enjoys the delivery not the victory we were probably being the devils advocate anyway!. But there will be a round two.\n\nThe intj came out of what ever rabbit whole of information they have dug. To simply highlight and correct what they see as incorrect information. Not someone's view point. \n
2	There are several elements at play here that will rile us up:\nWe hate assumptions\n\nThe J versus your P means we can get to the point of your argument before you have finished your sentence so it looks like we aren't hearing you out or jumping to conclusions, but we just think really fast\n\nAn ENTP enjoys the process of debate - it's fun. An INTJ wants to kick the tyres of an idea by debating with someone clever. Once you have proved it won't work, we'll give up and move on, pretty tired from all the talking too.\n\nIt would be unusual for us to take things personally unless we have spent AGES researching something and know that you cannot possibly have done the same. For example, if an ENTP wants to debate something I am qualified in and they are not - I will assume they think I don't know my stuff and are insulting me (like, man, I have a degree in this and you want to have a crack?)\n\n
5	> because it takes them a while to actually accept that you meant something other than what they had in mind\n\nIt's not our problem that we understand your own arguments better than you do.
1	100% my experience. They also tend to create arguments about nothing just because they feel salty about their own life. My sister is INTJ. When she is not upset or agrees with me it's easy to discuss deep subjects. As soon as she disagrees a little bit she gets super judgmental and attacks people's character.\n 
1	I've only ever met one INTJ. He was one of my close friends partners. He would never debate me. Every time I said something controversial, you could see it on his face that he was biting his tongue not to say anything. And we had opposite views politically. \n\nI am also very well qualified in a field he only had an amateur interest in. So he was guarded about discussing anything related to my field, even though normally he would have a lot of unconventional stuff to say about it, and would say these things only once I was gone.\n\nI think he was motivated to keep his relationship, and I think part of that meant him not debating infront of his partner (my friend). Eventually she dumped him because she said he was a narcissist lol.

Here's to more great posts in 2019!\n\nThe Mods\n
13	First and foremost, I’d like to thank The Academy for this award.  I am nothing but completely humbled. \n\nSecondly, I’d like to thank my two favorite functions, Ne and Ti for making this dream come true. I couldn’t do it without you guys. \n\nAnd lastly, I’d like to thank u/Azdahak and u/The_White_Baron for inspiring me to accept myself for who I truly am... though I may struggle with chronic ADHD, I can overcome any obstacle with the help of friends and large doses of amphetamines. \n\n
10	Oh man, where to begin. I don't know what to say! *Obviously it's an honor just to be nominated.*\n\nI guess I should start by thanking everyone who doesn't understand what a comeback is for voting for me. Particularly my friends, who thought it was hilarious. And, I mean, I really need to thank u/Ninauposkitzipxpe for not knowing what a stereotype is. Had she been armed with that knowledge I wouldn't be here today. To think someone would think about how they lost an argument for 7 months - what dedication. I really appreciate that my rebuttal comment now has the silver it rightly deserves, preserving recognition for posterity. Good thinking, Nina!
3	This Winners List is truly built as a labyrinth of controversy, upset, and glory. The mods did a great job.\n\nEDIT:\n\n>**Best Comeback:** Comment by [u/The\_White\_Baron](https://www.reddit.com/u/The_White_Baron) on [I have been removed as moderator](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/96l5nx/i_have_been_removed_as_moderator/e41j020/) **(Nominated by the mods)**\n\nThe mods nominated a mod removal.... and called the removal Best Comeback... what sort of legitimately accepted comeback doesn't reinstate one as top dog(mod) again... because really it was their behavior that got Snapped Back...*takes back winner of Winners List award*... Surely this is too far even in these hallowed halls
3	Hold up, creds to peterhumm18 for the question, but that Best Advice shout out is mine!  :P\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for the Platinum!
3	My nomination won. Neato!

1	Why are half of these about some mental disease, wtf. 
8	So much hate for INFJ?	I hope i don't cause any real problems here. I noticed there's a lot of hate on this sub for INFJ. Ive never met an ENTP and I joined in hopes of getting to know you guys.. what do you dislike about us? Are there any good experiences you've had with an INFJ? What do you guys value in a friendship, so I/we can learn to befriend you?\n
23	There isn't. You're simply seeing people reacting to the INFJ+ENTP memes.
19	I love INFJs!  I have no idea where you’re getting this hate from.  I even run a club for INFJs out of my basement.  
14	I think I've said this somewhere on this subreddit before, but my main gripe with INFJs is that so many of them are *unhealthy*. In fact, I'm not sure I've ever met a healthy INFJ. It's the combination of navel-gazing and perfectionism, I think, but I can only spend SO LONG listening to you talk about how much you hate yourself, especially since I know you're never actually going to do anything about it because your core values are so deeply held.\n\nAll that being said, I definitely don't hate INFJs. On a good day, you guys are actually my favourites! I like that you're introspective and caring, and that you often have insights into people's behaviors that us thinking types may not. I just... wish there were more good days compared to bad, because every INFJ I've ever known has been prone to spiraling. \n\nETA: Something else that's always flummoxed me about you guys is how much you're willing to bend over backwards to help other people, but how you won't lift a finger to help yourself. It's very frustrating.
9	Taking the bait here.\n\nThere's a lot to like about INFJs, and my sample size of 3 are all female INFJs that were at some point interested in me romantically, which I was too at some point.  But as you can see from the tone of what I just typed, it didn't work out.\n\nAll 3 are delusional.  I mean, all of us are in some way or another, but I think they had it more than others.  All 3 are convinced that they have this Super Power and it's ridiculous how others just can't believe/see it.  One has telepathy and can read auras, another can heal with her hands and one can see beings from other realms.  It'll be a funny little quirk if it didn't bleed into other areas, but the same thought process that leads them to believe they have INFJ Super Powers is also the same one that makes them deluded about other aspects in life.  As adept as they may be with solving the problems of others, when it comes to their own, they're completely deluded.  They like to think they are rational, logical beings, but what I see is just deluded, closed loop, self-reinforcing beliefs that do not stand up to any sort of "real" analysis.  Just like you can't convince them that they don't have telepathic abilities, they can't be convinced that their actions aren't the wisest.  Using one example, one of them is a fellow vegan and I, along with others, tried to convince her to take vitamin B12 supplements to avoid health issues and she's convinced that what she's doing is right, and we're just not open minded or whatever.  Guess who is the one that ended up in hospital years later from neurological issues.\n\nAll 3 are generous in their own ways, but they can be surprisingly selfish too and in ways that really grate me.  I have a friend that tried to commit suicide and I confided in one of the INFJs.  I was shocked at what she said to me that night, judging her for her weakness, etc.  That same INFJ also now has this thing about how all health problems can be resolved with sufficient effort (changes in lifestyle, diet, etc) and refuses to believe that there are afflictions that one can have that just aren't resolvable.  I used the example of how you can't grow back an amputated limb, and she laughed it off like yah, of course you can't.  But she can't see how this can extend to other things too.  This is all fine if it's just an intellectual debate, but in this instance it was particularly bad because it happened as a thread on my Facebook page (which I've since stopped using) and one of the people commenting happens to be a dad who has a daughter who survived childhood cancer.  Perhaps it's too much to call this selfishness, perhaps the better term is extreme self-centeredness.  They're so stuck in their own heads that sometimes they lose their empathy, which is funny because 90% of the time, they are the most empathetic group of women I've met in my entire life, and that's what drawn me to them.  But those exceptions I saw were particularly grating to me.\n\nAll that said, I like them as friends!  I have very enjoyable conversations with them and shared activities with them feel very nice as they exude this natural warmth and care.  They like my company for my endless stream of ideas and thirst for adventure I think.
4	I love INFJ's, one of my top two type favorites.\n\nHOWEVER, this I am a psychic, indigo, empath, past life having, magic; witch, elf,  henoyaka trickster (or however the fuck they spell it), enlightened third eye opened super special person whose wise ways are above you energy vampire narcissist sociopath dullards...\n\nWell, that shit drives me nuts. \n\nAnd the cult circle jerk that inevitably forms when they start congregating amongst themselves in large numbers.\n\nWith that said, I do love most of the ones I met. My cups runneth over in philosophical conversations with them and I blow the horn of plenty in feelings of love and acceptance by them.\n\nYou just have to get past the magic woo woo bullshit with some of them.\n\n\n
3	As a whole it’s very easy to point out the flaws of any group. And your type is most likely to count every negative comment and overlook every time that we praise INFJs.\n\nI’ve only ever met one confirmed INFJ and we just clicked since we met and our friendship has only improved since. Any INFJ that that is like him is alright in my book by default. \n\nBut based from what I’ve seen on the INFJ sub, a lot of you guys are broken versions of him and that’s probably why you guys get a lot of shit. Like going into a sub and asking “why don’t you guys like me”. A lot of that is why you guys get a lot of crap. 
3	Don't know about them but the INFJs I've met are pretty smart and I like that. But I have met one unhealthy one that claims to be INFJ (Whether it is true I do not know) and he's pretty self-centered. He base decisions off his feelings and doesn't want to listen to me and the other NTs so it's irritating sometimes. \n\nThat said, I click well with the normal ones. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk to an ENTP lmao I am pretty free somedays
3	If we're talking just MBTI, then I think the love/hate between these two types comes from sharing the Ti and Fe functions. \n\nWhen both types are mature, it can work well as the shared functions allow for easy, instinctive understanding of each other. \n\nBut during more immature states of development, it would be easy to misunderstand and criticise each other because we see the other type making poor use of those shared functions. \n\nSo for an ENTP who has Ti as their auxiliary function, it may drive them nuts to see immature INFJs (whose Ti is tertiary for them) not using it well and not demonstrating logical consistency. And for INFJs, they might not like how immature ENTPs with their limited tertiary Fe lack empathy and don't care about keeping the peace, etc. \n\nSince tertiary functions tend to develop in later stages of life, I'd say these two types are only really good for each other after they've had a chance to mature. 
3	My best friend is an INFJ, I love her like a sister.\n\nShe's a bit hippie dippy but at the same time she just has such a creative mind and it's fun to just discuss some really esoteric stuff that most people won't even entertain because it's not "real science"\n\nAdditionally, I credit her for shaping my self-relfection and empathy skills.  I like people who can teach me something new either in general or about myself and INFJ are so people focussed they just seem to see you in such a different way than you see yourself - it doesn't meant to need to take all of their observations on but it's super helpful from a personal growth perspective 
5	Based on what I've seen, all the INFJ girls seem to be blue-haired damaged moonquacks that got abandoned by daddy. 
4	Finally someone noticed? The entire sub seems to fucking love you and I'm over here like "where???".  Okay so there's nothing wrong with your type exactly but I just don't get along with you guys. And that said it baffles me that this sub seems to have coined INFJ's as the Best, the Best that we must Protect and as the One who is the most Compatible with ENTP. What? 
5	You know... I have many friends who are INFJs, some of them very close ones, and I definitely don't dislike you. But over the years I have grown to see the dark side of INFJs as well, where they are so focussed on helping people / pleasing people that they can entirely disrespect others' boundaries when these others want to keep some distance. It's like... are you helping me for me or are you helping me for you?\n\n&#x200B;
2	Note to self and other INFJs on the forum: we need to keep our superpowers a secret from ENTPs. 
2	INFJs are paradoxal to me,I love the chemistry I have with just about any of the opposite sex I run into, but the convictions just about make me tear out my hair.\n\nWe were dating for a while, but she'd constantly bring up things like "your aura is looking off today, is everything okay?" - "Babe according to this horoscope unless we talk about the purpose of our relationship it's going to end before April this year" - "The only reason you don't want to hear about astrology and numerology is because you know if you listen you have to admit I'm right."\n\nEvery INFJ I've met in life's been the same routine, they bring up the above mentioned topics, and since I can't help myself from swallowing the bait hook and line I start tearing down the arguments made, and end up being called an asshole.\n\nIn the end I suppose it's the (to me) baseless conviction of various supernatural phenomena to spice up their mundane life, coupled with being pissed over a mean right hook after inviting someone into the ring you're fully aware of wont pull the punches when the bell rings.
2	INFJ is a good type and all of the ones I’ve met have been great people
2	If you wanna be pals with an ENTP, never assume that we lack empathy just because we don't give it in a conventional way. I got accused of lacking empathy multiple times by a feeler just because I'd rather give him advice on how to solve his problems as opposed to telling him that everything will be sunshine and rainbows and glitter. Consider this: If I truly lacked empathy, I wouldn't even be trying to help you solve your problems in the first place.
3	Personally, I didn’t have a  very pleasant experience with the INFJ I met, but I know I can’t judge all INFJ’s just from him, but I still can’t help but a bit wary... just in case. Other ENTP’s may have had similar experiences. I think another thing is that INFJ’s seem absolutely amazing on paper, but when you meet an INFJ they don’t live up to that expectation, because well, they’re humans too, and have flaws. It’s kinda like the expectation vs reality with ads, the item is still good, but not as good as it was in the ad. 
1	The closest friend I have is an INFJ... No way I'm hating her!!!
1	[deleted]
-2	INFJ here. We get a lot if hate because ppl are jelly or they dont like different. ENTPs typically love INFJs. Im married to an ENTP and ive clicked with every ENTP ive met. I think an ENTP would tell you to not give a crap about what other ppl think. 
34	How much do ENTPs spoil themselves?	I was contemplating the reasons why I'm not so productive and I came to the conclusion that I really get tired easily and that I spoil myself A LOT. For example, this is how a normal school day for me goes ( I'm really trying hard to focus on class ) :\n\n1/ Get those 6 to 7 hours of sleep.\n\n2/ Eat breakfast.\n\n3/ Drops a deuce to avoid going to the toilet mid lesson.\n\n4/ Goes to school after all the conditions are met ( I'm always 15 mins late but who cares it's college ).\n\n5/ Not much is learned.\n\n6/ Tries to make up for it at home.\n\n7/ Make sure I have my lunch.\n\n8/ Make sure I get a power nap.\n\n9/ Maybe another power nap to empower the first power nap because I still feel tired you know?\n\n10/ Enough sleeping your future is at stake get to the fucking desk.\n\n11/ Is excited to start but it's almost dinner time.\n\n12/ I don't want to interrupt my study session so I will go get my dinner then I start.\n\n13/ I'm too full I have to digest a bit while laying down before sitting on the desk. \n\n14/ Time to study.\n\n\*30 minutes pass by\*\n\n15/ Ends up dead tired. Enough studying\n\n16/ Goes ahead and spend 2 hours on internet.\n\n16/ Sleep and repeat.\n\nI noticed that I care about my rituals a lot to end up in the best possible shape but I end up tired pretty quickly.\n\nDo y'all think it's an Si thing? Or is it just me? I was thinking about going to the gym from time to time to raise that energy bar and work on my endurance. Shall I go ahead and do that? I mean is it some physical weakness from my part or am I mentally getting tired easily?
17	Just sounds like poor self-discipline. You can't delay short-term gratification for the long. You should find a motivational trick that works for you (I like making lists and physically crossing off items when I complete them), as it sounds like you are struggling to do basic tasks like homework and self-care. Best of luck finding maturity and learning that the adult world is full of boring tasks and chores that must be done anyways.
8	Dude a power nap takes 15minutes, you spend 4h napping in the afternoon at least if you go from lunch to dinner time. Too much sleep is what gets me, no more than my usual 7h of sleep per night and I can be productive as hell if I need. Napping during the day completely kills me if I'm not tired.
6	Daily per diem in sales roles or a card for supplies..lol.. I'd reward myself for a good meeting.. Not sale... A meeting..lol
8	Sounds like ADHD.
2	I am really strict on myself about money but within my budget I spoil myself all the time. Like if I want to go out to eat instead of eating at home one day out of the week then I do it with no hesitation. If I want to color my hair and I have enough money to get all the stuff to do it then I do it. If I feel like being lazy and watching TV as long as there's nothing pertinent that needs to be done, then I let myself be lazy. 
2	"Know thy time" in 8 easy steps!\n\n1. Print out a standard sheet (1 each day, not in bulk).\n2. List when you want to start each activity on the day and for how long.\n3. Record your start and stop time for each GENERAL activity. (similar to what you did above).\n4. Mark green for on time starts, red for late starts. Be ruthless or there'll be endless rationalizing. Record SHORT comment of what happened that the miss occurred.\n5. Record score at end of day.\n6. Track daily scores on a monthly graph that is visual and on your wall in a visible place for all. \n7. Review misses and choose one obstacle to remove. \n8. Adjust plan.\n\nNotes:\n- start simple\n- use small increments\n- expect that the first month there will be a lot of red\n- Rome wasn't built in a day\n- eat the elephant one bite at a time\n\n
1	ENTP! This life is stupid and all but you have to start doing your work! You feel tired most of the time? Get caffeinated! I recommend coffee or espresso double shots! GET YOUR LIFE TOGETHER! Fight through the procrastination. 
1	[deleted]
1	I'm reading this while procrastinating studying for finals. Sounds about right
1	Dont listen to any of them. Your problem is that you aren't getting enough sleep. Your schedule sounds very similar to mine when I was in high school and after high school ended I started sleeping better because of work and that helped a lot. You need at least 8 hours of sleep.
1	I think school is boring and the knowledge I learn is antiquated at best.  In today's society it is the ability to learn the knowledge to then perform a task (test or project) and forget then repeat. But that's a whole other rant. Getting a degree was important to me even if the knowledge gained wasn't at par with what I wanted so...\n\nI used rewards including some of my favorite things to push myself to get things done at school. Like a dog getting a treat for a trick. For example if I missed class or didn't complete a project I couldn't get drunk or go camping or snowboarding on the weekend. Those were the rewards that motivated me.  I would write out what I had to do in order to get something that I wanted each week.  If you need to break it down to the day because a week is too much time at first you can. If I completed everything on the list I got the reward. If I didn't complete it then I was ruthless about not letting myself have the reward.  It was a way to add pressure to task that initially lacked pressure to complete. 
1	I'm this way too. I have two direct cures I have identified.\n\n1) Having a schedule or habit routine. I have an app that has all my habits and it's ridiculous the stuff I will do just to be able to check it off on a stupid app. Having a structure and routine is huge. \n\n2) This one sucks but is 100% effective, is giving up or restricting online and addictive media use. So I dumbed down my phone and blocked most sites on my pc. It makes you so bored you actually do stuff. 
1	Well I won't go into details but I spoil myself more than I should. My soul needs pizza, games, good sleep, and all that goodness. I'm not proud about it.
1	This is exactly why ADHD doesn’t get diagnosed appropriately: people don’t really understand how the disorder manifests and come up with a bunch of rationalizing train of thought. Then they wait until they’re full blown depressed and try anti-depressants rather than the types of meds and exercise programs they really need. \n\nThere’s no such thing as spoiling yourself. I get what you’re trying to say but there’s a much more logical way to think about it. \n\nIf you ever have quick jerking motions, shake your legs and feet, or experience any sort of tic, then you know you’re overdue to be evaluated for ADHD. You can get an evaluation at a regular doctor and even with a nurse practitioner and try meds while you’re waiting for an appointment with a psychiatrist. 
6	What do you value?	What do you prioritize to feel okay in your life? For me it's quality food and activities like dance and yoga.\n\nWhat keeps you feeling alive?
7	I love good food, it one of the only things that actually make me excited. A good workout or a good conversation also get my mood up. I also get a huge mood boost when I get followed or rt’d by my heroes on Twitter. 
6	Freedom. Physical comfort (good food, warmth). Connection. \n\nIn that order.\n\nI need connection to feel happy, but I need freedom and comfort to not feel unhappy.
2	Emapthy, Curiosity, Gratitude, Humility, Perseverance, Patience
2	Being around close friends. All of my favorite memories consist of that sort of thing.\n\nDay to day, my foundation is the gym. Lifting weights calms me because it’s hard to ruminate when I’m busy counting reps and the time between sets. Cardio gives me a really good endorphin high. 
2	Innovation / intellectual freedom, exploration, progress.\n\nI've made a new years resolution to do at least one of (something creative, something healthy, something constructive \[learning, DIY in the house, etc\]) each day.
1	Oh my, I really needed this post to verify that it is OK to only like similar things (food, curiosity, sports) and not get excited over some typical stuff(like travel).
1	Power
1	i prioritize Ne then Ti, then Fe and after that Si, thats how i prioritize .
5	I've recently seen this test. I don't know how scientific it is, but still, I'm interested.	
3	Does it also test for ADHD? Otherwise I fail to see how it's useful. 
2	Mean 100, SD 10, my score 89.\n\nAs a ENTP I felt quite conflicted about some of these questions. Most of the time I like to dictate what I do day-to-day and come up with my own approaches and such like, so my ideal situation is to be given a deadline (say) 1 month out, and work on my own approaches in the 1 month and figure out how to achieve that.\n\nBut I can also be quite lazy and if it's something I don't really care about, I can defer pretty much indefinitely until the 'actual' deadline.\n\nI'm not really the "Natural Leader" in a lot of situations, but often in 'new' or 'unknown' situations I will take the leadership role.\n\nEven in  minor situations like a group discussion where everyone has to fill in "post its" with their own opinion and then put them on the board... I'm almost always the first person to stand up and put them on the board.
6	Entp fighting style?	Would you rather be in a boxing match, barebones, or be placed in a room full of objects and whoever uses the objects creatively wins? Makeshift weapons.
8	The latter lol
4	Not what you asked, but fighting styles in within specific schools of martial arts are varied and I think ENTPs do gravitate towards certain "styles."  I wrestled a lot growing up and throughout college, and there is definitely a split between wrestlers who are more improvisational vs. those with concrete game plans.\n\nThere are plain jane moves that work from beginners up to the olympic level.  [Jordan Burroughs](https://youtu.be/Hs4pNv9pEbQ?t=162) is probably the best USA wrestler in the past 10 years, and he wins 99% of his matches with very simple, well executed moves like a double leg takedown, which is just tackling someone basically (move at timestamp in video).\n\nCompare that to someone like [Bouvaisar Saitiev](https://youtu.be/4H4j9BbyfLw?t=97), who is arguable the top 3 greatest of all time, who does shit that it looks like he just made up on the spot.  The move in the video at that timestamp doesn't have a name lol.  I don't think you can even practice it, it's just something Saitiev could do as he improvised through matches.\n\nI was never close to the level that these guys are, but at a certain level of proficiency in wrestling you see a lot more guys that just flow as opposed to executing the same moves over and over.  I imagine ENTPs gravitate towards a flowy, improvisational style as opposed to hard hitting, execution styles.  The same probably holds true for other martial arts: boxing, kickboxing, bjj, etc.
5	Some here believe it's to just call names, unfortunately. I think you would actually fight with details and sound reasoning. 
2	any strategic fighting. i do Taekwondo and it‘s cool because while moving i can always think of the possible kicks i could do in certain positions and just choose one and do it. i hate anything that requires endurance or discipline. but if you randomly attack me and i have to be witty and have quick reactions and think of solutions of how to attack/defend it gets really fun
2	Well I believe the best strategy with a fight is to avoid it all costs. So I would do whatever I could to avoid the fight from even happening. I'd back off and tell the other person to back off. I'd walk away, or run away if I had to. If the fight is absolutely unavoidable, then yeah, there would be no rules. Then it becomes survival. But I would always use the minimum necessary force. I wouldn't do any more than what I had to get them to back off, so I could move away again. One punch can kill someone. 
2	Bare knuckles 
1	Avoid, but if pressed, violence of action always wins the day.  Kick to the nuts, fish-hook the mouth.  If its a real fight, all of that is justified, and if it's just some B.S. power trip you have to end, the only thing people remember is who was on the ground turtled like McConnell.  
1	I wrestle and box myself
1	execute and implement total annihilation
1	Boxing is a nono. If it's going to be barebones lets use everything, like Systema, Krav Maga or a dirty form of MMA.
7	Occupation	Hey y'all. I'm curious of what you guys work with, and if you enjoy your jobs. I personally get bored super quickly, as soon as I've become really good at what I do, I'm of to something new. I just can't seem to keep interest in jobs that I'm "done" with. If you know what I mean? When I'm "done learning" I get bored and seek to break new ground.\n\nSo bottom line is, what do you do, do you enjoy it, and where are you from? \n\nThank you all very much for sharing your inputs. It's very interesting reads!
5	I'm a (junior) lawyer in a common law jurisdiction. A little more solicitor work, but some litigation/oral advocacy as well. I spend 80% of my time hating this job and 20% trying to stick it out in case it gets better. I don't think I'll remain in this career path in the long term, although I do like policy work so it's possible I'll wind up in law-adjacent.\n\nLaw can be tough for an ENTP because it's very detail-oriented, backwards-looking (by design), and because whatever gratification you're probably looking for its very, very distant. Unless you're some kind of super genius (a title reserved mostly for lawyers on TV, who can hardly be said to practice anything resembling law), you'll probably suck at your job for at least the first five years. It takes a long time to start making any real money (relative to your hours worked and bullshit dealt with) and you have to really, really fight, in my view, to get to a point where your cases are actually meaningful or interesting.
4	Sounds symptomatic of ADHD. You should try Adderall. 
3	Live in London, and I'm a digital video producer. Lucked into the career completely but I love it. I get to be creative, assertive and as it's an emerging scene there's a lot of potential ahead.\n\n
3	Sales! Started off as equities sales at Goldman then quit to become an e-commerce entrepreneur. Since shutting down the business four years ago, have been in enterprise software sales in large corporates. I love sales but I have moved roles/companies every two years because of itchy feet! I can’t imagine being in the same role and/or company for more than two years at a time. I thrive off change and new challenges. I’m perpetually “casually looking” or interviewing. 
2	I‘m studying to become a logistics manager, i‘m already bored of it before even having it started. at such times i hate that i cannot just „follow my heart“ instead of over analyzing everything. rn this degree is the most beneficial one for me. but i hate the idea of wearing a suit and tie and managing people, i‘ll kindly hand that over to our ENTJ partners at the other corner of NT MBTI. \n\ni want to become an entrepreneur because trust me you‘ll *never* get bored. one challenge after another and you can implement all your ideas and monetize them. no one bosses you around either. i think we should all become entrepreneurs
2	I own a freight brokerage and love it, I’ve got 4 agents working for me and in the middle of hiring another. Everyday I have to put all my skills to work, especially problem solving and thinking fast on my feet. It’s so rewarding and wouldn’t have it any other way.
2	Senior software engineer. Love it. Give me a requirement and a month and I'll ace it.\n\nIn your shoes I would seek to look for something with "constantly changing" situations that you'd never get bored with.\n\nIf I wasn't doing what I'm doing I'd considered being a lawyer, journalist, emergency responder.
10	Things that need to be addressed about ENTP personality type.	I’m currently mapping out topics I want to cover in future YouTube videos and was wondering if there were things you’d wish someone had covered/elaborated on. \n\nSome of the things I’m considering are:\n\n•Distinction between ENTPs & ENFPs\n\n•Cognitive functions for beginners\n \n•How each cognitive function may manifests for an ENTP\n\n•ENTP in corporate workplace \n\n•Conflicts and confrontation \n\n•Systems thinking and divergent thinking \n\n•ENTP learning styles and productivity hacks 
17	The correlations between ENTP and narcissism/ADHD. 
9	You should make a topic about how much entps love to plan and think ahead instead of being spontaneous and on the fly.
8	Honestly, I think something on gender would be interesting - e.g., how ENTP men may present differently from ENTP women, generally speaking.
4	It’s not something I’ve looked into, but correlations between the MBTI and Enneagram and Big 5 would be interesting.
3	ENTP & Ti as a seperate topic is redundant if you're doing a video on how each cognitive function manifests for an ENTP already. 
3	Difference between ENTP and ENFP seconded !\n\nI‘m not sure which one I am.. 
2	growth 
2	Introverted ENTP, I thought I was an INTP for a long time and I hear that’s common
1	ENTP temper etc. idk much about it but all that stuff with EP NT TP NP etc and what it tells about us
1	Cognitive functions according to Jung
3	Se vs Ne competition?	An ENTP and ESTP see a lamp. What do they respectively think of? If they were going to duke it out what makes one or the other win?\n\nWould putting more and more objects in the room influence the outcome?\n\nIs the Ne user thinking "what is this lamp made of? Is electricity running through it? Is there any metal in the room that I can use the electricity to electricute this ESTP? Maybe I can swing across that rope...hmm idk if it would be safe, it might break and cause my death.\n\nIs the Se user thinking "That lamp is heavy at the end and has a thin and light base. It would probably be pretty good for swinging. It's also red and really bright, I might be able to pull a knife on him while his eyes are drawn to it. I'll place the lamp over here at this corner, and when he is about to turn the corner I'll swing over, that rope..hmm there are acouple strands left on it...I bet that's enough to swing on. When he turns the corner I'll swing from behind and stab him."\n\n?? Ne and Se must be good in different contexts.
7	It's difficult to pin down Ne and Se in isolation, since we only see them in action through reasoned arguments (through a J-filter). Theoretically though you first have to define a Sensing iNtuition dichotomy. Sensing is about concrete reality, while iNtuition is about abstract fantasy. Sensors value details, and things being realistic. Intuitive are often stuck in imaginationland. \n\nSe therefore will be about observing reality itself. The details of objects, what *is*. It's very matter of fact. Ne on the other hand is like a fuzzier Se. It functions the same way, only turned toward fantasy worlds. What if the Nazis win WWII? Let's create a world like Man in the High Castle. It's "reality", but not quite. \n\nSo an STP in contrast to an NTP will be more grounded in reality. Ti is also a reality based function (in contrast to feeling which is concerned more with *people*) so Ti is also a grounding function. Therefore you expect STPs to essentially have a double real grounding effect. They're far more pragmatic than their NTP brethren, but the driving force behind both of them is really TP.\n\nThey'll look very similar. An STP will basically look like a more grounded NTP, I.e. more matter-of-fact.
1	“When extraverted thinking is subordinated to objective data as a result of over-determination by the object, it engrosses itself entirely in the individual experience and accumulates a mass of undigested empirical material. The oppressive weight of individual experiences having little or no connection with one another produces a dissociation of thought which usually requires psychological compensation. This must consist in some simple, general idea that gives coherence to the disordered whole, or at least affords the possibility of such. Ideas like “matter” or “energy” serve this purpose. But when the thinking depends primarily not on objective data but on some second-hand idea, the very poverty of this thinking is compensated by an all the more impressive accumulation of facts congregating round a narrow and sterile point of view, with the result that many valuable and meaningful aspects are completely lost sight of. Many of the allegedly scientific outpourings of our own day owe their existence to this wrong orientation.”\n\nExcerpt From\nCollected Works of C.G. Jung, Volume 6: Psychological Types\nJung, C. G., Hull, R. F.C., Adler, Gerhard\n
49	ENTPs and hard work	The biggest workaholic Ik is an ENTP. He is one of my closest friends.\n\nWe both studied in a special pioneer school for the elite students in our city. The way it works is, in order for us to stay in that school we have to keep our grades above average. Being the lazy he used to be, he got close to the point of being sacked . Ever since, he changed completely. He started studying 24/7, everytime he got the chance he would pull out his maths  textbook or whatever and work on exerices until it became a habit. It first started because of the pressure and because he was a bit insecure, he was afraid of being seen as "stupid" if he got kicked out of school. However, even after he managed to save himself and he knew for a fact that he was staying for sure. He didn't stop working. It's been two years and he is still the most workaholic person Ik.We have common friends who are ENTJs INTJs ISTJs ESTJs INTPs... and we all agree that he is the most workaholic person we know.\n\nOne day, I asked him - being a lazy ass ENTP myself- how did you do that? how did you manage to change completely?\n\nHe told me that he forced himself to stay on the desk. He told me that he literally got to the point of sweating , he was bored af yet he managed to keep on doing that. Soon enough he is a new person. The thing is, I asked him about this strangely strong will like Ik for a fact he had no plans for the future he was just simply studying. He told me that it's his way of proving himself among us ( it's a pioneer school and most of us had a pretty good IQ, some were even gifted getting medals in IMO and shit.). He said he wanted to cover the IQ gap with hard work ( he did ).\n\nThe thing is, Idc if people think I'm stupid. I want to work harder but not for the wrong reasons ( I believe he is being unhealthy and told him ). The stereotype for the ENTPs is we are unorganized, lazy and procastinate. Yet, even if it was unhealthy, he managed to break free and get over his weaknesses. It's not impossible if one person can do it, right?\n\nTL;DR: Did any of you manage to become a hard working person in a healthy way? If so, can you share the experience?
27	The few people I know well enough to confidently endorse as ENTPs are hard working as fuck when they're not super depressed.  I think more than anything the struggle is to work on the right things, rather than procrastinating by doing silly "work".  It's more an issue with focus and actual follow through.  \n\n> he was bored af yet he managed to keep on doing that  \n\nThat's the struggle way more than "laziness".  For my part it took me a long time to figure out the kinds of things I don't really get bored with, and then to steer my career towards those things.  I still have to do quite a lot of boring shit... but I grin and bear it because it's necessary to keep doing the fun things.  \n\nWhen I'm excited about whatever it is I'm working on I don't want to do anything else really.  I've worked 7 days a week for weeks at a time to make things I thought were cool and challenging.  Supposedly this is typical enough that it's written into a few type descriptions: The enthusiastic super hyper inventor who would rather be making shit than sleeping, and disappears into the workshop for weeks at a time haha.  \n\nYou might try reading Benjamin Franklin's autobiography.  He got a ton of shit done, and talks at length about how and why.  
12	That's some serious pressure. I've always known/thought that if I were to apply all my effort toward something, I would be exceptionally good at it, to the surprise of even established experts. That sounds arrogant, of course, but I've had plenty of compliments from people I respect when I didn't even try, so the assumption/belief is basically an extension of that. The thing is, I'm kind of scared of that ability, while simultaneously unmotivated, because of a lack of need. In that kind of highly competitive, hyperintelligent environment, I can imagine an ENTP would learn how to focus and excel, because we're terribly insecure about being seen as "not smart." 😂 
8	No. I wanted to make something of myself so, I wouldn't be like my parents. I didn't want constantly struggle financially like them. We were poor as dirt. 
8	> Did any of you manage to become a hard working person in a healthy way?  \n  \nYes!  oh wait, I didn't see that "healthy" part there... shit  \n  \nIt went a little something like this:  \n  \n1. Be lazy and reckless  \n\n2. Get into financial troubles due to laziness and reckless decision-making  \n  \n3. Panic  \n  \n4. Be forced to work my ass off to recover from financial ruin for years, working full time while also a full-time student\n  \n5. Spend 2 years developing a hard-work habit because I basically have no choice  \n  \n6. Pay off debt and decide I want a nice car so I keep working hard  \n  \n7. Buy a nice car and decide I want something else expensive so I keep busting my butt  \n  \n8. Repeat cycle of buying expensive items and continuing to work hard  \n  \n9. Now it's just who I am
12	For me it's all about framing everything as a competition. Against myself, against others, against all of God's creation. I know I'll do anything to win, and that all games can be won. So everything becomes a game, with a victory condition.  \n\nWarning: this mindset should not be applied to other people. 
4	Very interesting story, thanks for sharing.
9	When I was 17 i entered a dual credit program for college. Basically I was getting credit for both college and highschool. My first semester i bombed hard. But I knew this was my one shot to make something out of myself. I was a horrible student at the time and I knew i needed to change. And so i did. I wanted to prove more than anything i could do it. I had never been more motivated on my life. For me that will power comes from the need and desire to "win".
3	I love hard work, especially if I like the job and there's lots to learn, or projects I can take on. \n\nSame with courses and hobbies... my average day prior to kids I had dedicated to work, work projects and home /hobby projects and would take up to 14 hours a day six days a week.\n\nHouse work? Not so much. 
9	> The biggest workaholic Ik is an ENTP.\n\n> workaholic \n\n> ENTP\n\nChoose one.\n\n\nHaha, just kidding. Well, first of all I do want to highlight the *possibility* that your friend is not an ENTP because that's based on subjective judgement(s). But, assuming he is I don't think it's that out of the ordinary. You mentioned a pretty important detail, and that's the environment you guys are in. With peers that are more competent, an ENTP recognizes that as not really competition, but more so motivation. I think being judged as incompetent or "not worthy of asking for input" is one of the (few) ways to hurt an ENTP's feelings (YES, it *is* possible haha). \n\nAnd this is really just Fe in action where social exclusion is generally something an ENTP does not aim for (especially in a gifted school). Also, it's not unheard of for ENTPs to develop a routine because of Si (e.g. if they got positive results from their studying method then it becomes a top choice automatically). Although, I'm not sure about them "proving themselves" to others. I don't think that's NeTi behaviour. I would rephrase it as "an aversion to falling behind". \n\nAll of this is to say that generally ENTPs don't look like that otherwise those stereotypes wouldn't even be remotely true. This is a pretty special environment so some special results aren't outlandish. To get a little subjective, in my experience I do my most (efficient) work when working/studying in a group or when others depend on me (i.e. I had to lead a group project because no one else wanted to lol, but hey I actually do enjoy the collaboration process). 
3	I definitely had to learn hard work the hard way. I'm *still* learning hard work the hard way, to be honest. I'm honestly in awe of those for whom it seems to come naturally - I find that I get distracted so easily, even with the best of intentions.\n\nHonestly, what works best for me is just being under a tremendous amount of pressure.  I actually need to overload myself if I'm to get any real work done.\n\nI suspect that for a lot of ENTPs, the first step is actually learning to value hard work. The second step is recognizing that, clever as we are, we actually need to put in the work to succeed as well. Unfortunately, I do think a lot of ENTPs learn hard work the hard way - i.e., after having an unexpected failure. My advice for ENTPs is therefore to really challenge themselves. Basically, if you think you're the smartest person in the room, it's time to move rooms.
3	Man, it is really awesome that you care so much about your friend, it seriously touches me. Don't worry, he needs to explore this other extreme to find middle ground eventually. I used to be the same, and personally needed the experience of crashing in order to learn the lessons I needed to learn. Today, my friends apologize that they have not been there to shake me up and make me realize that I was on the wrong track. The good thing for your friend is that he has you. Help him to see things more clearly and catch him in case things get rough. What he probably needs to hear most is that he is loved - not for compulsive behavior, intelligence or success, though, but for his kind character and for being there as a friend. He is already complete, worthy, enough, creative, abundant, and does not need to prove anything. Chasing something to compensate on IQ is a really stupid thing to do. As if IQ mattered at all, especially for creative people. He must learn to live in his strength, not in his weakness. Tell him that. Do you know how he is doing? I mean, do you really know what is going on in his internal life? \n\nHere is what, if I was him would appreciate you doing: Go find resources that will help him to see 'through the societal game'. In fact, I believe it is essential for ENTPs that we go on a deep dive on the 'essential' things in life, to question norms and rules, social and cultural conditioning, really explore meaning et cetera. I struggle believing that we will ever get rid of the 'striving' side in us (if you even want to), but we can use it for the right things, to strive for understanding, for wisdom, to be an example for others, to use our insane ability to solve their problems. I personally benefited a whole lot from studying and applying C.G. Jung's works (i.e. individuation), several Eastern Philosophies (e.g. Taoism), reading up on psychology (what makes people and society tick, how can we influence our subconscious, how to practice self-love, et cetera... on the one hand to heal my own traumas and get rid of limiting beliefs to move forward, on the other hand to understand other people better). I even majored (on the side) in process philosophy to really understand and internalize the metaphysics many people like Alan Watts, Wayne Dyer and all the others talk about. I am almost embarrassed to say but I also learned a lot from people like Rich Roll, Tim Ferris, Tom Bilyeu and a few others. Let me clarify: I more and more realized that they are not there to make you chase the farce of self optimization, even though that is what all of them seem to do themselves, but to help you develop critical thinking and find your own path. In my mind, they serve mostly as a great starting point for deeper research. It was through podcasts that I got into The Law of Attraction, nutrition and functional medicine, spirituality, what good parenting really means, and much much more. If I had to suggest your friend 1 book only, it would be Tara Brach's Radical Acceptance.\n\nMore specifically, I encourage everyone but especially your friend as a fellow ENTPs to explore and integrate the own shadow side (this is a big one), become an expert on the art of meditation, start writing on a regular basis, start reading fiction, emotionally quit the societal game (which does not mean that you refuse to do what is needed from you to do or strive towards success, it just means that you do 'business on your own terms', to quote a man to learn from Yvon Chouinard), find a way of nurturing your creative potential (think outside the box here), explore the arts and humanities, develop some form of physical practice connecting with nature, really become mindful of who you are, who you want to become, and therefore why you might want to prioritize your own wellbeing and that of others (the power of intentions). You may even want to enroll in a self-authoring program (see narrative identity theory, et cetera) to really prioritize your future self by shaping the story your are telling yourself about yourself. Also, mingle with and try to deeply understand other people, not just ENTPs and classmates (when was the last time you talked to someone from another culture, when was the last time you really (!) talked to a nurse or a photographer, someone significantly older than you).\n\nAs soon as you are incorporating all these things, which - don't be fooled - might take a few years, you will realize how many shells you built up over time and discover a truly beautiful side in you. Two quotes from Rumi here: “Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.” and “Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.” Perhaps, if you are lucky (however, never forget that chance favors the prepared mind...) you might even go on this journey together, as friends. Imagine yourself, both sitting next to each other when you are old, looking back on life and say: wow, I really had no idea, thank you that you have been there and helped me finding my higher self. :)   \n\n\nDisclaimer: I am 26yo and have no fucking clue what this is all about (yet), but I know that it set me on the right path, in part due to the fact that there is no clear path. As C.G. Jung once said: “If the path before you is clear, you’re probably on someone else’s.” 
2	It’s nowhere NEAR as dramatic, but after taking some entrepreneurship classes as electives for my major (computer science), I’ve begun to realize how timing yourself into a daily routine helps. The magic word for me was constraints. It’s not the same as restraints where someone or something is holding you back against your will. \n\nLike many other ENTPs, I naturally tend to bounce around a hundred ideas, yet I never complete a project. With time constraints, it helps channel my concentration into the things that matter most, which helps me get closer to completing homework and projects. \n\nAnd these aren’t tight time constraints either. What I did was use 30-minute loops so that at one interval I’m working, the next I take a break. Work, break. Work, break. I should also note that for each work interval, I’m not always doing the same subject. Same with the break intervals - I don’t just game, but also walk or get a snack.\n\n\nWhat could also help is to find your “calling.” These don’t always have to be linked with your passion, but it’s better if they are linked in some way. The calling is that one activity, skill, hobby, or talent you have where you can do a lot of work without getting stressed out. It could even be something where you feel sad that days only last 24 hours because you want to spend 30 hours on that one thing.

1	What’s the deal in these threads with being surprised with a high achieving, “out to win it” ENTP? It’s insane.
1	[https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/ac3r7v/how\_are\_you\_at\_gaining\_professional\_connections/](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/ac3r7v/how_are_you_at_gaining_professional_connections/)\n\nThis is partly what i do in jobs, but im also veryy hardworking i dont slack off, i dont lost focus, i do what i have to do, and keep seeing to improve what im doing or others ar doing, i think is because i engage Fe at work, if i dont do it my way no one else will, and others will have to suffer it others will have to work extra hard to make up for someone slacking and im not going to do that to them, i have worked 7 days a week with no rest and not asking to rest because i have will of iron when it comes to responsabilitys.\n\nAnd im extremely accountable and actually i dont flake on peopple, i keep my irresponsable behavior inside my home, when i just become the old me, videogames, not finishing almost anything i start at home,i have all the will to learn anything on my own, but when it comes to work on my own without having people that count on me, it becomes way harder to put the work, but when theres people that count on u, ill be there everyday at any time is needed.\n\nThis is not just about Job, i beggan going Yoga the last year, and i didnt drop class a single day,i ended becoming a friend with the teacher, and she uses me as an example of Determination because all of this.\n\nI still see me as the person  always was late to anywhere, who struggled with finishing task on time and a lot of the ways i still see myself ar as if i still where that person.\n\nThe thing i found motivation when i engaged Fe, when i have people that count on me at home, when im building a team, if it were for me i dont truly care much about having stuff or about anything truly to have developed this kind of will, is when i changed perspective and focused on how my actions affected others and how my behavior could inspire others when i changed.\n\nAlso as i side note i have 3 jobs and even thoug i earn well, is not the money the main motivator for what i do.
1	I can see where he is coming from. Actually I could attempt to explain his thought process. Right now he is in challenge mode. After entering your school he was challenged by the strong competition to stay „alive“. He probably subconsciously thinks that „They expect me to fail or be average, because I don‘t have an as high IQ as others. So I‘m going to prove them wrong and show that I am not average and show that I can do it. I think ENTPs are known for being extremely different when there is challenge. If you tell us we can‘t do something, we will excel at it. I think that‘s his mindset because I had the same.\n\nUp until now I‘ve always had bad luck that a lot of drama happened during my exam time. Everyone expected me to fail and get bad grades. They told me „How would you even be successful among so much drama“ etc. When I changed schools they told me I‘ll get bad grad because „everyone is like that“ etc. Basically always told me I can‘t do it. That‘s why I was hard working as hell just to prove them wrong and everything they told me I couldn‘t do I did and excelled at it. Now — the bad news about this. Right now everyone is so used to me succeeding that they‘re *expecting* me to succeed. „I mean that‘s you you can do it anyway“. Now I‘m annoyed as hell because they took all my success for granted and didn‘t see how I had to work my ass off to get here. Right now I‘m in a slope that I don‘t want to work hard anymore. Because everyone expects me to. I don‘t take anything seriously anymore because I don‘t have to prove anyone wrong anymore, it‘s the opposite. So it‘s hard for me to find the motivation to work hard for myself. But I‘m getting better at it. Idk this won‘t help you much maybe just to understand your friend better
1	I had a family suddenly everything changed. It wasn't just about me. So if I get bored at work I suck it up and find a way to be productive and have fun. Since then at my current job I've been promoted twice and constantly receive high ratings on all of my reviews. I think most ENTPs just need a reason. 
1	Im an entp. I dont think ENTPs are lazy. I think most just mistaking "not having good discipline" as lazy. 
10	Advice	According to my friends, I give really good advice. I was told today it was blunt but also hopeful by my friend who has relationship problems. \nPeople come to me all the time for help for careers, family, relationships, technical; etc. And nearly all leave satisfied with a good answer which benefits them. I dont mind it. I like showing that I know shit and help people. \nThe problem however comes when I need advice. I suck at giving myself advice and I cannot think of a single time where someone's advice actually worked for me. So Im stuck in this hole of 'what the fuck to do?' Because I dont know what I need to do without spending hours contemplating it but for someone else's problem it takes me minutes and it works. \n\nIs this an ENTP problem or am I just an encyclopedia without the knowledge to open myself up?
4	Same here. Unfortunately didn't figure out a solution for myself yet. If thinking about yourself at 3rd person and then giving that "imaginary" person advice doesn't work, then maybe you should find another ENTP. But you probably have thought about that already.\n\nWhat I mostly end up doing is troubleshooting my problems, but since I'm think about myself I find it really hard to turn on my objective filter and then I end up saying: "I'll just solve it tomorrow.." . Just try to think about it as a friend's problems and you know, do your thing. I know it's difficult, but I'm getting better at it and if you try it you might too.\n\n
2	Yeah, same. I'm not even trying to be helpful most of the time. Just waxing poetic on the absurdity of it all and they eat it up like fresh biscuits and gravy.
2	I would find what you have already being doing without noticing it, it means if your lost with yourself. Look in hindsight what you're already doing in every day life. Thats kinda like your shape of who you are. There it is. You can add-on to that shape with extra things you might be interested. ect gym, girls, reading, art, music, movies, random shit like rockclimbing?   \nsorry need to ramble....I had been jumping around with university or trade since leaving highschool, it kinda gave me the feeling of 'floating without purpose'. Im glad now ive found out what i want as a main source of income. ITs tough because people jump into careers without realising thats them for the rest of their life. SO.... i guess i needed some 'float' time of not being sure of what my destiny is. Only to find my destiny through that way. 
1	Looks like you're not listening to criticism, especially from people you despise. 
1	I'm in the same boat word for word. I just try to be more open to other's opinions on what will help because sometimes it's not 100% right but leads me in the right direction. 
6	Would you say you're pragmatic?	Why/why not? If not, then what other word would you assign to yourself?
6	Relative to NFs? Yeah. T is still rooted in reality. Relative to the other types? Not really. I come from a family of Sensors and they think I'm an alien. Go figure.
3	I call myself pragmatic, but as a part of my inherent internalized duality, I can also be incredibly impulsive.\n\nI value pragmatism and strive to be as pragmatic as I can, but sometimes fall short.
2	> dealing with things sensibly and realistically in a way that is based on practical rather than theoretical considerations.  \n\nEhhhh sometimes?  I often struggle to do what's practical in the face of what I think would be ideal.  I have absolutely no interest in cooking you chicken and rice for dinner in 20 minutes or so.  However if you've got the time I'll drop 5 hours making some crazy elaborate meal we can't possibly finish.  \n\nI hate it when I'm asked to do some boring easy shit at work... though of course I delight in identifying what would be most expedient/efficient... so long as someone else has to do that while I work on my impossible missions.  \n\nIf I can't go hard I'd rather go home.  
2	I would say I'm pragmatic because I'm very results-oriented. Even though I like to keep my options open for the most part, there are certain things I *know* I want in life. As a result, I'm aware I have to make certain choices in order to get the things I want.\n\nThat being said, I'm also pretty theoretical. It's a weird contradiction. I just think certain things are worth pursuing based on theoretical merit, whereas for other things, I'd like the practical benefit for myself. The contradiction may be explained by the fact that I tend to be a fairly unemotional decision-maker. I always try to be fair, but I'm rarely swayed by a sob story. 
1	I force myself to be more pragmatic usually as I naturally tend to wander off and be like "well if I did this, that would happen" but not actually doing said things. So I'm pragmatic by choice but not by instinct.
1	Pragmatic is used to describe sensors, so I would assume most ENTPs are not pragmatic the majority of the time.\n\nInstead, I would say that they're innovative. But, that's giving too much credit to ENTPs (Sorry, guys. We're not all as innovative as much as we'd like to think). So I'll settle with *alternative* as the word to describe NeTi. 
4	ADHD vs. ENTP	I’m new here and would like some advice, I’ve been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD (they keep changing it) since grade school. I’m always trying to figure myself out and how I tick,  I’ve always felt different than others but couldn’t put my finger on it. I’ve always excelled in any job I’ve had and now own a business and doing great. Anyone I’ve ever managed has always told me what a great boss I am to work for (stern, fair, funny and hard working). I know it sounds like I can’t stop slapping myself on the back, but I never open up like this. So, recently I took a personality test (several of them to make sure it was accurate) and it says I’m ENTP. I start reading and researching everything I can on the subject and it’s me to a T! So to my question, does ADHD and ENTP go hand and hand? 
10	Not really.  The short answer is that the behaviors associated with adhd are maladaptive *by definition* because adhd is a mental disorder with symptoms mainly out of the conscious control of the person.  \n\nBut the traits associated with any personality are neutral which can be positive or negative depending on context, and moreover are only tendencies.  Personality type isn’t destiny. \n\nHowever, people can easily misread the vague descriptions of adhd symptoms into the vague descriptions of personality traits.\n\nFor instance, it’s typical of entp descriptions to say something like “easily bored and find it difficult to focus on mundane tasks.”\n\nBut this is an aspect of personality. Entps are easily bored because they’re curious about *everything* and because they’re constantly seeing new insights. So this can lead to getting swamped by the tangential arguments one thinks of, and being bored when the task at hand requires attention but not necessarily thinking and figuring things out.\n\nThey abandon things readily because they’re dominated by Ne...which is curious about the *concept*. So a superficial, cursory overview of something...learning enough to see how things work....might satisfy Ne curiosity and then they abandon the interest.   Entps abandon many hobbies only because in comparison they start *a lot* more than other types.   \n\nBut with adhd, there is a lack of control, a deficit of attention.  Someone with adhd basically *can’t* concentrate.  That’s why they need drugs to help.  \n\nEntps basically just need maturity and some life lessons about the consequences of procrastination in an SJ world.  \n\nBut this confusion often causes EP types (especially ESFPs who seem to be borderline hyperactive anyway and are 2-3x as common as ENTP/ESTPs) with ADHD to mistake themselves for being an Ne dom, at least on Reddit.   It’s obvious when people start describing Ne qualities as a liability.  
5	> does ADHD and ENTP go hand and hand  \n  \nbeing ENTP does not make you ADHD nor does being ADHD make you ENTP- so, "no" is the answer to your question
2	I can easily see the correlation between NP and ADHD
2	If you want an unusual perspective — my friend has been diagnosed since he was a kid, and we've had a scary amount of seemingly unrelated things in common ever since we met. I always thought we were just psychometrically close to each other, and he thought I had ADHD. Well, he took the test eventually and turns out he's ENTP as well, but that's not all: I went to the doctor last week with a similar question and what do you know! I, too, have ADHD.\n\ntl;dr Friend thinks we both have ADHD, I think we are just both ENTPs; turns out we are both both!
1	In Belgium the awareness of ADHD increased and so the misdiagnoses too. I believe a lot of Ne and Se dom people could be misdiagnosed. The question has raised a few years ago, when I started dating my ENTP SO who has ADHD. I do see some small differences between ENTP'S with or without ADHD and I did a little survey in some community groups. Lots of Ne dom people have been diagnosed because the behaviours look alike. The brain scans of Ne dom's in their flow state (neuroscientist Dario Nardi's research) is the exact same as scientists discovered in people with ADHD. I do believe there are some differences but there hasn't been a study about this yet.\n\nThe guy here who stated people with ADHD can't live without medication: they can. I know several people with ADHD (including some family members) who build it off and are doing perfectly without medication. Yes the focus may not be alway quite how we want it, but they can definitely pay attention and keep their attention to certain things, even if it's not subject of interest, just in a different way.

34	How was your college experience?	I'm in college right now and it's killing me, and I would like to know if some of you have been through similar situations. Like many people, I spent all my school years getting either great or ok grades without studying and never learned to study properly, which combined with a bad choice when I had to decide a major I ended up dropping out and working for some time. While I was working I realized I needed a job that challenged my mind because I was going insane from the boredom. After a few months of trying to learn different skills I decided the best way to go would be a STEM degree.\n\nThe problem is I still suck at studying, and STEM is quite unforgiving in that matter. That combined with the fact my parents (who have their own personal and financial problems) are paying for everything after a year of being independent from them makes me feel I am failing at life really hard. Thing is, I am still in the degree and I know I will finish it because I do enjoy it, but it will take me years. I know my parents love me and will do what they can to help me, but they are getting older every day, having health issues, etc. I just don't feel right adding stress to their lifes when they have enough of it. The only solution to that would be taking a part time job, but seeing how much I am struggling with the degree I know I won't be able to handle a job on top of that.\n\nAnother problem I am having is being on top of everyday responsibilities. I guess this is a common experience for people in their early twenties, and I can see how I am able to deal with it better than many people my age, but I still feel I should be better at these things.\n\nAbout my social life, I have never had many friends, so right now I am quite comfortable having a few close ones and occasionally hanging out with other people. However, for a long time I have been feeling pretty disappointed with many of them. When I worked and paid for all my expenses I had some experiences that showed me parts of life many people around my age are still unaware of, and it shows in their childish behaviour and idealism. I am aware this is normal and not many people have the opportunity I had to commit mistakes and learn from them early on, but it still alienates me quite a bit. I have only one friend who is not either taking way too many drugs, completely into an ideology that is only driving them to make stupid mistakes that will hurt them in the long run or wasting all their free time playing videogames; and because of life circumstances I can only see him every few months for a few hours at a time. I feel I have stopped growing as a person and I am even going back to old habits I had gotten over a long time ago. I don't really know how to find people with the same mindset as me, so for now I just spend more time on my own, which is not the best for an extrovert.\n\nAnd this is how my college experience is right now. Does someone relate?\n\nEDIT: Many times I have posted something and I haven't responded to many answers because I am quite busy, but that does not mean I am not interested in them. I always read every single comment in my posts. I write this for the people who think too much time has passed and nobody will read it. Even if a month has passed, I am interested in your experience.
46	Alright so I'm on the entp subreddit so I'm gonna be blunt and give my honest opinion with the aim of trying to give you what I think is the best advice. T style, non of the F filter.\n\n\nJust get a grip man. Seriously. You say you want to go to class and have a good intellectual career, then just do it. It isn't easy, it's a fucking pain and it's all too easy to fall off the wagon. But if you want to meet your goals you just have to pay the price. I used to be a highschool failure, I literally didn't even show up to class and the school got into legal problems and all kinds of shit. I basically got expelled and through my mum's lobbying and support the school let me try a THIRD time, on probation and threat of being expelled.\n\nThat's when I got my shit together. It took three catastrophic events for me to finally get my shit together. This was 5 years ago.\n\nNow ? I'm in law school in one of the top 3 universities in my country . I'm in the top 10% of my class GPA wise, Im enrolled in distinction programs ,  have  done an extracurricular internship and  now tutor criminal law to first years. Im basically the definition of an overachiever in university because all my fuck ups happened in highschool.  The only way to get there is realising that if you want something out of life you have to pay the price for it. There's no easy cop out, easy fix and no magic wand to fix your problems.  \n\nBy the way I still party like a motherfucker on occasion  and go to weekend  long music festivals 2 or 3 times a year. I'm the kind of person who spends 4 hours in the library on top of attending every  class on weekdays, then party so hard I don't even sleep on Friday, spend Saturday \nrecovering and then Sunday  I'll  try  to get some  reading done if I feel better. You have time to do everything you want to do if you just get organized, focus your ambitions and get your life balance in order.\n\nHang in there and good luck!\n
5	I had similar experiences. Eventually you are going to have to get a grip but that comes with age I think. LIFE IS WORK. A good one is at least. Fucking study, do the fucking dishes. Keep your apartment clean. Take care of your finances. Yeah it sucks in the moment (at first) but then it becomes rewarding. Stop blaming laziness on your mbti and go after success. It’s hard but it’s worth it.
4	Went into a top 10 very elitist STEM school in my country for my bachelor degree, where I studied 18h of maths per week, 14 hours of physics and 5h of CS, with exams every week. I mostly enrolled because I had good grades and that everyone pushed me to do that.\nFirst year I didn't study much but was really stressed out, yet I still got good grades, so they put me into the class for only the best students during the second year.\nWell I just bursted out of stress and exploded. To cope out I developed a severe mental illness and I ended up droping out during the second semester, my grades progressively worse and worse.\nIt took me a lot of time to recover, to find myseld again, and to figure out what I really like. The worst is still dealing with family expectations and stuff, and the feeling of being a failure and not having a future.\n\nSo now I'm restarting uni again, but studying linguistics and social sciences and hoping to get into a graduate program to become a Speech and Language Pathologist, and I'm reliving. Studying something you like is so much better, and even though there is still pressure it's not that bad compared to an elite school. I still don't like studying but the classes are very interesting and it's way less of a chore. I even attend lectures unrelated to the classes I take because they're interesting.\nSo I guess to succeed we really need to do stuff we like, with as little pressure as possible. And ideally something easy so we don't have to struggle with studying lol.\n\nGood luck mate.
4	All I can say is that it was lit. Almost never a dull moment. 
6	I can’t help you much, we have literally the same situation. 
3	Hello.\n\nI am going to put an opposite opinion of what the others said.\n\nMy college experience has been ok-great despite the lack of pressure from not having to pay for my studies (I am in Europe). I am in one of the top schools in my country.\nAlthough not in the very best in its field, I missed the very best by little mainly because of family reasons.  (US equivalent would be : I got a world top 300 when I aimed for the Ivy League)\n\nMy advice would be : peer pressure.\nTry to find some people that matter to you around you willing to work with you and go to the library with them.\n\nDo not look at work in terms of hours but rather in terms of courses. It's not  "I have to work for 2 hours", it's "next comes real analysis".\n\nWhen you study try to organise your schedule in a way that enables you to learn everything you need to know efficiently and quickly. (No need for a thorough understanding, that's boring. You will get to the "thorough part" when you ve mastered everything)\n\nAs long as peer pressure is there, you will respect the schedule.
3	Its funny how Im in the exact same situation as you are but significantly less intense(no heavy tuitions and stuff). So my problem is the same like yours, the people that surround me arent the type that push me to do more. And the fact that in highschool I had such friends doesnt help my case because it gives me something to compare to.\n\nWhat you must know is that you should never depend on the people around you to get you into your productive groove. You should learn to be your own person and do your own things on your own time. Just like studying, its going to demand  you to be consistent and it will probably be slow progress but all I can say is hang in there and dont wait for anyone else to make you a better you. Be patient and very thoughtful of your decisions. Dont compare yourself to those below you, because that will only give you a false sense of progress and one way or another you will realise, at the wrongest possible time, that your progress wasnt real and be dissapointed. And dont confuse the constant nagging in your mind for self-improvement for actual self-improvement because the world doesnt reward thoughts but actions.\n\n
2	As I was reading your post I thought for sure I was just reading a biography of my life. I’ve dropped out twice due to my inability to force myself to study and stay away from partying. I dropped a third time but something tragic happened so I’m giving myself a bit of a pass on that, but now I’m thinking of going back as I can finish my degree up (electrical engineering) in a year and a half. I just need to bust my ass and get it done. I SUCK at studying though, even my first year and a half of EE I didn’t need to study, but Emag, Electronics etc is too difficult to just slide by on lecture alone. I feel ya pain OP. 
2	You sound like a tropical college student. Just build your study habits and you'll be fine. Don't be too hard on yourself :).
2	My college degree consisted of smoking ciggarettes, drinking alcohol, living with acne, high anxiety and stress. some girls. 
2	It's horrible. You will meet some amazing people but most of them suck in my experience especially the professors and the advisors and administrative staff are worse than the professors
1	We are on same situation dude, I feel ya
1	Hey man I had some trouble in college too and felt the same things you were feeling, I did really good my last couple years of college and then did my masters and got to dental school. I don’t know why this isn’t mentioned but if you have trouble focusing consider getting ADHD medication, the long hours to study for STEM related subjects can feel like a breeze with medication . Also about the friends thing, start joining activities YOU like and doing things you like to meet like minded people. You got this buddy
1	I can relate pretty well. Always got good enough grades before college by just halfway paying attention in class. Once college hit i was fucked. At frist i didn't do half bad but my gpa only declined after that first semester. My parents decided to divorce After my first semester so i was financially responsible for myself. Realizing a 8 dollar an hour job isn't going to do fuck all for me I started trafficing weed from my home town back to my school and made $1000 a day for a drive. This led me down a long road filled with adventure i wouldn't trade for almost anything. I was introduced to music festivals and met hundreds of amazing souls and for the first time in a long time felt truely happy. \n\n After getting to 100ish credits in 5 years I said this is dumb and decided to move onto something else because I was pursing a degree that I realized i didnt even want to move into the field i was trying to break into, so i packed my bags and really started travelling. After about a year of this I made my way to Colorado for a music festival and for the first time I felt like I was truely home. 6 months later i bid farewell to my soul family and my dog and I moved out west. \n\nThis led me to start my career in sales, a field that I really enjoy and I started an entry level job at a large b2b tech company. After a year and a half I was disillusioned about what I was selling and again took off some time to do what I wanted to do again. \n\nNow after that I made my way into insurance and was hired at an agency to be their sales guru and am slaying at it, and with aspirations to own my own agency, the agent i work for is mentoring me on how to do just that. \n\nLong story short no matter the road you take, youre smart enough to do just fine in this life. Dont forget to take some time to enjoy it. 
1	I basically did as little work as possible and graduated with a C average. I partied and met people and had the most fun you could in a 4 year time frame. I didn't know what I wanted to do, and it sure as hell wasn't school. I probably should have taken time off in between. However, I didn't get a great job and I worked a bunch and figured out my life a bit. Went back to school and I'm almost done with my MBA with a GPA almost a full point higher than it was in undergrad. I've always been a late bloomer and this is the same. 
1	It was long. I supported myself, received an associates degree and a bachelor's degree. took me 9 years. often dropped classes prematurely, and I often overreached and took classes I wasn't qualified for. And often didn't drop classes that I should have because I didn't want to always be a quitter (pride) or lose my money. my gpa isn't great. it is a B minus. if I had dropped the 5 classes that I failed because I:\n\na)shouldn't have taken two of them in the first place\n\nb)should have dropped the other 3 before it was too late\n\nmy gpa would be a solid B.  :( not fabulous but a lot better than a B-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut as @Elyou243 said. you live in learn. unfortunately i didn't learn a lesson in high school. and now i'm going to have to work even harder selling myself (and how i've learned from my errors assuming i get an opportunity to give such a sales pitch) to make my B- worth anything in job market. listen to @Elyou243. even if you don't know what you want to do or going to do, just work hard, and work smart, and try and graduate with a good gpa so you don't close any doors.
1	Honestly I can relate to this so much. I'm a Junior studying computer science and leadership psychology (weird combination, I know). College has been a rollercoaster for me tbh. My first year was amazing because everyone wanted to get to know everyone else and there were no preconceived notions about anything. Everyone just wanted friends. Fast forward to now, I've been through three friend groups, two breakups (the first was pretty nasty, just dumped my girlfriend yesterday because she refused to communicate with me about anything and admitted yesterday to having feelings for her "guy best friend". My grades averaged 3.5 freshman year (all my classes were easy bullshit intro classes, so naturally I didn't study). Somewhere along the way my friend group exploded with drama that all went completely over my head and next thing I knew no one was talking to each other. Then the sophomore slump hit me. Overloaded as per typical ENTP pride I thought I was hot stuff and took 18 credits, all upper level computer science courses. I finished that semester with a 2.3. Major wake up call. My toxic friends at the time (new friend group) ghosted me after I broke up with my first girlfriend for being toxic and immature. The one friend that sided with me ended up being my roommate and is currently my closest friend, however, he is my main outlet and he is studying abroad this semester with the business school so I have no one close I can talk to. Except my now ex-girlfriend. My best friend introduced me to her and we were together for around six months. Something happened over break (she lives in a different part of the state) with her and her best guy friend. Up till that point I had no issues with him but some time over break he said he had feelings for her and even though she didn't cheat, she reciprocated. So my only support network kinda is non-existent right now but at least I finished my 5th semester with a 3.5 again.\n\nBottom line: There are two parts to college: your academic life and your social life. When you focus too much time on one your other one will fall apart. Or maybe just a coincidence. Regardless, expect college to be an honest-to-goodness shitshow. Do yourself a favor and find people you can trust ASAP and never let them go if you can help it. And when it comes to studying I've found that I study best when I force myself to find a deeper meaning in the subject.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr College is rough but the good parts and people are what you will remember for the rest of your life. Getting your degree is important too.
1	My college experience  \nhas been non-traditional and amaing!\nhttps://youtu.be/6Toy_m6ExU0\n\nI started my freshmen year going to the local university just because it was relatively affordable and I wouldn't have to move. After 1 semester of majoring in communications I realized I was wasting my money and decide to dick around in community college while I figured out what I wanted to do.\n\nAt community college I silently told the acadmic advisor where they could shove it and decided to forego gen ed in favor of whatever random electives I felt like. I took photography, drawing, principles of design, graphic design and dance. Through my dance teacher I discovered yoga and I am now on my way to becoming a certified teacher trainer. I also play hang drum for yoga and healing sessions.\n\nWhile at community college (having taken dance for camera) I decided I was finally going to follow my lifelong dream to become a legendary filmmaker and began studying Film & Television Production with a Minor in Honors Leadership & Academic Research at a University in Denver.\n\nI spent 4 semesters here, studied and worked my ass off (with my dad helping pay for a LOT) became a shift supervisor at the campus Starbucks and learned a heck of a lot about myself and society. I even studied photography in Italy (in the context of the Renaisance). \n\nThen I dropped out, got a minimum wage slave job and have been living life on the edge ever since.\n\nAll this is to say . . . don't let anyone ESPECIALLY NOT YOUR PARENTS tell you what life you need to feel fulfilled. Only you can figure this out and it's hard, requires a lot of work and transformation but if it was easy . . . everyone would do it.\n\nNow I am happy than I have ever been living life on my terms as a freelancer/street musician/entrepreneur.\n\nDECIDE WHAT YOU VALUE\n\nbe patient\n\nwatch @garyvee\nhttps://youtu.be/BDpHQYel6DA\n\nand take care of your health\n\nIt's all on you, whether you choose to believe this or not.

1	You sound like you could use some help. Have you thought of reaching out to anyone?
1	In class right now, I have half of my window filled with notes, and the other filled with reddit. Lol. I'm a business administrations major so I guess(?) I have it easy...
1	As a women CS major who struggled through 7 years of college - college is much more strenuous and overwhelming than the “real world”. Having stuck it out through all those years was definitely worth it. I learned a lot of good things about myself during those tough times. \nHang in there and remember C’s get degrees! 
0	2 years of partying and playing MTG. Dropped out last January.

5	Long distance relationship	So I'm talking to this girl who lives 2,500 miles away, and she's just about as perfect of a match for me as I've ever seen (btw I think she's ENFP, not confirmed). We've only been talking about a month, and I'm scared I might eventually get bored of her, or even worse she'll grow bored of me. Any suggestions? Have any of you guys been in the same situation or had a similar experience? 
12	Yes. No matter how fun a person is online, the only way to know if they are a good match is to meet them in person.
7	When you say "perfect match" what are your criteria?  Have you been in relationships before?\n\nYou will *definitely* get bored, because that's the nature of relationships.  Everything is super exciting and rewarding while in the infatuation/honeymoon phase, but after that fades into boredom is when the "real" relationship begins.  What matters isn't *whether or not you get bored*, it's *what's left when you do*.\n\nAs someone who just got out of a long-term LDR, I can add some anecdotal advice here: with 2500 miles between you, there needs to be some serious conversational chemistry and emotional connection to maintain interest while you 1) can't date, 2) can't touch+, 3) can't meet or see each other interacting with friends and family, 4) probably are supposed to forgo local opportunities...\n\nI mean, the list of LDR difficulties goes on, but ultimately the part that will probably be pretty shitty (especially for two Ne-doms) is *logistics*.  Unlike local relationships, boredom isn't your greatest concern - you can shut your chat app and go do whatever you like to refresh, while the other person has no way of reaching you.  However, also unlike local relationships, you could have everything go *right* emotionally and still watch the relationship die simply because there's no easy or quick way to close the distance (i.e. transferring jobs, immigrating, leaving behind current responsibilities, etc.).
3	If it's only been a month, I'd say there might not be much to go off of to consider her a perfect match honestly. If you think you would actually make the effort to meet her, then sure continue, but if you don't see that happening in the future, then yeah, you'll probably get bored. I would. 
3	I’d recommend meeting her somewhere. Maybe y’all could both plan a vacation? 
2	I'm married to a confirmed enfp and it can get difficult at times, we never get bored of each other but we have a hard time accomplishing long term goals and she sees my need for debate and self improvement as criticism which she takes very personally. Best thing I can say is keep things fresh and fun because she will appreciate that spontaneity but try to steer away from controversial topics she holds dear.
2	Some people become fun specifically because they're far from you, on both your end and their end. If we're talking relationships for life, with time, all you need is for that person: 1. Not to annoy you [while providing: 2. Physical touch and sex]. First stage of a relationship lasts like 3 months (this person is perfect), then second 2-4 years (this person is very good), then the truth comes
1	Long distance is very hard to grow relationship.. we crave human physical touch I think at least occasionally...I have seen them work out if they meet a few times a year..in the end they also have a plan to work towards being together
1	Same experience with an entp. We've talked like crazy for 4 months.  Now I think he's bored / busy with life and thus both have stopped talking to each other - just drifted apart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's sad because the chemistry is insane but yeah....life happens.\n\nI did tell him on the first month on the the possibility of him getting bored etc. he tried to reassure me he wasn't going to or \*IF\* he did..it would take a long time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut yeah, here we are. \n\nKinda sad about it but what, can't do anything about it, the entp has to decide himself if he/they want to stay and keep you.
5	Theories about why we cannot make progress in some fields	2 Thoughts\n\nThese are just thoughts and speculations about knowledge. I don‘t have that much knowledge so what I say might be non sense. If so just tell me my thoughts are shit. \n\n1st\n\nWhat if us not being able to evolve and make progress in some fields in sciences is due to our current knowledge being either incorrect or incomplete? Of course people consider this, but they also accept the equations that haven‘t been proven wrong yet as true for now. So maybe it is a matter of time until some theories get disproven and after we have found the corrected version of it - we will suddenly evolve a lot in this areas. \n\nImagine a skyscraper being build on a crooked base, it would be stable until a certain point but we could not go further than that. Then the people would try finding solutions on the top of the building as to why it cannot go higher, but the actual  problem is in the root.\n\n2nd\n\nWhat if the reason that we cannot make progress in some fields is due to a person‘s lifetime not being long enough to specialize in every single field. There are experts in every field. And even though two experts can come together, discuss and share ideas. And each of them having the tools to find out everything about the other field, it still cannot be compared to let‘s say; we have one person who has specialized in every single field as much as he can. I am sure there would be some revelations and realizations for him that we couldn‘t find out with our limited knowledge, as in expertise in only limited fields. \n\nSo once AI is perfectioned, we could (probably) easily teach them to specialize in every single field, and tell us every single connection he made and see where new possibilties, connections and opportunities occurred. This would be info never possible for a man to achieve, so maybe we have come to an age where we will be able see connections in areas we never thought possible. \n\nAn example would be that people used to think about electricity and magnetism as seperate things, until they found out they‘re the same force and create electromagnetism. \n\nWhat are you thoughts on this? I‘ve been thinking about this for a while, and thought maybe you have a similar thought on it. Or whatever thought just let me know
9	3rd\n\nWhat if our belief that we can understand world around completely is wrong and there is no finite stage of knowledge. What if our anthropocentric view of universe is flawed and in the end - the knowledge we gather is only useful to our own species, but on the grand scale of things is no more viable then any knowledge a fly may have about the world.
5	>Then the people would try finding solutions on the top of the building as to why it cannot go higher, but the actual problem is in the root.\n\nThomas Kuhn analyses this problem in his book [The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Scientific-Revolutions-50th-Anniversary/dp/0226458121/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1547223685&sr=8-2&keywords=structures+of+scientific+revolutions), one of the most influential books in the philosophy of science and apparently also one of the most influential (and often times *completely* misunderstood) works of the 20th century. \n\nThe gist of it is that scientists are comfortable with working within one set of assumptions and theories until there are so many edge cases and the preferred model has become so faulty that patching it doesn't work anymore, which leads to the field being thrown into a crisis which gets resolved by introducing a new [paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm). A prominent example cited is phlogiston theory, another one was the postulation of a luminiferous aether.  Kuhn criticizes the view that science is strictly progressive (in a completely apolitical sense) in its nature. Instead he suggests that it's much more [cyclic](http://www.thwink.org/sustain/glossary/images/KuhnCycle/ModelCrisis_KuhnCycle.png). I think a good way to think about science is that it doesn't move in a straight line, but follows a long-winded path up a hill, with occasional plateaus and even passages in which the car drives downhill (a phase in which established scientific knowledge has to be abandoned because new theories soundly refute it and offer more parsimonious explanations or have more explanatory power).   \n\nThis comes pretty close to the point you're making I think. [Here](http://mypages.iit.edu/~schmaus/Science_and_Values/notes/Kuhn2.htm) is a summary of Kuhn's book which could be of interest to you.\n\n>This would be info never possible for a man to achieve, so maybe we have come to an age where we will be able see connections in areas we never thought possible.\n\nMaybe. But it's a long way until we have AI that can do this reliably. This also ignores the fact that any set of data needs to be interpreted and lacks the creative aspect of theory crafting. \n\n
2	I don't get your problem in the first place.\n\nOf course, you can't always make progress all the time. There are plateaus. For various reasons. But we do make progress in almost every field. \n\nAnd yes: Learning curves get steeper, yes AI will help for some things. Yes, some theories will be proven wrong.\n\nThat'S the way it'S always been. And always will be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't get your particular problem...

7	People who have experimented with drugs, do you find that you binge, binge, and binge one drug and then just suddenly lose interest?	Sometimes I will be really into a drug and then all of a sudden my desire to take it will just disappear. Anyone else ever have this when it comes to taking drugs?
5	Yes. 2018 was my revival in drug usage. I took a break from 2015 to the beginning of 2018, and then felt comfortable enough after that to begin experimenting again. \n\nI will get very focused on one specific drug, worry I might be getting addicted, and then just lose interest for some reason. I’m not sure if this is an ENTP thing, but maybe. At the beginning of 2018 I drank a lot of alcohol on the weekends, but I just feel gross about myself after I do it so I’m not really into it anymore. During the latter half of the month I was really interested in psychedelics. I’ve realized they’re not really for me though. Really fun at the novelty stage, but once I began to analyze them it really fucked with me and I tripped so hard that my mind collapsed on itself.  I really just don’t want to feel that again for a while... so now I’m just doing my usual Adderall. I need that to function, though. 
3	Despite the fact that I love pushing boundaries and explore new things (sports, relationship, intellectual and spiritual pursuits, ...), I never had a real interest in any heavier drugs. Friends of mine did cocaine, psychedelics, and weed but I never participated. Ok, there is this thought: Am I missing out? What could I learn more about myself? Am I less cool now? But honestly, I don't think drugs are worth it as just symptomatic for things in you that better should be faced and integrated than numbed (we all have them). So yes, I did smoke weed perhaps 5 times in my life (I am a 26 yo guy) but I would never do the effort to get the stuff from somewhere. Probably I would forget on the way about it anyways (not funny). However, I admit that it requires quite some discipline for me to stay away from alcohol, tobacco, and coffee, but not even that is  too hard as I exercise a lot and therefore care about what I put in my body. Hope my comment inspires the one or other who may think: 'Perhaps I should do more drugs since that is apparently something ENTPs commonly do'. Don't be fooled.
1	Yes! I just done a big write up on your other post, so I'll make this short. Exactly this! Although there are a few mainstays which I'll always lean back towards (Alcohol, Cannabis, Stimulants).. as there isn't really anything "new" for me to binge on anymore.. and the RC guinea pig stage of my life has been and gone, with all the media hype and dreams of legitimacy too.  \n\nThe same can be said with my passions, interests, hobbies also. Guess it's just part of ENTP life! Being Inconsistently Consistent.
1	No not at all. I'm a big proponent of psychedelics but I just smoke weed on the weekends to avoid any tolerance which removes some of the psychoactiveness if you smoke to often. Additionally, acid and shroom tolerance skyrockets so you should wait at least a week or longer before dosing again so you can't really binge these types of drugs
1	Definitely. Started with alcohol, stopped using it, then onto weed, stopped using it, onto lsd, stopped using it, and then it's kind of cycled, along with nicotine thrown in the loop. 
0	Tried a few had no interest at all. There was no binge

15	Has there ever been a civilization that developed without religion?	
8	Don't think so.
5	Huh.....thinking...thinking.......... huh. Yeah, I guess not from what I know. I'm as bothered about this as I was after hearing that one is not an adult if their bed is in the corner of their room.
2	Civilizations with no religion simply worship the state instead.  In case you're wondering what that usually is called, it's Communism.  Most civilizations in history have been theocracies.  The ancient Persians and Mongolians did permit religious freedom to an extent, but also deified their leaders.
2	Hence why I said most civilizations throughout history have been theocracies.
4	I think the priests itself were the first to NOT believe in anything, but they continued their act to raise folks morale\n\nYou can read the book by vile evil nazi racist Varg Vikernes called "Sorcery and Religion in Ancient Scandinavia: Varg Vikernes" where he [he is a pagan] just says why people believed, how their beliefs changed. \n\nBy the way, assuming you are an atheist, do you get bothered by synchronicity?
1	Depends on how civilizated the civilization in question is.. A guy in that thread you linked said that religion comes from the ability to abstract ideas. I personally agree with this; therefore if that is true there's been a moment in time where there's was no religion. So all of humanity comes from a civilization without religion. If you consider a more modern society then ALL humanity comes from a place of religion.
1	Just a thought on one of the comments referring to the way the ancient Chinese viewed religion (and the 'antithesis' of it). I'm not sure which period we're actually talking about, but I'm not convinced that the antithesis of religion was the state/emperor... The emperor sometimes claimed to be heavenly (in the Confucian sense), so if their attempts at influencing common opinion worked, religion and emperor/dynasty shouldn't be seen as opposites. On the other hand, one can argue that the fact that the emperor has to put in an effort to convince people of his heavenly relation means that he probably has no relation to heaven in the first place... But I dunno, this reasoning seems a bit twisted. Buddhism flourished in the Tang dynasty, but I'm not sure if this is related to civilizational 'progress' in a tangential manner or if there is some causal relationship involved. Currently, depending on how one defines religion, the Chinese state could probably be seen as 'progressing' with limited religion (state-sanctioned or small-community-based ones (Christianity, Buddhism, I'm not sure about Islam) in probably most areas)... \n\nOK, that said, I'm happy to be corrected if there are factual errors above

102	Meditation has really helped me realize when I'm getting stuck in stupid thought loops of my own creation. I think it might be able to help some of you folk as well.	
10	Whats your meditation routine or advice for someone who doesnt know anything about meditation? 
3	I never realized thought loops were an ENTP thing. I process things so quickly and my what if machine is fantastic at coming up with multiple solutions. If that fails me then I just move on. If I can't move on then I accept the best option and don't sweat it any more. 
3	I’ve tried, but I always fall asleep. 
2	How do you stay consistent about it? I don't meditate per-se, but I do regularly practice immersing myself in what I'm doing as much as I can in that moment.\n\nAlso, do you have ADHD, and if you do, were you medicated? Are you still medicated for it?
2	I also suggest to anyone who’s looking to start meditation to check out Noah Elkrief on YouTube regarding meditation. The way he explains the process is pretty good and deconstructs this oxymoron of controlling your thoughts by gently leaving them alone; being present in the moment. And if you have a few bucks to spare, get Headspace on your phone (you get a month for free iirc).
1	Lol this is me.
1	Yes. 
1	Seems like a couple of people on here are asking how I meditate so I thought I would answer it all at once in a single comment. I am by no means an expert on this, but I do have a few years of experience and also lead the meditation community at my university so I should be able to answer.\n\n**What is meditation?** \- The act of specifically training your mind to be more focused. This is done by repeatedly bringing your attention back to a single object, typically the breath (although other things such as sound or mantras can also be used they just aren't as popular).\n\n**I've tried it but I can't seem to focus/have ADHD/always get distracted!** \- This is a good thing! The point of meditation is not to sit there and be in absolute focused bliss. Our brain naturally wanders all the time and there is nothing we can do to stop that. Instead, the point is to ***realize*** *when you've been distracted and bring your mind back to the object of focus.* It's a little bit like going to the gym and lifting weights. You don't just stand there *holding* weights above your head, rather it is the *act of lifting the weight* that will increase your strength. Your mind is exactly the same way - meditation isn't about *holding* your focus on a thing, its about the *act of realizing your mind has wandered and bringing it back.* Each time you do so your strengthen your mental "focus muscle". So really, sitting there and realizing you aren't paying attention to the breath is exactly what you want to happen - it gives you an opportunity to use your focus muscle. Every time this happens is like doing a rep of a weight at the gym.\n\n**I start it, but always stop after a few days/weeks!** The secret to starting any new habit is to start small. In fact, you should start so small that you have *no excuse* not to do it. I seem to have very low willpower, so I started my dailyish habit by ***literally just sitting my butt on my cushion and taking a single breath.*** If I sat for longer than a single breath then great, but I always gave myself permission to get up and leave after one if I wasn't feeling it that day. Why did I do it "dailyish"? Because I have no willpower, and if I try to do something every day and then miss a day I will often give up on the whole thing. Instead, I try to do it the majority of days - If I do a habit 4/7 days of the week then that is a success! I also started with the smallest behaviour possible. This means that when the lazy part of me inevitably said "I don't want to do this today" it was easy to not listen because the entire process would take 5 seconds. Just set aside a reserved "meditation space" (it can be a chair, or a cushion, or a step, really anything. I would recommend avoiding your bed because that is already a spot reserved for sleeping and you may then fall asleep during meditation) and always run the behaviour there. Having an app to track it on as well as a notification on your phone can really help. Having a friend to hassle you into doing it is also great, but not necessary.\n\n**Alright, you convinced me to try. How do I actually do this dang thing? -** Meditation generally consists of 3 steps:\n\n1. Sit down and try to focus on the sensation of breathing (in the belly, shoulder, nose, whatever sticks out for you).\n2. Get distracted (I've been meditating for 6 years and usually I end up in this step after 1-2 minutes. It's not about how often it happens, it's about how quickly you can realize it's happenned and bring your attention back).\n3. Realize you've been distracted, go back to step 1.\n\nIt can be really helpful to either find a group in your community that meditates, or to use an app. At the beginning I used headspace a lot and it was great, although there are a bunch of different ones out there so if you have another one you like then use that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully that answers everyone's questions! If you have any more let me know in the comments and I'll try to get to them when I can.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Wim Hof Breathing Method before or after meditation.\n\n
1	I’ve actually been trying to meditate most days this new year as a new habit. It’s difficult to do, but I think I generally feel better when it’s a successful 20 minutes. I’ve been using the Oak app since it’s free and can do a little chime every X minutes to remind me to refocus. \n\n\nHere’s to hoping it helps everyone with something. 
1	So the solution to this problem is just to feel the moment, proyect your personality in a good way. I mostly feel like that when I am alone , but those moments alone make me explore my psyche, which leads to development.
1	I cannot recommend more highly to anyone (talking to you, ENTP’s!) interested in starting mediation: the Headspace app on mobile. There’s a yearly fee, but easily the best thing I’ve purchased last year. These are guided meditations, and many of them have themes of personal growth (self esteem, change, and relationship packs I’ve used and they’ve helped! ), & work and productivity (focus, prioritization, and creativity packs I also find awesome!), as well as other themed mediations like eating mindfully, grief, kindness, presentations, and sports... I’ve had anxiety problems my whole life, and meditating with these is the best solution that I’ve found to calming down my mind (eating well, exercising, and sleeping too of course). The best thing about meditation is that I don’t have to bother my family and friends with rapidly talking in circles for hours at a time about my restlessness, until after I mediate and still determine that my issue requires human communication to figure out. :.) 
14	I constantly feel like some sad broken creature that needs to be fixed after hanging out with my INFJ friends. Why?	I’m not even sure if they intentionally do this, but when I’m with INFJs for too long, it’s like they have this *need* to bring my insecurities to the surface and fix them in ways that aren’t productive for me as a person. If I’m talking about issues, problems, or just about anything in the “world” and say it in a confident tone, for some reason they find this as their time to suddenly turn these observations that I have on to *me* and make me reflect about negative things that I’m already aware about myself. Not only that, but they also have to make me aware that EVERYONE knows it and EVERYONE thinks the same way they do about me. They make me care and self-conscious about things that I otherwise don’t care about more than I do.\n\nExample: I have an ESFP friend who is very unhealthy. In the last few years, she has gone downhill more than ever. She treats everyone around rudely, to the point that she is always screaming, yelling, and making everyone’s lives miserable. I am aware that she has personal problems that need fixed and helped. The problem is, no matter what you do, she refuses to help herself. She called me a “fucking cunt” the last time I spoke to her because I called her out for always yelling at her *friends*. After that, I decided I wasn’t going to deal with it anymore. It’s really, really difficult to get me to the point where I actually care enough to stop being friends with someone. The only way that happens is if I’ve come to the conclusion that they’re not going to change any time soon and that I shouldn’t have to stick around and deal with that. I texted my INFJ friend, told her my thoughts and that I didn’t think I was going to be friends with her anymore...and suddenly it is MY fault. It’s my fault because I TRIGGER her by calling her out, it’s my fault because I do this this and that. \n\nLook, I would NOT have stopped being friends with her if it was JUST me she acts that way to. If it’s just me, then ya, maybe I’m doing something wrong. But it’s *everyone*. Then this INFJ proceeded to basically brag about how strong he was by saying how everything she does isn’t a big deal, about how she just needs help- and yet if he gets the chance, he can bitch about her all he wants to me in the car. But if I do it, suddenly it’s because I’m the cause, I’m be fuck up, and because basically just me as a person triggers EVERYONE including her.\n\nSo afterward, I stopped texting my INFJ friend, and now I feel like shit. Logically, if I hadn’t... I don’t know... called her out...I guess she wouldn’t have screamed at me and called me a fucking cunt? So like I guess he’s correct? But why do I have to sacrifice my sanity and watch other people get treated like shit because she “needs people” who she is a complete bitch to? It annoys me because the INFJ is correct in a very, very idealistic way, but not a realistic or human one. It’s like I’m an IDIOT because I’m not being so PERFECT like he is. So now I feel fucking stupid and like I’m a moron.\n\nWhy do INFJs not realize that not everyone else is a “martyr” and fucks themselves over so they can feel self satisfaction? It’s like they *like* being dogs who are being whipped. 
10	Wow, this sounds exactly like a situation I had with my ex-INFJ friend. Honestly, INFJs are such a toxic lot. \n\nShe would also criticize the hell out of me and tell me that I just needed to have more compassion for people even when that person was severely fucking me over. And I just took it because I can handle constructive criticism and different perspectives. But the second you turn their hyper-critical lens on themselves, they get defensive as fuck because it ruins their perfect image they have of themselves. See, there’s this thing called the actual self and the ideal self in psychology. The thing with INFJs is that they can’t differentiate between the two. They see everyone else’s *actual self*, but they only see their own *ideal* self which is why so many of them are cult leaders. When you shatter their sense of self and confront them about their own hypocrisy, they basically cut you off and “doorslam” you out of their own illogical mess of shame and emotions. \n\nI really don’t see where this whole ENTP/INFJ power couple thing comes from. I can only stand INFJs if they hold themselves to the same standard that they hold other people, but they usually don’t. And r/INFJ is such a circle jerk of people patting themselves on the back because “no one understands them.” \n\n
17	Look at it this way:\n\nSuppose you saw the potential perfection in everyone. However, unlike ENTPs who see perfection simply as a cool possibility, you see it as a factual inevitability. You don’t just “think” it can exist in everyone, they have an intense, idealist gut belief (Ni-Fe) that it can. This is what INFJs do. There isn’t a conscious, systematic process behind this belief, it’s simply what they believe above all else because their intuition tells them so. Because of their functions, an INFJs only real identity revolves around this view of people. The only issue is, because of their inferior Se, they typically think how things are now is too cold, evil, and corrupt. They will more often than not always think this to some degree. \n\nHowever, this INFJ likely isn’t trying to “fuck you over” in an intentionally malicious way, they are doing it because in their mind, you’re attacking this ESFPs potential perfection and paying attention to the ESFPs “immediate” self, which to an INFJ is only a thing that is temporarily delaying the ESFPs inevitable perfect self that will be there. Since this is an INFJs most prominent sense of “self” that they have, in their mind you’re probably also attacking him because you’re attacking his intuitive views. To him, you’re just being a product of the evil world, you’re self-hating, you’re selfish, and you’re probably a coward because you’re afraid of striving for perfection and believing in it.\n\nENTPs simply don’t think this way. We are ExxPs. All ExxPs are by nature self preservers of their second functions-  they won’t be controlled and will not stay in a shitty situation because they feel obligated to it for long- especially ExTPs. Ne/Se are free flowing unconscious functions of “existence” and “reality”- our goal is to guide *our* own identities (Ti-Fe and Fi-Te) through our perception of the amazingly chaotic, crazy world around us. We *live* for exploring. If we feel tied down, if we feel like things are never going to change (which is something we strive for), then we are not going to stick around and get hit by the shrapnel. ExTPs are idealistic about “society” as a whole, but only to a certain extent- we aren’t going to sacrifice ourselves for something else if it’s at the expense of freedom. INFJs- or simply FJs in general “”””get”””” this but they don’t really “relate” to it or “care”. They think it’s just some quirk that can be tied back into place. That’s what they likely see your ENTP traits as, quirks and kinks. They don’t get that these things aren’t quirks and kinks, but that they are literally who you are and your own identity. \n\nImo, you do what you want(you’re an ExxP so you’ll do what you want anyway), but don’t expect to get that INFJ to express anything but pity for you because you don’t “get” perfection/people like he does. To be honest, INFJs just don’t seem like a good match for ENTPs at all. Every time I am done being around one I feel like I just got done trying to solve a math equation with no end in sight. It just doesn’t seem worth it. \n
6	She got triggered that you called her out; it's your fault to be called a fucking cunt (you confront the her and she responded to you with an insult). But you are not at fault for her unhealthy behavior. Like you said, why should you allow someone to be unrespectful towards you and others? The thing with Ni is, it can be quite tunnel vision and you have to bring new perspective to them (in this case, the INFJ believe it was better to be empathetic than to speak out the issue). When they are imposing an ideal on you, that's an equivalent of not accepting for who you are. I would confront them on that with something like "I let you be yourself with all your flaws, why can't you let me be myself with my flaws? Bringing up the past (insecurities) and what others think about me is not a justification for anything (it's irrelevant and unproductive)" At first, they may think you are being stubborn (or having a fixed mindset), but by being consistently firmed in your self-respect (assertiveness), it may discourage them for criticizing your person in the future. There is a possibility that the INFJ would withdraw because they feel they are a negative impact in your life. The other possibility is a total admiration for you (attention: it can be pretty gay)
4	Everyone you described (except yourself) seem to be very unhealthy persons to be with. Don't let other people's judgment get in the way of your self-respect!
2	dude, i have seen countless unhealthy feelers trying to justify their shitty behaviour towards other because of „their struggles“. but guess what, nobody gives a shit about your struggles as long as you‘re not respectful. some people assume you have this unbreakable bond that no matter how shitty they are you will stick to them, or that „supporting friends in bad times“ is equal to supporting friends that treat you badly at those times too. if she has struggles, it‘s okay if she‘s down or stressed or not up for fun things, but you only step in to understand her and talk with her about her problems. it literally makes zero sense why it would be a justification to treat you badly like can people not seperate these two things and see you‘re not at fault foe their struggles so you shouldn‘t be the one who suffers for it? 1+1=3 i‘d say. zero sense\n\n(sorry for this rant i‘ve had a mentally abusive friendship with someone who did *exactly* the same thing to me too, so i get pissed off at such people)\n\ni would recommend to stay away from such toxic people. i know 2 INFJs as family members and i feel bad for their husbands because both are very hard to deal with. once unhealthy INFJs can get extremely toxic. i cannot tell you much about this besides just walk away from them and you have no reason to feel bad about it, or as if you‘re at fault. do you feel good next to them? no. simple as that. then walk away. a friendship is not a family bond where you have to deal with shitty people bc you have no choice. you *do* have a choice because *you* choose your friends. if it feels like a burden the friendship basically does not make any sense\n\ni know easier said than done, i‘ve been trying to walk away from a ESFP friend too but because she‘s not *that* toxic currently i don‘t care enough to take measurements because consequences would be annoying to deal with so i‘d rather just deal with the friendship as it‘s still kinda fun\n\nanyways hope i could help you
4	Because they are probably INFP's. \n\n9 times out of ten you can't hit an INFJ pinata without INFP candy falling out of it.
2	I came here because I enjoy reading INFJ criticism and analysis. \n\nAnyways, your friends should bring you up in the world, not make you feel shitty about all your actions. Personally, I would encourage my friends to set boundaries if people are horrible to them as your ESFP sounds. Though it sounds like you could use some new friends all around—male INFJs are weird anyways. 
2	INFJS are usually assholes and very broken people. I live with two of them, I know. My personality is so over the top I have completely bulldozed them into being my clones. They mirror me very well. Don't let the INFJ judgement bring you down and you will do much better around them. All this said. My partner is an INFJ and I wouldn't trade her for anything. She holds me down and I lift her up. We complement each other well. 
1	That doesnt sound like anything i would do at all. These are really troubled people, and these actions are quite bizarre. What you did was best for you. Is there some extremely large backstory between your relationships with the ESFP that would cause the INFJ to berate you like that? 
1	How old is this INFJ you are speaking of? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA lot of INFJS need the self growth they advice others, for themselves desperately/ HUmble pie and some confidence and a good Ti development is needed/ ALso drawing boundaries with Fe so they can realize not everyone has the same value system. I find younger or better said undeveloped unaware INFJs quite difficult to deal with, ( im 28 year old INfj female)
1	I think xxFJ's in general are hard to deal with but not all of them are terrible people. I think part of my problem is the need to be understood, but they just won't understand what my thought processes are. There is too much of a difference. 
0	The last comment "It’s like they like being dogs who are being whipped." sort of confirms my suspicions around the subtext behind this "question".\n\nWhile I agree with you that INFJ's have this remarkable gift.. I think what's really happening is you're being a typical female and there is some sort of love triangle going on here. 
9	ig ENTP	Hey there! My question is the following: what is being an intellectually gifted (at least 98th percentile) ENTP like? How has it affected you socially?\nSomewhat important footnote: I am asking this question out of sheer curiosity, so pretty please, don't downvote me into oblivion.
22	I'm literally 98th percentile, or 130 IQ. It has made me a lazy fuck. 
13	I'm in an MD/PhD program so I feel like to the layman maybe I'd qualify. I don't feel intelligent but I definitely think many people around me lack a shred of critical thinking skills and common sense. Which professors agree is getting worse and worse as competitiveness increases and mental regurgitation becomes the only skill necessary to succeed. My advice to everyone is if you feel like you're the smartest person in the room, keep advancing your education until you feel average. I'm about there now at least in academic performance. However there's a huge con to it which is that ENTPs get sporadic and bored easily and a lot of programs like this expect you to keep your nose to the grindstone and jump through illogical administrative hoops so it's easy to get into a depressive funk. In regards to social-ability I'm definitely above and beyond the typical colleague, but I'm way below average on work ethic which is becoming problematic ha
10	Never taken an iq test but I’m fairly certain I’m smart. Also you all need to chill we got some \nr/iamverysmart material 
9	I honestly think the whole “socially retarded” aspect of being super smart is complete bullshit. There are plenty of smart socially savvy people and plenty of smart socially retarded people. The smart socially retarded people just get more noticed because they’re “SUCh an ENiGMa”.
7	Flip it around and you can answer it yourself.  Would someone’s life be qualitatively different if they were in the 2nd percentile (IQ 70)?\n\nFor instance if you have an IQ of 70, you’re going to be fairly restricted as to the jobs you can do because you won’t be able to compete in school.  For instance, neurosurgeon or data scientist are pretty much out of the running.\n\nIf you have an IQ of 130, then pretty much any job is open to you, which presents its own set of challenges especially if you’re an ENTP and have difficulties finding *one* area of concentration to pursue.  
6	I’m definitely an extrovert and social, but sometimes I feel like I’m operating at a totally different frequency than a majority of the people around me. The ones like my INTJ best friend who are at/above my level (and not robots) are the people that really stimulate me. It’s rare for me to make more meaningful connections with others, but when I do they’re deep and tend to be based around a mutual respect. And I think being an ENTP + intelligent, as interesting as it might sound, helps me out in that I can pick up on people’s behavior and read between the lines in a way that I can predict what they’ll do/say in a given situation with a solid degree of accuracy. Once in a while I accidentally finish someones thought for them because I had already run through it in my head; then I shut up a little bc that’s rude. 
4	Why would someone's life be diffrent if they were in 98th percentile?
4	I have an IQ of 134, which makes life better and worse. I enjoy deep diving and making obscure connections like all of us, but even further then that to the point my other entp friends cant follow (could be the copious amounts of weed they smoke) education wise, walked through HS graduating early with honors and college was a bit more difficult but never did i think i wouldn't pass. Idk man, both more open and closed off at the same time. I can be socially awkward as well as the life of the party, basically like everyone else in the group
5	***My two cent rant:***\n\nI think these "intelligence ranking" systems are ridiculous and not productive in the slightest.  What difference does it make if you're in tenth place or twentieth?  It's all relative, and there will *always* be someone "smarter" than you in a different context or arena.\n\nBeing "98th percentile" is just some arbitrary ranking on some arbitrary test.  What does "intelligence" in this context even mean?  Is this translating to mental processing power?  Neural pathway efficiency or connectivity?  Computational ability?  Theory of Mind development?  Marked interoception?\n\nI'm extremely skeptical of anyone who claims to be intelligent and then points to a math test or some other external measure as proof.  No one can condense your mind (or anyone else's) into a single number, and the willingness to do so shows either an astounding lack of awareness or an ironic lack of intelligence.\n\n***Disclaimer:*** Yeah yeah, I get that Mensa helps on some applications.  If you've gotta play the game, then fine, use what you got.  On principle I despise the mentality, but I recognize that people realistically have to work within the system.
2	140IQ here, been in schools for gifted since the 5th grade. Definitly used to be one of the laziest around school. Started studying mechanical engineering at a university, which forced me at some point to start studying. At the start i tried to bs myself through the exams, but after a few years in you cant cram a complete semester into your head, couple of hours before the exams. Now im basically a workaholic and use lists for everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> what is being an intellectually gifted (at least 98th percentile) ENTP like? \n\nlonely, if you cant find fitting friends, who also like super scientific stuff or other intriguing topics. Luckily i have a couple of gifted INTP friends from school. I dont think the IQ changes all that much in being an ENTP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> How has it affected you socially?  \n\nBeing an ENTP, i'm one of the most social ones amongst the other gifted ppl. I'm totally into sociology/psychology  and analyse every relationship i have. I think im pretty good at reading people, but im super worried i might control or manipulate someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTbh i dont know if most of the traits are due to being gifted or being ENTP. IQ itself is useless, if you decide not to use it. Hit me up if you wanna know something specific
3	I only know INTPs who are that smart
4	ENTP stereotypes that are not true for me	Title.\n\n\-I don't have 100000 hobbies - not even one that I'm really knowledgeable about.\n\n\-Can't argue a point very well because I can't concentrate/get lost in thoughts.\n\n\-I don't have groundbreaking ideas on how to improve things.\n\n\-I notice details easily and enjoy them.\n\n\-I am not charming nor confident.\n\n\-I can stop talking and don't really say much because I feel like anything I say is not appreciated or even acknowledged, feeling like everything you say is disregarded right when you say it.\n\n\-I am not really into memes.\n\n\-I can ignore my thoughts\n\n&#x200B;
14	Lol. Notice how OP never even claims to be an ENTP
5	Therefore....
5	Ant stereotypes that are not true about me\n\nNot wicked strong\n\nDon't burry my dead\n\nCan not form mecha ant monster with thousands of my peers
2	Is it actually a stereotype to be into memes? If yes then all those stereotypes actually apply to me.\n\nYou've really only chosen traits that come with Ne and while it's pretty strong among ENTPs you don't necessarily have to present them to be one.\n \nAlso don't stress this out too much. All this MBTi is mostly bullshit and me personally I don't believe it. I won't help you find yourself at most it will disorientate you more. \n\nOnly way this can help you grow is if you already have really found yourself through other means, gone past caring about stereotypes and all around just looking to make yourself a better person instead of circlejerking your flaws ( which is mostly what this sub is for). The only good things here are the memes, but do as you do.\n\nSource: Your friendly neighborhood ENTP that thinks MBTi is a pile of shit.
19	ENTP problems	Do you want to talk politics, history, why things are the way they are, how to fix them? We can talk. Do you want to know about scientific Discoveries & their ramifications? Gotcha. Do you want me to remember to get my badge for  work? Forget it... 🤷🏻‍♂️
9	The problem I have is that I hide things so well, so i find it, that I can't find it. ENTP problems. Smarter than ourselves sometimes.
1	Hahaha!  Yes.
1	Everything else is boring. We're kids basically\nBut also just unintentionally forgetful af i guess?
1	Hi. Good afternoon! I want cookies 
1	Or sweep a floor. I'm almost 40 and I still don't understand how this is supposed to work.
1	Oh my goodness this post is accurate 😂😂 the amount of times I forgot my badge or clock in card at work 😂 or my keys as I leave the house, every single day... 
1	Any of you guys like talking about film 
1	One day I got asked to buy cough syrup, but somehow I bought migraine drug instead. 
1	Me studying art:\n\nDo I know what I want to paint? Yes \n\nDo I know how I'm going to paint it? Yes \n\nDo I have everything I need to paint it? Yes \n\nDo I have enough time to paint it? Yes \n\nSo am I going to paint it? No I am going to watch YouTube videos and then maybe rush the painting when I have only a small amount of time left. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
5	New to Reddit.	Hello everyone!\n\nI'm looking forward to learning and being a member of the community. I believed myself to be an ESTP based on my first test years ago but most recently I have tested as ENTP. The content I am reading and watching on ENTPs resonates with me deeply. That being said - I'll keep this first post short. I'm here for many reasons and I'm very excited to be here!
4	Howdy!\n\nOut of curiosity, what indicates you're an Ne-dom over an Se-dom?  My sister is ESTP, so I have lots of fun cataloguing the differences. XD
2	I’m a sheep on the bandwagon with the other posters. You aren’t ENTP. \n\nESTP and ISTP are some of my favourite types people to either chill or accomplish stuff with though.. So don’t be disheartened there mate we probably like you more than most other Intuitives. \n\nIf you were ENTP you would not rest until you proved us wrong. 
1	Still thinking ENTP based on this feedback. The car and my girlfriend aren’t ways of fully explaining myself so much as they are what I believe to be necessary requirements for where I want to be in terms of my personal fulfillment. I do understand financial concepts well but to to date I haven’t been great about employing them for my own personal gain so much as I have done the research just for the sake of knowing so that I can make the right decisions. Took me way too long to get to this point where I’m actually implementing based on my knowledge. 
3	How Personality Traits Tip Over Into Mental Illness	
1	I am quite curious. Would you consider all the MBTI extraverts (Te-, Fe-, Se- and Ne-doms) to be highly extraverted in the big-5 sense (talkative, assertive, high energy level; p.1 of the nature article)? I’m just wondering if we do observe Fe/Te-doms as being more likely to have ADHD than Fe/Te-auxes. \n\nIf we start from definitions (instead of correlations in a dataset of individuals between 5 and 19 years old)… As I understand it, Ne/Ni is a possibility-seeking and -generating function. Ne is the inclination to focus on possibilities based on outside-of-the-self information, while Ni is the inclination to focus on possibilities based on the self’s store of information. There is nothing in these definitions themselves that link them to behavioral issues… Jung does extrapolate from definitions to potential problems that a person might face (e.g. a Ni-dom that does not recognize that a possibility is generated – with tenuous foundations – from one’s own experience, and instead sees it as an external truth, may become excessively attached to it), and I agree that Jung’s work is important. However, just because a person is a major historical figure in the development of a theory doesn’t mean that we have to follow his words to a T. (Newton’s work is highly important, but it is possible to modify and improve on it.) In pop psychology… I think people should be given leeway to interpret Jung (provided that reasons are given to support an interpretation). We deal with slightly different people in our lives (different from each other, different from Jung), and the base model may just need to be tweaked for it to be practically useful and parsimonious.\n\nI just re-read what I wrote. It’s not meant to be hostile, and I do appreciate the links you’ve put up. Personally, I don’t think it’s an exclusive either/or – either a personality disorder is a variant/extreme of a personality trait, or a personality disorder is separate from a personality trait. Some disorders may possibly be more like cancer (where it is not an extreme/variant form of another condition), and others may be more like, say, memory loss. I think that studies can be useful (depending on the study design and analysis method… but then most analysis methods are currently beyond my understanding, so it’s hard to tell) and that a belief can exist in degrees; I’ve found your links and posts useful for ‘updating’ prior beliefs.  
-1	Lol wtf downvotes?  Is Nature not good enough of a source?  
6	Refusing to follow through with plans	Idk why but my stubborn self just doesnt want to do things i planned. Like i for some reason feel its justified? Planning to meditate to help this but what do u think? \n\nObv its worse on days where i barely sleep. \n\nLike ive gotten addicted to a netflix show so i keep staying up till 2am just watching it. Deleted the app 😓\n\nIts almost like im denying being human and just ignoring what my body says like "im tired". 
5	check out dopamine fast and how too much dopamine affects our productivity. dude i was exactly the same as you but i got pissed at how much time of my life i have wasted like that already. so i realized in a state of constant instant gratification and quick dopamine rewards i will never be able to get my donkey walking. \n\ncheck out this\nhttps://youtu.be/vl-44jDYDJQ\n\nand this https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8UsI9CXHm6o&feature=youtu.be\n\nto better understand yourself
2	People who dislike a specific type, why?	Is there one type you dislike above al others? I know it’s kind of dumb, but what type do you dislike and can you explain why?
9	tbh entps are the worst tbh tbh
6	Heres my attempt at being a judgey asshole for a moment. I think we tend to dislike things about a certain type rather than the whole type in general. But ill try my best.. be aware none of these judgements are set in stone and are open to changing. Also just based on my limited experiences and analysis.\n\nENFJ’s in general.. They are selfish lying manipulators who use social perception for there own obvious ends. \n\nHealthy INFP is one of my favourite partners in crime BUT Unhealthy INFP’s are just sorry sacks of selfish shit stuck on repeat. \n\nINFJ makes me walk away 100% of the time from our interactions like I’m never going to be good enough or they thought I was incompetent and stupid or a weak pathetic try hard. They all have precious lil snowflake syndrome or something of the sort.
5	I don’t *hate* them. I just honestly think that their function stack is the pit of cognitive functions... and yet somehow they still manage to be the most egotistical of all the types. It’s like if you saw a mentally ill homeless person on the streets screaming and ranting that they’re Jesus or something. 
1	Entj they’re usually assholes
1	Intjs is the type where i found most egotistical asses, and for being intuiives they can be so extremely blind to anything that doesnt relate to their Fi, of course  i have met plenty of intjs who where not asumptions making fedoras, but the number of this type is too big .\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/8m6x2l/something\_ive\_noticed\_after\_working\_with\_another/](https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/8m6x2l/something_ive_noticed_after_working_with_another/)\n\nAlso weirdly the intjs that were good, were just too damn good love conversating with them, the compatibility in general was off the charts, but when is bad, all the micromanaging of conversations, the asumptions, their insecurity that type has the worst people i have ever met and some of the best, not in between either click big or dont click at all.\n\nThe problem with them is that hte bad intjs those that suck at everything they do spoke the same as the intjs who have managed to achieve something, just lacking all the competence of those who actually have a life and having all the prejudicess that kept themselves for achieving anything and they gospel it like they know shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe good ones ar my second favourite type second to infps.But the bad ones speak too loud for a type that is usually quiet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	I've met great people from all types, so there isn't a MBTI that I "hate" when it comes to actual people.\n\nThere are some types I would absolutely hate to be. Just reading the description of ISTJ makes me want to puke out of embarrassment for whomever might be an ISTJ. It's like one long roast. 
1	I just generally don’t relate that much to SFPs. I think we have a very different value, interest, and communication system and it leads to natural personality conflicts.
39	Do you guys have an addictive personality?	Do you get addicted to things like drugs or whatever very easily? Or are you pretty good at controlling yourself? Just wondering how everyone does whatever it is they do.
35	I’ve done a lot of drugs for the experimentation aspect of it, and none of them have ever been ones that I felt like I would get addicted to...\n\n...except cocaine. I’m pretty sure coke is the drug that was made for TPs lol. I did it at a party and then again the next night and then again the night after that and was craving it after everything died down. That was the only time I have ever felt like I could get addicted to a substance. It was scary realizing that so, I quickly got away from it all. My INTP friend struggled with it for a while, and so did my ESTP friend.\n\nCoke is like the best, cleanest, and most amazing Adderall you will ever have. It’s just awesome, tbh. 
16	Nope. I get bored of things way too fast to have an addictive personality. 
14	Yep.  I'll do almost anything to excess. 
11	I'm ENTP and I don't believe I have a very addictive personality. I find myself binging on things for a little while and then giving them up.
18	Yep. I am ENTP addicted to almost everything risky. Gambling, hard drugs, sex.\n\nAnd i like it.
7	I get easily addicted, but can easily get rid of addictions, too. I just have to think about it and make the logic of it (Ti). Of course without Si, this is a bit tricky, but Ne might make you bored of what you do, and it actually helps to move on from that if you had the logic done. (Ti, again)\nSo, without the support of Ti, it could be difficult to get rid of, but then again with Ne it's more difficult to get addicted to something. \n\nDo I relapse? Yeah, of course. That's the part the lack of Si strikes. But relapsing isn't the worst thing about addictions, giving up the idea of self control is the worst thing, IMO.
4	I have wholly untreated ADHD so this one goes without saying.
3	i‘m only addicted to sweets and energy drinks\n\nso i guess no\n\nbut i always have obsession phases over particular things 
3	I hate addiction.  It restricts my freedom, and I have always strived to avoid it.  Due to a swinging shift I became a coffee addict, but that's the only thing in life to which I am formally attached.  I like to know that if I lost literally everything I'd still be fine being me.  No computer?  I'm still me.  No phone? I'm still me.  No alcohol? whatever it tastes gross anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, I do have a more easily addicted personality, and that may be why I am so careful to avoid addictions of any sort.  I really love my freedom.
3	Not at all, which has made exploring as an ENTP extremely fun and relatively consequence-free. 
2	I forget to want most things. Like I think I might be addicted to this and that, then I just forget about it a few days and the cravings disappear.\n
2	i go hard into projects and then the rush wears off after a while. that and sugar, never done drugs so couldnt say
2	I love MDMA, but not in ways that interfere with my goals in life. \nBut I have abused other drugs in a short period of my life, especially alcohol and cocaine, but it was in a period where my closest friend had died and my family didn't want anything to do with me, since I needed a year of school, because I was in sorrow and my classmates treated me badly (I was not from a wealthy family and talked well about our Danish system). All my friends simultaneously left me. \nThe pain I was in was miserable and to be honest I couldn't imagine it turn out any other way.. I'm afraid my life had been worse if I hadn't abused drugs, at least then I connected with some fucked up people, who gave me some kind of distorted love.\nToday I'm at University, I have forgiven friends and family for leaving and have kind new friends as well. \nI don't smoke or drink much alcohol, but I do MDMA in the weekends and it has never become a problem. I have tried playing at casinos in Monaco and Tokyo, but it never really catched me. So for me if it ever becomes a problem it's a reflection of horrible loneliness. 
2	Physical addiction - yes.\n\nPsychological addiction - no. (Luckily)\n\nIf I’m done with something, I’m done with it. \n\nSmoked weed for four years straight to cope with the lack of purpose in my life. No cravings at all.\n\nCigarettes are another story since my body is used to the nicotine. I replaced it with an e cigarette and everything’s fine. \n\n
2	I know you guys for some reason prefer anecdotal data and personal validation. But if you are interested there is more robust data on the subject, albeit with low number of participants (n=62)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[PERSONALITY AND ALCOHOL/SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDER PATIENT RELAPSE AND ATTENDANCE AT SELF-HELP GROUP MEETINGS](https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/34/3/359/185679)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRelevant data (tl;dr): ENTP are 5% of normative population but are 0% of patients that attended rehab clinics for alcohol or drug abuse. For contrast ISFJ, ISFP and ESTP are 9%, 5% and 3% of normative population but are represented by 21%, 18% and 15% of the rehab patients, respectively (obviously, when was it not respectively? Why would I change the order? anyway I digress)\n\nIndividual traits of S,F and P also positively co relate with more rehab patients prevalence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	I have a hard time controlling myself, I'm impulsive and addictions come fast.\nI think it might be because I feel discontent all the time like things are never good enough.\nThing that runs in my family it seems and I've been like this for as long as I remember.\nAnyone else can relate ?
2	I get addicted to videogames so easily that I swapped to linux so I can only play them when I really want. I try to stay concious about watching youtube or browsing reddit, because I think that I used to be addicted to it.
2	ENTPs are prone to addiction and obsession, so avoidance of doing stupid shit is paramount. 
1	I dont, not drugs or alcohol or even sugar i have a will of iron when it comes to stopping myself from anything damaging.\n\nThe only addiction i have struggled with is Sex thoug, but im mostly undercontrol.(not that under control it actually takes a tool on who i am, and puts a lot of pressure in the peopple who actually know me).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem with all of that stuff, even cigarretes is that everyone who has died of lung cancer got into it because they were curious, people who got addicted to meth didnt got to use meth because they thoug hey lets become a crack head, they did meth because they wanted t experiment it, and it was for sure more awsome than life without meth, so why dont keep at it.Thats why i have a very wary mindset regarding all of this, even pot i smoke very little because i dont want it to take my energy to do things, projects, creative endeavors because is easier to just be stonned and do nothing, so i heavily focus n doing those things(im talking about pot i dont do hard drugs) on very controlled enviroments and special ocasions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	Not at all.
1	Yes
1	I don’t get addicted to anything easily because I end up bored of it. The only exception is maybe nicotine? I’ve been vaping for a while, but even that I’ve been able to stop cold turkey whenever I want with little to no withdrawal, and only slight cravings. \n\nI’ve done a large amount of drugs, coke, shrooms, LSD, what have you. The only ones that I think is actually physiologically addictive is coke and codeine, and I’ve only done codeine once, and do not plan on revisiting it.
1	Never had a true addiction to drugs, but when I like something I’m addicted until I get sick of it, which doesn’t take long. So kinda. I’ll go through video game phases where I’ll play 12 hours a day and then a week later I’ll be bored and won’t touch it at all. 
1	Maybe you could say I was addicted to alcohol or games. Maybe but due to the fact I reflect a lot in my thoughts I never ended up in a life risking situation of over dosing. Which is normally the main consequence of becoming addicted. 
1	I've been told I have the potential for it, but I've never really seen it. I'm more of a binge drinker than an alcoholic. 
1	I've been told that I think I do
1	Absolutely.  I use addiction to things like food, shitposting on the internet,  and binge watching television as a means of procrastinating things i need to do.  It's all a way of avoiding having to deal with real problems.
1	I get addicted to even just netflix shows. it's so difficult to just control my curiousity and emotional investment 
1	Totally. I struggled with anorexia for a few years. Now I binge eat.. Been obsessed by people and stuff too..
1	Absolutely, but only in hindsight. I was once told I’m addicted to escaping from reality.. which now I’d agree is quite true(for all ENTP’s) although I wouldn’t want that to be confused for an addiction to inhibiting awareness. \n\nI went to a water park once and the lines were long! But this one ride, the bullet or something.. a slide that just drops you vertically until you arc back up in a loop.. had almost no one using it. I later found it’s most likely because folk's hearts couldn’t take it.. I mean the adrenaline rush could be considered "not fun" for some I guess. I however, ran back up 5 more times for a total of 6 turns. Even whilst feeling light headed.\n\nDISCLAIMER* long boring personal talk about drugs from this point on* EDIT SIDENOTE - Gambling may be the only addiction I haven't had\n\nAll of my reactional drug use and flat out abuse has been at the present time an experiment of sorts (lets see how well I can function or dysfunction on 120hours no sleep this time) Or a functional solution/remedy(this weed should put me to sleep/help me sit still for long enough to watch this movie)\n\n\nI now believe I have been using psychoactive substances in all regards just like this, ever since I was a child.Either experimentally for the insight gained from experience or functionally as a solution or remedy to some trivial ends. Probably due to my un-diagnosed ADHD(some definitely recognized it in me) which I think was an issue ignored in part due to being quiet intelligent, but more so parents not wanting to associate stigma to myself and/or themselves. \n\n\nI started going off the rails when I was 12-13 and initially found myself self medicated with cannabis, which I took to intensely and fondly as it also surrounded me with other marginalized misfits I could relate to(other smart rule breakers).. then came seasons of assault as I tackled all other drugs in every way/shape/form through my teen years. Also went through a phase of online gaming addiction while my Ti started to build capacity. By the time I was 22 I was back to using amphetamine often(not realizing I was self medicating because it made me feel normal, also didn’t hurt that normal people when tweaked, seem much more receptive to "entpness" in general.  I am now 26 and stable on medication. Due to my age, location and current trends there really are only 3 choices to go with these days anyway..being booze/cigs, cannabis or devils salt. \n\n\nMy biggest weaknesses or should I say most moderated.. are those most heavily available. Alcohol I buy in limited quantities because I know my tendency to say “fuck it lets have another beer”. Smoking in general I try avoid and is a love hate relationship paradox. Never liked cigs but been addicted since a young age, habit is becoming in-affordable due to tax increases. Quitting is easy for me until I get environmental triggers like someone smoking in a movie or the smell being carried my way. Love smoking weed and always have, however I acknowledge that cannabis generally makes me dysfunctional, indecisive, lazy.. however is great for enhancing things including other substances. I try steer clear of stocking up on this substance, as Ill probably continue to use it where absolutely unnecessary(old habits die hard). \n\nGoing back to alcohol for a moment, I learnt how to drink like an adult fairly early on.. after the long stage of binge drinking as a teen, but before my peers had discovered functional alcoholism. I call alcohol liquid diazepam(valium) and started using it to counteract anxiety or jittery effects caused from stimulants.  Caffeine is probably one of the most effective substances for me, I mean it really gets my TI sharpened. Nootropics are great for Ti. Anyway I’ve decided to cut this ramble short. Also just realized if I had stood up and walked 4 steps I could have typed this out on my desktop PC 😂
1	I’ve tried nearly a dozen different drugs and I haven’t become addicted to any of them. \n\nHowever, If I’m in a depressive episode, I have a very addictive personality. Luckily these don’t usually last too long and I can depend on my will power to cut off any borderline addictions once I crawl out of these periods, but I’ve had to cut down on my drug use as I can see how dangerous this game is. \n\nI’m much more likely to become behaviorally addicted to something like exercise or learning math tbh. Both of those give me very intense bursts of euphoria and since they are encouraged behaviors I’ve always had a very difficult time balancing my lifestyle once I get hooked on these activities. 
0	Yes, I get into starting😉 to experiment with drugs💉 but I hardly see myself as addicted😨 to them. Ive done alot of drugs💊 and drinking🍻 especially when I was in a fraternity🎉. But that has died down now. I will still do it from time⏰ to time📆 but It doesnt consume my life. Im still able to operate and function properly at most dopamine and serotonin levels would be out of wack📉 but Ive been good at bouncing back from that📈.
5	Selecting and commiting to a course of action	Im 21 and still havent pursued any form of higher education because I have no clue what I want to pursue. \n\nThe things I am passionate about, art and music, are things Im somewhat mediocre at, and I know it's hard enough to make it in those careers when you are excellent. \n\nOther things I like and would be content doing take a master's degree, and having severe ADHD, Im just not sure Im cut out for that, not to mention it will take many years before I know how it will turn out. \n\nI dont know what to do really. I certainly dont want to work retail my whole life. I've done many career aptitude tests and they continually give me the same, very hard to achieve, things. \n\nShould I say fuck it, and give college a shot even knowing theres a huge chance I might fail, especially without a specific goal in mind? Or should I keep trying to find something I want to do? \n\nOlder entps who have found success doing something they enjoy, how did you do that? 
2	The route to a secure future? Technical college. A trade, plumbing, electrician, linesman, steam fitter etc... Look into the trades, you might find one you think you’ll like. And you’ll be making 70-110k a year in these jobs. The education is affordable under $8,000 total and it’s academically easy. Too easy. \n\nIf you want to go back to school later in life, like when you’re 30. You’ll have the money to do so.\n\nThis is what I am doing. Might be a path to consider?
2	Spending tens of thousands of dollars on something you’re not sure about at 21 is not a good choice. I’m not going to say college is a huge waste of time and money, but it is (unless you’re going into law or medicine). Most especially if you’re not even sure what you want to do. ENTPs change their minds all the time. Don’t go unless it’s free.
6	I realized that I don't truly know my grandpa want to get to know more about him.	I grew up with my grandparents until age 7 until I moved out with my parents to our current house. At 8-9 my grandma died and I was left with only my grandpa.\n\nTomorrow I'll go to an abandoned driving range with my grandpa to give me driving lessons, and today It stroke me that he is in his 70s and I don't know much about him even though I've asked some questions before. \n\nGrandpa might get sick at any time. He's already got hypertension and he's on meds and his body aches from time to time. This is one of those moments where I'd travel back to the past from the future in order to do the stuff I should be doing If I wouldn't think about doing it right now. I don't want to fuck this time I have. I'm not going to treat this as an I'll do it later moment.\n\nI'm generally not an emotional guy and neither is my grandpa. I know he loves me, he has supported me financially ever since I've known him and he cares enough to teach me stuff. I hope he knows that I love him as well. Now, I don't want to play the guessing game, I'd like to express this before it's suddenly too late. As I said we are both not good at expressing our feelings and I don't know how to express that I love him, I want to drop this stupid ego and just tell him. Don't know if "HIT THE BREAKS HIT THE BREAKS" to "I love you grandpa" is a smooth transition...\n\nOther than that, can you give me some good questions to get to know my grandpa better?
4	I think the transition is smooth enough. \n\nThe best way to show affection is to spend time with those people. \n\nLike I don't know much about my grandfather because the things he finds important to tell me - 'who is the best ski jumper of the season' over how everyone is doing in the family are a bit perplexing choices. But hey, he is who he is and I'll watch that ski jumping competition.\n\n&#x200B;
4	> I'm not going to treat this as an I'll do it later moment.\n\nGood move. Never invite regret into your life.\n\n> I'd like to express this before it's suddenly too late\n\n“Gramps, I know I never really said this before, and maybe I not the best at showing it, but I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am for everything you’ve taught me and done for me over the years.  ~~I just wanted to tell you that before you drop dead.~~”\n\n> Other than that, can you give me some good questions to get to know my grandpa better?\n\nAsk him about his life. Give him something to talk about that he’s automatically an expert in:  What was he like when he was your age? How did he meet grandma? Did you think you would wind up with the life you have?  Do you have any regrets?  What was your biggest mistake? What was your biggest triumph?  What’s really surprised you about 2019?  What’s something from the past you wish was still around.   Are kids *really* all that different today from when you grew up?\n\nGo from there and adjust as necessary to your grandfather’s personality.  
2	"Hey, could I- could I ask you a question? It might seem a bit off at the moment, but honestly I've been getting really deep into thought lately about life and I was wondering if you ever had times like that in your life? Like those times when you look back on things and wonder what could have been? I don't know, I've been really thinking about how you raised me, among other things, and I was wondering what you do when you think back on life. Like what do you think about?" And honestly the things he comes up with, the things he initially says, will likely be the things that matter most to him; who he is.\n\nYou could also be straightforward and say everything you wrote there, line by line. You express beforehand that it's going to sound silly, crazy even, but I bet he'd be honored to know that anyone thought so in-depth about him. I bet he'll wonder how he ended up with such a wonderful grandson, tell you about his life, but only when he stops laughing in your face about that transition. You can even mention the ego part because if he loves you than you could probably get away with just being yourself. 
7	The government shutdown spotlights a bigger issue: 78% of US workers live paycheck to paycheck	
3	It raises some questions. To what extent should the government accommodate ineptitude? It's not the government's fault their employees are living paycheck to paycheck. \n\nLet's say you're working for a company, let's call it Shmoogle. It seems to be doing well, like Bitcoin, but suddenly crashes. Leaving its 50,000 employees to now become unemployed. If 30,000 of these employees lived paycheck to paycheck, it's not the fault of Shmoogle that these former employees will now struggle.\n\nOne could argue however that the government is the fallback here, allowing them to apply for unemployment. But that's pretty much the core of my question: to what extent should the government accommodate ineptitude? In Shmoogles case, 20,000 employees *didn't* live paycheck to paycheck and they're insulated to find another job.\n\nThe arguments that the government should support these 30,000 Shmoogle employees defers individual responsibility to the government. Why should I have to live within my means and have forethought when the government can support me? \n\nThe safety net lets people jump higher than ever, but the consequence is that when they all fall at the same time the net breaks and now everyone is left grounded with broken legs. 
1	Its unfortunate and I know people who work for government programs that have been affected. Unfortunately one area of concern is that many of these jobs are low paying, especially some of the ones I know in wildlife and with national parks—which is equally unfortunate because the people are usually passionate about them. \n\nSomething to take into account too is student loan debt, etc. Some people may be living paycheck to paycheck in an effort to pay down debt, or if they’re young in their career may not have established a safety net—not to mention that can only last so long. \n\nThere’s bad finances, but there’s also unfortunate situations and I would rather extend the benefit of the doubt. Accidents and emergencies happen already, a forced government shut down shouldn’t be your emergency pay concern. It’s ridiculous, especially when it’s being used as a bargaining chip. 
7	Arguing with Fi users	Tell me your experience with it. Were they dominant or auxiliary Fi users?
11	They either get it or get pissed it seems. Like there's no middle ground lol
5	Dominant i tend to adore them, my infps ar fascinating individuals. I love having conversations with them.this is by far my favourite type, and the type of the persons i admire the most,Kierkegard,Goethe, and several modern artist i love  fall under this type.\n\nEnfps on other hand ar well really good if we keep convos funny, but if we got to the personal part they keep doing the enfp avoidance of responsability and their logic is aghghadasdafgsf.I love them but keep clashing with them because of the shared Ne, and the way they justify everything about themselves.Yet i enjoy talking philosophy with them, those that dont believe they already had the answers to anything ar great at divagations.\n\nEsfps always see things that i miss, and i really apreciate this about them, my yoga mentor is deliciously raw, she is amazing, but i dont know that many esfps and the only esfp guy i know was a simpathy gathering bastard, hat i clashed because i was going to fuck the girl he was into and it was all weird, i actually felt sorry for him.\n\nIsfps well im very attracted to isfp females, and the isfp males ar sweet and chill, but with them i have the sense of anything i say can make them see me as a sociopath so i act different around them, isfps say  that i complicate everything too much, i dont dislike the type is just one of the types i found i have the highest incompatibility.\n\nI tend to avoid arguing with them because is not going to end up well, i found out that my infps need a more direct approach than i usually give, so if anything bothers me, i simply need to be direct and tell them.\n\nAlso in order to avoid bigger problems, if i have a disagreement that goes againt their Fi i need to verbalize m perception of it, they tend to listen and actually understand ur point if u make them empathize.\n\nThe biggest classest i have ever had ar with those with Fi third, intjs and istjs, they got all the asumptions and the Fi need to feed their ego, but lack the sensibility fi doms [have.](https://have.So) So is all add Ego intellectualism until i drop the big weapons and war enssues.
3	they make me walk on egg shells, especially SFPs so idk, besides the ones i already have as friends i try to avoid them in the future. \n\nfrom what i experienced they don‘t want you to do/say xy thing to them, but will do xy thing themselves to everyone including you. that gets me pissed actually \n\niE. i love joking with friends etc, but if someone jokes with me but doesn‘t want me to joke with them. then i won’t let them joke with me either. simple and fair\n\n*(or i troll them and make them mad on purpose)*
2	The main problem I have arguing with Fi users is what’s not okay is always shifting like the tide, but they don’t seem to notice how their views change because it’s based on their feelings and not tied to any sort of logic system. 
8	ENTP Parents, lets type the Paw Patrol	first of all I can't believe I haven't found this sub-reddit before\n\nRyder - ENFJ\n\nRubble - ESFJ\n\nChase - ESTJ\n\nMarshal - ENSP\n\nSky - ENFP\n\nZuma - ESTP\n\nRocky - ISTP\n\nEverest - ESFJ\n\nTracker - INFP
5	Were ENTP pups decided not to be featured in the fear they would corrupt small children?
2	wHeReS mY INTP PUP??????\n\n\nI want a pup that has constant existential crises and can’t stop asking why
73	Proposal: There are more feeling functions than just Fe and Fi	We all know about Extroverted Feeling, Fe.  \nWe all know about Introverted Feeling, Fi.  \n  \nI propose that there are two undocumented types of feeling.  \n  \nThe first is used occupationally.  I will call it Fo, for Occupational Feeling.  This is when you are a feeler for your job, but you recognize it's for navigating the office politics of Karen and her drama with her step-daughter.  \n  \nFo is what allows us to get ahead in our careers and pretend to be super empathetic.  It's quite helpful when you need to move up.  \n  \nThe last type of feeling I propose is one that is difficult to put into words.  It's when we fumble over ourselves, attempting to feel but acting foolish in the process.  It's like we want to feel, but keep saying "um" while attempting to figure out what the next step is.  Therefore, I call this, Fum.  \n  \nAnyhow, just a giant theory I came up with while eating beans last night.  
73	Fe Fi Fo Fum
14	Fo is an extension of Fe.\nFum is an extension of Fi.\nTherefore, still Fe and Fi.\n\n11/10 meme tho:)
11	You forgot the feeling function that’s useful when when you can win with idiots: fu
6	And I think for a lot of NT types, Fo can really be your foe until it’s more developed. Personally, I find Fo an interesting game to play.\n\nWhat I find most exhausting is Fum, and I’m not sure what that’s from. I think there may be a correlation to Fi. And that low Fi users have more uncertainty to begin with in their exact feelings. 
9	inb4 THIS NIGGA EATIN BEANS\n\nCould you expand on Fum? It seems to me that Fum might just be the struggle understand one's own emotions but what you said wasn't clear enough for me to be confident in making that assertion.
3	To put these two new definitions into physical analogy,\n\nWe could se Fo as your college football team (a bunch of Catholics) really *trying* to get ahead of Clemson, but ultimately failing due to their high empathy levels inspired by Jesus. \n\nAnd Fum as the sad excuse that was Bama’s defense 2 nights ago. 
2	I can't think of any response that would actually be worth writing in a comment. However, I still feel the need to let you know how much I enjoyed this post.\n\nThis was a good post. I liked it a lot.
2	Beautiful theory. I'll trade you my cow for the right to teach this theory; a cow for a golden goose if you will.
2	Fo is just Fe + paying attention. My Fe isn't jacked up to 100 when I wave my neighbor while getting mail. It is when playing with my 5yo nephews.
2	Fum is arguably the most relatable. Just saying 
2	WHY THE FUCK IS EVERYONE TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY? IT'S A FEE FI FO FUM JOKE!
4	Fo is literally Fe. like that’s precisely what Fe functions to do.\n\nFum is just tertiary Fe. 
1	It's going to complicate things but nice theory.
1	In DISC, what you call occupational feeling is something that they quantify, for instance using their own language. For myself naturally I'm more dominating (D) over influential (I) but when dealing with people in a professional setting I'm more I than D. As for your second point I would say that that is just a trait in of itself and doesn't really qualify as a phenotype.
1	Seems like #1 is Fe aka social harmony  \n  \n#2 seems personal to you. I would need more examples
1	Omg dead
1	Beans confirmed to be the best drug of 2019.\n\nOr maybe it’s Ne, I don’t know.
1	This is what I love about ENTPs. Haha on all the other types ( me too until the end ) trying to seriously analyze this joke. 
0	I get that this all is a joke but even then, regarding this:\n\n"Fo is what allows us to get ahead in our careers and pretend to be super empathetic"\n\nThat's also called manipulation and is quite questionable from a moral perspective.
6	greetings eee enn tee pizzles	What gets you going at the moment?  What are you currently doing/working on?  What's the current obsession?  Are you currently obsessing over having no obsessions?  thats a fun pasttime.  Trying to figure out why your sling shot only bounces off the pigeons chest while Mike (true story, i know of a pigeon named Mike) glares at you intimidatingly?  Post it here.  Let's see what everyone is up to! 
2	Current obsession would be black holes, spaghettification and Michio Kaku interviews lol
1	Currently agonizing over whether or not I should dedicate the next five years to mindless studying to become a teacher (which I really really want to do) and going back and forth as to if I have to staying ability to stick to it.\n\nI deleted Facebook because it took up an insane amount of my time.\n\nWorking on a video game project that will probably go no-where lmfao
1	Are you on hard drugs ?  
1	Nigga please
1	More on what i already do, but actually writting about marketing and about how mbti can be used for pr porpuses and breaking down they whys, and possible applications of it.Specially regarding Pr porpuses and the weaknesses of target groups, i have being doing tons of infield research here and my experience here has proven to be extremely usefull for me.Also considering if i must consider my research finished or which kind of framework can i start applying to expand my view.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Kingdom Hearts! 
1	I'm trying to make a scifi story out of haikus. Maybe not feeling confident that I'm entp at the moment.
1	Self improvement:\nObsessing over adhd neurochemistry (and how to dealnwith task transitions) self love and surviving narcissistic abuse, how to survive asshole three year olds, and konmari purging. \n\nExternal job type stuff:\n\nWorking on a studio that will teach everything from paint and sip to toddler crafts\n\nBlogging. Because reasons.\n\nWriting a book \n\nAnd I obsess about this mysterious thing called sleep. 
1	It’s your fav iii enn f jenga\n\nMy current forced but kind of not really obsession is this data analysis I’m doing. It feels a lot of three steps forward, two steps back, but it feels good to work on something and figure it out though I also consider throwing my computer sometimes. Luckily, it’s safe due to its price tag. \n\nSome more personal interests is I’m going to try this year to watch a whole bunch of movies “everyone should have seen”. I’m really bad at that. 
1	I'll take your questions as what are my New Years Resolutions because it's the first time I've had serious New Year's Resolutions.\n\nAnyway, there are two things I want to nail down this year: time management and computer memory management, a.k.a. C/C++
8	Hey fellow ENTP's what's your favorite super hero from Marvel and DC?	I am curious as to if there are correlations with MBTI's and preferances.  \nfor me DC: Batman, Marvel: Wolverine
11	Can't believe no one said Deadpool... funniest superhero for sure. Apart from him, I'm also partial between the Flash, Green Lantern (or at least lanterndom as a whole) and Martian Manhunter
5	...I have a soft spot for Gambit?
5	Cliche, but Batman and Spiderman. The only ones from each side to have amazing games. 
3	The Flash and She-Hulk :)
3	Batman and only Batman
3	DC is trash. Seriously, any universe with Superman is just boring. Superman's power is literally "whatever it needs to be".\n\nThat being said, I'm going to limit my Marvel favorite to the MCU. It's Rocket. He seems like one of the few avengers whose type is a TP.
2	DC: Impulse (young justice ver), Marvel: Captain America (from movies) thou now I think I prefer the Spiderman. I never liked previous movie spiderman.
2	DC: green lantern.\nMarvel: who cares
1	👏DEADPOOL👏\n
1	Any version of Spider-Man. I’ve just always admired him since I was a kid
1	Tony Stark, Batman, Flash
1	Rorschach, I love his twisted extremes of black and white morality, and doctor strange for the insane visuals and concepts, and the fact that the movie doesn't end with a fight!
1	The Punisher
1	Daredevil, spiderman, wolverine
1	Doctor Strange and Doctor Fate
15	ENTP problems? Or me-problems ?	IS it just me or is everything TLDR? Also, the max amount of tabs are open on my phone, with various topics which I want to get around to read but never make the time to.\n\nCan't concentrate on anything ever. Especially online. Basically, I'm tired of myself but wouldn't have it any other way.
3	If the article is interesting I will read a 10000 word article no problem. In fact I enjoy it.\nYou probably just fucked your reward system. (Mine is fucked too but I‘ve always enjoyed reading)\n\nEdit: and mine is probably not as fucked as yours.\n\nReally good video on that topic: https://youtu.be/8UsI9CXHm6o\n\nPlease tell me what you think of it.
2	I know what you mean. Im a tab maniac. When you pass 99 on my old mobile chrome browser it would just show a smiley face.  \n  \nI think its ENTP related but idk what specifically or if its exclusive.
1	It's a modern day problem. Using the internet rather than doing deep reading in the form of books has changed the way our brains work. Check out The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains. Start changing the ratio of book reading vs internet reading and limit your mindless surfing. Shout-out to r/nosurf
11	I want to be a teacher	I'm pretty sure I had an ENTP teacher in highschool (anthropology), where class work basically consisted of discussion and debate and no real formal structure (it was my favorite class BY FAR) I love tutoring my siblings and convincing them that they are not stupid just frustrated with their assignments. So my question is this: do ENTP's make good teachers? Did you have any? I know everybody is different but are there any ENTP teachers here? Do you have any suggestions or tips?
8	Not a teacher, but I was a tutor in college for 3 years. I absolutely loved it, and I had students specifically ask for me all the time. I really think that ENTPs have a knack for teaching others, as I was always able to read the situation and adjust my teaching style depending on the students' needs. 
3	I love ENTP teachers. They are the most well rounded of ENTPs in my experience. 
2	I’ve actually thought about teaching. I’m studying law, but I feel like I’d be a natural at teaching. It’s a job that combines creativity with intellect and compassion. Go for it. But in saying that I don’t know any entp teachers and don’t think I had any in school.
2	I also really enjoyed having ENTP instructors, because they challenge you, and because they rarely take things too seriously. I found that my ENTP instructors were beloved by about 3/4 of the class, and then hated by the remaining 1/4, because they were often insensitive to the feelings of the - well, more sensitive students, and because not everybody enjoys the Socratic method.\n\nI don't have too much advice re. being an ENTP teacher. However, I will say that as an ENTP student, I do actually need a bit of structure in order to really learn. It can't be too much structure, otherwise I'll feel constricted and get bored. However, it's helpful to have some schedule, and some objective metrics, to make sure I'm not just jerking myself off over the logical consistency of my own arguments. It's often easy for an ENTP to *act* like they know a lot by talking the most, but harder for us to prove our knowledge on a test. Sometimes, we require the latter to make sure we're actually learning the shit we need.
2	i love ENTP teacher, they make good jokes. Also it depend on your subject, i think you should choose a subject which is not too important/hard also able to tell a lot of stories and experience.\n\nOr you can be a inspirational speaker/teacher who travel everywhere with their own lecture about soft skill/whatever necessary skill, this job path fit really well with your personality tho.
2	Short answer: Look at Feynman. \n\nHe was one of the best teachers of all time bc of his ability to make huge complex concepts look like a piece of cake. Add a bit humour to it and a good ability to read others, so you can know what exactly way will suit their learning style best, and tadaa - you have a perfect teacher.\n\n
2	In my academic experience entp teachers are among some of the best I’ve encountered.  They have a knack for reducing complicated things into more manageable forms by knowing what is the real essence of what they’re trying to convey, and what are details best left to the student.  \n\nThey will be beloved by learners and detested by people whose primary goal is tick boxes and get As, mostly because they give you enough rope to hang yourself.  That is to say, don’t expect to be lead step by step through a problem or have an exam be based exclusively off the homework. \n\nThe danger of entp teachers stems from their benefit — they can make complicated shit look simple and obvious.  \n
1	I have an educator history back then before I started working (13 years ago) After I started working I was involved in education-related projects in my company with my own initiative. (now I have a recognized educator certificate within the company but my job is not related, I am an IT guy)  I also very much love to teach and learn.\n\nDon't know about you other ENTPs but I feel so happy when I teach someone. The happiest I am is during teaching anything to anyone "who is eager to learn".\n\nWhen educating a group of people, feedbacks are most of the time state that it was so entertaining and the education was kind of fun to attend. As you can imagine I am also a good speaker and involved the community to the education to discuss the matters together. Never got any education on educating, I believe it's already there in our nature.\n\n**However;** when educating individuals that's another story. I somehow find myself being so rude, not patient, pushing people to the edges. Only people who have more than enough patience can handle that kind of one to one educating.  In the end, they notice that they actually learned it faster. I believe I play devils advocate unintentionally. \n\nBefore starting the education I repeat myself "The education will run the way I want, you will obey no matter what". Because of our ENTP nature, I want the learner to learn fast, using many different methods and approaches, burning his/her mind. (Again group teachings are different)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
6	Entps and legal careers	Success for ENTPs in the legal field? Currently a real estate paralegal and I'm not loving it anymore....
4	Success as a lawyer correlates strongly with conscientiousness and not really with creativity, the former being a weakness and the latter being a strength of ENTPs typically so I would guess that its hard as an ENTP. I'm sure there are successful ENTP lawyers though.
1	Thank you for the advice and yes! Real estate is very boring lol. not sure if it's just me or the being in the Paralegal position vs being in a position where I'm the attorney but it's so mundane. The worst part of it is that right now I feel not sufficiently smart enough to be in this field
11	Vivid Childhood Imaginations	Anyone else have a very graphic and fantasy-based childhood based on soaking in information and then piecing together "what-ifs"? How about a inclination to understand how everything functions but failing to have a large-enough attention span to stay focused for a long (say, not more than a couple hours) time? Love to hear any other childhood experiences. 
5	I STILL make up elaborate stories to tell myself to go to sleep (they usually result in me adding details to said story and not sleeping). I was definitely a very imaginative child, constantly playing pretend with friends :) 
2	I mean. I day dreamed a hell of a lot in school and got lost in many many scenarios about different things happening. But not really pondering on how things work per say, just what would happen if this happened from a social point of view! \n\nI grew up a millennial with a PC so I essentially googled everything and often found myself learning about lots and lots of things all at once, I was addicted to learning and found everything interesting! I would spend 12 hours a day reading/bouncing from one article to updates on the current war (at 12 lol). But I also played video games just as much which is a shame. Problem is I became socially inexperienced and thought I was shy/introverted. But I grew out of it getting a job and now at university haha! 
1	I remember as a kid I used to read just about anything that would come to my reach. Any kind of book I could find. I even remember at one point I wanted to literally know everything the world had to offer.\n\nOf course I grew up and realized there are more things to learn than there's time to learn them, but I still try to discover something new every once in a while. 
2	What is your opinion on rules such as turning off your car while filling gas?	I upset a lot of my friends because I am always the person that breaks rules like that. Another example is that I coast down mountain roads instead of breaking or downshifting.\n\nTo me rules like those, especially the gas one, are things that dont logically make sense and people follow because that's the way it it.\n\n
4	Would you like to explain how the rule of pumping gas into a running car doesn’t *logically make sense*? \n\n
2	Completely the same. Ex: I won’t stop all the way at a stop sign if it’s illogical for it to be there and I can tell it was put there to “keep control”. \n\nI don’t necessarily subscribe to the whole “rules were meant to be broken” concept, they exist to keep things in order. I just happen to feel that I don’t need to be herded along with everyone else. \n\nIt’s not that I know best, I just know best for *myself* and feel very confident in my ability to maintain safety in a community. Authoritative laws and rules made long before I was born for people that have nothing to do with me just haven’t ever made sense to me. \n\nHigh school drop out, clearly. 
2	I switch the car off for two reasons. Why waste petrol by idling. And why give invitations to car jackers.\n\nI am not familiar with "coast down", probably not a common term used in my country, can u explain? 
1	Tell them you are saving your battery and starter my not turning your car on/off unnecessarily, and if they are worried about the car blowing up, tell them you always touch the outside of the car to get rid of static electricity. 
3	Recommendations for good educational subs	So I quit memes two days ago wich is the best thing next to quitting reddit (I unfollowed two thirds - half of my subs). I follow a decent amount of substantial subs but would be interested in your recommendations.
2	Cogsci is a treasure trove.  \n  \nZen is cool if youre interested in figuring out what enlightenment is.  
4	I bet I would have done a lot better in school if MY teacher was a flying AI drone	
6	Against the devils advocate	These days debates largely seem to be about hurling the next best insult at the other. There is no dialogue. Taking the devil's advocate position just means that you are an irresponsible troll and you will not be taken seriously.\n\nThe SJWs seem hell-bent on calling lots of people Nazi. Let's take that seriously What do we do with the Nazis once we have identified all of them? Round them up and bully them? Round them up and shoot them? Send all these modern Nazis to the prison? Stop them from assembling together?\n\nSo instead of the devil's advocate, I propose a new alternative - The devil should not be hanged advocate.\n\nIn almost all cases when we identify a person a devil, the apropos answer seems to be to hang them. Socrates, Ted Bundy, Abraham Lincoln and Jesus were all considered to be the "devil" and therefore were hanged by the society or an individual considering them to be so.\n\nHere's an example of what I mean,\n\nWhy should Ted Bundy not have been hanged? You could have given him to the Psychologists who could have endlessly experimented with him. I don't see a reason why killing him is necessary. That would have potentially helped in identifying future Ted Bundys. That's just one reasoning I can give for why Ted Bundy should not have been hanged.\n\nHere are the devils I see now, who are being hanged.\n\n1. Harvey Weinstein\n2. Louis Ck\n3. Julian Assange\n4. Dread Pirate Roberts\n5. Travis Kalanick\n6. Gottfrid Svartholm\n7. Edward Snowden\n8. Richard Spencer\n9. Tommy Robinson\n10. Milo\n11. Nuchem Rosenberg\n12. Todd Nickerson\n13. Pewdeipie\n\nDo they need to be hanged?\n\nWherever you look in history, the devil has always been hanged. [Sympathy for the devil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgnClrx8N2k).
11	Well of course we "hang" (a.k.a. socially outcast) people who believe or say things we deem to be incorrect or immoral. \n\n.\n\nBtw, Eddy Snowden ain't no devil and we should all send him roses for Valentine's day.
5	Why Edward Snowden? 
3	>Why should Ted Bundy not have been hanged? You could have given him to the Psychologists who could have endlessly experimented with him. I don't see a reason why killing him is necessary. That would have potentially helped in identifying future Ted Bundys.\n\nTo my knowledge Bundy was executed via electric chair. Also he was interviewed extensively by criminal profilers for around, if I remember correctly, a better part of a decade before his execution. He was even consulted on some cases. In the end, as much as he was an interesting subject - his contributions were much smaller then the data criminal profiling gained from looking through several instances of serial killers and spree killers.\n\nNot to say law and justice system could not be reworked towards gaining insight into criminal tendencies more then simply dealing out punishment.\n\nBut with some people on your list, like  Richard B. Spencer or Tommy Robinson, what real more insight then 'same old shit' could people gain from studying them. Is just spouting polarising or in factual opinions enough to be interesting? Don't we have Kardashians for that?\n\nAnd should people be forced to interact with these individuals in some pursuit of it.
2	> These days debates largely seem to be about hurling the next best insult at the other. \n\nThen it’s not a debate.\n\n\n> and therefore were hanged by the society or an individual considering them to be so.\n\nThat is a HUGE distinction and you can’t validly make any claims about how society treats someone vs the actions of an individual. 
2	> So instead of the devil's advocate, I propose a new alternative - The devil should not be hanged advocate.\n\nWhat is your understanding of the phrase "devil's advocate?" How would you define it?
1	Leave the Dread Pirate Roberts out of this.  The real DPR retired years ago and is living like a king in Patagonia.
1	All of her need to be hanged in quick succession. It instills fear in the lower devils.
1	It's just the natural course of the radical left system of oppressed v oppressors. They literally can't think outside of their ideology. I tried - and I mean REALLY tried - to have something approximating a discussion of viewpoints with these types before and it was nothing but an absolute farce on their side. I was accused of being everything from an extreme alt right "Murican" (I'm Scottish, and far from alt right) to a Russian propaganda bot, if you can believe it. They literally cannot think past what they have been fed, all of which is simply baseless beliefs based on victim narratives. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI actually can't imagine an ENTP being an SJW type. We're far too logical and we enjoy discussing things too much, something you rarely see from the SJW types. 
9	How i make judgements	 \n\nas an ENTP (at least, i assume so)- this is how my Ti makes judgements (and how not having Fi in my main function stack affects me)\n\nnot satisfied with the descriptions of Fi and Ti out there, and i’m trying to figure out once and for all if what my description of my judgement process is matches that of Fi or Ti more, so here are my thoughts on how i make judgements as (an assumed-to-be) Ti user in scenarios that are commonly associated with Fi-ism:\n\n\- when people tell me they like/dislike something that i don’t, i'll probably eventually either agree with or understand them as long as they explain why (ie bring up past experiences, explain what qualities of said thing don't mesh with what qualities about themselves), since i've been given context and have been talked through a set of plausible reasons as to how it led to their final feelings about the thing, i adopt a neutral stand toward said thing.  \n\n\n\- while if i make a decision about how to do something/what to do, and "know" (in quotations because of the possibility that sometimes "truths" that i know are wrong) that that's the best way to go about doing things (at least considering everything i know) then i'll get really frustrated when people disagreed with me (which i assumed in the past to be a uniquely Te trait). likewise if someone disagrees with an opinion i have. \n\ni don't form opinions easily (on huge, complex issues at least), and i have to know a topic and its implications deeply (ie read and think about it a LOT), as well as take into account what others think about it, and whether or not there are good counterpoints to my opinion/reasoning, before i carefully come to any sort of decision about where i stand on a topic. so i do initially (that is, before i've considered how well their argument holds up) get frustrated when someone when someone disagrees with my opinion- simply because the knowledge i keep in my head and the few conclusions that i actually draw from them (through an unconscious logical process) are things that i believe to be true about the universe (considering their contexts and the set of circumstances leading up to them anyway), and an opposing opinion that is more correct than mine is would shatter quite a large chunk of the knowledge web in my head (and knowledge is very important to me). at least that’s my theory of why i can get all pissy and defensive when my opinions are challenged (and why i thought myself to have fi for a really long time)  \ni guess the difference between the first scenario and the second would be context? i recognise that likes and dislikes are very subjective and depends heavily on context (e.g. where a person grew up, what past experiences they've had, what they do for a living), and as long as they tell me some things about their context, then i can easily put myself into their shoes (so to speak) and understand why both of us have a different judgement about the same thing. if the judgement isn’t as simple as liking/disliking something (for example, if we have differing opinions of the usefulness of an item), then i might even tweak my judgement of it right away to accommodate the other contexts and possibilities i hadn’t considered. on the other hand, when it comes to /opinions/ during a debate (especially about wildly controversial issues), i usually approach such issues from a detached angle, learning about everything relating to it (by reading and asking around) and thinking up implications until i’m sure my opinion (or as i should call it, the large base of knowledge my -unconscious- logical process uses to answer questions regarding controversial issues - my “opinions” are constantly being pushed and pulled and moulded in a way that i’m not sure opinions are supposed to be able to) is a judgement covers all the bases it possibly can.\n\nthis is also the reason why i’m always having people tell me about themselves, and analysing people and social scenarios; i need to do those things in order to determine where different people’s opinions are coming from, and so that i can effectively withdraw (relatively objective) information from their subjective judgements to add to the collection of knowledge in my head.  \nanyway, feel free to roast/call me out if you want or if i'm clearly an F type trying to force myself into a label that doesn't fit me, i just needed to post this somewhere because i never seem to be able to reach any sort of conclusion unless i pick a theory and talk it through to wherever it's headed. cheers.
8	I think you’re *clearly* a Ti type.\n\nI’ve posted my ideas about Ti/Fi here ad naseum, but I’ll just say this. \n\nI. Elephants are bigger than mice.    \nII. Elephants are better than mice.  \nIII. (I think) elephants are bigger than mice.  \nIV.  (I think) elephants are better than mice.   \n\nI think I and III are typical Ti-type statements. I is an assertion of fact.  The qualification “I think” in III introduces doubt into the supposition.  IV is a clearly stated opinion, and II is an opinion disguised as and sounding like a factual type I statement.  \n\nThe nuance in this example is in the difference between qualitative vs quantitative comparisons, “bigger” vs “better”, only the former of which can be said to have any legitimate (even if arbitrary) ranking.   \n\nI think Ti types essentially restrict themselves to I, III in their arguments.  And I think Fi types often use IV to erect a personal ranking...a system of “values” if you will....a personal ranking of qualitative evaluations.   And the clash between Fi and Ti happens when Fi forgets/ignores/doesn’t realize that IV and II are not the same thing as I/III even though they subconscious might have a convicted feeling or believe that they are.\n\n\n
6	Im exactly the same. When I'm forced to make assumptive opinions around my FI dominate friends. I become very uncomfortable for example one time my friends tryed to play truth or dare (should be called what do you like or dare) and it made me very uncomfortable because the questions asked me for my opinion on who I like but I have not formed a previous opinion on the subject or situation. This has even affected me when someone likes me and I have not fully analyzed if I like them back. Because of this I have upset some people.
1	>anyway, feel free to roast/call me out if you want or if i'm clearly an F type trying to force myself into a label that doesn't fit me, i just needed to post this somewhere because i never seem to be able to reach any sort of conclusion unless i pick a theory and talk it through to wherever it's headed\n\nok
1	Two things: the nature of Ne Dominant & the 6th function\n\nJung describes Ne as a trait that constantly seeks, and should it find itself in a room through its own making.... it finds a way out in order to keep moving beyond. As Jung words it, “Facts are acknowledged only if they open new possibilities of advancing beyond them and delivering the individual from their power.”\n\nSecondly, the 6th function can be seen as a boosted version of itself, and it’s viewed very innocently, as there’s no 7th function to reel it in. This phenomenon leads to the ENTP being a sort of “upholder of truth”(Te), paving the way for truth using the deductive methods of Ti, intel gathering from Fe people, and then by funneling it all through Ne’s ever expansiveness it hopes to attain truth. So I would say you were right in believing it to be Te, and you were in the right ball park in thinking you had Te and Fi in the conscious stack as you would place a lot of faith in the absolute observable evidence that Te impresses upon one. I would also say you’re also right in that opinions “shouldn’t” change as often as yours do. Usually Te funnels into Fi in order to build it up, and then Fi stands up to the shifting tides of Te in order to hold it in place; usually a person’s preference between the two, as an equal preference is impossible, will determine which serves what. In your case, however, that does not happen.\n\nSo from these points one can determine you’d constantly Ne explore the tides of the ever changing facts, utilizing the talking to Fe people and thinking on things, Ti, in order to come to conclusions- irrefutable conclusions. Te, like any of the extroverted functions, is concerned with the object(and not the subjective self), how the object is observed to be true so therefore it is true——> leading to a sort of absoluteness in its decision. However, the fatal flaw of Te(and Fe) is that it’s based on locality, allowing one’s environment to affect it, which prevents it from attaining actual truth. In your case you noticed that your Te was constantly shifting due to your own constant seeking of more and more, Ne. If an ENTP settled for Si than it could be said that such shiftings might slow down(in theory on this point).\n\nSome examples of this phenomenon:\nThe constant flux of Te by way of Ne is why ENTPs, at times, cant stand close-mindedness; projecting onto others their own cognitive style.\nAlso, you can see the obsessive, and ever changing, facts in people like ENTP Jordan Peterson who can’t not go one interview without listing off some data or evidence or research and say things like “Just recently there was a study done about....” I’m not suggesting that one not bring up research, recent research at that, but compared to others spokespeople he definitely expresses quantitatively more “facts” and “data” and “research.” Other people might share such intrigues, but those other people probably deal with it “better” so as to not need bring it up. \n\nSo, in conclusion, I think you were more right than you seemed to let yourself believe otherwise as there was clearly some reason you felt the need to make the post. Cheers. 
1	TL; DR
1	Fi and Ti function similarly. It's easier to focus not on how you analyze data but what you focus on/ where you draw the data from. Fi and Ti look at different things to draw conclusions.  
6	What has been your latest obsessive read?	What are you currently reading about and obsessing over? Why? Why do you find it interesting? I’m mostly just asking these questions so the post doesn’t get removed for lack of context lmao.
7	Robert Greene of *48 Laws of Power* fame recently finished his largest and most impressive work yet, *The Laws of Human Nature* which I am currently reading through. It's a real page-turner, too, over 600 pages! His largest work yet by far.\n\nI rarely read anything other than non-fiction, but I finished the manga *Dead Dead Devil's Dededede Destruction* today, and it's definitely one of my favourite comic books now. It starts out all slice-of-life-y, but has extremely dark undertones about human nature.
5	Cults like Heaven’s Gate or Jonestown. Some of the stuff that people believe in and are willing to kill themselves in droves over is pretty wild.
1	Evolution and consciousness. I'm currently reading Dawkins' *Selfish Gene* and Dennett's *From Bacteria to Bach and back* and I'm sifting through the articles on talkorigins.org. 
1	My most recent was the Revelation Space series by Alastair Reynolds
1	> What are you currently reading about and obsessing over?\n\nI'm reading *Building a StoryBrand: Clarify Your Message So Customers Will Listen*. \n\n> Why?\n\nFor my business... more specifically, because one of my mentors demanded that I read it. ;P\n\n> Why do you find it interesting? \n\nI'm a sucker for the Hero's Journey, and this book applies it to marketing. It's very cool.\n\n> I’m mostly just asking these questions so the post doesn’t get removed for lack of context lmao.\n\nThe clarifying questions are actually very helpful. :)\n
1	Lie algebras in representation theory.
1	Anything by Mark z. Danielewski, but especially the familiar. He may be a gimmicky author, but he has the wordsmithery to support it.
3	What do you do with your life?	Because I really don't know what to do with mine. I have to pick college major and have no idea into what should I go - thought about cognitive science, ux design, information systems, but honestly? I don't even have much energy to look into it. \n\nMost jobs don't interest me,and I'm not excited by things like buying a house, new furnitures, perspectives of travelling, going into "adult life". Living mostly in my head seems like the only thing worth my time, and the only that I'm interested in (well, this and giving data to my brain so it would supply internal world. Movies, books, ideas etc.\n\n Don't get me wrong, I like going to art galleries, cafes, clubs, but it's just something in my free time where I can have just more external input to my thoughts. \n\nApart from these things, I really have no energy nor interest in thinking about what to do in life, and I have to do something probably, so my question is, what did/do you do with your life? 
5	Get a CS degree. It's probably the most versatile degree for people like us, from what I've seen.\nEdit: I'm an entrepreneur/wantrepreneur. Haven't had much success yet, but I'll never give up. 
4	I landed in consulting and generally enjoy it because every day is different. The downsides are that you’re totally at the will and mercy of your client and that means logic often goes out the window, but sometimes it feels like playing a strategy game IRL. I always say people who get bored easily would probably enjoy consulting but there’s a lot of trade offs too...long hours, business travel, ass kissing\n\nHOWEVER, (ETA), I will say that I often fantasize about quitting to go work a mindless hourly job so that I can use my free time to its full potential and not waste any valuable time or energy solving problems or thinking through things for other people 
4	You sound depressed man.  \n\nAnyways I am a software developer and I love it.  I have a high degree of autonomy, I get to learn about all sorts of interesting things constantly, I get to be creative, I get to problem solve, plan for the far future, architect things, debate all the time about code, process, psychology, design, I go to fun conferences, I have a flexible schedule, I make good money, I get a lot of vacation, I am surrounded by smart ambitious people, and so on.  
3	I wanna make money\n\nBut in all seriousness, I just want to be content. Nice, invigorating job, makin' music, and some birds. Paradise.
2	Here is some advice I posted a few weeks ago. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/a5fvfk/advice_on_finding_purpose_and_going_for_your/?st=JQPDEAIV&sh=d2ccb958\n\n\n
2	I own a freight brokerage and ENTP do well as a freight agent, fast past, always changing, have to think fast and problem solving daily. Oh, and you can make good money
1	Currently a sahp. 1/10 wouldn't reccomend.\n\nPreviously, I did many things over many years, and my consistent go to for hobbies was/is carve rocks, and write stuff. \n\nFavorite jobs over the years:\n\n* Retail sales at a games store (we actually had to take games home to try them out)\n\n* Order desk at an architectural hardware wholesaler (lots of learning/ problem solving, lots of running to get things from the warehouse - active desk job) - decent money and benefits \n\n* Framing houses (lots of learning/problem solving, active and can see accomplishments at the end of the day) decent money and physical fitness\n\nSo.. when i go back to work, I'm planning on covering those qualities in whatever job i apply for.
1	Does your school require you to lock in a major in your first year? When I went to uni, I thought I would get a degree in economics, but I took a first year philosophy course and (in retrospect, unsurprisingly) fell in love with the subject. Of course, I'm not saying you should pursue a philosophy major - just that it's a great course for a bright but confused incoming freshman. Taking some comp sci courses sounds like a solid plan as well, especially if you have any aptitude in that area. If I were going to college now, I would probably pursue something related to artificial intelligence, albeit likely from a more humanistic/sociological perspective as I'm not much of a scientist.
11	Having trouble communicating with my ENFP girlfriend	So I (20M) been dating my girlfriend (19F) for 2.5 months and we recently have been having communication issues. She has told me that I am too dense to pick up on how she is feeling in a lot of circumstances. Is this a common problem among ENTP males with not being able to read my girlfriend and adequately be there for her emotionally? And for those that have overcome this and have learned to read their partners, how did you overcome the emotional communication barrier/gap?\n\nUpdate: We broke up. She said it wasn’t worth the effort so whatever. It happens. Here’s to being apathetic for the next week while I get my shit together. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
17	You shouldn't be required to "pick up" on anything and neither is your gf. If she has an issue, she needs to be a little more mature and communicate said problems to you and vice versa. Now if she is attempting to communicate, and you still dont get it, then it's you have a problem. 
12	\>Is this a common problem among ENTP males\n\nI'd wager it's a common problem with 20 y/o and 19 y/o people. I remember myself when I was around 20, and yeah.  \n\n\nIf you want to try working on that gap. Think what kind of communication of feelings would be the best case scenario for you and work from there with her. 
6	I'm a 22 ENFP female 4w3 sx/so 468 tritype with a 26 ENTP male 8w7 sx/sp 854 tritype partner, living together for 3 years now.  Let me preface this by saying I'll present to you OUR experience of Fi vs Ti miscommunication which we've both finally worked past. This may or may not be helpful.\n\nEarly on in the relationship my man would always require I express my Fi to him using Ti. why? Because unless it was formatted in a logically consistent way he could digest, it would simply make no sense to him. Fi is consistent, but it's not feelings per say. Ti is a tower of babel of logical conclusions drawn from the external enviornment. Fi is a tower of babel based on conclusions drawn from the internal experience, therefore, it is totally subjective in nature. It makes sense, but not to anyone outside the subject. Think of Fi as Ti focused on mapping the internal universe of subjective experience. Conclusions are drawn by observing the SELF and tries to dig deeper into the closest you can get to the primordial lifeform (aka the soul) to draw wisdom and project it universally.  Fi then uses Ne to hop from person to person/ experience to experience to gather more data based on THEIR subjective experience in and attempt to see what was excavated internally reflected. Fi believes by understanding the self, you can understand others as we are all inherently made from the same goop. Fi is NOT the EMOTIONS itself. Fi is closer to the observations drawn from OBSERVING the emotions.\n\nNow consider that Fi is the ENTP'S blindspot, and Ti is the ENFP's blindspot. This does not mean that we are totally incapable of understanding one another. We are simply placing our focus on different aspects. We look at similar things differently. If we can learn to understand WHAT we are looking at, and WHY we are looking at it, we can actually make a pretty bad ass team. You propel the object and she, the subject.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe got past our issues when we learned about each other's modes of thinking better and made the active choice to be cool with that fact that we're just different from eachother. There are times when I have to force myself to work real hard to get his point and vice versa. But I no longer expect him to pick p on INTERNAL cues. How the hell would he even do that? We also plaid lots of dragonball and magic the gathering to help with my critical thinking lolol. But ultimatley it was just effort being made to understand one another and not automatically asuming that one or the other doesn't have a point just because we had trouble seeing it.  I can see you're already trying to do that for her which is great! She must make the effort as well to try to understand how you think and what you are looking at as well.\n\nMost importantly though:\n\nWith all that being said, it's not your job to be an emotional crutch for your girl. Her emotions are her own, you are two separate individuals who are responsible for your OWN emotional wellbeing. You present yourselves to the relationship already chill, you don't make it your partner's responsibility to chill you out. No one can make you happy but yourself. If she gets upset there's nothing wrong with providing emotional support, but she needs to understand that is a band aid at best. You're not her human band aid, romantic partners are not there to always fix the situation everytime you're feeling sad. She should learn this. It'll make her happier and life easier.  As for you, keep trying as long as you see it's worth it. Good luck with your girlfriend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
5	Let's forget about types here.  \n\nI don't have trouble picking up on whether or not my partner is upset most of the time.  Fe is supposed to be good at reading people.  But whatever.  Your partner needs to communicate with you.  You are not a mind reading extension of her.  \n\nFurther you are not required to jump when her emotions ask you to.  You should probably actively work to make sure you're both happy, both your needs are met, you both feel loved and respected etc.  For that to happen you both need to actively communicate and be patient and compassionate.  You both need to be reasonable.  \nPart of being reasonable is not expecting people to do things or change simply because your emotions want that.  That's how toddlers act.  If she can't make a reasoned argument as to why your behavior is wrong and needs adjusting, then she is probably being a toddler.  You fucking pedo.  \nBut yeah you're both about 20 so good fucking luck with all that lol.  Seriously good luck.  \n\nTry reading about active listening, compassionate communication, healthy boundaries, and pegging.  
2	Agreeing with the other posters here, this isn't a type thing, this is a neither-of-you-have-a-fully-developed-brain-yet thing.\n\nIt's not your responsibility to mind-read your romantic partner(s). Anyone who claims it is is at best naïve and at worst emotionally abusive.\n\nYou overcome whatever gap exists by A communicating their needs clearly and explicitly to B (and vice versa).
2	Okay, Let me say something. People that think that relationship problems sort themselves out by themselves are so wrong. You should always communicate to your partner the good things and the bad things. Obviously your approach to issues will be different , you must speak clearly and empathically with her. In the other hand, she should be mature enough to approach you with a good character and a sense of development when she feels she has issues with you. A relationship will always have conflicts varying in importance  but if both parties talk their differences in a good manner , a well rounded beautiful relationship will flourish. Remember no egos , no bullshit, just empathy.\n\nRegarding the emotional cues she seems to say you don't pick up. I think that is a personal thing. I consider myself an excellent people reader, but that's because circustances are different in my life that in yours etc. What helps me alot when analyzing people's behaviour is to get myself in the mindset of the person , read their corporal language ( eyes, hands , shoulders), and see how they are taking etc. We are really great intuitive psychologist by nature , follow your intuition , that's the only thing we have !\n\nRemember that no one in this sub knows you or her the way you do, so keep that in mind. Hope everything turns fine.
2	Hey, ENFP here. I can kinda empathize, as I have had similar issues to my ENTP friends in the past, but we’ve more or less come to a common understanding. \n\nBecause I have Ti PoLR and Fi aux, I have trouble using semantics and definitions effectively. When it comes to learning new things, I conceptualize and store information in the form of images, sensory data, intangible ideas, and I hate to say it, but differences in emotional state. \n\nFor example, when I think of the word “values”, an image (usually accompanied with an emotional response) comes to mind, rather than a definition or a “source code” for that idea. \n\nThis means that it’s easier for me to convey what I’m thinking through similes/metaphors/examples than it is through accurate verbiage. I’m shit at wording of things because I’m so used to applying words based on their connotation rather than their definition. \n\nSo as a result, regardless of whether or not I have a good understanding of something, it’s extremely hard for me to explain that thing to other people accurately. \n\nMaybe your girlfriend is frustrated because she can only communicate based on intangible ideas/examples, and you’re having trouble comprehending her because you have a different understanding of the words she is using. \n\nOn the flip side, I’ve learned that when bringing up issues to my ENTP friend, I have to try my best to be as clear, precise, and articulate with my conveyance as possible. \n\nIt also helps me if I detach myself emotionally from the problem, and I explain it to him as if it’s a math problem, for example. \n\nI also always say stuff like “Maybe X isn’t the right word...here are a couple examples of what I’m trying to say, maybe you can put together the concept behind them.”\n\nI think of ENFPs like Cassandra from the Greek myth...we have a lot of insight, but we sound really stupid when we try to tell others about it. \n\nI’d recommend that your girlfriend really uses her  Te to reason through everything, and you use your Fe to make sense of her emotional responses and trace them back to a tangible source. \n\nI’d also recommend that you make yourself as vulnerable as possible, and open up about yourself to her as much as possible (your innermost insecurities, how your brain works, where you’re lacking and what you admire in her), so she can feel comfortable. \n\nAnd lastly, I’d recommend that your girlfriend really detach herself emotionally from her own situation, and try to tackle it in an objective and rational manner, rather than focusing on the effect the situation is having on her. Also to try and Te-diagnose what exactly the root cause of the issue is. 
1	I read emotions, but I don't know what the fuck to do with them. Is that what you're experiencing, or do you genuinely not detect emotion?
5	Identifying MBTI types.	Hello, recently I’ve found myself in a management role. I’ve been working with my leader for some time now, and have discovered a few things about him. He is an ENTP as-well. One of things we discussed when it comes to motivating and coaching a sales staff, is that you need to be able to identify what motivates them.\n\nI asked him how he does it, and he told me it came from “Lots and lots of reading into psychology”. He is a very respectable leader, and has certainly outgrown his role, but it got me thinking. I know he finds MBTI types important, because before I was manager, he had all the managers he was overseeing complete the MBTI test and send him their type. \n\nI wonder if he has found away to identify people for what types they are by analyzing their behaviours and inquiring on their thought processes, and through time has found a way to identify people for their MBTI types and to cater his leadership style to most effectively motivate and push performance \n\nI’d like to know, what are some things I can look out for that can help me identify my subordinates and how to direct them down a path that would motivate and help them perform, based off that MBTI assumption. \n\nAny insight is appreciated, thanks. 
3	Not an MBTI expert, but I did type some of my friends for fun and ended being right so, here you go.\n\nE: the more they talk the more they want to talk.\n\nI: will generally leave a dinner party first cause they need to feed their cat or whatever stupid reason they gave you to get the fuck out cause they're tired of being around people. doesn't mean they weren't enjoying themselves, they probably talked too much and are just done for the night.\n\nN: ideas fascinate them. jump from subject to subject with them and they'll love it.\n\nS: might discuss ideas with you but from what I've seen, they're not very good at going from topic to topic (especially if said topic is very broad). they will look lost once you start scattering cause they can't keep up with the craziness. they notice a lot of things around them. also, from what I've gathered, an S will ask you if you got a haircut right away, an N will ask you if you got a haircut like, 3 weeks later, cause they weren't paying attention to your hair.\n\nT: express disappointment in their work and they will try to understand why.\n\nF: express disappointment in their work and they will feel personally attacked.\n\nP: they get shit done, but slower cause they're busy chatting with their colleagues, checking reddit subs, working on a personal project, all over procrastinating, mostly because they can get away with it. one day they give you the work at 8am, another day at 4pm. you can't keep up with their schedule cause they don't have one.\n\nJ: they get shit done first, then they get to enjoy the rest of the day stress-free. mostly fixed-schedules and you can see similar patterns in their daily routine.

10	Why do ENTPs probe?	Are they trying to collect more information to gain a better understanding of the subject matter, or figure out if you're bullshitting?
21	Can’t it be both?\n\nCuz its both.
5	Because we like butt stuff, okay? Stop judging us..
3	Cuz knowledge is power
3	I think it comes to trying fully understand the truth behind what someone might be trying to say. I do this a lot, and people find it condescending, but I’ve found it’s very easy for people in general to miscommunicate what they are actually trying to say. \n\nOther times, it’s because I disagree, but I’m open to hearing their side, or try and see if they hold a belief I don’t agree with because they are stupid, or because they are smart. \n\nOther times, it’s because I’m trying to direct them into a line of thinking that aligns with my thinking towards a topic or situation.\n\nOther times, I find it fun to try and get someone to contradict themselves. \n\nOther times it’s just pure curiosity.\n\nOther times it’s a very easy way to encourage verbal noise so there aren’t awkward silences. \n\nOther times it’s because I need to dig for something I can use to  sell them something. \n\nSometimes I’ll just stop talking at a natural pause and wait and see what they do. \n\nBasically probing can tell you a lot about someone, not just about what they say, but how they react to it. I think it’s a curiosity thing mixed with some sort of superiority complex thing. I WILL ASK THE QUESTIONS \n\n
3	To rile people up ;)\n\nNah, to know their deepest secrets and motivations.
2	If by probe you mean “ask questions” then it’s To fully understand what you’re trying to say — why else?
2	If by probe you do indeed mean ask questions, it's because we're interested! We love learning things, because we just find new things fascinating. We like interesting facts, and we also like ideas. However - where things change is when it gets more towards peoples opinions or viewpoints. We like hearing peoples opinions or viewpoints, but if we disagree, we are happy to sort of "test" your viewpoint, by asking questions, by talking about your views in ways that you might not have considered - because we see them all! People take this as being argumentative and combative, because people can be very averse to having their views challenged, however ENTPs love this. We love the mental stimulation of having debate-type discussions. For the most part these are never intended to be heated arguments, or negative. I have a good friend who I suspect is an INTP, and we get along SO well, because we always discuss things, and the discussions can be quite "debative", but not in an argumentative sense, it's just that we're both good at looking at things from all the angles, and it makes our conversations very fun and stimulating. However when an ENTP does this with someone who doesn't like having their views challenged, they can feel very attacked, like the ENTP is arguing with them or being disrespectful. And of course, we will not understand your emotion, so we just shrug and wonder why you aren't up for a good bit or hearty discussion about your precious views :P \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR we just find knowledge, facts and discussion very interesting and fun :) 
1	It's either one of those or both, depending on the person/situation.
1	Def to collect info to gain better understanding. We already know if you're bullshitting cause we do that on a daily basis so no need to figure that out. And no. It doesn't matter if you're good at bullshitting cause we're better.
1	Science is like  \nHypothesis aka prediction  \nThen testing if youre right or not  \n  \nSo trying different inputs/starting points and then seeing what output/outcomes they correlate to helps us conceptually map stuff.
1	Whether it be in a college class, a Bible study, a 12-step group or even training at a new job I'm always the guy who will ask the questions that no one else dare ask. \n\nPart of the time it's to understand how someone else thinks but a great deal of the time I'm trying to get them to hear themselves say something out loud in regards to their true motivations and understandings. This is not so I can show them that I'm right about something or know more about something I want them to learn through expression with another human being especially when it's a weird painful subject or something that might be controversial.\n\n*I haven't been invited to a party in a really really long time.*
1	I'm speaking for just myself here, but when I sense a logical inconsistency in a story, it just... nags at me to resolve it. I'm not trying to be a dick - I'm genuinely trying to reconcile the inconsistency. Often, the answer *is* that someone is lying - but other times you realize you're missing facts. It's like - my brain is sifting through several possibilities, and I just need further information to narrow it down to the right one, and then I can breathe easy.

5	Why studies need to confirm that the body is meant to *move* is beyond me. Take note that the lymphatic system requires movement against gravity to work and the circulatory system requires movement to work *efficiently*. You don't need studies outside of those two facts. \n\nPeople need to be told by Government that moving is beneficial for them because they're so out of touch with their bodies they don't realize how much better it feels to do it naturally. \n\nThis world is so backwards. 
3	Any other ENTP 4w3?	I'm not here to hear that ENTP 4w3 don't exist. \n\nRepeat. Keep your opinions pertaining to the existence of ENTP type 4 to yourself. \n\nIf you are another (based on my research, very rare) ENTP emmeagram 4, what do you think are your strengths and weaknesses and how do you think is the best way to improve yourself and work on said weaknesses? 
6	Same.\n\nWeakness: I don’t think I’m very self reflective and I’ve really had struggles learning to see myself how I really am.  I think the best advice I can give is to learn to listen to others’ opinions — especially if you keep hearing the same thing from multiple people no matter how wrong it seems, and not be quite so steadfast in defending your own preconceptions about yourself.  
9	PSA: the last "entp" 4w3 who came around these parts eventually admitted to being an ENFP, and found happiness. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/9zn872/found_out_im_a_type_4_enneagram_heres_my/\n\nHere's a follow up post\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/9zuq56/heres_my_attempt_at_reconciling_the_etnp_type_4/\n\nAnd the eventual admittance that the ENTPs were right all along, and it didn't make sense\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/9zvzqf/im_so_sorry_you_all_were_right/\n\nFeel free to repeat history, but the details will be the same:you're not an ENTP because ENTP 4w3 is inconsistent. 
3	Hm 4 seems interesting like my INTJ friends.  \nMaybe ENTP with 4 is using the Fi brain region more.  \n  \nDo you find that you stick to your strong likes and dislikes despite other ppl suggesting you should doubt those conclusions?
7	So are you implying that ENTP's with a 4w3 personality exist? I'd like to analyze your arguments.\n\n>I'm not here to hear that ENTP 4w3 don't exist.\n\nThen you are most likely in the wrong place. Don't expect people to not criticize and/or refute your postulates in a subreddit such as r/entp.  
2	Is it likely the OP is a 4w3? Probably not, statistically speaking. But is it possible? Absolutely.\n\nEnneagram type 4 is filled with a sense of self hatred, low self esteem and an underlying comepetitive nature as a result of feeling a sense of "something must be wrong with me" in their early lives. People did not respond to the young 4 in a way that made them feel accepted, therefore a complex is formed around the idea that there must be something inherently wrong with them. Depending on the instictual variant stacking, the 4 can manifest in different ways. A 4w5 so/sp is going to be the stereotypical self loathing, self pitying 4 that most everyone pictures. Now a 4w3 on the other hand is a whole other ball game. This type is nicknamed the artistocrat, and if combined with an instinctual stack of SX/SO, for example would look more like an enneagram type 8. Hell, sexual 4's are nicknamed hatred. This 4 looks confident, is socially engaging, and very outspoken. They reject their own sense of shame by projecting the opposite outwardly.\n\nENTP's are hardly the most common type out there.  I'm  sure many ENTP's have experienced alienation due to their hyperactivity, a out there ideas that prevent them from coming down to earth and (no offense) shitty attitudes. I'm sure many have experienced people telling them they talk too much, and there's a bunch in this subreddit who have been diagnosed with ADHD/ADD already and put on medication that may or may not be necessary. Why is it totally implausible that a semi rare type could potentially develop a 4 fixation? Especially female ENTP's who experience additional pressure to be sexually pleasing to the eye and have a personality that could very well be considered masculine. Just because there are correlations between the enneagram and MBTI does not mean that it's a strict rule incapable of exceptions. Don't let  Ti restrict your thinking. Just because things are usually one way and make logical sense to be one way doesn't mean it will ALWAYS be that way. The world does not always make sense like damn. Follow that logic every once in a while.
1	my fellow brethren, I am a knighted ENTP 4w3 
1	I’ve met 4w5 ENTPs and possibly a 4w3. I know they exist because any mbti can be any enneagram since one is determined by biology and the other is an attitude/emotional state you wear on top of a more inherent disposition. \n\nThe dudes I know that are ENTPs with enneagram 4 have borderline personality disorder. The lady friend is a little more stable. \n\nr/enneagram might be a place you can get more responses. \n\n\n\n

19	What is something that people often lie to themselves about?	What are some things that you think people just lie to themselves about so they don’t feel bad? Or just anything really?
58	That they are ENTP and not just a pseudointellectual prick 
26	That everything will be fine. Without taking actions
28	I'll do it later
17	I would say tons of people that work hard assume they've worked harder than anyone that's below them financially. They don't realize how exponentially harder it becomes to do things like study for college classes when you need to work a full time job during it or don't have a car etc. I was fortunate to have all these things and attribute a lot of my ability to be in an esteemed graduate school position because of my parents financial support with things a lot of people like my brother take for granted. I'd be way too lazy to pull this off if I had to work THAT hard ha
15	Victims of abuse often lie to themselves about it.   \n  \nFurther, victims of many things often lie to themselves about it.
13	That they're good people.  There's a huge difference between being a good person and merely being not-a-serial-killer.  People like to think that they're basically decent, and that is simply not true in many cases.  It's not the big events which usually make a person good or bad, but the little day-to-day things.  In your day do you lift the people around you up and make the world a better place?  If the answer is no, then you might not be a very good person.
6	"Man weed ain't that bad It doesn't even affect my life at all"
3	That everything they do is inherently selfish. 
4	That their current life problems aren’t 90% the result of their own life choices. At least post high school. 
6	Being a good person, yeah good is subjective and we all have our faults. Still though, people completely fail to realize that they have a significant impact on people. Like depressed people, you are being selfish when you withdrawal from your social obligations. Also, people who have careers that actively destroy the planet, ex: petroleum, arms dealing/manufacturing, logging (specific regions like the rainforest), ect. Honestly, everyone sees themself as the protagonist and that's definitely not the case.
4	That they’re above average. Most people are exactly average.
6	I have a sneaking suspicion that people just lie to themselves when they say they like straight alcohol. I can drink it and tolerate it, but I can never imagine actively liking the taste. I honestly don’t get when people say they love the taste of beer, vodka, etc.
1	Honestly, Themselves. And how they are actually doing or what is REALLY going on.
1	Im not an alcoholic. I just need to turn it off every once in a while. 
1	That the the majority of their motives in life are self-centric.
1	That they're interesting and different from most.
1	You don’t have to eat well or exercise in order to be a healthy individual.
1	I don’t feel like doing that/cleaning that right now. I will definitely not mind doing it tomorrow. \n\nTomorrow comes... “that bitch.”
1	Whether we are with the wrong or right person... We love to give chances 
1	Their very own true identity.
1	How much they know.
1	Drugs
1	That you should respect cunts just because they are in your family.\n\nThat is ok for a woman in a relationship to endure an abusive partner or/and someone that doesn't give a fuck about your sex enjoyment.\n\nThat we live in a suck-suck society and you always going to take something from someone in the end.\n\nThe majority of people fear death, so we create close to a thousand beliefs to supress this fear. So the fear of the truth turns out to be a big fucking lie.\n\nSiamese brothers might hate each other.\n\n"Suicide is wrong"\n\nReligion is a cult of ignorancy.\n\nThe concept of destiny. 
4	What do ENTPs think of INTPs?	I am an INTP here and I recently met an ENTP who is, well, .. perfection, really. \nI just wanted to know what you guys think of us and how do you express your interest or love in someone since I noticed you love almost everyone and you're really friendly.
11	Personally, I love INTPs and they're one of my favorite types. Yall get me which is nice af. Plus I just like breaking the outer shell of INTPs since theyre much more reserved than my fellow ENTPs. \n\nFor me, when I like someone I tend to act a lot more friendly but not too much to where its obvious. I get super conflicted between wanting to be affectionate and not wanting them to know because I want to read them before they read me. So, I'll do flirty stuff but Ill play it off as joking so that way, I can gauge their reaction and if I think they don't feel the same I back off immeadiatly and usually stop talking to them altogether
6	Hahaha I mean I can't speak for all entps but I certainly don't love most people...  I find many people useful and/or amusing in some way.  This is a rabbit hole but basically because I like to know why people think/do things, for much the same reason as I just bought a book on how modern city services work (seriously it's rad af).  \n\nI am also very warm and friendly if it doesn't cost me anything.  Costs include having to interact more with people who annoy the shit out of me.  It isn't ingenuine but it doesn't spring from actual affection.  Just a sort of background default amusement and low grade compassion.  \n\nAnyways those are both rabbit holes...  \n\nI like reasonably mature intps because we are very same same but different.  They get me, I get them.  They tend to be personally hard to injure but do make an effort to not be utter cunts (Ti over Fe).  They tend to be capable of both razor sharp analysis (NT), as well as flighty symbolic nonsense for fun (Ne and Ti).  They tend to come up with all sorts of interesting pet theories and delight in parsing them... Which is pretty much my jam irl.  Intps can be wonderful.  \n\nThey can also be stubborn shits (me too but intps... Damn), and appalingly neglectful of personal health and hygiene.  Also see INFPs...  Not all but some holy shit y'all.  Like if you're unsure ask a friend if you stink please.  \n\nHow do you know if I like you?  I tell you.  I won't like you until I have interogated you at length.  So you know if I think I might like you because I am interrogating you.  For my part I even have more than a few little shibboleths which supposedly arise from psychological and ethical constructs.  Pet theories and all that.  \n\nHowever I do this to potential friends as well.  So yeah.. I will tell you if I like you.  Zero shame.  \n\nWait though.  Sometimes I am romantically interested but still think it's a bad idea.  So one might pick up my um special affections but I never do shit about it. \n\nIf you like the entp tell them.  I have never ghosted a friend for liking me.  
5	I'm a male entp divorced and I live with a female INTP and have for 2 years and I couldn't agree more.\n\nwe live together platonically, she has a boyfriend and I have others in my life but we work amazingly well as roommates \n\nshe has sat for hours on end listening to me pontificate about the most insane minutiae you can imagine.\n\nShe has the patience of Job and from what I've heard coming out of the other bedroom, makes her partner quite happy.\n\nI was married to an infj for 30 plus years and romantically there is something for me\nthat is special about that combination but I can't speak highly enough of an INTP.
4	>since I noticed you love almost everyone\n\nFalse.\n\n>and you're really friendly.\n\nPartially true.\n\nHere's what I mean: I think ENTPs love \*interacting with\* almost anyone, especially with respect to meeting new people, when ideas are flowing and connections are being made. Doesn't necessarily mean we like you as a person -- just what you bring to the conversation. Some people, I could talk to all day and they'd probably be convinced I liked them, but I probably feel ambivalent (even negatively) towards them. Personally, I'm so aware of people's flaws and shortcomings (nobody's perfect, and most people are highly imperfect) that I don't really "love" anyone until I've spent a lot of meaningful time around them such that I can make a well-informed judgment on their character. By the same token, though, I also am pretty open to surface-level interactions with many different types of people -- there's not many things someone could say that would upset me so much that I would immediately exit a conversation with them without at least trying to figure out the line of logic or emotional state that explains why they say/do/believe the things they do.\n\nEDIT to actually answer OP's question: You'll know we (ENTPs) like/love/are genuinely interested in you if we go out of our way to make plans rather than just being friendly and having a conversation or doing an activity together that happens to be convenient at the time.
4	What you guys think of us: INTPs are the shit.\n\nHow do you express your interest: non-stop talking (although that's what I generally do), oversharing cool stuff about my life (probably making it sound edgier than it really was), wanting to know more about their thoughts on things, aaand that's all I can think of.\n\nHow do you express your love: we don't.\n\nBut seriously, when I love someone I'll generally be more patient with them, cause I'm not patient at all. I don't have time nor want to make time to be patient. For anyone. Ever. So, if I'm willing to take your advice on things and make efforts to compromise when I really don't have to cause you're probably wrong anyway, that's when you know. Also, being vulnerable around you, cause I hate being vulnerable, so if you see it happening you're the real deal.\n\nI noticed you love almost everyone: not true at all. It looks like that, cause we ARE really friendly. But I couldn't care less about 99.98% of the people I talk to.\n\nEdit: Ah yes, if I'm flirting with you I'll probably try to make you laugh by being my most brilliant-stupid self.
2	I'm an ENTP and I have a buddy who I highly suspect to be an INTP, however he hasn't taken the test - I asked him to but he didn't want to, which is characteristic of an INTP as they are very distrusting of testing :P but yes - I have basically zero doubt he is an INTP and we get along EXTREMELY well. He is basically very similar to me, but not as extroverted (obviously). However where he is stronger than me is he actually follows through on his goals and ideas better than me! But yeah we both share a sense of humour, we do fun things together all the time, we're actually travelling together later in the year. And btw I'm speaking about two buddies, but I figure if ENTP/INTP can get along so well as friends then this would translate into relationships.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, yeah, I definitely think an ENTP and an INTP could make a great match. You will both share a passion for discussion, logic, a fascination for new things, for interesting things, all that great stuff. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll I can say as a warning is you will need to look out for the ENTP's lack of "follow through" on their goals, we are mega procrastinators whereas INTP's as far as I can see work very hard. We are also very spontaneous, which INTPs can be, but INTPs are also way more structured and methodical. We are the opposite. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of how do we show we are interested, generally by talking to the person we like. We will be very interested to talk to them, make them laugh, spend time with them, especially doing new and interesting activities together. So basically all stuff the INTP is gonna enjoy too. It won't be super obvious, we're not gonna be showing our hand, but we'll definitely give you our time and attention. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway - best of luck, what I would say is just look out for this one thing - ENTPs tend to be VERY into someone at the start of a relationship, but we might get bored. It's simply because we just find new things so interesting. So getting to meet and learn about a new person is mega awesome to us at first. But if things don't stay interesting after a couple months, we will get bored and want to move on. Not trying to put you off, just saying to take it slow and DO NOT rush into things. You definitely just want to "date" for those first few months to see if things have a real chance or if it's just more of a flirty thing but you aren't really a good match in reality. Hope this all helps. :) \n\n&#x200B;
2	If you like an ENTP, tell them, personally I value a calm but direct conversation. "I think we get along well, I think your cool, wanna go to x on a date."\n\nJust a pinch of radical honesty with intentions and thoughts.\n\nAs far as INTP's go, I like them as long as they are not conspiracy nuts. Sometimes in their attempts to go deep they jump down the wrong rabbit holes, then it's all lizard people SJW's made the Earth flat and faked the moon landing.
2	They are cool, Intp the otherside of Entp, probably smarter than us but not smart in the life game. 
1	[deleted]
1	Love them. We have a lot in common and I feel our discussions are meaningful, fun and we usually just «click». 
1	INTPs vary wildly and are more like ESTPs than they are like ENTPs i think
1	INTP are soooo intelligent. They get ENTP's I think, we get them.
1	Intp and entp better stay at best friend level. Not enough emotion for romance, offcorse depends on. 
2	Aside from ENTP, what other type do you see the most of yourself in?	Not really in a “I almost typed myself as that type” sort of thing, but more like you empathize and relate to people who are also that type.
15	1. ENFP because they think crazy shit\n2. ESTP because they do crazy shit\n3. ENTJ because they do shit like crazy\n4. INTP because shit, they crazy
5	Probably ESTP and INTPs. \n\nI relate to ESTPs because we both have the same sense of identity and internal world even though we perceive everything differently on a surface level and at first glance. However, I’ve noticed ExTPs are very similar when it comes to group social situations.\n\nI relate to INTPs on an analytical level. We are almost always on the same page, and even when we aren’t we still understand the others point of view. 
2	INTJ INTP and INFJ personally
2	Simple Intp. 
2	Intp - I definitely am always an XNTP so I can mostly see how we work and think similarly 
2	Entjs,seriously i can always tell why theyre doing what theyre doing and i can see their nature and effort and always get this sense of i understand u with them.\n\n Estps on some life attitude level like were both judged for the same shit from other peopple, but they have a diferent approach to almost everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInfjs because even thoug theyre introverted judging feelers, we end up seeing  the same shit from total different angles, and i can see them completely, not just  liking the image they project but i understand strongly where their vision  came from and why. It happens with some infjs that post here, i can see them so well is absurd, theres no other type i can see their pain and struggles so clearly.\n\nIntps in conversations and  that type feels in a very similar way than i do, and their life atittude is strikingly similar, my biggest problem with intps is knowing when to turn off the character i create for other people and letting them see the real me, they usually dont like the funny man i portray but they get me when they know im not as an asshole as sometimes i let peopple think.
1	Mostly INTJs and INTPs 
1	INTJ
1	Probably ENFP. Since i was young I've struggled with insecurities, which has caused me to be somewhat of a people-pleaser in certain situations. That has lead me to sometimes prefer harmony over being right, which is kind of ENFPy i suppose.
1	ESFP cus dat booty stretch wide
1	INTP, INTJ or maybe even ENTJ. Any of the analysts (XNTX) really. 
74	The older I get the more my reaction to ideas and thoughts from others that are being presented to me tends to be “Okay, but I already thought of that years ago”.	I’m not sure if anyone else has this, but the older and older I get, the more people’s crazy thoughts and ideas seem to bridges that I crossed over already- sometimes a long, long time ago. I don’t vocalize it, but oftentimes people will have these epiphanies about things that I already realized and I’m surprised they hadn’t yet. \n\nI’m aware that maybe I’m not excelling enough to get to the point where I am actually challenged by others ideas, but I’m just wondering if any of you older individuals think this sometimes?
44	Oh I definitely have that. Typically with ideas behind psychology/society or whatever. A while ago my 30 year old friend was ranting to me about religion and how he realized it wasn’t true etc. It was just weird to me because I went through that angsty, rebellious, and opinionated phase about religion when I was like... 14. It was hard to stay interested in the conversation because it was this bridge that I had crossed over and stopped caring about when I left High School. All I could think was “Well.......ya. Duh.”\n\nYou just have to remember that people don’t focus on the same things as you do when it comes to “ideas”. Sometimes it’s very much in the background of their mind. For ENTPs, ideas are always in the front of our minds so we often can’t comprehend how people aren’t on the same page as us. 
26	I thought of starting a thread about this topic years ago. But then I thought "someone must have already thought about that" and decided not to post.\n\n&#x200B;
18	Yeah generally speaking I think this is why NTPs are said to delve more into the F shit when they get older.  F is an endless source of insanity.  \n\nAlso of course there are universes in the small things like actually implementing big ideas.  Making shit never gets old.  
11	This is normal.\n\nEvery generation thinks they’re these amazing innovators and are coming up with brand new ideas... not realizing that the generation before them already thought of or tried that. \n\nAs someone in his 30s, I see this more and more. Teenagers and college aged people who are waking up to politics is where I see it most. I remember after Bill Clinton gave a speech for Hillary that Instagram and Facebook was full of stuff saying “wow Hilary’s husband is such an amazing speaker! This changed me!” And I’m like yeah... he was president for 8 years, of course he knows how to give a speech. It’s the same southern-style of speech making that’s been around forever, you’re just now seeing it.
6	I find myself doing that for small innovative things around my house, like whenever someone says an idea I end up pointing out an issue I already thought about with it\n\n\n\nSide note: do any other entps in here ever feel like posts on the subreddit seem like r/iamvery____ style posts? It seems like a reoccurring theme for people with a lot of hubris and overinflated egos to self identify as entps, although I haven't looked in to the details of it, so it might be more common than I think 
6	Wait til you get even older, when you stop caring about even having these conversations with people. Life becomes an echo of an echo of an echo. I'm hoping this is a facet of the peace I've long sought. 
8	Me with airpods
3	Here’s something you may not have thought about.. How were rope bridges over deep chasms with water at the bottom made? 
3	There's nothing new under the sun
6	Can relate. \n\nI've also noticed a growing pet peeve I have for people who start sentences with "am I the only one who \_\_\_?" I try to remind myself that the actual phrase they mean is "is anyone else who can hear me/read this feeling the same way so we can talk about it?" but sometimes it takes all of my effort not to snark back.
4	Every middle age and older ENTP ever :D
2	Sort of sounds like people in this thread are competeing with each other of when they each lost their religious view 😂😂. "i became atheist at like 14" " i became at like 5!" Wowwww omg so cool . Sort of realize this theme of behaviour comes alot from ENTP but also some other types. Maybe im over thinking it but seriously i hear it when i read these responses
2	Eventually you get to a point where you realize the Si-doms are right about a lot of shit. 
1	I used to start post like this, but then I took an arrow to the knee.
1	Agree
1	I remember in the 1st grade wondering if everyone else sees the same colors I do. I then remember my friend thinking he'd come across some revolutionary philosophical epiphany in hs over the same thought lol
1	Most people feel like this. My conclusion is simply, that it's because changes are hard to make in a larger scale. A lot of the challenges in the world needs holistic solutions, which is unrealistic, because all countries across the world never has agreed upon anything. 
1	It's possible you've had epiphanies that are old to the people you're telling, too.
1	Yawn. I was already thinking "OK, but I already thought of that years ago" years ago. 
1	I’ve been saying this for years. .....
1	100% but years ago i learned that naturally i may have novel ideas but the execution matters too. So if i have an idea i think deserves attention or praise, but 0 outlook on making it happen, i dont get as crazy excited about it. But becoming like this comes with having projects that i *do* execute on. So its not like i threw out my ideas its that i prize the practical and amazing ones above the just plain amazjng ones
1	Please move this debate to r/iamverysmart
6	What type of video games do you like to play?	What video games are you interested in? Why do you like what you like and how does it stimulate you?
7	When I was younger I played Runescape, Roblox, and Minecraft a fuck ton. I loved the “big world” feel of them and also the social aspect. \n\nNowadays I only really get interested in plot driven sci-fi or horror games. I just don’t have an interest in anything else. However, I probably only play one or two games a year anyway. My list: Bioshock, Bioshock Infinite, Portal 1 & 2, Outlast, the Halo series, Mass Effect 1,2, and 3, Alien: Isolation, and then most recently Dead Space. All of these were played over a span of five or six years. \n\nDead Space was one of the most amazing games I have ever played. So, so fucking good and well made. That game is a great example of how you keep a player invested, haha. Afterward I sat back in my chair and just said “Wow”.\n\nI pretty much have no interest in competitive or pvp and find them boring and tedious a lot of the time. I never really understood the hype around Call of Duty. It was always just “eh” to me.  I also can’t stand how seriously people take them. I can’t recall one time while playing a competitive game where I felt the need to get pissed off and angry like I see some of my friends do. Lol, just why? They turn into big babies over a *game*. That being said, I really like playing Smash Bros with friends.
6	Strategy games.\n\n* Civilization Everything (Except 6 because sucks)\n* Rome: Total War Everything\n* Crusader Kings 2 (Nothing like starting form a Count to becoming God Emperor of X)\n* ...Fortnite because it's stupid and fun
5	When I was younger I played Warcraft Three and then WoW a lot, i also enjoyed RPGs a lot. Basically anything that had decent length and story. Nowadays I hate shit with grinding really, but I still play some RPGs. I played the ever living shit out of Mass Effect 1-3 and The Witcher series. Just finished Spider-Man as well, that was a decent action RPG. Dark souls trilogy...I fuckin love those games. I’m about to play God of War(ps4) when I can. I also tend to like competitive games, I played MOBAs for awhile, dota in my young teens and transitioned to league. Played CoD4 with a fairly competitive clan. Now I just get on sometimes and knife folks for about an hour. I guess I’m really into a lot of games, but mainly pvp based or rpg for single player. 
3	Overwatch!\n\nI've been playing for almost 2 years on different consoles and still learning. It takes mechanical skill but it's incredibly tactical. I live for those competitive games with a coherent team.\n\nNear constant mental stimulation and fun to group up with strangers. Low-key want to become a professional gamer, but as a 24 year old I realise my time for that has probably passed. I'm not even that good but a guy can dream c:\n\n(I always answer this when it comes up here lmao.)
3	I love adventure, open world games, jrpgs, platformers, dungeon crawlers, fighting games, and different kinds of shooters.\n\nSome of my most played and favorite games ever are(in no particular order)\n\nWow, \nMaple Story 🍁, \nKing of Fighters, \nDead or Alive, \nUltimate Alliance, \nMarvel Heroes omega, \nNinja Gaiden, \nTerraria, \nStardew Valley, \nFortnite, \nOverwatch, \nDiablo, \nNinety Nine Nights, \nStreet Fighter 4, \nMass Effect, \nDantes inferno, \nSonic games, \nSpiderman games, \nSplinter Cell games (early ones), \nAnything Tales of..., \nSkies of Arcadia, \nGrandia 2, \nInside, \nLimbo, \nBlitz 2003, \nMario games, \nBuzz (game show party trivia game), \nOld coin op games, \nDestiny, \nBorderlands, \nSkyrim, \nFallout 4, \nGuilty Gear, \nBlaz Blue, \nLoZ, \nCrackdown, \nGTA, \nProject X Zone 1 & 2, \nPokémon, \nPhantom Breaker, \nPhantom Breaker: Battlegrounds, \nArcana Heart, \nDay Z, \nScott Pilgrim VS the world\n\nFuck ton more but that's what comes to mind
4	Anyone else like No Man's sky?
2	I like grand strategy games, Total war franchise for example\n\nBattlefield 2 also, because of how neat the team synergy worked with the chain of command\n\nAnd chess of course, but that is not a videogame\n\n&#x200B;
2	I recently rediscovered Minecraft and remembered the countless hours I spent playing it when I was in high school. Minecraft and SimCity satisfied my need to create. I remember buying SimCity 5 when it came out immediately just to get disappointed that it couldn't live up to the high standard of SC4. Luckily, Paradox delivered by releasing Cities:Skylines a while ago. \n\nI also used to be borderline addicted to League of Legends for a while.\n\nFavorite games are StarCraft and Victoria II right now. I like strategy games in general (Paradox titles in particular) and I dislike games that overly rely on team play to be successful so SC and Victoria II are natural choices because I'm the only to blame to when shit goes wrong. \n\nAlso, anything early Maxis comes pretty close to what I'd consider a perfect game. SimCity, SimEarth, SimLife, etc. I faintly remember playing a strategy game with different ages (stone age, industrial age, nano age, etc). I want to say Empire Earth but I'm not sure. Something like that + some sort of evolutionary or pseudo-evolutionary process to determine game stages + SimCity/Minecraft style building modes would probably make me never leave my room again.\n\n
1	CS:GO hidenseek game mode.
1	*Civilization series \n*Final Fantasy series, especially XI and XIV (currently playing) \n*Diablo series\n*Other RPG's\n\nEdit: weird stuff with mobile
1	Maybe it's because I've been really stressed out lately, but I re-downloaded Minecraft and have been playing single-player for a few hours every couple nights.  \n\nI like Kerbal Space Program too, but haven't put much time in recently.
1	* Simulation games (civ, cities skyline, pes, etc)\n* Rhythm games (guitar hero, bangdream)\n* JRPG games (fairy fencer f, the legend of hero, trillion, etc)\n* Visual Novel\n\nI simultaneously play many games at the same time though, well I mean when I get bored playing game A, I change to game B, then game C, then go back to A/B, or something like this. Currently trying to finish some jrpgs and some vns here. 
1	All the FF series (first game on PS2 was FF 10 when I was a kid). Apart from that, at 2-3 years old used to play arcade games (tekken, mario, etc..), rpgs came later on. Nowadays, and to be quite honest, my taste in games hasn’t changed for shit : Final fantasy : XV and Realm Reborn, Monster Hunter World, Octopath traveler (old school rpg vibe oof) & Diablo 3 on switch, divinity original sins 2, pillars of eternity, darkest dungeon, Nier : automata (haven’t finished ik I SHOULD), and some other random games. (Tons of mobile games as well : FFBE, fire emblem heroes, gâcha games in general, they satisfy my gambling needs). 
1	Dota 2 is 100% my game, no matter how much I learn there’s seems to always be more. I can never get to that stage where I’m just like “I know everything about the game” so it just doesn’t get boring :) 
1	RPGs and strategy games. Or sims. 
1	Strategy (Civ 5 and Ultimate General), RPG (Witcher 3 & Skyrim), FPS; quite a few overall. It all depends on what mood I'm in; however, I generally tend to like games that aren't overly complicated in terms of mechanics yet still allow for a lot of creativity and freedom in terms of their approach. 
1	Mostly historical games (strategy/shooter) or rpg games with a lot of strategy 
1	I have sunk so many hours into FIFA career mode, scouting and signing players, developing my youth academy, getting lower division teams promoted up to the first division, obsessing over tactics and formations. It's fun to try to play it as realistically as you can (e.g. no stupid player purchases, like if I'm a bottom table Italian team I'm not going to mortgage the farm to sign Harry Kane). You create little narratives in your head about your players, especially if you stick with mostly the same squad and see them grow and develop from youngsters into world-beaters over time. That said, EA has been trying to kill career mode for years because they make so much more $$$ off ultimate team.
1	I really enjoy Civilsation Revolution, because it involves strategy, resource management and WAR. There are many ways to win and it's all about working on your strategy and achieving supremacy over your opponents. You can choose to be peaceful, cultural, influential, technologically advanced, or of course military domination. Also you learn interesting nuggets about the history of humanity. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also REALLY enjoy the XCOM games. These are also strategy games, where you are fighting off an alien invasion of earth. You have to decide the best place to position your units for maximum effectiveness on the battlefield in order to complete the missions. For example snipers, assault, support, etc. Each unit type has their own abilities and items and so utilising them to their best is important. Fuck ups and bad decision making can cost you greatly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese games are actually made by the same company, a fact I didn't become aware of til way after I'd played them both. 
1	Dead by Daylight. Chess. Fooling around in Fallout 76.
1	1. Rust\n\nI love Rust, because quite frankly, as a solo player, it is the ultimate challenge on a high-population server. It's almost entirely a PvP game, and in Rust, you can loot everything off of someone you kill.  You can also blast you way into people's houses, or find a crafty way in because of poor building design.  \n\nI'll play a wipe, and hardly anybody will see me for the first few days.  Big bases attract attention, so you have to plan your wipe like a squirrel, tucking away weapons/gunpowder in little nooks and crannies around the map so that if you lose a base, you're not reset to zero.  I'll make small bases near the water for boat access/recycling at harbors in the dead of night.  I'll make trap bases to catch the odd geared guy, so I can blueprint all of their stuff.  I'll take my first rifle to wreckage out on the water and murder divers like a Navy Seal.  The best part is, I build all of my bases so that it is never economical to blow into them.  So no matter what, I always feel like I'm winning the war of resource attrition.\n\nThe best part is, if you're smart, you can have an impact on a server that some 5-6 man groups can't pull off with things like brute-force codelock raids, or by cultivating the weakest link of a group to turn them against the leader.  Then, you can just brush the poor mark aside.  \n\nOne of my favorite wipes, I found a half-geared group of guys running along the beach.  I had a crossbow, and they asked me if I was friendly.  I asked who the leader was, and I put a crossbow bolt through his head, and put on the boonie cap he was wearing.  "I'm the captain now.  We're going to build our village right there by the river."  \n\nHad that little band of noobs paying me taxes the whole wipe, until they pissed off some Koreans and got us all...evicted.\n\nNever two wipes the same, and you can always come at it from a new angle.
1	I am losing mind! And it valuable to me...	I have a saying that I never utter... when the going gets tough, I get going. But tough in the sense of feely feely bullshit and "being aware" of people's feelings and reactions. We moved to this shithole of a country 8 months ago, and I hate every moment of it. I am a stay at home entp mom ( I know, BIG mistake), and it seems that all I do is shut the f up all the time, so I dont discourage the "adapting" to this shithole place, where all I want to do is run for the hills! I have researched culture shock to the extend that I can, and looked at other options as to why I hate it so much here. I know we adapt to anything, which I used to be so good at! "Get out, be social", is NOT going to work, as the general person out here seems to have their head up their ass, has no oponion on anything, are so damned closed minded, and the only humor they have is based on racist jokes. Come on people get a life! I have sensed this from the moment we landed, but gave it a chance anyway. Basically, if you are not a "calender person that always work and never play" STAY AWAY!!
2	What's your plan to get out of this mess?
2	Just curious, what is this country?
1	Have you learned the native language, OP? 
1	This is post is ridiculous. Use your logic and adaptive abilities if you have them to understand 2 things. The country is obviously not only full of unintelligent people, that would be a ridiculous stereotype and 2, there are easy ways to meet intelligent people. If that is your target demographic then simple seek out social settings where there is obviously going to be people participating in such activities. \n\nBelgium like all other countries has libraries, chess clubs, university study areas, rock climbing gyms maybe some coffee shops etc... I just looked up briefly “Belgium Philosophical groups” and the first thing that pops up is a meet up on January 12th, 2:30 PM with 18 members participating. The group has 349 members, be its 350th.\n\nThere are always people to meet \n
6	Any ENTP believe they have been the victim of a covert narcissist?	I'd like to hear about it. As far as i can tell we are not their typical victims and we ourselves are sometimes labled narcissists. Any thoughts?
7	Nope, I generally see that shit coming way before it could hurt me. 
5	My nana and my Biological were. My mom has tendencies because she was raised by one and then married one. It’s effected me in multiple different ways. \nI have not only my ENTP love for debating but I have a constant need to be correct because of the constant gaslighting I received.  
3	I have a narcissistic personality structure, so over time I've gotten very good at sniffing out other narcissists. In my teens I was in a very unhealthy long-term relationship with a girl who definitely has some cluster B stuff going on. Since then I've avoided serious romantic relationships with NPD/BPD-leaning people.\n\nI recently left a job with a supervisor who probably meets criteria for NPD. He was a complete dick who tried to bully everyone into compliance; since it's just a part time job while in school I decided not to put up with it and gave him equal amounts of shit every time he gave me shit while applying other places. It's been pretty funny to just verbally annihilate the dude multiple times per week for months and watch the work environment get more and more hostile as I make my way out. C'est la vie. 
3	I don't believe in the overt/covert narcissist concept. I think it's just another made up label to label people because people always need to label other people. Always label, label and label
1	I'm in a relationship with one. Its hell and I'm stuck for the time being. The only reason i didn't see it coming is because i was fresh out of a relationship when i met him.
1	There is a good chance she's BPD\n borderline personality disorder.\n\nShe would need to be tested but,\n Normally women are not only NPD.
1	As the above states, I’m an INFJ that’s been a victim of someone who is probably a covert narcissist. \n\nI realize now that my relationship with my INTJ father primed me to stay in a relationship with someone like this. Previously I had relatively healthy relationship with non-narcissistic partners, but I subconsciously fell into a trap, despite thinking I was consciously fighting it. \n\nMy Dad made me responsible for his adult emotions through most of my childhood. It’s hard to say whether he follows and covert or grandiose pattern but there’s zero doubt he’s way up there on the narcissism scale. \n\nSo I became a young adult that felt responsible for the emotions of a covert narcissist. It took me years to accept because I didn’t want that to be who he really was. To my horror at the end of our relationship he said, “When we first got together, I thought you fixed what was wrong with me.” \n\nAnd then I knew with so much clarity that I couldn’t deny it anymore. \n\nMore than anything at this point, I have trouble forgiving myself for staying with someone like that and not accepting his true nature. But he’s also a master at lying and I was very ill so I am able to practice as much self compassion as I can muster. \n\n\nr/narcissisticabuse is a great place to hang out if you haven’t been there. \n
39	entp night owls	I read some posts saying entp are nigh lt owls. I think it is true, because I'm a night owl against my will. I have been trying to be a morning person for so long, because I like the idea of having a nice relaxing morning routine, and I have tried so long to go to bed early so that I could wake up early, but I can never seem to fall asleep before 2am because my brain never seems to stop thinking. No, I'm not depressed or thinking about negative stuff the whole night, but it's more of random thoughts like "what am I gonna do tomorrow morning" "what movie should I watch this weekend" "why is the color white associated with purity" "why do cats have smaller noses than dogs" and some random crap like the youtube video i've watched that day or some random meme I came across. I can never seem to stop my brain from thinking and it's making me really frustrated. Did anyone have did kind of problem before? How did you solve this problem? 
23	Not ITT: Paragraphs
9	I dont think this is a type thing. I go to sleep very late yet wake up very early. Idk y but that's just how I've always been. For example, last night fell asleep at 2 am and woke up at 630 am
10	Worst combo is night owl and morning person.  I usually go to bed at 3 doing God knows what and I wake up at 9 to do God knows what.
7	So you have insomnia, not an ENTP thing. \n\nI've always been a morning person. I can count the number of times I have slept past 10 am on one hand (spoiler: it's 4 times). My preferred time to wake up is around 6-7am and I like to be in bed by 11pm. It helps that I can be fully awake when I wake up, so I skip the whole drowsy/grouchy phase most people seem to go through. \n\nBeing unable to sleep due to racing thoughts is a symptom of insomnia, so you might look into that, instead of assuming all ENTPs are night owls (sleep schedule has nothing to do with cognitive functions so idk how you made that connection).
3	http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html\n \nYou probably stay up late because you have a large block of time to actually do what you want.
2	This was my life before graduating college...it’s gotten better as I’ve become older; having a full time job that starts early and having kids makes me so tired early that I go go go but then my head hits the pillow and I’m usually out cold immediately unless I’m totally nerding out on some random bullshit on my phone before then in which case I just keep nerding out till I fall asleep whenever that is.  I still don’t get to bed early enough (but before midnight) and waking up is sometimes the hardest thing I have to do all morning which makes me frazzled and always late.  I have been unable to create a good routine for bedtime and morning, and it hinders my ability to start my day right and get some bullshit tasks out of the way so I don’t have to worry about it later (which I then will put off anyway). I bought a book/journal for myself for Christmas, Habit Nest Morning Sidekick.  It’s geared towards people like us who have odd hours without a good schedule or morning routine and is a 66 day timeframe that is supposedly is enough amount of time to form nee habits.  I just started it last night so we shall see if it actually helps me make it happen...
2	I’m not. I have to go to work every morning:)
2	I am a vampire. Sunlight hurts my eyes. [Fuck owls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeFxdkaFzRA).
2	Okay it's killing me, why is the color white associated with purity? 
2	You just lack discipline
2	I solved that problem sleeping 4 hours a day. Sometimes get exhausted then I sleep 8 hours for 3,4 days to regain energy. I also sleep while travelling from & to the work to save more time for productivity. \n\nSleeping is for non-ENTPs
1	Night owls are usually curious people, they can't sleep until they find out what they were looking, searching for, otherwise, their system will force them to sleep because of overstain.   \n\n\nOtherwise It can be about insomnia or etc.  \n\n\nSo, not a thing to care about, just focus on what do you do, why don't u sleep, what are you curious about.
1	I used to be a late night owl. Usually go to sleep around 2-4am. Either I'm out getting drunk or I'm watching YouTube baked. Or some other obsession like a good book or manga or interest. \n\nHowever I am now completely a early bird. After taking care of myself more, my body naturally fixed it's circadian rhythm. I quit smoking, drinking, coffee which led to me going out less and being able to rest more deeply. I find that being asleep before 11 is the BEST rest you could ever get. I think sleeping during the time of 11pm and 1am I feel the most refreshed and mentally alert.
1	I feel ya man, I stayed up till 4am last night researching the lore of the elves in LOTR.  
1	Who, who, who me?
1	I would love to be a morning person. I even get up at 4:30 to begin my day by eating and exercising before I head off to school but my energy level just gets higher and higher as I progress through the day and I get to the night. I am more awake, aware, creative and focused at night, and this really fucking bugs me because I'm a sucker for light and I can't live without the sun. \n\nI fucking hate winter and I use a lot of artificial light to fake the sun. I'm planning on following a career in the artsy entertainment industry and the fact that my creativity is at its peak at night sucks like hell.
2	the stupidest thing that really happened: Two men were arrested who wanted to bribe a policeman from a carton in Sri Lanka for a joke..	check that https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46762770\n\nTwo men who uploaded a video to social media, where they try to "bribe" a cardboard policeman holding a cardboard radar. Perhaps the police in Sri Lanka is also very sensitive about jokes about yourself, because according to experts, the police in Sri Lanka is one of the most corrupt institutions in the country. Users of social media defend two jokers and argue that this form of satire is an effective way to fight corruption.\n\nhttps://img.joemonster.org/images/vad/img_46620/ca856eddffd420e71ebac7626064dd15.jpg
1	Dat's dumb af
9	How do you get over people?	Friendship, break-up , crush...\n\n&#x200B;
13	Time
7	Stay busy and replace that person with another person or thing. Also write a letter to that person but dont send it. In that letter, eulogize your relationship. State what you liked, what you didnt, good times, bad times, the reason why you liked them, what qualities they have that you want in someone else. Then seal that bitch, put it away, and never think about it again 
5	Distracting myself by directing my thoughts somewhere else. (Obsessing over something new, etc)\n\nRepeat everytime you accidentally remember them.\n\nAvoid anything that makes you remember them.\n\nBut the most healthy way would probably be to make a list of what happened, what those people meant to you, what caused the "break-up", how much was I at fault and how much the other party, what can I do about it now, do I still want them back, if yes how bad, would it be worth pursuing them, is there even hope, if not write down why it might be better this way, decide to end it internally, decide to move on, decide what to do next, what to do better next time, what do you really want next time, and most importantly, learn your lesson so you don't have to go through the same thing again
3	Try to become a better person. Pain is one of the most useful things to you because it shows what you care about. Try as hard as you can to see why something went wrong and then seek to fix that for the future relationships that you are going to have. Some of the biggest periods of self improvement for me came because of the pain of broken relationships, however they are always amazing opportunities to grow, the worse the break up the better opportunity to grow. 
5	I block them on everything. Delete all our threads and pictures. Factory restore. Keep self occupied. A lot of weed. 
2	To everyone suggesting drugs - I would argue that using a substance to deal with a problem will make it hard to be comfortable sober in the long run. Consider saving the use of drugs when you are in a good place, not the other way around. 
2	Attempt to logically tell myself why I should move on/not care and end up making a poor attempt to simply ignore/repress my emotional state.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis strategy almost always doesn't work btw.
1	Fuck em’ \nNot literally but like if they arnt a part of a life anymore that’s their problem, I can find new people make new friends etc. And they will all be better than that person cuz that person left me, and what kinda friend/lover just leaves? Not a good one \nSo fuck em’ 
1	In a tank or monster truck most likely. 🤔
1	I imagine them blowing up into pieces whenever I think of them.  
1	a shit ton of drugs.... sadly my truth. altough it has been an amazing year 
5	ENTPs, what do you dislike about the culture/ideas of Reddit itself?	Just curious to see what problems you guys have with this website and the people in it. I’m just curious to see an ENTPs take on it instead of the much more prevelant INxx types that are common on it?
9	There are a few things:\n\n* Using memes or puns/jokes that are detrimental to discussion to pander for upvotes/gold\n\n* Racist undertones especially on subs that have a significant amount of subscribers \n\n* Confirmation bias (e.g. circlejerking) and downvoting comments/posts that are critical of the current held viewpoint \n\n* The saturation and almost comically predicatable eventual devolving of arguments into ad hominem/name calling statements. Also the glorification of getting into arguments on Reddit and winning them (as if that somehow makes you superior in some way? What a fragile ego..)\n\nEdit: while there are negatives, there are also positives such as being able to create subs for practically anything (which allows for people to come together under a common interest and contribute meaningful content/resources for both everyone inside and outside of the sub). \n\nI think hiding scores for a certain duration and randomizing comments like when a thread is in contest mode would alleviate most of the issues I highlighted above. \n\n*But*, there is a clear preference by the creators/upper mgmt to cater to the already present political angle Reddit generally holds and to encourage recognition of certain comments/posts (i.e. gold and the other awards). That trade off comes with low level content at times and a certain homogenization in larger subs.  
17	One of the most annoying ones is the blatant hypocrisy of all of these “liberal” and “open” individuals when it comes to social issues. Look, I don’t want to pull *this* card, but fact is that Reddit is full of straight, white, introverted, shut-in pseudo-intellectuals. Although I agree in general with the *idea* of what a lot of people on Reddit think, I definitely don’t have a cut throat mentality about some of the shit they do. \n\nI think my biggest gripe is the one revolving around how women are treated here. In general, Reddit has made it clear that the view of the majority of users is overall to support women’s rights. When it comes to the group thought of women as a whole, this seems pretty true. In posts talking about women’s rights, everyone is on the same page...\n\n...however, this changes drastically once the it becomes about a specific individual. You’ll see it more-so on threads about female celebrities than anything. The most infuriating aspect of this is that if a male celebrity did whatever this female celebrity did, then all of these Redditors who have seen this male celebrity as a “charming” or “good” individual that they look up to will defend him to their dying breath. They will forgive, try to see the error in his ways, and have a empathetic discussion about the guy. If he stands up for himself and says that he understands what he did wrong, suddenly *everyone* forgives him! *Gasp!*\n\nExample: Louis CK. He was accused of sexual misconduct. The individuals who accused him of it said he took off all of his clothes, masturbated in front of them, and asked this on multiple occasions to multiple women. None of them said he could, and none of them wanted it. He loses his comedy show, etc. Of course, everyone on Reddit loses their fucking minds because he is an empowering and relatable figure to all of these people on the website. What do you see in the comments? People defending him, trying to be neutral, saying how they will still always love his comedy, saying they want the full story, etc. I don’t give a shit about Louis CK, it’s just one I noticed. What the hell do you think would happen on Reddit if Sarah Silverman did this? Because I promise you it wouldn’t be the same reaction.\n\nAnd then let’s look at Jennifer Lawrence. At one point she was Reddit’s “cool girl”. But of course, since she’s an outspoken women, there were always posts about how “bad” she is and how “overrated she is” (something you never fucking see for male celebrities who are all around liked by the general public). Once her nudes were leaked, what happened? Reddit was in an uproar, and people literally gave her shit for speaking out about it. Ever since she spoke out about her *NUDES BEING LEAKED TO MILLIONS*, this website has had a hate boner for her. Every thing a female does is some huge ass controversy and and just all the more reason to hate them because they “can’t take the heat”. Literally Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are like the same God damn person and everyone wants to suck Chris Pratt’s “charismatic” and “down to Earth” cock. The only difference is that Jennifer Lawrence *is* attacked, which is why she defends herself, which is why more people proceed to hate her because she is “outspoken”.\n\nThis isn’t just with female celebrities of course, it’s with females as individuals in general. It’s just lame as fuck and honestly pathetic. A female does one thing, falls off the path as the “cool girl”, becomes outspoken, and then suddenly all of her minor flaws are massive flaws, all of her complaints are just bitching, she’s a terrible person, etc. A “cool guy” does it, then suddenly people become understanding parents who just want to see their little guy be the best that he can be. “This isn’t the true so-and-so”, “I still like him”, etc.\n\nIt’s all absurdly hypocritical. If you’re going to claim that you support equal rights for something, fucking support every aspect of it equally. \n\nI expressed this opinion to a group of guy friends once and now one (INFJ) legitimately thinks I am  “secretly pretending to be gay because why else would you be so opinionated about it” so that I can get women to like me. Lol? Ya. Yepppp. You caught me! \n\nI’m opinionated about everything you dumb fuck. 
6	I hate how politically biased the Reddit admins are. They push their agenda hard. Reddit is not a free space and it should be. I don’t think any subs should be banned, save for child porn subs and others that are explicitly illegal. I know so, so many people who have left because they got sick of Reddit’s shit. I’ve left a couple times too. Really I only come back to this sub.
6	As a woman, it’s really frustrating how much of this website is imagery of naked women. I can’t browse r/all without having pictures put in my face that make me feel bad about myself—and I’m relatively attractive. I’m just not a porn star. 
2	Sometimes people, instead of answering a question, start competing to see who can smother it first, as if their favorite ideology, whether Religion or Science or Whatever, could actually be threatened by what people thought on Reddit! 
2	How US centric it's.\n\nLike when the french protests started the front page of /r/worldnews (keep in mind the world) had nothing about it except, Trump says that the french protests blah blah blah blah.\n\nReddit is the sixth most popular site in the WORLD, and most people that speak english are outside of the US, but apparently a site that is one of the most popular in the world should deal with only 4.4% of the world.\n\nHow much people upvote sensational posts.\nI have seen millions of posts "New study shows that LSD can cure depression", while if the title had something other than LSD,Shrooms,Microdosing it would probably swept under the rug with all the 3-7 upvote posts.\n\nPeople can't keep a discussion on topic.\nMost intelligent discussions tend to transition in to a battle of puns very quickly\n\nSubreddits either tend to have too many users and most posts on it's frontpage don't interest me, and anything you post has a low chance of somebody reading, or they have too few users so there is no new content on it's frontpage for days and anything you post has a low chance of somebody reading\n\nAnd yet will all it's flaws is by far the best social media site.
1	I don't think the ENTP complaints will be all that different from the INTs. \n\nMy biggest problem with Reddit is the voting system. Any anonymous community that allows voting at no cost is bound to turn into a democratic circle jerk. You can observe it in this sub as well. Well argued positions get routinely downvoted because they go against the grain. \n\nEven worse is the low effort/high reward ratio when it comes to content. A shitty meme or stupid one liner has an easier time getting to the top than a multi paragraph comment because the average Reddit user isn't interested in reading anything longer than a few sentences. Tl;dr culture is annoying imo because it goes against what a forum is supposed to be -- a place to exchange and engage ideas. At least the NT subs should be like that. \n\nA possible solution would be to eliminate the upvoting system altogether or introduce some mechanism that would make you "invest" some of your accumulated karma to vote. Alternatively, force people to justify their downvotes via comment. \n\nOverall though, I think Reddit does well at what it's supposed to be. A low-level, free for all market place of content. If you want anything more, restrict your user experience to the more strictly moderated /r/ask* subs. \n\nI've been looking for alternatives to Reddit and so far, the only website that satisfied my requirements was [MetaFilter](https://www.metafilter.com/), but I'm not interested in paying money for an account. 
3	I dislike the masses of whiny people on Reddit that have chosen some trendy modern religion (be it dogmatic progressivism or its right-wing counterpart, although the lefties are the most rabid here) and feel the need to inject their prescripted outrage in every slightly relevant topic. They are everything I dislike in people; irrational, whiny, stuck in dogmatic group think.\n\nP.s. If you are someone like this you certainly do not fit the ENTP profile.
3	That people down vote to disagree 
1	SO relatable. Feelers are only good for smoking spliffs and watching anime with, definitely not talking about interesting shit.
49	Realizing more and more that I have been surrounding myself with the wrong people my entire life.	Let me set the scene:\n\nNew Years Eve 2018. I’m already a little mentally fatigued for reasons I couldn’t really understand. This is weird because I can almost always pinpoint why I am having a problem with my mental state. My ENFP friend who I have already been with the entire week because he is visiting from across the state wants to hang out with me for New Years Eve. Kk, I say. Why not? I realize I don’t know where we are going to go because he wants to do acid and I can’t exactly have him doing that at his moms house...\n\n...so I decide to call up my other ENFP friend who is with some of my other friends. For some reason I feel a pit in my stomach as this happens. I just *don’t* want to hang out with them. But I feel obligated to do something because my ENFP friend is already with me...so we end up going...\n\nAnd here’s the scenario: ISFP female friend, ISFJ female friend, ENFP female friend, ESFP female friend, ENFP male friend. I am the only T here. As the night goes on, they are all having a blast...it’s fun, but I just start getting *bored*. I was already feeling a little “eh” earlier, but for some reason being in this party scenario with all of these people that I can’t truly *click* with just tipped me over the edge...\n\n...and then I just had a sudden realization that my main group of friends have always been people that I only click with on superficial levels, and that there are often misunderstandings, sometimes hurt feelings, etc. and that they never really get me. That night my ENFP friend said “I can never tell how to take what you’re saying to me”. \n\nThe next day I went and hung out with my INTP friend and it was the exact opposite. We talked for hours and hours. Being with this person didn’t feel forced, didn’t feel like I was putting on a face, didn’t feel like I had to watch everything I said, didn’t leave me second guessing myself once I left their company. \n\nI then talked with my ENTJ friend later on about some stuff and again, it was just a neutral, good conversation. No judgment, no misunderstandings. \n\nToday I hung out with my ESTP cousin, and while we don’t have a lot to talk about when we are just sitting around, I just *get* him and we click super well in social situations together. \n\nBut ya, I’ve realized I just hang around way, way too many feeling types. I’m not saying this to be a thinker snob or some shit, it just makes the most sense. The issue is, is that I struggle to find other NTs for some reason. Like since I’m stuck in this NF social dynamic, and also more interested in the Arts/Entertainment Industry than STEM, it’s hard to get out of it.\n\nSuggestions? Thoughts? How do you meet more NT friends? It’s time to change things up.
27	Same here. Most of my friends are feelers. That feeling of 'I like you but I seriously would rather talk to strangers than stay here' is hard to explain and shit to contain.
6	Im 30, ENFP and I already feel my Fi turning me into devil, along with some strong Te grip so.. but an ENFP who never had any serious problems may as well be ESFP to me. Enfp subreddit annoys me like hell ;)
3	I relate to everything you wrote and it makes me think that if I feel that bad, that alienated, that much never at my place, maybe it is just that I am with the wrong persons, not that I am a wrong person. Maybe also I value too much the opinion of people I don't even agree with or relate to. I do that just out of loyalty, poor self-esteem, a belief that other are better than me and because I know my friends are neither stupid or mean. But that really should not be a reason to let them define me. 
4	I think this is the reason my best friend is an INTP. One of my really good friends is an INFP. I think it depends on the person of course, but hanging out with sensors you aren't going to be really able to enjoy talking about abstract crap that most people don't care about. I don't find Feelers to necessarily be all mushy (I hang out with three INFPs) for the most part but I guess it depends. The INFPs just seem to wanna chill and not have anyone step on their toes so to speak. \n\nMeet some new peeps and try some activities that Intuitives enjoy to satiate your desire for abstract talk. \n\n
4	i remembered this post last time i hang out with friends again. it really made me think because for the first time ever i actively paid attention as to how their company makes me feel. same as you, my circle consists of ESFP and ENFP and NF types mainly. even though i can have fun with them on a superficial level, i still kinda think that something is missing. the moment i want to talk about stuff that interests me, ESFP completely shuts out, NF friends listen but won’t contribute much but just say „hmm, yea“. the only friend i can have such connection with is my ENTP friend (what a surprise HA) the thing is i cannot change much about thus since it is hard to find NT types you click with on personal level. anyways this post really makes me think man...
12	You shouldn't watch what you're saying around any group of people, you should always say what's on your mind and not hold yourself back. That's not an MBTI thing, that's a general thing. I recommend the book No more Mr. nice guy.
2	Someone invited you to take a hit of acid?\n\nI'd like to point out that acid is a dangerous substance with tremendous negative potential. If boredom has enticed someone to "try something new," perhaps the lifestyle needs a change, rather than using a "silver bullet" for life's challenges or tediousness.\n\nAnything worth something in this life must be earned.\n\nThose that will not accept this, or believe themselves incapable, will lose.\n\nThey will be guided by their fears and desires, and become lost.\n\nPerhaps, this is not your situation. In that case, disregard.
8	Hi... it’s the guy who believed he was an ENTP turned ENFP turned briefly ISFP and now finally INFP. I’ve just finished a journey that you guys were a part of, so I wanted to share the end result with you	
4	This is a very wholesome conclusion to your quest for finding your cognitive type. I’m glad you found your answer :)\n\nNow that you know the contrast in S/N, do you notice things in retrospect that you didn’t realize at the time (similar to your example about your friend)?
2	Nice
2	Eyyy it’s the musician, I remember you! Good on you bud. 
3	Favorite competitive activities(other than video games)?	Only reason I say other than video games is because it's obvious and also I have neuropathy. Was hoping for a more "real world" hobby. Might try card games too
8	Hunting and fishing are competitive against nature.
6	Beer Pong
2	I loved ScienceBowl and KnowledgeBowl in highs school. Wish we had a college bowl. 
2	Rowing (Crew)
1	hm, the only ones I do that fit your request is playing canasta. It's fun because it's not based on luck, even if there's a limited number of strategies to win. Like chess, it's only fun if you don't take it too fucking seriously, to the point of knowing every possible movement that can be made.
1	Does pinball count as video games?
1	Figure skating
1	Taekwondo, kickboxing, archery, javelin throwing, axe throwing, arguing.

1	Go and Magic: The Gathering for gaming. Running and martial arts for non-gaming.
3	Productivity?	How do you handle it? To-do lists, schedules, yearly goals. Tell me!
5	Colornotes is a mobile app that is the best. It's a notepad you can use to organize things. For instance I use blue for movie/show lists, gray for information, yellow for brief to-do lists, orange for reminders like owing money, green for workout progress etc. \n\nIt also has a built-in calendar. Also with color coding if you so desire. Put in a reminder on a specific date, and at 12:01 am that day you get a reminder notification of your thing. So I'll put in "meeting 12-2" and i have a notification that stays until I dismiss it. \n\nI don't make yearly goals. The best way to accomplish goals is short term milestone. The key to accomplishing tasks is to be *specific*, not vague. If you say you want to lose 20 lbs in 2019, that's called a vague goal because there's no methodology to do it. It's just an idea.\n\nBut if you say you're going to start stronglifts 5x5 on January 5th, that's specific. When you say you'll go to the gym MWF every week of January, that's a tangible, specific, short term goal you can do. And because you say you'll do stronglifts, it's also mapped out *what* you'll do at the gym. Again, specific goals.\n\nIf you say your 2019 goal is dieting, that's vague. A more specific goal would be every Sunday you'll order groceries for the week. More specific, but still vague because *what* will you buy? Opening a myfitnesspal acct and brainstorming a meal plan is a start. For instance you now quantify exactly what kind of diet you're seeking if you say you want 50% carbs, 30% protein, 20% fat in your diet. Then you use myfitnesspal to try different combinations of foods, and then eat those foods. \n\nLong term goals are accomplished by short term goals. Let's say my 2019 goal is to learn another language, Russian. That's a vague goal. I can be more specific by saying I'll do 2 hrs of duolingo three days a week. But that's still not as specific as I can be. Instead I can schedule to study duolingo on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday at 6 pm after dinner. That's a more specific goal, with a quantifiable timeline I can do.\n\nIf I want to fix my sleep schedule I'll say I want to wake up at 7 am evey day. But that's not specific enough, because I should quantify a range of time for when I want to go to sleep. So I'll say I want to be in bed by 11, so I may try "winding down" at around 10 by brushing teeth, avoiding games, etc.\n\nThe key to productivity is short term, tangible, specific goals. Because then you're accountable for your progress. Don't rely on others to urge you to do it, you have to set the schedule yourself. Internal motivation and scheduling is more resilient over time for habits than external motivation.
2	For me, rather than having daily goals, I set myself monthly goals, so I don't feel very trapped into routines. I think this way I've a better Ne+Si interaction.
1	I copy my to do list form year to year, so no real progress there.  \n\n\nFor everything else, I keep paper diary with points/deadlines each week.
1	It depends on the scope of the goal, and the arena.  \n\nFor home stuff, or far out important dates (like trips) I write on a whiteboard.  \n\nFor work and work related projects I use a number of systems.  Work of course forces me to document things and account for my time and plans in various industry specific ways.  \n\nI actively try to recruit other people into my work and personal projects, in which case I might find myself creating my own lists and tasks for us all to get done, and hold each other accountable to.  Of course if someone else wants to do that bit, I'm happy to let them haha.  For coordinating people on long term projects I really like www.trello.com.  Shorter term things google docs is fine.  \n\nDaily I add quick tasks into google calendar.  I indicate the due date in the title.  If it's super important I might set multiple actual calendar reminders, scheduled with an understanding of how long I think it will take to do the thing (plus some fluff).  \n\nI also like to break tasks up by type.  I have a running list of things to research in www.evernote.com.  Sometimes I invite others when we're trying to say figure out where to go on vacation.  \n\n**The lynchpin for me is having prescribed times to work on things in different arenas**.  It's good to set boundaries for both work and fun.  That's how Js do it and I got tired of fighting it a few years back.  That shit works.  \n\n\nAgain you keep separate lists for home/side projects/work.  Pull something off the list in the alloted time.  \n\n\nI try to alternate fun nights/days with productive nights/days.  Like I set aside last saturday and early sunday to work on side projects.  I have a prioritized rough list for those (mostly mod shit last weekend).  Out sunday night.  Last night I cooked and chilled.  I set aside tonight for house stuff and fitness.  Tomorrow night I'mma get sloshed with a couple of new friends.  Thursday I'll stay extra late at work.  Friday and Saturday I'm out.  Etc.  \n\n2 fitness days/nights (minimum) per week.  1 house day/night.  2 side project days/nights.  2 recreational (minimum).  Note that some days can be whatever!  Especially fitness/house combos.  It doesn't take that long to get a good workout, or get your house in order (so long as you stay on top of it).  \n\nYou can adjust how many days you devote to an arena based on what your priorities are.  I don't keep a planned calendar I just say to myself "wait if I schedule another fun thing this week, that'll be too many nights out.... how many nights have I spent on x?".  On average it keeps me more or less looking like an adult.  \n\nAlso I can't overstress the importance of knocking out any sub 20 minute task as soon as you think of it.  Most of the shit that has caused me problems over the years was something I could have knocked out in five minutes.  And you know when you let those little tasks pile up before you know it you have a 5 hour task from something that used to be five minutes, or an entire day of bullshit to deal with... which you then procrastinate on further.  Bleh.  It's like being a slave to your past self all the time.  Fuck that.  Just get off your ass and mail that check or whatever the fuck it is RIGHT NOW.  
1	Do we need chaos? to conduct my own war with the world?	so, do we need chaos? to conduct my own war with the world?
4	what
5	I'll be the first to sign up for your revolt, wigi
5	Sometimes I think that Wigi isn't even an ENTP but an extremely demented schizophrenic person who keeps posting here because we ENTPs are the only ones who are willing to pay even a minute of attention to his rants.
1	Does the Devil exist without chaos? How can I advocate for he who doesn't exist? If I am not a devil's advocate, who am I? Existential crisis, it has begun. War is upon us.
62	ENTPs, do yourselves a favour...	...and never EVER go to webMD. Seriously, stay away. Don't make my mistake. If your inferior Si works like mine, then I promise you'll be panicking over twelve illnesses at once, and then you'll get to know that you have only few days to live and you'll get anxious af. Just some friendly advice.
49	Sometimes I think I'm the only one who knows how to use WebMD. It's never been wrong for me. It's like people aren't in tune with their bodies and don't know what's going on. WebMD is a simple algorithm and uses the same statistics doctors do. You put your symptoms into a database, and you get out the highest correlated illnesses that could be causing it. \n\nThe only difference between WebMD and people doctors is that doctors recognize patients are idiots and simply tell them it's a cold since that's the most probable outcome. Whereas when patients are left to use the computer themselves, they're never happy at how a cold is making them so miserable, so they keep digging until they see cancer and then freak out. 
5	Is this a troll post?... \neither way your best option is to understand people get sick but I should get creative ideas that are logically sane to improve my health. Also you are searching on Web MD they litterly have Memes on how exaggerated they depict the illness of a person. \n(I.e: meme: person- "I got a headache". Web MD- *opens up coffin* "Get in".
10	Not really, WebMD is pretty useful, imo. Think of it as a broad overview of diagnoses that *could* be true. All that's left is a series of elimination, which (if you do it properly) gives you a rough list of diagnoses that may be probable. \n\nObviously, if you have the runs it doesn't mean you have ulcerative colitis when gastroenteritis is listed as a diagnosis. It takes a bit more reading than just the results to get a better picture, but I'm not sure why people have difficulty with this. Maybe it's confusion regarding the medical terms? Or they don't want to put in the effort to read and narrow down each diagnosis? I'm not sure. 
3	Legit was convinced I had herpes to the point I was crying, turned out it was jock itch/rash, pro tip, lotrimin ultra works amazingly x3 
4	I've had every disease, disorder, infection, -itis on that website since 2010\n\nNo official medical opinion yet.
6	Amen OP. 
3	I just spend my entire life looking for the right doctors, and I go with them when I feel shitty for weeks. Like if it doesn't get better after a month, I go to them or the ER if I can't get them. Or, if I know I have something seriously wrong I go right away. Like most people. Although I'm way more stubborn then most, and always try to shake it off. For example, I had a torn labrum in my hip for over 3 months and just thought it was a muscle pull or minor tear/arthritis. \n\nI don't trust WebMD.
3	HAHAHAHA!!!! As one who has also made this mistake, I second OP's statement.
2	Never used it. I work in emergency medicine, so when things go wrong for me I always know what it is long before it reaches my doctors radar.\n\nLikewise with friends and family. Only for some reason I know so many fruitcakes that reject modern medicine. They come running to me for my opinion on their problems, I give them an accurate impression, they disagree / reject it, time passes by and it gets worse or they deteriorate and big surprise they end up diagnosed with the exact impression I gave them, treated with the same suggestions I gave them. Only now it's worse, and in some unfortunate cases, irreversible. \n\nI have to wonder if it is as common in other fields or professions to have so many people doubt you as it is in medicine?

2	Youre right i should go check if i still have fake Lupus
1	Technically, your conclusions would be drawn with all your cognitive functions... (including your dominant preferred function, Ne, which develops abstract patterns and potentialities).\n\nCome on guys... we must start viewing MBTI holistically; as an entire unified system.\n\nIsolation can only take one so far before integration must advance understanding.

1	lol I read this and it triggered me to go on the website I was expecting some really scary shit but its just a regular health website hahaha
-1	or you can just not be retarded.  Do you really think you have 12 distinct illnesses from self diagnosing on WebMD?  It's ridiculous
-3	You can avoid this entirely by doing two things:\n\n1) Don't give yourself any immediate rewards, ever. No drinking, no drugs, no masturbating to porn. All of these things contribute to clogging your brain and thereby making you question why you feel so bad. \n\n2) Stop eating plants. Seriously none of them are safe. We've evolved for millions of years eating nothing but meat, we have no organs that specialize in extracting fat and other essential nutrients from plant matter(Only one stomach, our appendix is bitch-made compared to other primates, very short colon, etc.) and they have tons of chemical weapons specifically formulated to discourage creatures from eating them that we have no defenses against. \n\nGet yourself healthy and you won't be looking at webMD in the first place. 
4	Which type have you had the most success with I a relationship?	NO, I’m not saying that we have an IDEAL type or whatever. I’m just curious to see what type has worked the best for you in a relationship setting.
4	Dated an INFJ when I was 19. I lost interest because I couldn’t stand the shut-in lifestyle he had and his incredibly stubborn viewpoint on how terrible mankind is an how everything is evil and everyone is bad blah blah blah. He proceeded to tell me that I was delusional and idiotic for thinking that I could ever make a difference in this world and I QUOTE- “I used to be like you- forward thinking, positive about the future, and thinking I can make a difference...but I realized the truth. You’ll be just like me one day and realize it’s all for nothing.” \n\nThanks.\n\nWas interested in an ISFJ for a while. Turned out he was straight. Sigh. ISFJs always seem gay. It’s really annoying.\n\nOf all the types I would say the easiest and best type that I could see myself being with would be an INTP. I’ve been friends with a few and I’ve always found them really attractive. The only real issue I could see is us enabling each other’s bad habits for practicality. I literally had to spend 15 minutes with my rich INTP friend a few days ago by inputting money spending receipts for a business trip so he could get 1,800 dollars back. He said “I just don’t care about money...and I know I should...but I just don’t...”. I could see shit never getting done if I were with an INTP. \n\nINTPs are some of the only people who I’ve hung out with and thought “Wow, I could be with this person all day every day and never get tired of them or feel annoyed.”

10	I debated someone I didn't know and...	... after debating for about 5 minutes or so I started my favourite hobby, which is playing devil's advocate. However,  the problem is that I didn't stop there and peoceeded to make fun of their arguements and questioning the points they were trying to make and make them second guess themselves and their beliefs. There was an old lady listening and she was laughing and asking me "what do you think?! Because you keep jumping from one side to the other!!" \n\nSo, I was compromised and then stopped. \n\nWhy do ENTPs really do that? Are we trolls or is there a deeper meaning to this?! 
13	Nah fam. We trolls 
2	I do this but not to troll. If I find the topic interesting I want to explore it fully and one of the best ways of doing that is to play the devil's advocate. It allows both parties to create an informed opinion.
2	Because we are having fun doing that and that makes us happy.
2	Definitely a deeper meaning. It’s your inner spirit trying to reach out and give back to the world via perspective. It’s how unconscious Fe works. Read about shadow functions and how it relates to creator72’s theories for more info
2	It's just how our minds work. We see possibilities. It's literally just who we are. It's just how we think! It's easy to seem like you are arguing with someone by suggesting different ideas to the ones they have. Sometimes we are genuinely trying to argue, but sometimes we are just being ourselves - but it still appears argumentative because we're still playing "devils advocate", because it's just how our mind operates! To see all of the possibilities. I think you could liken our mind to a slot machine. Pull the handle, spin, stops in a random configuration. Interesting! Pull handle again. 
1	Winning is addict by the time you found your self debated to match and lost alot of people you will learn when to stop ,not from the debating thing but only the time to get back and ether say maybe or nothing 
1	Odd flex but ok
1	>Why do ENTPs really do that?\n\nChild Fe.\n\n>Are we trolls or is there a deeper meaning to this?!\n\nDepends on what you understand by "deeper meaning".
1	For fun  \nAnd for testing and validating propositions via logic
3	How do you deal with friends who only want an echo chamber of support when you can see flaws on both sides of an argument?	So my MARRIED friend started a job after being a stay at home mom for years, and met a guy at work she began to develop feelings for. She attempted to rationalize her liking of this guy by saying ‘oh we’re just friends’ and convincing herself meanwhile behind her husbands back she was going to the bar with this guy, and took him instead of her husband to get a tattoo unbeknownst to him. Naturally she continued to convince herself she was just friends with him, while messaging all of this to me for weeks on discord. \n\nA few days ago her husband had suspected her of cheating and decided to turn on her computer and he ended up reading our discord conversations and found out about her hanging out with this guy behind his back, so naturally he assumes they’re fucking. Obviously he is angry, upset and yells at her, and she reacts with the argument ( to me ) that he’s being verbally and emotionally abusive to her. Her whole argument is she isn’t cheating because she isn’t fucking the guy from work yet she’s been telling me for a couple of weeks that if she knew guys like ( her friend ) existed, she wouldn’t have married her husband. \n\nI’ve already pissed her off by being myself and remaining neutral and trying to examine all sides of the situation, but to her that’s me being a horrible friend :S yiiiikes 
2	An easy way out. Explain to her how it looks to her husband. If done without moralising and from the point of care, it is the best you can do. You don't have to be echo-chamber but you don't have to be their mother/preacher. because if you're the latter, you'll not going to put your point across and only antagonise them.
1	Crush them with logic for fun
27	Friends, Loneliness and Dating...ENTP female questions...	Hey hey all, hope everyone is doing well so far in 2019 ...\n\nFew questions for this sub. Do any other ENTP females have difficulty maintaining friendships with other females? I am a 21F ENTP and have been recently become more aware that I literally have no deep friendships. It has been getting me really down. I already struggle with depression, so it has been a challenge to push myself to branch out/socialise and maintain friendships. I crave for a close circle of friends that I can hang out/share ideas and confide in. Maybe I’m doing something wrong...My close ENTJ has been ignoring me pretty much it seems, I have been trying to reach out to her and others to socialise “Let’s get coffee sometime on X date or let’s go for drinks/go see a movie” ... Before meds, I was typed as an INFP/T but now I have been typed as an ENTP/ESTP.\n\nI feel really lonely. I have been trying to stay away from social media because it’s full of girls hanging out/going to music festivals, camping etc. I really want to do stuff like this, but I feel like an outsider who will never be wanted or accepted by anyone., however, I am trying to just do my own thing and do a lot of self work/practice self love on my own in the meantime....\n\nI have a lot to give and I feel like nobody wants the affection and warmth that I do actually possess. All my friends seem to stay in contact but like I said, I feel like they are tired of me and just don’t have it in them to be honest and tell me to get lost. I share things with them, then I try to give them space but idk....\n\nI have been a bit of a social loner since I was young, if this makes sense. Like feeling not on the inside/lonely when surrounded by people. I have this with dating/guys too. I am starting to feel like I will be alone for a long time, which, as an ENTP...it’s pretty unsettling. \n\nI have found the guys I have been going on dates with are interested at first but once they start getting to know me, they don’t want anything to do with me. My friends have told me that maybe I need to be less intense and just chill. How does one do this? I don’t want to dull myself down for anyone, especially not for a potential partner. \n\nI feel pretty lost at the moment, but I’m going travelling soon which I’m excited about. I’m going to stay single and just do my own thing I think. I have never had a boyfriend and just have had casual relationships with men...Problem is...I never get asked out lol...I have asked guys out and had dates but they have been really ... dull and unfulfilling. I am tying to go in with no expectations and just focus on my own standards and values. I need to work on setting boundaries with guys who may not be entirely “healthy” for me and my self growth. Rambling aside, how do you deal with guys who aren’t entirely supportive of you? I mean I tell them to not make assumptions, for example...This guy I’m seeing seems to give me a lot of backhanded compliments. I mean, I know I am not that smart but I don’t appreciate being called “inarticulate” or having my opinions disregarded because I am a woman. I wouldn’t really call myself a feminist, but I seem to attract sexist assholes with huge egos hahaha. Apparently I speak my mind too much and am a bit too honest, but I have been learning to handle honesty and truth with more sensitivity and kindness. I just don’t want to change for someone else, I want to be always me, but better, if that makes any sense?\n\ntldr: lonely and feeling pretty disheartened with having hardly any close girl friendships, dating prospects etc. I would love any advice/suggestions from other (perhaps older) ENTPS. \n\nTake care all, hope you are all doing great 💖🙃🌼
16	Try and find some NTs to be friends with, trust me, you will establish a bond pretty quick.
12	1.	Get some NT friends. I feel like it’s necessary lol. \n2.	I’m also 21F ENTP. There are men that appreciate strong, independently minded, and outspoken women. The trend I’ve found is that they are not extroverts however. I’ve only ever found introverts to be romantically attracted to me. And those introverts being either Ni dominants or Ne aux. interesting pattern there. \n3.	remember that all your friends don’t need to serve every role. I have a lot of friends for different things. I have some girl friends that I talk about stuff like boys, music, etc with. Some male NTP friends that are always interested in my theories and research. A few ESFP and ESFJs that I go to bars with. It’s ok to not have “close friends” as long as you are getting your needs met. \n4.	don’t sweat boys. Seriously. And if a man disrespects your intelligence then he isn’t the man for you. I don’t care if you’re dumb as rocks, insults in the beginning of the dating process are a red flag. 
10	Hey! We likely don't live nearby, but message me if you wanna chat! Am girl (25F). I want to second smallghosts's comment, especially point #3; I think having multiple "shallow" friendships is more common than people realize. While I've formed a few deep friendships in the past (but not really since moving after high school), honestly I haven't found the shallow friendships to be any less energizing.
10	Yo your meds didn't make you an entp.  Your post is nearly pure Fi with some Ne flavoring haha.  \n\nAlso you're 21 don't sweat it.  You have some time to figure a lot of different things out.  My advice is to work on forming intimate platonic friendships, and then worry about romance.  A good relationship is mostly a friendship but with way more potential for stress, pain, and sex.  
5	I’m a female Entp (23 f) and what you’re saying resonates a lot with where I was at 21. I totally agree with the comment saying to befriend an ISFJ, ENFP, ESFP, INTP, and INTJ. Weirdly enough, those have all been the people who I’ve connected the most with since college o.O (my brother is an ENFP, childhood best friend an ISFJ, high school best friend an ESFP, boyfriend an INTP, and generally really love when I have an INTJ in my life to chat with-try to not flippantly argue with these guys too much haha.)  NT’s are where you will feel understood. :) \n\nThere’s a book which I’d say changed my social life. It’s called “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie. I never wanted to read it when I was younger, as I thought it sounded like a book on social manipulation lol, but it has amazing insights on how to approach socializing with people if you’re not sure where to start. \n\nI also had crippling social anxiety from the ages of 15-20/21, and his book”How to Stop Worrying and Start Living your life” honestly helped me a lot. In the last couple years, I went on a binge of reading books like these and learning about body language and meditation. I think that these elements have helped me appear more relaxed and approachable around people haha. \n\nSo like I said, I’ve had some of the same childhood/teenage best friends my whole life. But these are only a handful of people I’d call friends all together. I’ve been through times where I hung out with “popular” cliques of girls and did enjoy being invited out to social gatherings/events, but realized over time that the substance behind meeting up and getting drunk/high together to take photos for Instagram lol wasn’t much. \n\nMoreover from that, there was tons of jealously involved and backstabbing. As an entp, I really was seeking intellectual conversations my whole life rather than shitting on how other girls look lol and awful backstabbing drama was hiking up my anxiety. But it’s good to live and learn through different kinds of relationships with people. \n\nAs far as guys are concerned, ooh girl. I have some stories for you haha. Cliche as it is, you do accept the kind of love that you think you deserve + nobody can make you feel inferior without your consent. I’m not sure how much into spirituality you are, but I’d check out “Why Men Love Bitches” and “You are a Badass” if you have time (the second one is a bit spiritual). My ISTJ faux step sister recommended it to me as we were both doormats in our college dating life. \n\nIf you’d like to be e pals haha, feel free to send me a PM! I’m always open to meeting new people and chatting. :) Good luck with everything and please keep your head up, girl! 
6	23f ENTP here. I’m so glad you posted this. I’ve been going through a rough patch with basically everything you’re saying. Your post helped me realize I’m not alone. Not advice just a thank you!
3	(26F ENTP) since puberty I've always tended to have more male friends than females friends, mostly due to having interests that are more male dominated. I always have a couple of female friends but I often feel like I'm always available for them but not vice versa. Im really close to my INTJ sister, so she will always be someone I can talk to, but unfortunately we live in different cities. I have another close high school friend who shares nearly every interest I have who is also ENTP, but she lives in another province now. I haven't really been able to get close to another female to that extent since, and not for lack of trying. Females I am friends with now I feel like I could never be close with because their problems are always the center of attention and I can't even have a fun time out with them without them bringing up all their insecurities. I also suck at going out places to meet people. I wish I had advice for you but I've yet to make any lasting female friends in this city and I've lived here for over 2 years.
4	1. ENTP lady as well, but I do well in girl groups. You said you were previously typed as an INTP, though, and your experiences sound somewhat similar to what I've heard from INTP friends. I think one thing that's important to accept is that it's totally okay to be an introvert and not attend parties all of the time. If you want to make friends, though, you do have to open up. Share vulnerabilities. Interestingly, I seem to make two types of lady friends - women who are either mega boss bitches who never take shit from anybody, or women who are quite shy, introverted, and self-deprecating. The primary reason the latter seem to struggle socially is that they're perpetually second-guessing themselves and their choices. Instead of rescheduling a missed hangout, for example, they'll just assume that they were stupid to ask you to hang out in the first place and never contact you again - that sort of thing. The trick to making close friends with someone is, in my view, simply to act like you've been close friend all along. Confiding a secret helps; asking for advice (especially relationship or fashion advice) REALLY help re. making lady friends. \n\n2. If a dude you're seeing doesn't respect you, stop seeing him. Alternatively, if you think the relationship is otherwise salvageable, stand up for yourself. I've definitely had male suitors in the past question... not necessarily my intelligence, but certainly choices I've made. I found that standing by those choices with confidence usually shut them up. You can usually feel it out when someone is genuinely trying to help you with feedback/advice, versus when they're subtly trying to put you down or (worse) trying to mold you to their version of whatever is acceptable.\n\nP.S. There are definitely men who accept, and even prefer, opinionated women. Interestingly, my SO isn't one of them - he's pretty neutral re. opinionatedness. However, he does appreciate that I'm intelligent and that I usually try to check my sources, and that I have a healthy amount of scepticism re. the things I'm told. Intellectual curiosity is an attractive trait to many. 
3	ENTP female here, and I have acquaintances but no deep friendships - I kinda made peace with the fact that I'll probably won't ever get anyone who understands my mind and who I find interesting. I have one INTJ friend but it's not that close friendship so.. \nShit happens. This is life. But maybe knowing that you're not alone will help a bit. I have also  intrusive thoughts and am generally anxious, both are a bitch. 
4	I've been married to an INFJ for over 10 years now, and we argue maybe 2-3 times a year, and it's mostly me not her. [I found a site](https://www.buzzfeed.com/ilincavalentina/eight-reasons-infjs-and-entps-are-a-match-made-in-nf6k?utm_term=.pp1m56rj1#.wrbgxAoZ4) that explains why they can be a good match. \n\nI hope that helps some. If not I can tell you more.\n\nOf that site, I found this was the most important reason:\n\n>ENTPs can sometimes come across as a little bit cold and heartless to their feeling peers, and the INFJ's sensitivity sometimes makes their life harder than it has to be. When they team up, the INFJ can provide the ENTP with some valuable insight into how the mysterious F works, and the ENTP can tell the INFJ to stop worrying about other people's feelings all of the time and focus on the facts. It's a win win situation.
3	Make friends with ESFP, INTJ, INTP, ENFP, and ISFJ. \n\nAs far as dating goes, keep trying to find people that share your values. Based on that, in my case, there are about 540,000 women worth marrying in the US which is like 0.002% of the population or 1/600 women. That's ok because I only need 1. 
3	Girls I'm friends with who aren't as masculine as me keep me as the Lesbian Friend™ even though I'm not gay. 
3	Being surrounded by "Feelers" aka Energy Sucking Vampires, will leave you exactly as you are now, empty but seeking to survive... find those T's honey...
2	I only recently started getting closer to good friends. Hopefully you are realizing the potential caring friendships around you. It's more possible as an extrovert
2	Sleep food and exercise help with enjoyment generally.  \n  \nAs for people it is hard but over time if you reach out to people IRL and on the net youll find people you vibe with *because* of how intense you are. Some ppl value that energy i find
3	this post sounds like it was written by an ENFP
1	Im friend with my self literally..im 26 now ... having friends depresses you to the max feeling you r weird and emotionless and its toooooo complicated to understand woman's it made me realize that we are friend with everyone but no one is friend with us . don't look to hard wasted my time.
1	RrRibbit 
1	18M ENTP here.\n\nA couple things. I've also been acting as somewhat of an outcast in school too, but I've become MUCH more active since senior year in high school after finding out how networking is as important, if not more, as finding the right major. (I'll get back to high school in a bit.) Out of all my friendships, the ones that lasted the best are the ones I've made in middle school. I could owe it to the fact that my friends were in ALL of my classes from 6th to 8th grade, but that alone would mean I'd somehow have 30 best friends lul. Reality is I have 4 best friends. It came out of three things: \n\n(1 we're the science geeks of our class\n\n(2 we come up with the wonkiest stuff. (I still vividly remember when one of them, an ISTJ, asked "What would happen if the Titanic hit an iceberg with U-236 in it?")\n\n(3 ROBOTICS\n\nTL;DR Find someone who shares your passion and meet with them as often as you can.\n\nNow, about the outcast situation. Just yesterday, my HS best friend (only half a tier below my MS friends) sent me another one of his LONG text messages. He was concerned that I wasn't aware that everyone in high school was distancing themselves from me. (You BET I was aware. I knew from the beginning and I could bare that cost.) Then he made the argument that it's how I'm SUPER individualistic and eccentric I was that's causing this awkward rift.
28	How do you handle exams?	Hey, 21M, supposedly ENTP here. I'm at college now, and I've been always dealing with exams same as I was dealing at primary school. (Though, probably I was more organized) I generally start studying the target exam 1 day, maybe 2 days (depends on the difficulty level) before it actually happens. Most of the time, I don't give much damn about the difficulty level, too. I go and think like, yeah, night is mine and I can handle it. And surprisingly, I handle it good. I'm not a super smart person, I don't have a good long term memory skill and usually I cannot focus on when it's not serious and usually, it's not. But when it comes to that night before the exam, I hyperfocus on the details. And when it comes to the exam, I uberhyperfocus (wtf) and try to give everything I could and usually it's enough. But after an exam, I usually forget a lot of even the most basic stuff to be remembered, and can't solve problems or explain something. \n\nHow do you guys handle?
38	That's like 20% of your potential. Are you not worth more than that? Wanna know better? \n\nIn HS+college freshman I did as you do and went by just fine. Then I learned to study with my GF in HS/college, whom was motivation enough to get that ball rolling. That got me to graduate top of my class, heavyweight champion of the world after throwing Mankind off Hell In A Cell, where he plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.\n\n1. Every class, you skim read the material ahead of time. At first it makes little sense, then you go to class primed and learn MUCH better. You also have an easier time memorizing what happened since the thorough class comes as a repetition of your early read.\n\n2. Every night, you open your books for whatever class you had. Doesn't matter if you do 1 exercise or the whole series, just plunge back into it for a sec. Your next sleep will be super charged with neuron pathways demanding to be built on that material\n\n3. Nights when you don't have class, or spare time, you open your books. Whatever seems most pressing, and diddle them a bit. Doesn't have to be a long time, but at least 15 minutes. Every. Damn. Fucking. Uberhyperday. Faster than you think, you'll be on top of every assignment, every semester, ahead of time.\n\n4. The week leading to an exam, start conversations with other students: open with questions about the material. More often than not, they'll have more questions than you do and helping them along will polish your acquired knowledge.\n\nIt's a lot of work and discipline. It fucking works. Duds who can't think by themselves if their lives depend on it get A and B averages, studying like that. Crush them.
5	You're cramming, and that kills long-term memory.\n\nTake notes with pen/paper, not typing. You retain better. \n\nIf the class assigns homework before the exam, do it as  it assigned. If you have questions, you can go to that prof (and ask them, then build that relationship, then get those sweet sweet letters of recommendation).\n\nIs it a STEM or humanities course. Humanities courses are easier to BS (at least for me). If it is math heavy, make a note-sheet with pertinent equations, and some minor explanation for application. Of course, if it's not allowed, don't bring it to the test. Writing what matters for the course and some small pointers will help remember, and then you have a review for when finals comes. \n\nI'm taking Organic online. It's self paced, and I allot myself 3 weeks per unit. Weeks 1 and 2 are viewing the lectures, and doing most of the online homework. At the end of week 1 I schedule the test with the proctor to light a fire under my rear to finish lectures by week 2. \n\nWeek 3, I do all the  optionaal HW assignments ( a lot of them build on later lectures) and do the 4 practice exams (my prof is  amazing), often doing 2 the night before the exam. If I am having trouble remembering reagent/biochemist changes/orientations, I will make flashcards, because writing helps.\n\nAlso I like caffeine before exams. 
5	I have done two degrees part time and this is how I found I work best, which I only started doing once I figured out what my function stack means to me as ENTP and how we learn.\n\nWe are button pushers, we learn by seeing the reaction to things. This means you need to apply what you get in lessons to get it right. Doing it 2 days before the exam means you are winging it and the only thing you have to thank for getting you this far is the fact that you are likely somewhat intelligent and that ENTPs horde information like others do grudges.\n\nHere is what you need to understand about yourself as a chronically distractable human being who gets bored very quickly. You need to train yourself to finish what you are doing before moving onto the next thing. There are many ways to do it but the way I did it is the following:\n\n1. List that shit out. Give yourself 25 minutes to list things in detail about what you need to do do. I'm not talking about item 1 being study maths. Item 1 under the maths heading is "The concept of an equation", item 2 is "rules of an equation" item 3 is "solving the equation" you get my drift. Why do it this way? Because you are clever and you will be able to retain most of what you give yourself in bite size chunks. I would rather know 100% of 70% of the work than 50% of 100% of the work.\n2. After concept comes application. Practice, and practice some more by starting easy and working up to difficult. These practices should be separate items on the list and you will know they are different challenges. Foe my marketing degree I did past papers and analysed companies according to what I had learnt. Companies I had an interest in, helps that this was my job at the time but really good to practice what was being taught. For my information systems degree I made systems, both software and soft processes where I thought things could be done better, I know that the humanities degrees etc have a lot of past papers that you should be able to go through. Fuck exercise books, you want the papers set by your teachers to learn how they think, how they expect answers. It is part of playing the academical game.\n3. Your tasks and time spent on an item should be short and achievable. Start with a small amount of time and start to grow your concentration abilities by rewarding yourself in small doses and often. Concentration is like a muscle that needs to be exercised. Someone aluded to rewards earlier, award strong behaviour in yourself, not necessarily goals. It might take me 6 hours to study what I need for this task, if the reward is only 6 hours away I give up, but if I reward myself for half an hour of concentration at a time I can break that 6 hours down into 12 tiny rewards and drive through them knocking it off. You will feel great and stay motivated.\n4. Learn from your mistakes! Going back to the button pushing, if you do something wrong then find out how to do it right without actually applying the right way of doing it then all you have done is reinforced the wrong behaviour. Mastery of something isn't about 10000 hours of doing it, it requires 10000 hours of doing it right which we forget about and hate because it may mean we took 10000 hours just to get to a point of doing it right. \n5. Attend classes and do homework. Easier said than done but if you do this you will have 50% of the knowledge behind you already. It is so so useful. I started a degree after leaving school and dropped out as I wasn't achieving the grades I needed as I never went to classes, after all, I didn't "need" to so hey, had a bunch of fun and fucked up. During my part time degrees, every class and every bit of homework I did. Classes were 6 in the evening to 9 after work Monday to Thursday for my marketing degree and I refused to miss them, no matter how tired.\n6. Part of pushing buttons is having debates. We fucking love em and we learn from them. Introduce yourself to your lecturer or teacher and schedule time or go after class where you can debate the work with them. Tell them this is what you like doing and go there with a position on the knowledge being shared to you. The biggest disadvantage you have is that you have no grounding or experience working with the knowledge given to you, making it hard to understand and relate to, this will break that. If your teachers won't talk about it find somewhere on reddit to talk about it or family or friends. Go to the smartest kid in the class and challenge their opinions in the things you are learning.\n\nFinally, finish what you start. We all hate following through on our ideas, but just get shit done. Plus being known as a person who gets shit done is a good reputation in any work place.
5	How I went from a below average undergrad to an almost perfect masters degree (CS):\n\n1. Make sure you either have the professors notes or write notes yourself\n\n2. Summarize everything(!!!) to a level where it contains everything you need to understand. For me this ended up being usually 20 to 30 pages per course\n\n3. Read it 2 to 3 times\n\n4. Condense it down to about 5 to 10 pages\n\n5. Read these a few times. Use them as a helper for some exercises.\n\n6. read them the evening before your exam and right before your exam.\n\nThis method took me about 8 to 16 hours per course once done a few times. Afterwards I usually wrote straight As even when I haven't been to the lectures itself (although I did more exercises in that case).
7	Maybe get yourself a daily planner for 2019 and think of the best way to live each day and write it down! (even if you just write down like study for 1h without getting too specific) and then in the evening you can reward yourself with something you like (I don't know, chocolate maybe?) if you did everything and you get nothing if you didn't. I think it's pretty important to write down what you want to do. (thought I am an INTJ that is 16 years old myself so take my advice with a grain of salt) Maybe get someone to study with, so you not only disappoint yourself if you skip studying but them too. Creates more pressure
5	> I generally start studying the target exam 1 day, maybe 2 days (depends on the difficulty level) before it actually happen\n\nThis is 30 days *too late*.\n\n> I usually forget a lot of even the most basic stuff to be remembered, and can't solve prob\n\nThis is the difference between *understanding* and just memorizing things superficially.\n\nIf I asked you to multiply 1231 x 456 by hand, I’m sure you could do it without having to study multiplication, even though you likely haven’t done a problem like that in 10 years. \n\nThat’s because you really understand how to multiply.  Granted, that’s a rather simple example, but it’s generally applicable.\n\nIf you’re having problems with math based problem solving courses, then you *have to* do problems to learn the material.  And that takes time.\n\nPerformance on a test, where speed is an issue, is also dependent on how practiced you are.\n\nThink of it like playing music.  I could put music in front of you and ask you to sight read it.  If I let you go as slow as possible, you likely won’t make any mistakes.  But if you speed up to the normal tempo you won’t be able to play it well because of the unfamiliarity.\n\nThat also happens with things like math.  You might honestly “know” all the rules you need to know and can do any problem given enough time.   But practicing lots of problems gives you a deeper understanding of how to *apply* those rules.  It gives you a familiarity with actually performing them.  And the familiarity lessens your stress during an exam.\n\nHere’s what I always tell my students:  if you do 5 problems a day, 5 times a week, at the end of the month you’ve done about 100 problems and have been practicing for a month.   How many problems are you gonna do two days before the exam?\n\nThe proper way of preparing for an exam is to start on **day one**.  Anything less than that is just going to get you into trouble.  \n\nSource: procrastinated and suffered for it through college and grad school.
3	"Uberhyperfocus".\nSorry man, but I'll have to steal this word. It's too awesome
3	It seems like for ENTP its hard to learn everything by heart, we like to grasp concepts and ideas. I think the first step to remember everything is to have a good understanding first instead of memorizing because this is what we are supposed to find fun and be good at. This is also something your personality benefits from as you will be able to explain what you learn much better to others. \n\nOn the flip side it's hard because real dedication is not easy for an ENTP but ou have to discipline yourself to have some kind of routine where you look at what you have learned the same day. It will be much easier to memorize everything when you revise. 
3	Self manipulation is the way to go.\n\nTry to manipulate yourself into thinking that you like studying and you will end up doing it "with pleasure".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is extremely tiring in the long term but you can hold off for the few years necessary to have a foothold in a good college.
2	Ooh! What I do is the day before the exam, even if I'm cramming and it doesn't feel like I have time, I take the time to teach my friends/discuss.
2	What works for me is, I change my mind set of what I study, try to make it more intersting and relate it to its purpose( in a hope of creating some kind of excitement, this doesn't work for all subject). Otherwise my mind delete things after exam. When I was your age I was supper lazy so I did bare minimum and procrastinate  all the time. But didn't like the outcomes so, I begin to read and study over and over again and forced myself to learn things. As Entp you need certain expertise otherwise you will regret. So, to study,  you must convice yourself that you need knowledge. Uneducated Entp is the worest feeling. Some times fear is  a motivation too. Scare yourself with the possible outcome and dumb entp is the worest. 
1	That’s how I did it! Did just fine.
1	I never studied, and I wish I did, but I also normally got Cs it better. I averaged a B so. 
1	Study few hours night before or just before the exam. Tell myself that I'm prepared and going to succeed. Profit. Just graduated with a 4.0
1	I cheat 
1	I had kind of shitty grades in college, because I never studied in high school and got away with it. By then I hadn't formed good study habits and was used to getting by talent. Around senior year, I realized when I actually took the time to study (even a little) my exam scores improved spectacularly (like C/Ds to As). Too bad I figured it out senior year, though.\n\nSomething I try to do is instead of just memorizing terms and concepts, is  try and make up an original scenario that would demonstrate the terms. Doing this actually fosters understanding instead of just memorization.\n\nAlso, make friends in your classes. I had a professor explain he encourages and does activities that  require discussion among students in class because he wants students to get to know and like one another. When you have friends in class it encourages you to go to class more, and you also have people who can help you and study with. He was totally right. It honestly does help a lot. Like even if it ends up that everyone you're studying w/is stupid and you end up teaching/explaining everything (and I've genuinely been in this situation), teaching other people is actually incredibly helpful in learning concepts. So, I definitely suggest making friends and studying with other people.
1	I generally don't study much before exams. I prefer to do my studying as I go like u/BeornPlush advocated -- essentially, constantly prepping and revising to make sure I totally absorb and wrap my head around the content. It's easy to formulate ideas this way when you have a solid base like this to work on. Before exams, I like to figure out and develop my ideas and I can usually do this by discussing it with others or just reflecting, contemplating possibilities and word-vomiting about it in writing. \n\nI suppose this also depends upon what you're studying as well and some techniques just won't work with some disciplines. Whatever works for you works!
1	Generally I handled them by doing them. 
0	Dude just BS through it. You’ll remember the real shit where it counts. Honestly the way I study for stuff is make it interesting or meaningful in some way. I never have to do that for my Computer Science Exams, but English is another story
5	what would you do during fire in the escape room?	check that story https://nypost.com/2019/01/05/5-teens-killed-in-fire-after-escape-room-goes-horribly-wrong/\n\nSo, What are you doing in this situation? are you JUST waiting for help from outside?
6	I've been in one escape room but they explained during the introduction that they aren't legally allowed to literally lock us in the room, and if we need to get out at any time, hit the "exit" button on the wall by the door.\n\nSo I'd probably hit the exit button by the door. 
3	They died from carbon monoxide poisoning, which is a pretty... "comfortable" way to go.  It makes you sleepy and confused, much like [hypoxia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN3W4d-5RPo).  So, they may not have realized the danger they were in and were still waiting to be evacuated.
4	Sounds like they suck at escape rooms. 
1	Kick the door down? Unles it is one of those metallic doors I am taking it down. I've never done it, but I'm sure panic and adrenaline will take care of it.
0	Thankfully, in most high pressure situations I’m known to be the one with a level head mostly disconnected from emotion and focused on logical choices. If anything, the risk of potent death would have upped the anty to me and I may have become more focused than before, I would hope.\n\nI feel for their loss though, and even though I could talk about being levelheaded who knows? Maybe I’d eat shit and die. Lol 
6	I just saw this on my suggested articles, do you agree with it?	
3	Diane is an idealist, not an intellectual (speaking archetype wise). She cares about the moral high ground. Way more INFP in my opinion.
3	I think Carolyn is an ESFJ.  She cares far too much about being liked to be an ENTJ, and has a massive Fe bleeding heart.  Most ENTJs wouldn't put up with Bojack's shit for a second.  He'd be lucky to live through the first time he dicked her over.  And where is this supposed intuitive nature?  She's entirely focused on people and people things.  I don't think she once says anything remotely abstract?  \n\nI also think Diane is an INFJ.  INTPs running around promoting social justice through raising awareness and shit?  Yeah... how the fuck did the author think that made sense?  Fe is LAST for INTPs. LAST.  
1	Hmmm... I don't agree with most of the typings. Bojack is not an ENTP. I think he's your classic unhealthy ESFP. Also, Todd seems more INFP than ENFP. Not 100% sure about Diane though, but it's the only typing I could agree with that article (that and the estp girl whose name I cant remember atm) 
236	Fi users vs Ti users	
51	This sounds like INxP vs ENxP to me. 
29	Eh idk, I'm an entp and it's still pretty shitty to have nobody give a shit about the things you see as important
7	How is this Fi vs. Ti?
7	1. 20s\n2. 30s
6	This is just something I’ve noticed among my NFP Friends vs me. 
7	Inaccurate... Ti users also care (as much as they (or anyone) would like to be invincible...)\n\nTi users consciously use "Fe," developed sooner or later in life.\n\nFe cares about others' opinions.\n\n(Vulnerable moments will hit every individual, and the quest to develop an invincible narrative, "Ti users: nobody gives a..." is folly)\n\n\*If it's interpreted as a Ti user excited about the freedom posed by nobody caring (ie. Fe is not restraining them in any fashion), it's understandable.
5	be ashamed because this post is shit
4	My experience with this is odd, on the one hand I hate apathy more than almost any other response because it makes it impossible to communicate or get anywhere, even straight up attacks can be engaged with while apathy is just nothing. But on the other hand, it doesn't really get me down because I feel like it's always possible to make people care and show them why things are important if I figure out the right way.
3	Me at the bottom giving my friends advice on how to not be self conscious when in a new/uncomfortable situation.
3	The problem is that worldview 1 is true for a lot of important issues that we could resolve with some collective effort while worldview 2 is not true when it comes to things like whether I want to do acid or not. The law would care a lot if they found out about it.
2	It’s obviously a perspective thing because I don’t know in what way we’re thinking about people not giving a shit? 😂 When we’re talking about nobody giving a shit, what’s the context? Feel like I’m totally missing an obvious point...
2	I think for Fi users they're more stages than categories.
1	DISAGREE!\n\nMain reason being that for MANY things if they don't get BETTER, eventually everything is going down, be AWFUL and affect everyone, making EVERYONE suffer, **including ENTPs** \n\nDo you want to by not care now, and suffer later on? That's the question!\n\nI can tell you as an ENTP, I rather give a LOT shit about it SO I do NOT suffer the WORST later on.\n\nOf course, if I don't think I will be suffering worse later on then it really doesn't matter. It's just comes down to what extent on what's happening\n\nObviously, not everything has the same degree of impact on how we may suffer...\n\n\nExamples - \n\nI WILL give a shit on what Trump does. He causing my suffering IS likely!\n\nI WILL NOT give any shit on what Kim Kardashian does! She causing my suffering (at least not currently) is NOT likely.
21	The moment I knew I was ENTP	This happened a few weeks ago. Looking back it makes me laugh. I think “classic” and also... “you idiot”. \n\nI was dating this girl and we were chatting. She mentioned something about how sex slavery is bad and something should be done about it. I was like “weeeellllllllll... should we though?” . I couldn’t help myself, I mean I had a few drinks, but I was already down the rabbit hole so I just had to see it through. \n\nIt got worse though. We started talking about slavery... and obviously that’s a bad thing, but, not that night. Apparently some people are better off being slaves than having unlimited choices. Why do I do this to myself?\n\nWhen ever something controversial comes up it’s like I’m a vampire. Like one of those vampires that only drinks pig blood but sees a bleeding loved one and has to resist all urges to kill them. As soon as something controversial comes up it’s the same thing. Especially at work, I almost debated with a peer who is also a woman about abortion. I was very careful but man could that have gone terribly wrong. \n\n\n
14	Just because you like to debate abstract topics doesn’t mean you’re an ENTP....
4	You played into a dangerous taboo. I use the term “restricted freedom”  when I play devils advocate for slavery and conservative politics. You gotta be careful not to aim at your feet when discussing controversial topics.
7	Im truly surprised this doesnt ended with a tale about Bdsm and how now u have a sex slave.
3	If you play devil's advocate for shitty positions like those simply to play troll and lack good arguments to back it up, you'll come out looking like an annoying shit-stiring piece of soggy toilet paper who just wants to cause arguments with unwilling people for absolutely no reason, not even for your own intellectual gain.
1	I'm ENFP and do this frequently. Even when I share the viewpoint. Could just be Ne. 
1	That's Ne, not Ti.
5	Any ENTP’s in Cyber?	Quite simple really. I reckon I may be one of the above - is work in Cyber Security  a good fit for someone who is an ENTP. \n\nIs is different every day, enough Novelty to keep the interest - big picture thinking etc. \n\nCheers!
1	Like every job or Industry it depends.\n\nYou can get very repetitive jobs like you can end up with as an analyst in a soc, or more unique like incident response, or security engineer.\n\nIt can be highly social like security consultant, or fairly antisocial like ethical hacker.\n\nIt will take 3-5 years to get established in the industry so you have to like cyber.
1	Working on Cyber Security sounds fun. I'd guess the NeTi combo is suited for that kind of tasks.
4	Whats your enneagram and how does it affect you?	As you can tell from my flair, im an 8w7. My tritype specifically is 873 and my 7 wing is strong. Im a lot like a 7w8 ENTP but the difference is that i'm usually more assertive, competitive, and materialistic in many cases as 8 is dominant. For an 8 though I am quite laid back, and love doing things just for fun and adventure sometimes. Strong 7 wing is awesome :D.\n\n&#x200B;
13	I'm a 6w9 with a tritype of 420. As a 6w9 ENTP I tend to be sexier than most other ENTPs and intimately focused on sex. Some may say I'm instead an ESTP, where the S stands for Sex but I'm just an ENTP 6w9.\n\nMy tritype makes me more laid back. It really highlights the ExTP nature of me. So you take my 6w9 and mesh it with my 420, you get an ENTP with a strongly developed Sex function. My N is dominant because I get a lot ideas from my 420 tritype. \n\nI long for the day to meet a fresh young 666 tritype ENTP. It'd be nice if she were a 9w6 type who branched into the 666 tritype. Her 666 would amplify her chaotic ENTP-ness and the 9w6 is the perfect match for my 6w9 because our wings will be mirror images. It'll be like winging out with a mirror only the mirror is your hot enneagramate. It's like a soul mate, only it's tractable via childhood. 
6	Yo. Fight me is my catch phrase, and fight me is how I live my live since I’m needlessly aggressive with random strangers in my way on the street. \n\nI’m aggressive, hate weakness, have a big boisterous personality, and an otherwise a stereotypical Jewish mom before eveningbeing a mom. \n\n
3	7w8 with tritype 783. I'm generally just laid back and chill, but I have no problem being assertive.
3	8w7, 873 as you are. It's a pretty cool experience being an ENTP and 8w7, very contradictory and confusing for others to witness.\n\nIt basically results in me being really stubborn in the face of group think, but it is most noticeable with people I really care about. Even they will see my reluctance to surrender my "sovereignty".\n\nLuckily I am very honest, so people work me out pretty quickly and don't take offence. 
3	Boyfriend ENTP is 854 sx/sp. It's bad. Very dark, withdrawn and aggressive mixed with general ENTPness. Doesn't help with first impressions. Always plays devils advocate in a somewhat emotionless and low key malicious way with everyone. Thankfully the Ne in him gives him incredible moments of enthusiasm and the 4 makes him deeply creative so he is a wonderful talent but solitude is a side effect despite his need to connect with others, he's somewhat pre disposed not to. 
2	even winged 9 here. idk if the assessment is even right. but i can see that i‘m paying more attention to harmony (9) than some entps. also having 9w1 and 9w8 even winged means i‘m pretty assertive and idealistic in my harmony making too i guess, haven‘t read about it ha
2	I'm a 3w2 ENTP. Im a master at lying, manipulating, smooth talk, or basically anything involving speaking. Im also very charming. If you attempt to debate with me I will take ur words, shred them up, and make you sound like anything I want lol. 
2	7w8, not sure if it does
2	8w7. Defiant to the end on my opinions and ideals. Often adopt a tough exterior to deal with life. Most who don't like me see me as scary. I don't give a single shit. My real friends know me as a friend who'll truly stick up for them if needed. Also love physical exertion quite a bit.
1	Where did you find your enneagram 
8	Entp and type of flirting	What type of flirting do you use when dating/seeing somebody or just generally going on dates? I personally use teasing or playfully insulting the other person as my main way of flirting.  
11	I would expect NeTi to use contextual* humour and pepper in some relevant cultural references. Making a joke out of something said *earlier* in the conversation by tying it in to the current subject at  hand is a skill that's right in the wheelhouse of NeTi. \n\nThat kind of humour isn't just used for their own enjoyment though. I think one of the purposes is to gain an idea of the other party's sense of humour and if they're catching the jokes that the ENTP is saying. So, it's essentially a litmus test for compatibility (not that revolutionary of a tactic, I know. But, I think NeTi *really* values others that can understand not just their humour, but follow it up with another joke/tangent). \n\n> teasing or playfully insulting the other person\n\nYeah, I think NeTi does do this, but only if the other party is comfortable with it. I don't think they would start teasing the other person right off the bat on say, the first date. Some people are not comfortable with that way of flirting, while others don't mind, but won't reciprocate. \n\nedit: by contextual I mean in terms of Ne (not Se) by tying two not apparently obvious things together and making it humourous.
6	I classify the playful insulting under Te flirting.  It's playing with the Te fixation on dominance hierarchies.  I don't initiate that sort of flirting ever.  I throw shade BACK at Te users.  \n\nI do throw shade at people once I am already intimate with them in some way, for sure.  We've gotta be tight already though.  \n\nI think I primarily avoid throwing shade until i'm really close with someone because I UNINTENTIONALLY throw so much shade just by forgetting to consider how what I'm saying might impact people emotionally.  I'm self conscious about my super power of pissing people off (by forgetting to use Fe), and actively work to avoid it.  \n\nIf anything, flirting for me is WAY more complimentary.  And it's very direct.  
6	I usually gather whatever straw and twigs I can find and demonstrate my ability to make a nest. After which I will dance using one leg (though sometimes two if this is a Tinder like situation) and typically then preform my mating call of "I'm better than you, this is your only chance!".
4	i literally don’t/can’t flirt at all. am i even ENTP? LLoooollll
2	Imma make it short and efficient chief. \n\nIRL:\nDiscussing my interests while throwing offensive and controversial conversational shitposts in between and waiting for her to catch them. \n\nE.g.: I find the MBTI personality type model to be a quite fascinating tool to identify human behavior with, tho God is an illusion and we're all gonna die anyway. (Or a contextual joke referencing science/philosophy/history/memes and/or pop culture.)\n\nOnline:\nInitiating the convo with an absurd meme. Dropping a caption on it as well and waiting for a reaction. If the reaction was favorable(a.k.a. she got it and sent me another meme, or challenged me) I keep her around. If she asks me to explain the joke.....yeah no. \n\n\n
1	Some light teasing is my MO as well, although I'm also pretty OTT with the compliments. I don't know! It's been a while since I've flirted with anyone other than my SO, and I love overdoing it with the compliments because he's an ISTJ who totally does not "get" all that stuff - so it ticks off my pet box of messing with him just a little ;) I like to watch him squirm. 
5	Software Developer Jobs Will Increase Through 2026	
3	This is just a prediction based on past performance and models.\n\nIf a "black swan event" occurs (which it eventually will), there will be limited need for the majority of software developers.\n\nSoftware developers are employed in the tech industry, and the tech industry serves customers/clients. \n\nIf a financial storm occurs (as an example of a "black swan event"), many tech companies will have clients/customers unable to continue paying for services, coupled with investors attempting to exit tech stocks, it will collapse the tech industry.\n\nThe tech rush currently ongoing may simply be another "gold rush."
2	I really like being one.  If you're trying to figure out a career I suggest looking into it!  
11	Entp bordem and depressions/ feeling annoyed, kind of leave me alone mind set.	Why are these emotions easily accessible for my brain? It just easy to feel this way. Is it Entp thing or my $%#%$? 
4	I feel the same way. I dont know man. 
2	Idk my guess is we neeeed stimulation or 2 socialize and without it i guess we get super bored which leads 2 what u described. idk lol i relate though
1	Can relate. I now call this recharge mode and just roll with it. Music/Reading/Theorycrafting/Creating usually snaps me out of it eventually.\n\nI think it’s our Ne rejecting the mundane/predictable/unchallanging aspects of our life and reality in general. Ne has a real need for New and Change. I could(did)hypothesise more but that would probably be derailing and topic hopping into other areas.
6	Guys!!! I need all the help from all the intelligent ENTPs.	Whats the best comeback or reply to someone who said "No one asked?"
34	“Someone should have” 
10	Yo mom
9	"You didn't ask because you knew it would destroy  your argument."
6	No one had to...\n\nThat’s fine, now where do we go from here...\n\nI said what I said...\n\nYou seem upset... (even if they don’t)
5	Irrelevant. Please stay on topic.\n\nor\n\nObviously. Movin' on...!\n\nor\n\nWas that not clear? I can dumb it down for you. \n
3	Do people tell you this a lot?
3	No u
3	"I injected you with AIDS while you were sleeping last night"
2	The solution is not to engage these kinds of people. Learn that you can't convince them, they live in a different world and do not care about facts or reasoning. Any form of responsiveness means you look salty and "lose".
2	"No one asked."\n\n"But I just did."
2	I win.
1	Hey, Entp are not good handling passive respond so you need to practice otherwise it will eat you alive. But for your case, act like you don't know and say hmmm.., " I thought we were confused about this topic."we not you, play damn. 
1	You did
9	Do you feel the need to justify/ defend yourself? If so, how much?	If someone accuses you of something with false claims, do you have the urge to defend/ justify yourself?\n\nHow much do you care?\n\nDo you get agressive?\n\nDoes it differ from situation to situation?\n
17	I’m extremely defensive a lot of the time - I often feel the need to explain or justify my actions and I have an argument for why my path is the right one. It’s kinda tiring sometimes because I don’t do things with no strings attached ever - the stuff I do is always way overthought. \n  \nEdit: this is a comment justifying how often I justify my actions smh 
6	It’s all situational.  \nWill I gain anything from clearing my name, do I really care about this person’s opinion, is this even worth opening my mouth...\n\nOnly times I defend myself are when my parents get mad at me for being truthful.  I live with all SFs, and sometimes brutal truths can be a bit too “rude”, for them.\nOr if I don’t defend myself I’ll fall victim to some sort of social scrutiny and be treated as some sort of fucking leper.\n\nAs for aggression, I never get aggressive with my family.  It’s a relationship with the level of stupidity in the accusation.  The more absurd the statement is the more aggressive I will get.
2	Don't fall for the trap.  If I can get away with it, I'll always fire back with offense intended to get them on the defense. 
1	Not as much to defend myself as proving theyre saying stupid things. Many times people see it as defending myself or others and get mad when I "defend" somebody they dislike.
1	It’s very situational.\n\nI tend not to care what others think or say about me most of the time. Unless what is said about me is completely ludicrous, I’m not gonna defend myself.\n\nNow in that scenario I don’t believe I get very aggressive. I’m pretty good at keeping a level head, though I can start to feel some wrath boilin’. \n\n
1	Yeah, I'm not one of those stupid characters in teen dramas who let rumors stir because they don't want to be confrontational. \n\nIf you want to have as much control over your rep as you can, you be gotta be willing to clear the air about false things.
1	Natrually yes. To the point I would often not realise I was being trolled and make a fool out of myself by taking things to seriously! \n\nAs I’ve aged and learnt about personality and better improved my Fe this happens less. However alot of people in and through-out my life have used me as a scapegoat or projection punching bag. I’ve taken alot of blame. \n\nIf it’s blatent lies and impacts others I’ll more often than not viciously defend myself. If only implicating me Ill probably shrug it off and shut it down by not giving any real power to the attack. \n\nIf it’s half true I’ll only rationalise with others implicated who I know will back my side, or a 3rd party. Then Ill strategically make moves that usually end up with someone feeling/looking like a dick and being cut out of my inner circle. 
1	If someone attempts to put me on the defensive, I'll immediately defuse the situation, usually by doing something unpredictable. Once everyone's flustered, I go on the offensive if necessary to quash any misgivings. 
1	yes, too fucking much, ugh\n\nwhen that happens I come up with at least three whole explanations justifying what happened in my mind, and always end up sighing and saying "ok." instead.\n\nThough, when a stranger does it with clear malevolence, like shouting lies to a whole room, I quickly jump out of wherever I am and contemplate beating the shit out of them, only to hold in control and actually think about the situation instead. I'm not really proud of any of this.
2	ENTP - but not quite..	I’ve been struggling with typing myself for about 18 months and counting now, and I have no idea whether I’m INTP or ENTP. \n\nThe stressful thing about the ordeal is that the arrangement of both types’ functions are not that different, with INTP as Ti-Ne-Si-Fe, and ENTP as Ne-Ti-Fe-Si.\n\nDue to my Ne and Ti being developed to nearly the same degree, I found that I relied on both functions in an almost exact 1:1 ratio, depending on the requirements of different situations. \n\n\nMy Si and Fe face the same situation; both Si and Fe does serve me well occasionally, and when I’m emotionally stressed, the effects of them both manifest in proportionate intensity. \n\n\nIs it possible to fall in between ENTP and INTP, since the placement of the functions are so similar? 
1	> Due to my Ne and Ti being developed to nearly the same degree, I found that I relied on both functions in an almost exact 1:1 ratio, depending on the requirements of different situations.\n\n> My Si and Fe face the same situation; both Si and Fe does serve me well occasionally, and when I’m emotionally stressed, the effects of them both manifest in proportionate intensity.\n\nCan you elaborate on this? How do they affect you in different scenarios? And no in terms of the model one cannot fall between two types. Although you *could* act as an INTP in certain situations, but not for a significant amount of time. 
1	Does dressing up and going to a party sound fun to you? 
1	Do you ramble aloud around new people
1	Everything’s on a spectrum. I don’t think anyone completely falls into a neat box with a personality label. \n\nFor example, I’m an ‘entp’ though if I look at my results on the 16personalities test I sit closer to the middle in regards to thinking vs feeling, meaning I could easily be typed as an ‘enfp’. I display traits for both personality types, but also believe I fit into neither. \n\nThe mbti is a great guide for understanding cognitive processing, but it isn’t gospel. 
1	For what it's worth, you sound more like an INTP.

5	INTP or INFP (or any other type)	 \n\nHi guys,\n\nso I've been studying MBTI and Jungian psychology for a while now and I'm stuck, since I can't determinate if I'm an INTP or INFP or any other type. I'm 17 years old guy, it that helps.\n\n* I'm pretty sure of the Ne-Si and I think that maybe I have stronger Si, in other words, I'm pretty nostalgic. It's one of the things, that makes me cry, besides relationships and really deep movies. I can recreate an older experience, or the feeling I got from it (mostly recreating dates with my ex in my head). Also under stress, or when I have to come up with a solution in a short time my mind switches to "come on! what have worked in the past? Think!". But at the same time I like change.\n* I tend to be idealistic, I have this dream in my mind, that sometime in future, everything will work out, and I'll have a stable job and a lovely family and it's a goal I want to accomplish. I've been told that I attract the most "autistic"(meant as an insult, not a diagnosis), flawed people around. Also, for idealism, for example, I like my school, my job, my boss and his attitude (he's a phlegmatic to heart), even though they have their flaws, I'm okay with them. And people around me constantly b\*tch about those things. Like yes, I too sometimes like to complain, but most of the time my mind is like "if you've chosen to do this, please suffer in silence". For example one night my friend from school was constatly complaining about our school and teachers, even those that are really great, and I didn't have any problem saying with a cold expression on my face, that if she cant handle it, she should quit and go study tailoring, but if she wants to do this, then she should just shut up and let it be. She was offended by it, very unexpectedly.\n* I hate overly emotional people that tend to cry after every slightest insult. Then I have the urge to apologize, and I dont like that. Also I cant stand people, who really forcefully try to be funny, but they just ain't. I cant stand them. And also stubborn close-minded people.\n* I'm pretty short-tempered, especially, when somebody micro-manages me, or speaks againts my way of doing things. I tend to explode, but I use to cool down in pretty short time and sometimes even regret it. Sometimes, when somebody really grinds my gears, I tend to explode and say every reason why he's horrible and stupid. Sometimes I do it I regret that, sometimes I do, I'm proud of it, but it happens like once every 2 years or so.\n* I've been told, that I have the ability to make people talk about things, that really matter for them, even complete strangers crack opened in front of me, but then I dont know how to emotionally support them, I'm not empathetic. Most of the time, if they open up while messaging, I tend to write a really long message, covered in beautiful words, that offers a solution. But when they come to me again and again and again with the same exact problem, I dont have anything new to say to them, because my last solution is, in my view, still great.\n* But this applies only when Im dealing with other people's feelings. When I deal with mine I tend to be an emotional mess. I've found out that writing poems and essays about the person tends to really help me, and when I've shown them to my friends, they didn't believe that I have written that, because in their eyes it was really great and romantic and stuff like that.\n* I'm a really romantic person and I think it's because in my early teen years, my mother forced me to watch romantic movies with her every weekend, until I started to enjoy it. And my soul animal is probably a crying teenage girl.\n* I tend to go out of my way to help others most of the time. I even remember learning how to control a completely new program, while I was going to town to meet my friends, and at the same time explaining how to control it to my other friend on my phone, since she couldn't understand it (and use google properly for that matter, but it doesnt matter, I liked to offer her help)\n* I've been told that Im overly critical about other people, but cant handle critisism myself, but I dont think thats true.\n* Sometimes people ask me why I'm so negative, but most of the time, Im just discussing every possibility, and they've just heard the most horrible one. I call it realism.\n* I tend to brag about things.\n* I'm a meme-lover, day-dreamer, tend to miss details in the physical world around me and value alone time as much as time spend with others and have tend to not miss social gatherings.\n* I'm perfectionist, highly critical towards myself, and always have been straight-A student, because learning came always natural for me. I also don't have any problem cheating on the test in order to get the best results, even though I see cheating just as a backup plan.\n* I can't hide any of my emotions, when I'm flirting I'm the last person that realizes it and I dont have any problem opening up to a complete stranger.\n* I'm either talkative and expressive as hell (which happens most of the time, especially around my friends) or I'm reserved and quiet.\n* I'm accidentaly rude to authorities and waitresses.\n* I can seem to be pretty insensitive. For example, when I was on a school trip to Auschwitz, after the tour, most of the people were moved and silent. But me? I was deciding what Im going to eat, while I was thinking about every innapropriate joke about jews. Yeah, I was moved too, and the things nazis have done were horrible, but my reaction to deal with serious topics, unless its talking about relationship, is to make fun of them. I think of it as some sort of defense mechanism.\n* Most of the time I have a problem keeping secrets. I either dont realize it was a secret and even if I do and I really try to keep it, it somehow slips out of my mouth in some cue.\n* When I start explaining something, I use my whole body to do it. I'm a visual thinker, my mind tends to thing about everything: concepts, math problems, etc. in images, and using my hands helps me to describe it.\n* I like to be the grey mouse, in clothing, in music style (for example I have a "socially-acceptable" playlist, to which I don't listen to) and in many other different things and I want to be liked.\n* When I want to buy new cloth, I tend to sends pictures of it to my friends in order for them to choose what suits me the best, since I cant decide this myself.\n* I have this friend of mine, that's like the complete opposite of me in his opinions, and we use to argue about everything and that's probably the thing, that our friendship is built on. Most of the time it's really fun, but when we go on a week trip together somewhere, at the end of it, when Im really tired, I tend to shout on him something like "why cant u just be normal" when he still tries to disagree on everything. He is somewhat used to it and accepts it. I sometimes say a ridiculous idea to him, that we start to discussing it, which goes like me: \*says idea\* ... yes, but....yes, but...yes, but...fine, you are right. And because of that some people make fun of me, since they think that I agree with him on everything.\n* I dont have problem meeting new people. I tend to fit everywhere and nowhere at the same time, but I really wouldn't say that I'm popular. In new groups, I use to find someone, to whom Ill be his companion. Most of the time its somebody, who made the first move, since I'm somehow too shy for that and its something I want to change about myself.\n* I somehow have the ability to synchronize with person. For example, even though me and my best friend are not the same, we have the same though proceses, same taste in woman and design. We didnt have that before and our attitudes are completely different. We are in a bromance, I think.\n* I know a heck lot of people, but my circle of friends is really, really small. I dont burn the bridges with other people, I just forget to maintain them. My thought process is like "okay, so because u havent contacted me in the first place, I dont want to bother you."\n* I'm the extrovert of the introverts and the introvert of the extroverts. If I have the feeling, that my point of view will be listened too, I dont have any problem expressing it or lead the conversation, and most of the time I'm the loudest one around. But when I'm in a different setting of people, I can be really quiet, tend to just sit and listen to them for hours at a time, without saying much.\n* Im judgemental about people even though I dont want to, but most of the time I create my opinion about somebody (like hes a musician, hes a technician and that person is a sportsman) from just looking at them or speaking to them for few minutes. Im wrong sometimes, but Im right most of the time. I thought most people do this, but then I found out, that for some, it isnt natural at all.\n* I feel like I'm a walking contradiction. I'm working as a swimming instructor, love playing violin, writes poems, love technology, is good at maths, loves fantasy and video games, love talking about relationships (some friends of my make fun of this and say that Im a woman, because there are "sparks inside my eyes" every time someone starts discussing relationships), works with design and our schools yearbook, newly like psychology (I was obsessivly researching about it for past two months) and I kinda want to see how it all works out.\n* I'm really good with kids, and I have been working with them for past 4 years. I would probably study pedagogy, but in my country that job is poorly paid, so I'm going to study informatics, because much better paid and I like it and understand it.\n* With everything I do, I tend to have a all-or-nothing attitude. For example I either binge-watch a TV series, or don't watch it at all. For me, to start something, most of the time, I need to have the mood to finish it right here and there, or I won't even start\n* I really suck at arguing, since I tend to speak before I think and then somehow contradict myself in every other sentence and cant back my opinions, which in my view contradicts with this ENTP sterotype. And arguing with my ex was like saying a statement, then apologizing for it. I was like a puppy. Until I got really mad about her and cut her out of my life. I still have feelings for her, but in order to secure myself, I just dont want her in my life at all.\n* I'm indecisive and second-guess all my choices and its the other reason, why some of my friends say that Im a woman\n* Most of the time in order to fully understand something, I tend to study about it, understand it with my own logic, then discuss it with somebody in order for my logic to be fixed by the other person's point of view.\n* I don't think of myself as creative. When I paint, I like to capture reality or re-paint, copy, someone else's work. I dont come up with new ways and methods to do something. Most of the time, when Im presented to a system I tend to augment it in my own way that I thing is the best, but it really isnt a new way, just slightly different. And when I come with something like this, I always stick to it. For example, I used to submit a laboratory report (describing the experiment) every month, and I used to do it in the exaxt same way - the method, font, etc for three years.\n* I use to create my own routine and way of doing things and I somehow like it this way. For example Im eating the same musli with milk for breakfast for past 6 years or I created my own way of teaching kids swimming, augmenting things I've learned on a course, and I think that its pretty routine work now, but it still isnt, cause every kid does different set of mistakes and u have to adjust it to them. Like the scheme is pretty much the same, or the exercices, but u still adjust it and correct different mistakes on every child. I most of the time tend to be strict, in order for kids to improve, but I dont have any problem playing stupid games with them and actually enjoy it.\n* I think that Im a bad person, full of flaws, but I kinda like it, since at least my life is interesting this way. Also I want to fix them.\n* I've been tested for ADHD, since our school psychologist thought I have it, but negatively\n* I have written this in one session\n\nI would really apreciate your help, because I can easily manipulate most of the MBTI test, so I cant trust them, and on the 16personalities test, which is completely wrong in my view, because it measures the letters, not cognitive functions. I've got 50% on almost every letter.\n\nThanks for your help, I apreciate, if you have read everything I had written.\n\nSorry for my english
4	I didnt even read all of that but from what I skimmed you sound a lot like my infp gf. \n\nYou actually notice that much about yourself bro? \n\nI cant even imagine what thats like. I know like 3 things about myself lmao
2	You seem INFP out of the two options given. You’re painfully self aware. 
2	INFP, you sound a lot like my INFP girlfriend as well. And. You know.. so much about your identity. 
25	Favorite emotion. Tell me.	I can't find the For Fun flair so you'll have to deal with the "General" flair. AND my laziness in adding quotes around "For Fun" (I didn't think of it at the time and I would rather make this joke than to go fix it)\n\nOkay. Favorite emotion to see in others (or yourself). Don't be pretentious. Why do you like that emotion? Or why do you prefer that one over another?\n\nHere's mine: Frustration. Why? Because it's not annoying to see someone frustrated. It's annoying to see someone angry and annoying to notice someone being passive-aggressive. \n\nWhen I'm frustrated, I start laughing because I know I can deal with the issues and I know I'm making a big deal about nothing serious. \n\nEdit: sound -> around. Also, this is a *very* normal discussion\n\nEdit too: 2 \n\nGuys/other-gender-in-the-plural-form, c'mon. This is extremely seriousness happening at the moment...
58	Sigh...This shit is why people think ENTPs are psychopaths...
33	Horny
28	Fascination, i want to see your eyes spark up as you delve into that wikipedia page and then gush about ancient mythology/3D printing/whatever your personal rabbit hole is*. Give me that mad dopamine rush of finding an awesome new hobby and diving face first into it. I want to see you full of life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* as long as it isnt too sinister
13	Purple, because it's not yellow.
14	Contentment.\n\nThe kind of feeling you get after a good meal, or in a warm bath. It's a good mixture of happiness and relaxation, while not being too extreme of an emotion. It's my favourite emotion to see others have and to feel.
14	1) In love. Or some kinda oxytocin spike. Like on a low level cuddling with someone after sex, on a higher level cuddling with the person you’re in love with after a perfect day together. It’s bliss, and peace\n\n2) the surge of electric intuition shocking your brain with an ‘Aha!’ idea, and the moments following. 
11	Happy. Why would it be anything else? (Other than horny)\n\nIf others are happy it means we haven't done anything stupid yet 😂
10	Justice ✊😈
7	Inspired? Is that an emotion? I like seeing people inspired as It affirms my natrual  infectous inspiration  and gives me a sense of a clear cut role in a social setting. \n\nMost of the time I’m lost as to what my actual role in the party is, as a hypermanic jack of all trades chameleon. I find that I even have odd days where  people(whom usually are too busy being boring conformists and projecting there values on others) seek me out for this as if they subconciously know many great things start with that Zap! of enthuesiastic optimism I deliver on the regular. \n\nHowever other times they’re just aware of my tendency to solve other peoples problems and forget about my own and are trying to take advantage of this.  I have become a real dick in pursuit of filtering out the genuine seekers of truth and higher principles from the retards. Its very circumstancial.
5	Extreme longing. It's easy to feel compelled to make creative things out of it. Any other emotion results in literally nothing because of goddamn procrastination.\n\nThe best *feeling* one is happiness, duh lmao\n\nIn others I like seeing excitement.
4	Awe. It's got a way of overwhelming the feelings of doubt/reluctance and making people work together. I like people working together. I like awe.\n\nAlso, horny was taken.
4	I love feeling nostalgic. It's a beautiful kind of pain, to long for things once known and cherished, but are now unattainable.  Knowing how you felt in a moment, and how you can never feel that way again. It's the main thing I tap into to write songs.
3	Interesting, I like being frustrated too.  I like it when people do things that bother me, or when people mess up in a way where I might face some consequences. I like it when there's some injustice, probably because it poses a challenge. \n\n&#x200B;
3	Peaceful, especially when focused
3	Makes sense... since frustration is a constant around ENTP friends; they just keep laughing though and get more excited. 
3	Excited. I love it when people’s eyes light up when they’re talking about something they love or when they’re greeted with a good surprise 
3	Adoration. I find it so pleasing when people are head over heels for you.
3	acceptance. the feeling when a group of people express their liking to you. and you feel accepted and loved. honestly only times i am literally jumping from happiness inside\n\ni love to see in others when they‘re overcome by joy after having met someone they were missing for a long time
3	Amusement. Determination. That kind of mischievous glint people get when considering doing something bad. Or that blasé candor other people get when considering doing something bad. I love seeing people slightly anxious and vulnerable so I can help reassure them. I like that moment in people where you’ve said something funny and true enough that their public persona drops a little and you connect. And, you know, lust. \n\nI’m a Fe whore.
3	Pleasure.
2	Surprise, because who doesn't love a good surprise? Especially when some people can be very predictable🙄
2	In women, pride. For men, frustration. For myself, i would rather just be in a state of perfect mindfulness, even tho it’s not often that I am in that state. 
2	LOL i start laughing to when i get frustrated. But when my s/o sounds passive aggressive i get sort of the same way, really blunt as well. My favourite emotion to see in others is happiness. Myself to but thats usually not the case..
2	I’m always impressed with genuine passion. Its really cool to hear someone talk about what makes them tick, justified or not (most of the time)
2	Motivation. Why? Because I can do what I want and I have will to accomplish what I want.
2	Fearless with I don't give a $#%@# attitude b/c it helps be myself around them. 
1	Catharsis. When you've walked the walk, you've made it to your destination, you've overcome your struggles, and you find peace and satisfaction in knowing that you weathered the storm.
1	In myself? Curiosity. Why? Its the only time I feel alive.\n\nIn others? Frustration and engagement. 
4	Favorite board, card, or table top RPG's?	What are your favorite board, card, and/or table top RPG's?\n\n(Vampire the Masquerade, Mage Knight, and Gloom of Kilforth for me.)
3	Divinity Original Sin 2 was really good. D&D I liked with my original group, but I haven't managed to find a good group since that has a great dynamic.
2	I really like this game :\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Czech-Games-00036CGE-Codenames-Pictures/dp/B01HT9DERU/ref=sr\_1\_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1546709846&sr=8-6&keywords=secret+code](https://www.amazon.com/Czech-Games-00036CGE-Codenames-Pictures/dp/B01HT9DERU/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1546709846&sr=8-6&keywords=secret+code)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nU get a set of pictures at random and a table with some squares, and u need to tell the other player which cars to pick without him picking the trap cards if he picks one of the trap cards u loose, so the point is to make connections between difernt pictures and using one word and 1 number make ur partnet pick the number of card related to that word or concept, is perfect for Ne doms.\n\nIs not exactly the version i linked but in Spanish is this one:\n\n[https://www.amazon.es/Devir-Código-Secreto-única-Bgcosed/dp/B07BKB3R9G/ref=pd\_sbs\_21\_4?\_encoding=UTF8&pd\_rd\_i=B07BKB3R9G&pd\_rd\_r=f29ceca2-1110-11e9-a9fe-5926893675db&pd\_rd\_w=ffcI0&pd\_rd\_wg=5Lma1&pf\_rd\_p=544b4b06-0fdf-4032-855d-b06c1b9b547a&pf\_rd\_r=MS1RETCC2WABWFVTYYVZ&psc=1&refRID=MS1RETCC2WABWFVTYYVZ](https://www.amazon.es/Devir-Código-Secreto-única-Bgcosed/dp/B07BKB3R9G/ref=pd_sbs_21_4?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07BKB3R9G&pd_rd_r=f29ceca2-1110-11e9-a9fe-5926893675db&pd_rd_w=ffcI0&pd_rd_wg=5Lma1&pf_rd_p=544b4b06-0fdf-4032-855d-b06c1b9b547a&pf_rd_r=MS1RETCC2WABWFVTYYVZ&psc=1&refRID=MS1RETCC2WABWFVTYYVZ)\n\nI dont know where u can find it in english, i just go to a bar here, order a beer and that bar has a lot of table top games of diferent types.I havent played table top rpgs so i dont know.
115	My daughter says I ruined the game Guess Who.	
26	I always play it with preconceptions. "does he look like a hard worker?" "do you think she's hot?" that makes the game a lot more challenging. You have to assess what they other one thinks of people. 
9	You don't even have a daughter though ,,?!
8	pretty much. it's not a "game" any more when the player fully understands the whole process in and around it. an essential element of a fun game include learning, so if we explicate the whole of what can be learned to the player, then it's no longer much fun to go through the exploration. it's like caving in a cave when you have a 100% accurate map of the whole thing. why do it? or like seeing the whole play tree in chess, then chess would no longer be any fun.\n
3	You can't ask if he is black and wearing glasses that's two questions
2	Lol brilliant logic tree. Reminds me of computer science problem solving. 
1	Bandersnatch?
1	Loooool
6	Favorite comedian?	I don't think this is 100% related to MBTI, but then again maybe it is. MBTI is all about how we perceive the world, and comedy is a play on that. So what are some of your favorites?
11	Dave Chappelle has been my favorite for a long time. Carlin is probably 2nd. A myriad could be 3rd depending on timing, but I've consistently found those 2 funny.
7	Big fan of Bo Burnham for his commentary and ability to talk about mental health, but his most recent special is more performance art than comedy. Of course Dave Chapelle as well.
7	Doug Stanhope, Fankie Boyle and Charlie Brookers "Wipe" episodes 
6	john mulaney\n\nbill burr\n\ntom segura\n\ngeorge carlin (only read a book of his admittedly)\n\nlouis ck has some good stuff sometimes a bit cringe 
4	Carlin, Stanhope, Bill Hicks, Louis CK (I know I know), Chapelle.
5	George Carlin. All the others suck. 
3	I've enjoyed watching some of Anthony Jeselnik's stuff a lot. \n\nYou can make it about MBTI by speculating about the favorite comedy genres of each type.
2	Chappelle, Jerrod Carmichael, Moshe Kasher, and Amir K. Probably Chappelle if I had to choose between the four. 
2	Any PFT fans? Sink and the mirror skit? Laboring under Delusions? ESTP friends suggested him and I've enjoyed every bit of his
2	Demitri Martin and Dave Chapelle are the only two i can think of atm 
2	Dave Chappelle and Bill Burr. \n\nBill’s podcast is great. 
2	Louis CK
2	Billy Connolly, Frankie Boyle & Bill Hicks.\n\nEdit: and Jim Jeffries. 
2	Chris Delia hilarious 
2	Sebastian Maniscalco is the man. I've seen him multiple times in Atlantic City. Hilarious. 
2	Patrice o' neal, RIP
2	Tom Segura and Bill Burr  \nBut also Eric from internet comment ettiquette  \nHonestly your moms house podcast is funnier than all standup pretty much
1	I've liked Bernie Mac, Eddie Griffin and Paul Rodriguez and Daniel Tosh. But there's a ton of good ones.
1	Norm Macdonald, Bill Burr, Joey Diaz, Frankie Boyle, Bob Mortimer, Lavell Crawford, Tom Segura, (early) Jim Jefferies\n\nIn my native tongue: Hans Teeuwen (has done watered down English shows in the past but they don't do his brilliance justice; if he was a native English speaker he would probably be considered as one of the - if not THE - greatest of all time) and Wim Helsen
1	Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report was fun. His new show is lame.\n\nThese days, Donald Trump? I don't know, and don't really care.\n\nThe best comedy is a side effect of something aims much higher than mere comedy. And the best jokes are definitely not the ones made by someone going through a script for a mass audience. Comedians have a veneer of edginess, but come on. They're just clowns that get paid to make people laugh.
2	Do you think he is right?	
8	This could be the case. I definitely went through a period of social awkwardness and lack of congruency. To go down the root of blaming it on my parents would make me feel like a victim. I would prefer not to do that. I think we analyze things so much, and are so focused on self-improvement, that it’s easier for ENTPs to correct issues from childhood.\n\nWith more thought, no I do not agree. Everyone takes on the customs and methods of behavior from their environment. If this was not the case, we would not have culture.
5	Looks like Ethan Klein’s fat cousin
161	Time to end procrastination!	
13	This post was made by the G2 gang
4	Can I cross post this to ADHD? Im exhausted already. Lol.
1	Procrastination is a way of nature to tell you "I'm tired of your shit, just do nothing!"
3	INFJ invading ENTP Land	I'm INFJ looking for other INFJs..., but not having much luck. A non-INFJ suggested to open my mind and consider ENTP...which he said they are good fit with INFJ.\n\nIs this true? Can the two types intermingle and talk and not clash too much?\n\nI am in a INFJ Reddit and would like to broaden my horizons. Please let me know if I should not be in this Reddit which is for ENTP.. thank you..
16	Don’t put so much weight into a self-reported test result to tell you who you can “intermingle” with. 
5	I'm really ambivalent about INFJs, personally - sometimes I love you guys; other times you frustrate the hell out of me. I think most INFJs are genuinely sweet people who want to do good in the world, and who have unique insights that NT times aren't always capable of because we're thinking too logically or "objectively". That being said, INFJs are rarely (in my experience) emotionally healthy. On a bad day, and there are too many bad days, I find them to be an emotional drain because they can't stop spiraling over whatever entirely inconsequential problem is going to ruin their life next. 
4	i think most ENTPs like INFJs until they experience their first conflict.. and vice versa. depending on how and if the conflict is resolved kinda determines longevity in my experience. 
5	I have a couple of infjs\nThe best part is the weird consciousness streams we can get into
4	INFJ and ENTP are one of the golden pairings, or so I've always heard. There's no restrictions on people joining us either, as rules are for tools lol. I've noticed that most of the clashes that occur between the types are misunderstandings of intent, usually from the INFJs perspective so just be sure to take everything with a grain of salt. We like to be sarcastic and, of course, play devils advocate so a good bit of the time what you read isn't actually their position. So keeping an open mind and if something disturbs you, opening a dialogue are probably your keys to success. Other than that, just be yourself. Most ENTPs like INFJs so don't be afraid to mingle.
2	sup
2	Hmm...I can see that happening..we do feed off each other, like a infinite loop..
2	Your not invading us, we love visitors.\nJust don't do anything suspicious like setting us up to do mundane repetitive tasks for the rest of our life.
1	That's what I'm hoping to find with another INFJ, that free association kind of flow...but then, I haven't actually talked with one in person, so I don't know if it would work..being the same...
1	That sounds very familiar for me, my hurdle is procrastinating to take action for myself and stop doing those things..I've been told that about being too much in my head and not just relax and be open...it's a struggle
3	Being an ENTP has come up in therapy (not directly) about not wanting to follow through on tasks and working on the idea of something instead. Any thoughts on why ENTPs are so bad at follow through?	See the damn title. Auto-moderator really sucks at what it does. 
12	My own simple answer would be that it's interesting to figure out the process to get to the end, but no longer interesting to actually do the work. It's the figuring things out that gets me though, not so much on the actual doing it.
11	Once you've figured out whether it will work or not, the novelty wears off and it's just a chore to complete.
7	I read that there are two types: \n- those who think the thinking is the action\n- those who think the doing is the action\n\nWe are the former.
3	This applies to any P type, and a fair few NJs.  Most INTJs are losers for example.  Hell most people by a very wide margin don't really accomplish much of anything.  Most don't travel, earn degrees, make more money than just enough (if that), etc.  Pick your metric.  We talk about the people who do interesting shit because it's interesting and aspirational, not because it's the norm.  \n\nFollow through is hard.  Was it hard for the famous entps?  Yes.  But they sucked it up and did the needful.  \n\nNe doms per jung are full of ideas and can get fixated there.  They are also prone to working on too many projects.  I have a few in the works haha.  \n\nHowever other types have other fixations.  Istjs can get stuck on their own bullshit like how life is unfair, or fritter away their time on meaningless tasks.  Do you REALLY have to repaint that wall man?  Maybe get a job instead...  Etc.  \n\nAnyways the reason you have trouble with follow through is because you personally lack grit.  Like most people.  Work on it.  
2	The idea is always more interesting than the action. We love thinking about it 
2	Maybe you should tackle this as an individual thing and not an identity personality type thing?
2	For me, there's an extent to which the follow-through can be (not always, but often) a bit mindless, or at least rote. Therefore, the follow-through is tedious because it feels like operating like an automaton. It really depends on the task. I'm always trying to find the pleasure in the follow-through. 
1	This is what im trying to solve rn for myself.  \n  \nI think on a theoretical-detailed level its about our brains not processing a certain quantity.   \n  \nSo like if something seems 'far' in time or distance we will think its infinitely hard aka impossible without lots of effort which we wanna avoid without a payoff at the end (all humans are like this).  \n  \nSo like if something seems easy or doable we dont know how easy it is but we think its as easy as can be, aka taking near 0 effort.  \n  \nSo we will flip from a infinity to a 0 difficulty rating when procrastination panic sets in and we are then able to see it as doable.   \n  \nI think other brain are able to assign a degree of difficulty with more options on the spectrum.
4	New to this community! I’m [F26ifitmatters] curious about ENTP and I have some questions. I’d be glad to get some perspective for my thoughts.	I’m sorry if I’m repeating any topics. I’m trying to keep it short! \n\nI’ve been having a lot of anxiety and depression in a past few years. I feel like it has controlled my whole life. It’s getting a bit better these days as I’m trying to figure myself out. \n\nSo I took this personality test and result was ENTP-T. As I read about this personality type my mind is blown away repeatedly. Nothing has described me more than this, ever. \n\nBut here’s where I get confused. I’m also diagnosed with ADHD, and I don’t recognize where my personality type ends and adhd takes over. \n\nDoes adhd make me entp or does entp make me adhd? Or are they completely separate things that have nothing to do with each other? If someone could explain it, like to a five year old, I would appreciate it a lot! \n\nAlso, the test result gave me the last letter -T as in turbulent. Yes, I can see myself from that part too, but I remember before my depression and all the anxiety it brought, I was very confident and open person. So do you think depression has changed my personality or has it just made “bad parts” stronger? \n\nAll and all I’m super excited about this discovery. I feel like this is my way for better. I can learn why I’m like this and try to evolve myself, instead of just blaming everything. \n\nI haven’t read enough of this topic yet, but I didn’t have patience to study more before asking!\n\n(English is not my native language, mercy)\n\n\nThank you!
7	You sound like you got typed right if it describes you that well, also since I can relate to some of the stuff you’re saying, but steer clear of 16 personalities, cuz that A or T shit is some crap they made up that has no place in real mbti. \n\nBeing ENTP makes you ADHD, but that doesn’t mean you don’t actually have ADHD. \n\nWhen you’re not confident or even depressed, yes, negative aspects of your personality will be magnified, and vice versa. Confidence is key for ENTPs, but don’t let it be arrogance, cuz we’re pretty shitty to be around when we get arrogant cuz unlike other types, we actually are the best.\n\nWith depression and lacking confidence, I just focus on brain chemicals, and physical health, which both come down to habits. It’s the difference between me feeling like shit and like my life is worthless, and me feeling like the second coming. \n\nExercise 6 days a week (pumps you full of endorphins and will help you look sexier), meditate daily, take cold showers, nofap (quit porn and masturbation), eat healthy, don’t eat sugar, intermittent fasting, no drugs or alcohol (or at least limit them as much as you can), have lots of sex, and get on your purpose and take action to make it happen. Sounds like a lot but if you implement one at a time they’ll all become natural. You do all that stuff, and you’ll feel like you just walked down from Olympus.
4	ayyy, welcome to the good side of Reddit ;)\n\n>As I read about this personality type my mind is blown away repeatedly. Nothing has described me more than this, ever.\n\nI \[M20ifitmatters\] know this feeling too well haha. Another way to get your mind blown is to do the Enneagram test, it's pretty accurate aswell ([Link to the Intro](https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/introduction), I'm 7w8 sx btw).\n\n>Does adhd make me entp or does entp make me adhd?\n\nI don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but the guy who "discovered" ADHD literally said that it's a wrong concept. I got diagnosed with it aswell when I was younger, gladly my mom was against the meds. Had a rough time in school, but it's better this way than to be reliant on meds. Curiosity + Energy = ADHD according to some doctors lol.In conclusion: ENTP makes the ADHD.\n\n>Also, the test result gave me the last letter -T as in turbulent. Yes, I can see myself from that part too, but I remember before my depression and all the anxiety it brought, I was very confident and open person. So do you think depression has changed my personality or has it just made “bad parts” stronger?\n\nHmmmmm, I don't know you but I'd say that depression doesn't really change you per se, I see it as a primarily negative state of mind. Once I started seeing it like that and focused on the positive things in live my diagnosed (!) depression went away.\n\n>I haven’t read enough of this topic yet, but I didn’t have patience to study more before asking!\n\nok, you're really an ENTP haha. Welcome in the family <3\n\n>(English is not my native language, mercy)\n\nLanguage is a tool to communicate with other people. As long as both sides understand each other it's good enough. Immer gern =)
3	As you said, this is a frequent topic so I suggest sifting through these [threads](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Fentp+ADHD&oq=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Fentp+ADHD&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.5677j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).\n\n
2	Don't think about labels like depression and ADHD too much. They are just descriptions of certain tendencies, and not well-defined diseases. \n\nOn a sidenote, as a fellow ENTP I'd advise you to take up meditation to compensate for those tendencies.
5	How could education be improved?	I’m asking myself this question a lot lately and I want to hear other ideas.\n\nWhat would you change in the current education system? And what do you think is the goal of education in general?
10	\n>What would you change in the current education system?\n\nMore teachers, smaller classes. Sort students into classes based on "learning types" and make sure the gifted students get the attention they need. \n\nAll of this costs money and other resources, so the first step would be to increase the education budget.\n\n> And what do you think is the goal of education in general?\n\nIs or should be? Because right now I'd say the goal of education is to give students a handful of essential skills (writing, calculating, a very superficial understanding of how the world works, etc.) so that they can specialize once they hit college or trade schools. \n\nI think that's fine but in general I think education should be based on the [Humboldtian model](\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldtian_model_of_higher_education?wprov=sfla1) rather than serving corporate interests. \n\nA democracy needs educated citizens who are able to think for themselves. So education should be more than just math and English. Students should also learn *how to think critically*. \n
7	Treat teachers as white collar professionals by getting rid of the unions and paying $100k a year to attract competence. \n\nAlso, re-open the vocational high schools but instead of welding and woodworking, teach computer programming, electronics, robotics, entrepreneurship, and other modern jobs for which college is for the most part a 4 year time waster.   This will keep the people who don't want to go to college (but feel they have to) out of a system where they don't belong, and allow colleges to save on having to reteach basic high school level knowledge like algebra.     
4	What do we define as a failure or a bad education system? Students who go through it and don't adequately learn the material? If so, in order to improve education, I propose we have a stricter education in place; why don't we simply exterminate the inadequate students? That way we have a 100% success rate with students who graduated from the system. And we solve the population problem. You're welcome. 
5	Watch this. I agree with Sir Ken Robinson.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zDZFcDGpL4U
2	I can only relate my own experiences, but I didn’t develop my obsession with learning until outside of school and I learned exponentially more on my own time, even about the same subjects. Probably because I could do things at my own pace, could learn through more than one method, and understood how things might benefit me. It was more intrinsically rewarding than simply following orders because you’re supposed to and following the script. \n\nI know it’s often said that schools kill creativity with rote memorization of facts, but there’s a place for that. Creativity comes from joining ideas together or relating what you learn to what you already know, which requires a knowledge base. But optimal memorization comes from periodically reconsolidating the memory, which doesn’t really happen that often when trying to rush through each unit. You end up cramming, trying to fit facts into your short term memory, with the mindset of passing a test (and you can sorta figure out how a test will look like and get good at testing, but not necessarily understand anything). Revisiting important themes and having occasional refreshers would be nice. \n\nI bombed a lot of classes in high school and early college due to undiagnosed ADHD, but the classes I did REALLY well in were ones where the teachers treated me with respect, gave me a reputation to live up to, encouraged me, and gave me chances to prove myself saying things like how I had a lot of potential if I put in the work. My worst bomb was in a class where my teacher said in front of the class that my grades were a joke, lol. Clearly expectations make a difference. \n\nCritical thinking is a big one and more implementable on a wide scale. A biology lecture I had in college for some reason decided to go in depth into critical thinking, with all sorts of examples, and talked about questioning sources, logical fallacies, and so on. I don’t think I had ever cultivated my skepticism before that course. Learn how to think more effectively and seek out the right information and evaluate things and it’s a skill you’ll carry with you everywhere. \n\nI dunno... In general I’d just like less rigidity. Maybe that’s the intention, to get you used to sitting for eight hours and doing things exactly as instructed, but you’re rarely given any reasons why learning is beneficial and enjoyable to you as a person, or given the flexibility to do things at your pace or to your strengths. You have no reason to continue to be curious outside of school. \n\nPractical life skills (e.g. budgeting) would also be good. Maybe they do teach those things now... my school didn’t. Some people argue that parents are supposed to teach you these things, but not everybody has that luxury and not everybody would think to seek it out themselves. Would save people a lot of trouble to learn these things sooner rather than later. 
2	Stop lumping children together by age. It is so arbitrary, and somehow manages to both stifle the exceptional and fail those who struggle simultaneously.
0	The goal of education is non-existent as the education itself.\n\nYou talk about self-interest, which we already possess, the ubiquitous consumerism is the highest proof of its efficiency. It involves stimulating competition, and also fear of pain, fear of boredom, every kind of fear...\n\nThose who seek knowledge won't be stopped by any system. And those who have found it will surely become a threat to it. 
-1	make system special for each personality type  
27	You guys look like you're ready for another low quality meme that describes the state of the sub.	
7	Who gives a shit about downvotes, the real problems are when fuckers start reporting you and get you banned over some little shit. I fucking hate what the internet is turning into with so many god damn cry babies.
5	Inspired by \~70% of the users of r/entp and [this carcinogenic thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/ac5ikv/saying_something_controversial_on_this_sub/ed5sm4s/).
1	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA fuck that was great
1	😢
1	Ah u/The_White_Baron... I didn't read all of it, but glad I know the reference now
1	Happened to me on a r/facepalm about my comment on a a trump meme that I found stupid because it used a quote from 2013.  The motherfuckers shot me down 50+ and I lost my first 1k upvotes.
3	Leadership	Do you guys do well in these roles, or do you not even seek it at all?
4	My experience with leadership is that usually there's a ExTJ in the room who will be more of a natural leader, and have a fetish for organizing people and making adminstrative bullshit work, so I don't seek it out if that type is present. But in a room full of introverts and/or perceivers, I often step up and take the lead because I know no one else will and I'm *capable* of leading effectively even though I'd prefer to be in a support role, refining (or poking holes in) ideas and decisions being made by leadership.
3	I’m a big time leader, and I tend to naturally assume the position, and others naturally look to me to do so. I guess I’m charismatic or something \n\nProblem is I need people around me making sure I don’t forget shit, miss little details, or... well yeah mainly those two. \n\nIt’s also really interesting to me how I can’t keep myself organized but when I assume a leadership role I can get others to stay organized pretty easily. Then again, I’m not gonna lie, I’m a really good leader, as it comes naturally, and I’ve had a lot of exceptional role models who were great leaders that I’ve taken great nuggets from
3	Ha, I'll go against the grain a bit and say I dislike being a leader, because it entails more responsibility, and because I hate telling people what to do. That being said, I think I'm an alright leader - I tend to be pretty hands off, which works well for a lot of people. It helps to have a good team of self-motivated people, because they tend to figure shit out themselves. I'm pretty fair and I don't bow down easily to external pressure, so I am able to maintain at least some semblance of authority.
1	If I'm put there, I' get the team to get things done.\n\nI just hate all of the responsibility. 
1	Currently in a role like this. I was previously a sales rep, and kinda ended up in this role due to some innovation and coaching ability. I’m doing well. It’s funny, my current manager is an ENTP too. \n\nI enjoy it, there is fulfillment in being able to create plans and have others carry out your vision. I also find that part of the job requires some investigative work which I actually really love. 
4	Save life in this Universe or create 10 other Universes?	Would you rather save all life in this Universe and the reality of this Universe as we know it, allowing it to continue existing as is.\n\nOr\n\nCreate 10 Universes, each filled with as much life and potential life as ours (including as much complicated sentient life in each). With each of the ten supporting life as long as ours will.
8	You are saying I have the power to create universes with as much life as I want? Well, then I’m going to make one universe that’s an exact replica of the universe that I am not saving in this scenario, and since it’s exactly the same, no one will notice. \nThat gives me nine extra universes to do whatever I want with. 
2	I care about me and the boundaries of conciousness are blurry so I'll go with the first one.
1	Create 10 duh
86	saying something controversial on this sub without getting called an esfp or the r-word😪😪	
39	some people on this sub are strict like ESTJ. \n\nit feels like my boss or parents are watching......*but it won‘t stop me anyway*
32	That one time I said I liked writing and was called an Se dom. Good times lmao
24	R ... Ryan Seacrest?
22	Yeah...you like that, you fucking retard? 
15	I think your picture is a pretty good metaphor for the airtight web of logic commonly employed by some on the sub. 
15	r word for the entp: "wrong"\n
13	people getting mad over this post are proving it further i love irony
5	Controversial does not equal nonsensical.
5	ay lmao.
11	Officialentp is esfp. This is not entp meme.
6	Some people can only deal with cognitive dissonance by devaluing the offending thought as "coming from someone else" especially one who is not of the same archetype or intelligence band.\n\nReally they should look at themselves in the mirror when they accuse others of not being ENTP, or being less intelligent.\n\nProjection. I see it so often on this sub it's almost embarrassing to be ENTP. 
11	Lol. If by "controversial" you mean stupid, maybe. But that's not why they're getting called ESFPs.
7	That’s what commenting on LGBT subs feels like nowadays 
7	Did you really use "r-word" for retard?\n\nJesus christ, why?
5	Since when do any ENTP’s have problems with controversial shit? We like to argue controversial shit. You’re probably just a pussy esfp. Retard. 
1	Rigga or what?
15	Which ENTP champion would you send to fight for us?	Royal Rumble death match hunger games like scenario.There can be only one winner.\n\nEvery type gets to send one champion. (Like INFJ's would probably send Jesus, oh and mythical or fictional character types can be chosen 😇)\n\nThe stakes for ENTP's, if they lose are; all ENTP's are sent to an immortal existence working in a cubicle doing brain dead paperwork and their boss and all their co-workers are forever chatting about small talk of which you cannot help but hear.\n\n(For my money, I choose Rick from Rick and Morty to fight for us.)
20	Oh God...that hell you described sounds awful. I’d never realized how awful that sounded until I read that. \n\nI choose me. I’ll get it done boys and girls, no worries. 
12	>" The stakes for ENTP's, if they lose are; all ENTP's are sent to an immortal existence working in a cubicle doing brain dead paperwork and their boss and all their co-workers are forever chatting about small talk of which you cannot help but hear. "\n\n&#x200B;\n\nare you satan
17	Gotta go with Tony Stark. 
7	Nah let's send Jeff Goldblum
6	INFJs aren’t sending Jesus... we’re sending u/Bubblesandsass 
11	Loki (from the norse mythology, the Marvel one is not ENTP).\n\nThey send the son of a god? I send them an actual god.
6	Socrates
6	if a little intp like me could get the permission to pick your entp hero, i'd go with Old Man Davinci. ragged and sagely wise from the years of life experiences. though physically weak, and in his deathbed when teleported to the arena, his wit and absolute IQ levels will give him the ability to invent objects on the fly during the arena battle.\n\nhis fighting style will be reminiscent of Detective Gadget and his Go Go Gadget abilities.
3	Is Odysseus an ENTP?
3	Muthafuken me. 
3	I’m sending Thanos. Let’s get it
2	we don't even have to fight as long as we have Socrates.
2	Yeah Rick Sanchez if he took the call to arms. Otherwise Dead Pool. 
2	Feynnman
1	was gonna pick rick as well, but since you chose him imma go with socrates
1	Send me guys 
1	Let’s send Jim Halpert guys.
4	Just found the most Ne thing I’ve ever seen sitting in an Oragami craft store	
5	That's really more Fi than Ne, imo. \n\nNe is a perception.  This is a construction which implies Fi or Ti.
2	I see a tour bus driver.\n\nOr maybe I’m tripping.
2	Reminds me of wabi sabi also it feels good in my brain because of all the different shapes its making me cognize at different angles too
1	Am I missing an Escher thing that makes this awesome or something? 
7	Competitive activities that require lots of Ne?	I was wondering if you guys knew any competitive activities(preferably team-based) that really capitalize on high Ne that also aren't video games. Video games tend to force creative object use which leads to a lot of Ne innovation, and complexity is really high in video games so it's even better for Ne. What about "real life" activities? I don't mean drawing, but rather competitive things only. Board games maybe?\n\nAlso I was wondering if anyone here could define what exactly Ne is doing with external objects. Like what are the possibilities observed other than those that take word association forms like seal->ice->icebergs->global warming. I'm an INTP and I find my Ne really comes in with using objects in creative ways, it's just hard to figure out how to define it. Examples include:\n\n1. using a straw to hold my steak since I didn't have a fork and didn't want to wait for the waitress.\n\n2. When a wizard in d&d I often use spells that interact with the environment to have an even greater effect than the spell alone would typically have.
7	If you want a real challenge. I’ve just taken up learning Go with my girlfriend. Very easy to play, unbelievably difficult to play well. I find it immensely interesting. 
5	I play chess pretty often and while im not the best in remembering every single opening move, i think im very good in finding possibilities and create tactics. Could be Ne combined with developed Ti to make sure it works
5	Debating xD\n\nPointing flaws in some expert theories (because of their tunnel vision). \n\nTotally legal, holistic medicine /s
4	Playing strategy games. 
2	I've taken up jiu-jitsu recently. I love the strategy and competition involved.
2	Board games like lots of other people have said.\n\nRock climbing. It’s where I’ve met almost all my entp friends, it attracts them. \n*nope that doesn’t work, what about a high left foot - nope, switch my feet - nope but closer, ohhh... I have to twist my hips the other direction and go right hand up. \nPlus you get to nerd out on the gear and physics.

25	Most effective information gathering system?	For a long time, one of my biggest problems being an ENTP is my reflex to argue not having support from hard facts or specific knowledge. Because of this, I’ll make an argument that I should be able to maintain but then realize that, to my knowledge, I have no factual leg to stand on.\n\nI’m wondering what our guys’ experiences are like when it comes to continuously learning. Do you have systems for garnering information? How do you approach it? Does your method for learning about the past differ learning about current events? Answer as many of these as you’d like.\n\nTLDR; what’s your system to garner information in your daily life that you can then use to support positions when a debate arises? How do you stay knowledgeable?
20	> Do you have systems for garnering information?\n\nEvernote. I repeat, Evernote. You can create different folders for different topics, or tags for topics that overlap. The search function is amazing. \n\nAs far as actually *finding* the information, start with Wikipedia or Google, and let yourself fall down the rabbit hole of related links. Ask the INTPs if you need more help with this. ;)
14	You shouldn't post-hoc learn information to support your positions. You should derive your positions from your information.\n\n>I’ll make an argument that I should be able to maintain but then realize that, to my knowledge, I have no factual leg to stand on.\n\nYou solve this by not having opinions on things you don't know enough about. It's okay to think 'I don't know this'.
6	I have a hobby of collecting fountain pens and inks so I prefer maintaining a journal where I just write down all my thoughts and hence constantly keep my fountain pens in use. This is a great way to enhance your memory and look back on what you previously said or did, helping you play the devil's advocate better.\n\nAs a university student working on a rather ambitious project, I constantly have to gather information. I just let my Ti free on the links and articles I stumble upon, gathering useful and also useless (atleast at that moment) pieces of information. I write them down if I have my journal handy else I just put them on my drive.\n\nSometimes I hit a dead-end while doing so which is out of my comfort zone, but I have gotten used to it over time. I just keep changing the keywords or search something that can connect me to what I need until I finally make it.\n\nAlso keep reading books and random articles and watch lots of random videos to expand your vocabulary and knowledge. Just let your Ti gain insight on all the information so that it is up and ready for your Ne to use anytime you need it!
6	Debaticus 3:11\n\n"*My son, listen closely, embrace these teachings as you would an old friend, for they will grant you eternal joy and wisdom. He who would expand upon his knowledge in the pursuit of wisdom, your faithful companions are Wikipedia and Youtube.*"
2	I daily read wisdom journalism, which is the most optimal genre within the journalistic field.\nI don't discuss anything unless I have strong evidence to back me up. \nInstead ask 💯 questions, if someone knows something you don't, especially ask why they think that and more specifically where they have the information from. People are awesome at recommending articles and videos 🤗 So don't discuss but follow your curiosity by asking questions???\nThen ofc makes notes for yourself during the conversation, so you can read up on it afterwards.
2	I don’t “debate” very well because I don’t argue or discuss to win. I don’t care about being tactical or calculated. I just say whatever is in my mind. And even if I don’t know fully what I’m talking about I will discuss what I do know and then the other person provides information. It’s like fishing for knowledge through conversation.
2	If you’re talking about remembering facts during a discussion, ie if you all ready played out the argument beforehand, and need to remember specifics, I’d think of it as an internal networking problem. Whenever you learn of something, consider how it fits into your system of knowledge. We all ready do this subconsciously, but try to see how it interconnects with all of the other stuff you know, that might be relevant. I find that this strengthens my ability to jump from subject to subject, or idea to fact, because you’ve all ready done it. 
2	Learn how to make your own facts. And I don't mean bullshit or lying, I mean facts. Look for correspondences between the structure of your argument and anything else and then use that to support it. And then look for correspondences with that other thing to find something an even better one. And I really mean *anything* else. It could be something in a completely different universe.\n\nWhich reminds me of something in superstring theory about how tears in spacetime are scabbed over by objects with the perfect size and shape for the tear. And that they travel faster than the speed of light and can come from the other end of the universe to do so.\n\nSo, do that. And keep in mind what it means for something to be a perfect fit as opposed to a force fit or an awkward fit. And that mastering it is practical omniscience. :D
1	I always keep my brain very much active daily (sometimes more than the need, so that I got exhausted because I sleep 4 hours a day to be more productive) so my memory is pretty good. I pay attention to everything I am surrounded with so I never forget and remember everything pretty well. I don't need any tool to remember things I 've learned apart from my brain. However....\n\nI don't have a habit to write things down (this is a bad thing because most of the time when the debate comes - you can imagine frequency -  I found myself trying to prove "you told me exactly like this on a specific date xx.xx.xxxx". So collecting the data in my brain does not help at all to win over an argument. People need evidence. I started tracking everything down recently, not to remember for myself but to prove things in debates.\n\n&#x200B;
1	I do and don't care about being 💯% accurate. When I am unsure about how accurate I am being, I state that upfront and clearly since in an argument/debate (maybe because I am older) I don't care about winning that much. It's like what I have heard artist say in regards to giving a shit about completing an illustration that you think is great and clinging to it, someone is probably "new" at being good at art if their doing that.\n\nNext, it's more important for me to know which "bucket" I got a alleged fact from or to put it another way, as long as I recall enough of what I am talking about to correctly and efficiently "Google" or look up the source.\n\nSo let's say I am talking about "The Hundred Years War" and I say, "It didn't really last exactly a hundred years". But then I can't recall how long it actually lasted, I will say that. Then look it up, because I know I'm right partially.
1	It’s just called growing up dude. As you get more mature you’ll have less of that “I wanna argue just because I feel like it” reflex.
7	Why should I believe what anyone says?	In the last few years I have realized I can be 100% wrong and still convince myself I am right to the point of absurdity. I have done countless stupid things only to look back and realize how obviously bad the decision was. And in the majority of those situations I was the person who had most of the information about the decision at hand and still managed to fuck up. That combined with the fact that I do not consider myself a dumb person, as proven by the countless times I have actually excelled at mentally challenging tasks, makes me wonder how much I can trust my own mind in making decisions.\n\nAs a solution to that, I decided to seek knowledge from people who appeared to be experienced in taking the right decisions, and also on ways to improve my own decision making. That lead me to countless self help books (from which I probably finished two or three) that only made things worse. Those books not only told me I was doing everything wrong, but that if I did what they said everything would fix itslef and I would have a great life. Sounds good, right? And it's not that hard to follow their instructions. There was only one problem. Each one of those had a different set of instructions that even contradicted some other books on the same topic. Who do I believe? Tim Ferris? Malcolm Gladweel? Mark Manson? Everything they write sounds logical and true, but is it really?\n\nThen it dawned on me. Why should I trust them with decisions about my own life when I can't even trust myself? Nobody talks about that. I also tried reading some philosophy, but it still didn't help me solve anything. Maybe I don't really understand them well enough to get the message they are trying to convey? Or maybe they were a little bit less full of shit than the average human being but still were somewhat full of shit? I do not know.\n\nWhat I do know is that I can see no reason why should I trust what anybody has written about anything in particular unless I can try it myself and see the results they promise, and even then I don't see a reason to trust that those results were an actual consequence of my actions and not just luck or the consequence of another specific set of actions that enabled them, which in my experience is the case in most life related situations.\n\nAnd then there is the fact that many times I make a decision even before I know I have made it, and I just rationalize my own decision. It has happened many times. Someone asks me why I chose a particular t-shirt or a particular device, or why I want this car or that car, and I tell them this reason or that reason, but deep inside I know those reasons are just nice parts of the whole and good enough to like it, but I didn't think about them when I first saw the object. What I really thought when I saw it 9/10 times was "Holy shit this is cool", which made me examine it and find what made it cool. But I already found it cool beforehand.\n\nThen what? The only somewhat logical solution I can come up with is following blindly my intuition and just trying to learn from the times it takes me on the wrong path. But that comes with its own set of problems. What about the instant gratification traps like Reddit? I have a big procrastination problem with it, and I already know it's not good but the first thing my mind tells me to do when I open my laptop is browse reddit instead of working on my projects or studying for my degree. Of course it makes me feel like shit at the end of the day, and that's still my intuition telling me I am doing what I should, but it repeats itself day after day to the point of going almost into a depressive state if I don't take control, which only takes me back to the start, where I do not know when to trust myself with my own decisions. Should I spend the day working on this or working on that? Should I eat this way or that way? Should I hang out with this group of people or that group of people?\n\nSo yeah, here I am completely lost with the hope I will manage to figure things out with time. What do you guys think on the way Marvel is going with the new movies they are going to release?
4	There's YT video, made by GCP Gray called "You Are Two". At some point He explains how one hemisphere of the brain is good at explaining decisions made by the other one. Seems like brain sometimes invents reason for some of your actions, to justify them, and to appear coherent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for your decision making, it's hard to refer to it without any examples. People make many mistakes. If you have all the data and make one, then you've been probably influenced by a cognitive bias/fallacy. There's tons of them. I'd advice to read up on the topic, as I've noticed that my thinking process is far more streamlined and just since I've started studying them.\n\nThat is to say - you'll probably never be able to shield yourself from them in 100%.
4	Here's what I discovered for myself and my decision making...a LOT of it is really emotional choices made in the moment. As much as I am mostly emotionless in social situations or in dealing with people, at least that is how we see ourselves isn't it, many of my(our) decisions are largely based on emotions and retroactively justified in a way that makes them seem like a logical choice.\n\nYou're too smart for your own good, so smart, in fact, that you can fool yourself into thinking your emotional decisions are really based on facts and sound logic. You basically said this in your post. I agree with following your intuition but you may be veering from initially following intuition to procrastination or whatever else.\n\nThe really hard work is learning to sort this all out the moment it is happening. You go to your computer to work on something and get sidetracked by Reddit but if you paused in that moment and questioned that choice you would see where that impulse came from. Even better, follow each choice out to its conclusion but be careful because emotion will sneak in there with rose-tinted glasses and make the poor, emotional choice seem "not that bad". You've been there, done that so you know picking Reddit over homework gives you a little pleasure at the time but leaves you feeling like shit after 4 hours have passed and not a damned thing has been accomplished.\n\nI know it's hard. I did this with gambling for many years and always managed to justify it to myself somehow. It's not worth it! Even now I have a good job that I enjoy, making good money yet some days I want to blow it all up, walk away and do "what I want", "what I feel like". I gave myself a 10-15 year plan to judge my decisions against. The plan changes slightly week to week but the jist of it is to have enough money to truly do what I want when I want and that means working a lot, living frugally and keeping on the path right now. I know I could drop it all tomorrow and survive but I want to thrive! I'm 36 and can look back on the last 18 years at how "doing what I want" was a series of poorly made, emotional choices compounded over time. The good news is that you get on the right path any time and turn things around but take it from someone that wasted a ton of time and money, the sooner the better!\n\nI am writing this from the gym. I have been meaning to eat better and get back in shape but, once again, I kept letting emotions and sweets get the best of me. Its another path to follow. I know it could take a year or two to really get back into shape but since I know that I can use that to gauge where or if a choice fits in with that plan/path. To start, I am simply making it a point to get to the gym every day so I can form the habit. I will add the real working out slowly in a week or 2 once just getting here is a habit. I **REALLY** didn't want to come tonight because I get up at 5am for work but I made it anyway. A little stretching, sit down bike and then the steam room. I know I didn't do a lot but I got here to honor my commitment to my plan and since I did that **NOW** I can go home, sit on my fat ass and watch a show or 2.\n\nHope this resonates. The time to act is now!
3	I have always firmly believed in a few principles:\n\n1. Don't take advice - and by this, I mean: Never do exactly what someone else says. Add the advice to the 'melting pot' that is your mind and decide yourself.\n2. Think things through - actively, and passively by deferring bigger decisions until it is the time to make them (be it because of internal or external factors).\n3. Make decisions decisively.  Don't second guess yourself. Don't regret things.\n4. Learn from your mistakes. They will happen, so use them as a learning opportunity - and make the same mistake the fewest times possible.
2	\>That lead me to countless self help books (from which I probably finished two or three) that only made things worse.  \n\n\nMost self help books are not the best source of knowledge. Because they sell the solution to a very simplified problems. Kind of like reading astrology for your star sign. It's very hard to give meaningful advice if you do not take into account where the person is at. Most of it will either be not possible sounding as empty frases or not relevant, which makes people it all more depressing.  \n\n\nBut in the end you don't need to base your decision on your intuition alone. You yourself mention that you know doing A (reddit) will bring you to point B (being unhappy at the end of the day). You don't need to follow intuition for that decision tree because you know the outcome, not to have comparison you need to check if you move to other decisions - if they make you happier at the end of the day or not? 
2	In terms of decisions that are based on facts, my rule of thumb is always go with expert consensus.  I figure that even if I’m smarter than certain members of a field, they know more about the field than I do.
1	I'm going to go against the grain a little and talk about the role of emotions in decision-making, which I think are actually important. I can relate to some of what you've said here, because I've definitely had many of these thoughts myself in the past. What I realized is that at some point, you DO have to learn to trust your gut instincts. You will never be able to verify every piece of knowledge you receive - it's way too time and labour-intensive. At some point in your life, though, you should have picked up the tools to filter knowledge effectively and intuitively, lest you fall into an Ne-Ti loop. I know you said you're not into further self-help and philosophy books, but a great read on decision making is *Thinking Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman. I highly recommend it.
1	Entps can cross reference what ferriss says what rogan says what kresser says with our experience and theories of how things are caused. It takes a while and lots of data but i think i have an accurate overview these days. Though im sure ill realize that i know nothing... again.
1	SO relatable it actually hurts. In fact, I just made a post today where I am asking for help to control my impulsive emotions and this "intuition," or what I'd call "gut instinct that defaults to averting people's opinions", is at the heart of it. (You don't have to answer to that post, but PLEASE take it as a warning. I'm starting to crumble mentally from these (in a way stupid) events; DON'T go to this path!)\n\nNow back to your question. I also have a tendency to counter-respond, but when I respond back, I don't necessarily attack the other person (though the aforementioned impulses can escalate BADLY). Rather, I'd give either a new, alternative as a suggestion or I point out an issue they might overlook. The ones who I respect the most tend to find an answer that proves that not only did they NOT overlook the issue, but I'm also unrealistic.\n\nYet, no matter what's the conversation, I still end up feeling thrilled because, at the end of the day, if I feel like I've gained something, I am definitely learning something. The act of just learning is enough of a reason for me to start developing something via a project or my own research. Moreover, knowing that there's a LARGE variety of opinions out there, there's going to be some community who'll find value with the new revelations you've found.
3	The Victorian aesthetic grosses me out.	All the furniture looks uncomfortable and everything looks unsterile, including the houses. It just looks dirty to me.\n\nI associate that time in England/whatever with disease and moldy skin. The image of the UK still grosses me out.\n\nIn the same way, brazil grosses me out because you have a bunch of sweaty people wearing slippers and living in polluted, dirty cities in the middle of a jungle with poor sanitation. I always imagine that Brazilians have a thick layer of antigenic fungus on them.\n\nWhat leads an ENTP to feel this way?
22	Being uneducated and inexperienced on those topics and listening to your initial gut reaction instead of weighing the odds of whether or not your opinions are true and also not having personal interactions with said topics in the real world. 
6	Victorian - welcome to the world where idea of comfortable furniture has not yet taken root. Wait till 1910's at least for that!  \n\n\nUK is still moldy.
3	\n\n>What leads [me] to feel this way?\n\nUh, everything you just said.
3	How does not liking victorian stuff link to the myerrs briggs? I mean tbf i love victorian stuff because i want to be melodramatic and extra likr a character in penny dreadful
3	> What leads an ENTP to feel this way?\n\nStupidity. 
1	...is this a troll? 
1	Lmfao what?
5	How are you at gaining professional connections?	As in, how are you at getting to the point that you make lots of...well...connections in whatever profession you are in?
4	Im extremely talented at this, not just because i make friends with ease, but because anytime i see an opening that might interest someone i know, i make calls, and i have found jos for friends and colleagues, so they end up looking up to me, because i take care of them.\n\nI also always understand bosses, and what theyre thinking and help take responsability out of them, because theyre usually exhausted.\n\nAlso im always learning new skills and learning from everyone which helps gainning more responsabilitys and people tend to trust me.\n\nAlso in any job i have ever been anyitime there was a problem i never loose my cool or my temper, so i talk to the person who screwed up, and ask well this happened what can we do now, and start looking for solutions 99% of the time, theres a solution and we solve it and it was no big deal, but the fact that i dont need to belitle or scream at peopple  makes a lot of my coworkers to want me to be on positions of charge, and a lot of times they basically bost me to positions of responsability because of that.\n\nI also tend to be absurdly good at perceiving needs and desires, and i use this to  gain rapport with people.\n\nIs funny when ur talented at this how much oportunitys come right at me, is not that im looking at them but i make it hppen at the end of the day.\n\nNot just in job but everywhere.\n\n&#x200B;
3	Honestly I’m really good at it. The only thing is, is that it’s not even intentional. I just become friends with that person while we are working on same project and then it goes on from there. I don’t do it because I’m intending to use them or something. \n\nIdk if any other ENTPs feel this way but I sometimes feel like accidental success/opportunities fall in my lap because I get super interested in a subject/project/person simply because I’m curious about it and people perceive that as “very ambitious”. The end result of “winning” isn’t my intention, but it can just happen anyway.
2	Really good, recently I have taken up vigilantism dressed like an animal. Even though I am middle aged young people and even a senior citizen have been getting on board with what I am doing.\n\nI even end up making connections with people I am trying to "vigilantize" using them as informants and what not. If that wasn't weird enough the commissioner of the police force has also started working with me off the record.\n\nIt's like the less I show myself giving a shit about people the more they want to work with me. I even got invited to this hero group thing. Apparently they think I am great at analysis and problem solving.\n\nConnections everywhere, am I right?\n🦇\n
2	Good at making friends, good at getting clients, terrible at keeping clients, terrible at traditional jobs...
7	Funny TV Quote	I'm watching "Dead like me" on Amazon Prime.  \n\nMain character to side character: Do you really care how it's going with me?\n\nSide character to main character: Sure. I make my face like this and the concerned words come out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis... this is perfect.\n\n&#x200B;

0	Am I one of you guys?	  I already asked this in r/mbti but I want to know what do you guys think I am (this is very long and if I'm correctly an ENTP, most of you guys would not read this till the very end (like me) lol). ENTJ, ENTP, a really annoying person, or something else? I did some tests and identified as ENTP and ENTJ but I'm leaning more towards ENTP because I have a special ability that can make an ordinary situation turned into some fantasy sci-fi movie-like with my imagination in like a blink of an eye and I'm pretty lazy. I can confidently say that my imagination power is beyond human and sometimes my head is filled with so many ideas I can't even express them out properly.\n\n\n\nI do have some ENTJ traits as well as I like to accomplish things and is compelled to lead and what I want to get done I will do my best to get it done while if I don't think its important I will most of the time not do it at all even if I have to do it. Most of the time I prefer to lead because I usually see myself as the one that is capable of leading (might sound really egoistic but the work usually comes out well when I lead) except when the current leader is already doing a good job then I would just share my ideas with him/her on how we can improve the work.\n\n\n\n  I like to think of myself as lazy because I tend to do many many things at once (ex. degree in physics while studying high school) and usually stop mid way (very bad habit). As for bossy which I heard was a common ENTJ trait, I'm not really bossy but I do tell people what they "should" do but totally fine if they do not follow along. I do love planning though but do not always write them down (I like to keep it inside my head) and most of them don't really sound possible in real life but I know I can make it happen (if I decide to act on it) which makes me think I have a strong Ne. \n\n \n\nMost of the time I joke around a lot but still get the job done. I love humors (frequent visitor to r/jokes) and joke mostly about myself (I do not take myself seriously). For efficiency, I usually do whatever task I'm given to almost perfect if it's something I'm interested in and if it's not something that interests me I usually forget about it lol.
6	i think te Ne of entps doesn‘t show so much in form of fantasy and imagination but more like, theories and weird ass conspiracies sometimes but i think it is connected to information or a concept/idea. instead of just random fantasy like in wonderland\n\nand maybe you could make different parts out of your text then maybe some would read it. (i haven‘t read all of it either)
2	look buddy, i didn't take the time to read all of these long, treacherous paragraphs, but i'll take you under my wing in a sensei / apprentice relationship thing. things might get steamy, but i'm married so don't look me in the eyes EVER you hear that?
1	just skimmed through the text, so I'm sorry if I missed something crucial, but I think you could be both. \n\nYes, I truly mean that, I for example have my I/E graph basically in the middle, sometimes I'm INTP, sometimes I'm ENTP (with which I identify more tbh).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe that's the case for you, too (with the graph being between P and J)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhope it helped =)

3	Look! \nits the patron saint of confused millennial fags.\n\n*no offense meant to any actual fags.
3	I don’t understand our sub’s hate for Peterson. He’s no god, no paragon of intellectual prowess. He’s alright though, and that’s chill. 
1	ENTrePreneur =D
1	thanks for posting this ! =)
0	Yeah it's Jordan Peterson but that nibba has some good stuff too.\n\nFor me this video is extremely insightful and while I kind of intuitively the gist of it, he describes it in a very concise way + it's backed up by studies.
49	What kind of player are you when it comes to board games?	Personally, I love to win. But I used to be cool about that and a fair loser. \nLately (since I turned 30 and with an INTP) I noticed that I get upset no one notices how good I am when I win.
52	lmao this will sound cocky but i always think that. sometimes i do amazing stuff and nobody noticed the magnificence of what i just did. then they come and point out sth trivial i did like whatever, and tell me how great it is. i wonder what standards some people go by
25	I play to not only win, I play to dominate. 
18	I can be pretty competitive and like to win. But, my main goal is just to have fun. I usually play with my family. My INTJ dad loves board games, so sometimes we are the only ones playing. You have to keep an eye on him, though. He cheats a lot by bending rules and stuff like that. Usually when we catch him, we just scream "cheater" over and over until he is shamed into compliance. My ENFP brother will sometimes play with us, but he would rather wreak havoc than win. He usually loses, and he will sacrifice himself to make sure someone else won't win. My ISTP uncle will come for family game days, but he has a terrible temper. We had to cancel family game day after he started yelling at me for playing the game competitively.
28	A fucking winner 
9	As much as I acknowledge that it’s a kind and generous thing, I pretty much can’t bring myself to throw a game and let my kids win unless they actually beat me (and I avoid super chancy games so that’s rare). Petty? Yes. Does the victory they really earn feel sweeter? Probably, but I should take one for the team more often. 
8	I like to win. I'm okay with losing. I tend to know early in a game how it will go but tend to keep playing regardless of the foreseeable outcome.  If I'm on the losing end of the spectrum I have a but more fun with the scenario and try things I might not otherwise do. I always play by the agreed upon rules and do my best to make sure everyone else does too. \n\nI tend to win at games and they tend to be easy for me. I enjoy hard games because it means I've got something to learn and overcome... as long as its skill based. 
6	I love getting fake ultra competitive (also i care a little bit) but throwing insults based on people's board game play and acting grandiose. It's super fun when people play along but people have been thrown off before. I love being/acting competitive over something insignificant. 
3	Rule enforcer
3	I always impress the ENTJ in our group once a game with a manoeuvre. He still wins tho. 
10	What kind of player am I when it comes to board games? The kind who always finds a way to make out with your girlfriend during the game. As a bonafide ENTP, winning and losing doesn't matter to me. I just gotta sow a little chaos in there. If it's a family game, my player status skyrockets and I'll sometimes make out with your mom. 
2	I always loose. Uh, can't do the whole look into the future moves of the other player nor can I make up a successful strategy. 
2	Depends on the board game. Something like Risk? Pick a different person to fuck over at every turn but do it in a way that causes the other players to go for each other's throats while you slowly sweep up land and territories and gain armies for yourself. \n\nMonopoly? Buy one piece of property that the other people will need an hoarde the fuck out of it. When they become desperate, sell all of your stuff to other players, bow out and go for a smoke and watch them battle it out while eating chips and making fun of their strategy.\n\nCandy Land? ...you can't be bad at that game. You just roll dice and move. But it's aggravating that fate has deigned me unimportant enough to win that fucking game. 
2	I want to win and expect to win, but if I don’t it’s all good. If I do win though, I’m going to bring it up every day for the next 57 years and just when you think I’ve forgotten and won’t mention it again, BAM “remember that time I kicked your ass in monopoly?” 
2	In most games i quickly find the best strategy to dominate, i have to hold myself back sometimes otherwise i'm ruining the fun for everybody. When its a game with family or a group i dont really care about winning anyway. (like monopoly or catan)\n\nBut when its something like chess or risk then i have no mercy, and im goin to crush anyone who is foolish enough to stand in my way
2	I love to win but I'm not sore looser. I accept and laugh it off, but still,i I'll do anything to win, including cheating. And I'm not mad if someone wins through cheating too, cause if they were able to cheat me then they deserve to win 
2	I tell everyone I’m cheating but they can’t catch me. Then I don’t cheat. And I still win because they are so consumed with trying to figure out how I’m cheating 
2	Went to PAX East a few years ago when Secret Hitler had come out. The creator of the game was showcasing it in a room with other successful Kickstarter-backed games, huge crowds playing, and he’s there explaining the rules to new players. I’m there with a friend, we sit in on the next game, 10 players total I think. In that round, I draw a Fascist card, and my friend is the Secret Hitler. First turn I tell everyone at the table I’m a Fascist. The creator of the game is dumbfounded. Nobody just comes out and says that! The table immediately breaks down into chaos, nobody believing anybody, accusations flying everywhere, second turn my friend is voted Chancellor, Fascists win. :)
2	I'm pretty agressive in games that I know some of the tactics. And I often change to ultra defensive mode. But the main component is talking stuff to opponents... I LOVE THAT PART. I get to Lie and tell de absolut True and they will have no fucking clue, hahahahaha.\n
1	I win
1	I LOVE board games. Have a collection of around 35. But they sit pretty well untouched most of the time cause I don’t have the time or friends to play.\n\nHowever. When I do play, I’m an asshole. I’m a sore winner and a sore loser, or so I’ve been told.\nI take things personally and will sulk if things don’t go my way.\nI hate when people try to cheat even a little bit and am a stickler for the rules unless a house rule has been predetermined.\n\nBut it also depends on who I’m playing with. Sometimes I’m weirdly perfectly fine with losing, as long as someone I want to win wins. Does that make sense? Idk.
1	I used to win a lot at Catan, but only because I played very competitively and beat up on everyone else (especially in Cities and Knights expansion).  Eventually my style of playing didn't jive with my wife's side of the family who are so freaking nice so I had to scale it WAAAAAAAY back.  Now I check myself and don't win much anymore.  But I'm told that relationship is more important than games.... so there's that.
1	If I care enough about the game I really want to win.\nSometimes I play chess against by ENFJ best friend, when I loose I get so upset I go back and watch hours of youtube videos to try and get better.
1	I'm the asshole who pulls up the rules to prove that someone is breaking them.
1	I play for fun but I have the most fun when I win 😈
1	I most like deduction and bluffing based games. More people are involved more I have fun. Of course, I lose so rarely.\n\nBelieve it or not, I have never lost in a single RISK game roughly over 100 games both online and with friends. I am just SO lucky with dices...Rest is ENTP thing.\n\nMy favorite board games are:\n\n* Sheriff of Nottingham ( bribe, bluff) I strongly suggest you play this one.\n* Ghost Blitz  (fast brain processing)\n* RISK\n\nHaving fun over chaos is my primary objectives in all games. That is why I always use people's emotions and anger to have more fun. Plus pushing them to make mistakes against the rules so that I can have them check the rulebook which I already know word by word.  I never focus on winning.
1	Depends on the game. When I know the game already I play hard and want to win, but am content if I don’t. If I don’t know the game I want to learn the strategy or try to figure out the best way “to” win, even if my plan doesn’t pan out. 
1	If I'm just playing for fun, I'll punt every now and again to keep from dominating too hard and killing the game. If it matters, I lock that shit down and show no mercy. Go for the throat.
1	i play to win when it’s a specialty of mine (ie: trivia, simpler word games, pictionary) \n\notherwise I like creating the chaos.\n\nSabotage other players? Yay!\nHuge deck of mystery cards nobody wants to pick up? Don’t mind if I do....\n\nI don’t take losing personally most times.\nIn fact I hate sore losers, especially the ones who keep whining after they lose. Like get the fuck over it.. \n\n
1	I am very strategic and plan some moves out in advance and some are one offs. But I can only play with certain people who are also good. Because it's not fun when I can tell 10 min in I'm going to win.. so I'll take more risky strategy's just so it's more interesting.\n\nI also have a very hard time playing games involving rolling dice because you can have the best strategy in the world but still loose by continually rolling awful numbers...\n\nI love board games, but I am very choosey with what and who I play with...
1	Trivial Pursuit and Cards Against Humanity champ here!  I also am pretty great at card games, if I do say so myself...\n\nI enjoy it for the fun, even if I don’t win, though of course I prefer to win.  I have a teenage son who is also an ENTP and we go hard in the paint some games.
1	I don’t give a fuck about outcomes. My goal is just to talk as much shit as possible and trigger my opponent.
1	Super competitive. Put super poor strategist. Means I've had to become a decent loser unless I feel cheated. That's when shit gets real. 
1	A cheater 
1	Honestly I don’t give a fuck. My goal is to have as much fun as possible. If we are not having fun there’s no point on keep on playing lol
1	Truth be told I really don't enjoy competitive board games anymore 🤗. \n\nProbably because I am older, who knows, but I really enjoy cooperative board games. Where we are working together to solve a problem.\n\nThat way when I do something "brilliant" or insightful I can explain to my teammates why I did the "thing". They are more open to showering me with praise then, plus I can teach them how to do the "thing" now and see if they can put their own spin on it. \n\nIn helping each other in co-op games we push and teach each other more. Rather than hording knowledge and strategy.
1	Very competitive and will cuss you out. But no hard feelings.
1	Always plotting to win, no matter what! I like playing politics in Magic, especially.
1	I like to win and often do. I try to be humble about it but it does give me a thrill. I'm not a sore loser or anything. Love strategy win or lose!
1	I tend to read up on winning strategies in f.e. Monopoly or just estimate probabilities while playing and usually end up winning a lot. I think I'm a decent enough loser though... I hope...
8	Self-destruction is a fact of what it means to be an intelligent lifeform. What’s the solution? What’s the most “optimistic” end result? I’ll tell you.	To begin, I spend about 75% of my time thinking about mankind- Why we do the things we do, why everyone is how they are, what mankind is capable of, what motivates us, what the solutions are to all of the issues, how technological advancements will impact society, how my ideas can change peoples perspectives, etc. Literally every day my mind is swirling with these thoughts of “society”.  I spend a lot of my time thinking about how we as people can “transcend” into something greater than we currently are. It’s pretty much the only thing I would truly consider idealistic about my thought-process. \n\nRecently(today/yesterday), I’ve been thinking about the topic of “self destruction”. What makes people well...destroy themselves? I’ve thought a lot about it over the last hour or so, and I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not just a possibility in everyone and everything, but rather an inevitable fact of existence itself.  \n\nFirst off, I recently watched the film Annihilation, a movie starring Natalie Portman as a biologist who goes with four other scientists into a highly anomalistical location that suddenly appeared in Florida. (SPOILERS) Inside of the this place called the Shimmer, life forms mutate, morph, and change into other life forms. In a way, everything self-destructs, becoming something different and new- basically, this place manipulates the biology of life forms by making the DNA within the Shimmer refract like light in prism. \n\nIt is soon revealed that everyone who went into the Shimmer was going there for self-destructive reasons. The main character goes because she cheated on her husband, who then responded by leaving and going into the Shimmer himself, so she wishes to find him. Another character has cancer, so she plans to go and die in the Shimmer, one is highly depressed, so she goes into the Shimmer because there’s nothing else to live for anyway, and another goes because her daughter died. Each of these individuals *know* that no one has ever come back from this place...but they go anyway.  Eventually each of these characters do exactly what you think they’re going to do- their “end” result in the story is a product of their self-destructive tendencies/issues (I won’t spoil it).\n\nI also watched a video on YouTube today about a theory called “The Great Filter”. Essentially what this is, is a theory that we have never seen nor spotted a galactic civilizations in the whole span of our galaxies existence because it is exceptionally rare for intelligent life forms to get past a societal “filter”. The filter is basically self-destruction. Life forms can’t get get over this hurdle because they can’t go beyond the innate self-destructive quality that comes with being an intelligent life form. As intelligent beings, we destroy ourselves, our potential, our best qualities, and our future 99.9% of the time. So...given the fact that hospitable planets are pretty rare...on top of the assumption that intelligent life is probably very rare...and THEN on top of the possibility of intelligent life even reaching a level of advancement that they have colonized the entire planet and are using almost all of its resources...oh, and then to top it off, that they also have to get past a blockade that is nearly impossible to cross...OH, right, and finding a solution to you know...the whole theory of relativity issue...it completely makes sense why a galactic civilization has never been seen...or has maybe never even existed.\n\nIt is a never ending cycle, and it can be seen through-out human history. While we make huge advancements, we will abuse those advancements every single time- The Roman Empire collapsed like what, five times? At one point it became so fucking huge that it couldn’t be sustained. Different ideas sprouted up, civil wars broke out, etc. and...boom. It reached its highest point, and then fell. Sears. Once it was one of the most popular stores for shopping in America. What happened? The owner refused to revolutionize and get ahead of the curve, and *boom*. Sears is now quite literally a joke. It’s a fallen Empire on the cusp of extinction. Steve Jobs created Apple. He catered toward user friendly technology, ushered in an era of smartphones, and founded one of the most successful technology companies of all time. What happened? Oh, right...he decided to go on a fruit diet for a curable cancer and died. What’s happening to Apple now...? Oh, shit, hold on a sec guys. I’ll brb. My iPhone 8 needs to update...wait what the fuck? Why is it suddenly slower? Ugh! Maybe I just need to charge it...good thing I bought a multi-purpose charger so I can use my earbuds and charge at the same time!LOL!!!...wait? What? The iPhone X is coming out...? WHAT? Everyone has it? OH MY GOD! I DON’T KNOW WHY I WANT THIS PRODUCT BUT SUPPOSEDLY ITS BETTER AND APPLE HAS THE BEST LOOKING PHONES AND IF I DON’T GET IT THEN I’LL BE SOCIALLY BEHIND AND AN OUTCAST OHMYGODHOLYFUCK SO I HAVE TO HAVE IT!!!!\n\nThe point is: in some form or another, everything self-destructs and becomes a shell of its former self..eventually completely morphing into something else or dying off. Everything. This is okay for a while since it’s part of our human nature...\n\n...until we reach our “Great Filter”.  The point of no return.\n\nSo what’s the fucking solution to such a bleak place? Like, hello, I WANT TO SEE ALIENS, LOL. What can we do? How do we cross over something that is pretty much inevitable? Here’s where things get a little whack:\n\nThe answer? Well...we don’t! At least not in the sense that we become space faring sea cows in *this* universe. Why? Because to do that isn’t practical. It simply does not make sense.\n\nA hundred years ago what did people do? They had their nose in a book, newspaper, or something. Now we have our noses stuck in television, games, and social media. The issue is that people who have the biggest ideas are the ones with their nose in those “fake worlds” because they are information gatherers and want to see the bigger picture and “hypothesize”. The people who live completely in the real world are practical and don’t really think of possibilities out side of practicality and what is immediately in front of them. They don’t take the leap because they don’t understand or care about the bigger picture, and the people stuck with their noses in a book won’t do anything because they aren’t willing to get out of their heads and make realistic change. I just don’t see massive space travel stuff ever being the solution for exploration when humans can likely find a more practical solution in our minds.\n\nWhat’s that practical solution you ask? Look around you. It’s already beginning. It’s always been there. Smartphones, movies, video games. Bitches, wake the fuck up! Those aren’t just leisure activities, they are the solution to our biological doom. As technology progresses and the world begins to die...as we sit back and realize we fucked up...we will have one solution. It’s not to race to the stars, it’s to create our own universes in a virtual existence. Why race to the stars when you can create your own? \n\nThat’s probably why we haven’t seen alien races flying around Mars! Do you honestly think anyone is going to invest in space travel if they can create their own space travel at their finger tips? Does the vast majority of mankind take boats or airplanes when traveling? Boats are scenic and pretty, but airplanes are faster and more efficient. That’s simply how humans think. No one is going to take a boat if they can take a plane- even if it’s a bit cooler.\n\nIn Annihilation the main character was only able to to pass through the filter because she was no longer a human being. The only solution to a human problem is to no longer be human. What I just stated above is honestly the only end result I can truly see happening.\n\nWake up people! WAKE UP!\n\n....\n\n....Okay, I’m gonna go do laundry now. Bye.
14	>I’ve thought a lot about it over the last hour or so,\n\nOnly an ENTP would say something like that and then go on a tangent about the doom of humanity and how we are all inevitably going to be uploaded into computers.
9	Sounds like somebody’s been watching kurzgesagt
3	Beautiful rant babe. Well put.
3	It’s inevitable, why waste time forming relationships when Worlds can be designed with autonomous entities playing out new and interesting combinations for eternity. 
2	We might set fire to the world. Civilisation may disintegrate entirely. We may become extinct, taking most of the biosphere with us. That’s entirely up to us; at this point, we’re the only thing even remotely capable of preventing that from happening. \n\nBut I personally don’t think we will. People have a great deal of emotional investment in maintaining the biological, social, economic, and technological status quo of humanity; but it’s a futile protest against things that were, are, and will always be temporary. Humanity won’t, and can’t, continue indefinitely. I, for one, can (and do) only dream of whatever post-humanity will accomplish. \n\nPerhaps I’ll live long enough to see the technology that will enable me to create a digital copy of my consciousness, or clone myself, or find myself in some sort of symbiosis with technology, or some other esoteric way of achieving some sort of functional immortality. If so, I’ll be a part of that post-humanity myself. 
2	tl;dr
2	This is a really convoluted way of saying that everything changes/ends.\n\nIsn't that like, common sense?\n\nedit: I skipped the part about us creating a virtual world to live in. idk that irks me quite a bit.\n\nI'd hate to stay in our little caves watching our virtual shadows dance on the wall. This simulation is limited by our imagination and we will never see if there is anyone else or something we couldn't even have thought up/comprehended had we stayed in our simulation.\n\nCounter argument: we are already in a simulation, so who cares?\n\nWell then lets explore upwards and not dig ourselves in deeper.\n\ndouble edit as i noticed another skipped part, excuse me for strawmanning if that happened:\n\nbooks and seeing the bigger picture, TV and seeing the bigger picture?  First I'd distinguish books and TV. Books can be a lot deeper and more meaningful/teaching than TV could ever be. TV is expensive to produce so it has to be liked by as many people as possible (this is why music / book tastes vary so much between people, but everyone watches virtually the same shows). So to put these mediums into the same "enlightening" criteria is wrong imo.\n\nAlso: "oh people consuming media are the ones that change the world and all pragmatists/realists do is do what is already being done" is disengenious. People only spending their time looking at movies or reading books miss the real issues that people doing the work know well from experience. You cannot fix the worlds problems by reading books. anyhow.\n\nyou stick people in simulated environments. and then you expect them to find solutions to problems in the real world? thats assuming that the answer is included in the question.\n\nalso why not let ai solve everything?\n\nidk this is too long and its too late pls say stuff back so i can reply tomorrow thanks.\n\ntriple threat edit: nvm thats what your tangent about books lead to. i was thinking uour argument was a different one so i strawmanned again. its 0230am and i feel like im arguing with myself.\n\nstill not a big fan of just escaping our problems by creating a virtual world though.\n\nwould that world give you everything that you want all the time? because like all the meaning in life is from overcoming challenges. "we choose to go to the moon because its hard" to paraphrase jfk. so would you just include challenges? why not just stay irl though? that seems kinda defeatist imo. Like saying "I give up on this reality because I don't think we can solve our issues so lets make a new one!" I really don't like that.
1	> I also watched a video on YouTube today about a theory called “The Great Filter”.\n\nCheck the sidebar of [r/GreatFilter](https://www.reddit.com/r/GreatFilter/top/?t=all) for other videos and information about the Great Filter.
1	Okay, [Rick](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/PowerfulBackCollardlizard-max-1mb.gif) XD
1	This is partly explored on the book [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight\_(Watts\_novel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight_(Watts_novel))\n\nIt says that humanity start killing itself to put their brains on a jar and connect to a virtual universe that simply gives them everything consciousness needs, and how its a trap or more accurately a failur of consciousness.\n\nIs quite interesting because even thoug humans in that book develop the technology theyre consumed by it, and there ar problems to adapt and start perceiving the limits of what being human entails, as in the book when they get a human an enhace its intellgence it basically becomes an autistic savant living in their own head.
1	You should check out the book Metamorphisis of Prime Intellect. (Free online just google it),\n\nThe first chapter is extremely nsfw (vr torture and death games) but if you get get through that it’s great. \n\nMost futurism splits into two camps about the distant future - utopia or hell/end of the world. \n\nThat book explores how utopia could actually be shit because we lose meaning from everything being too easy.\n
10	Jungian Stat Points	So my D&D group decided to base our stats off Jungian functions. Still writing the rules for how cog func stats will be used in-game, but here’s my character so far! (I decided to try my first run with my jungian results!)\n\nEveryone starts with 80 points. Each func can hold a max of 20, correlating to 5% usage of each func.\n\nMy stats (greatest to least)\n\nNe: 20(points) -> 100%\nTi: 13 -> 65%\nFe: 13 -> 65%\nFi: 10 -> 50%\nNi: 8 -> 45%\nSi: 8-> 45%\nTe: 7 -> 35%\nSe: 1 -> 5%
5	Sounds dank, and actually quite practical
2	What a fun idea ^ _ ^
2	Definitely update when you work the rest out
6	How do ENTPs is different hogwarts houses differ?	For example Slytherins are as competitive as it gets, Hufflepuffs not so much, and ENTPs are said to be somewhat in the middle, so do you think they would really differ? It's just an example.And it's late do I probably don't make sense anyway.\n\n\n*ENTPs in 
14	We're all individuals - I could see an ENTP sorting into any house.\n\nThat being said, all the ENTPs I know sort Slytherin. ;)\n\nI don't think it'ssss as much to do with competitiveness as it isssss inventiveness and disssscovery.  Slytherins push boundaries and ssssearch for/acquire knowledge with the intent to apply it and improve their circumstancessss (unlike Ravenclaws who just want knowledge - *cough cough* mega-nerds).
7	I'd be in Hagrid's House.
9	Is he really comparing MBTI with Hogwarts houses?
5	lol wat
9	*I am so thankful that nothing in this post or question makes any sense to me...*
4	I am weird mix of Slytherin and Ravenclaw. In HP world I would love to experiment and learn about obscure magical stuff but at the same time I would try to use it to become one of the most powerful wizards ever, but only so I can be free and do whatever I want.\n\nIn the real world it translates to my actual goals. I am planning to get myself a name in a specific part of my field so I can get enough money and contacts so I don't have to rely on the system for the rest of my life and spend it working on my own projects.
3	I got gryffindor according on the pottermore quiz. \n\nI don't give a fuck about Harry Potter though. 
2	I'm a Slytherin🐍🐍 I feel like ENTPs could be in any house but in general I think Slytherin is probably the most common entp house, second Ravenclaw third gryffindor fourth hufflepuff, the main reason for this I believe is because ENTPs and Slytherins are both very resourceful and competitive
2	Ravenclaw, they are not only obsessed with learning but they also create in equal measure. Artist, storytellers, etc.\n\nENTP's can be any house. But I speculate it's in Ravenclaw that they will drop their mask and be themselves the most. \n\nHufflepuffs want to get along to much, Harmony and small talk.\n\nGriffin, I don't always want to be doing shit.\n\nSlytherin, I don't give a fuck about winning or social climbing enough.\n\nRavenclaw, sit in a mage tower smoking herb and sipping potions while philosophizing and debating about an esoteric spell found in some dusty old tome. (And for the record, yes unicorn penis can be transmutated into an aphrodisiac.)
2	Ooh fun sub. I got Ravenclaw with Slytherin as my second
3	There are no ENTP Hufflepuffs. None. Dedication, work ethic, kindness, patience... not a great match for our natural tendencies, methinks, not that ENTPs can't develop those in addition to traits that come more easily to us.
1	ENTP & Slytherin 🤭\n\nI’d say I’m pretty cunning. I always thought that I’d be the villain in a movie, rather than the hero. 
1	Slytherin all day every day
1	I'm an ENTP ravenclaw but am definitely a more introverted extrovert. If I don't test ravenclaw (which rarely happens) I'll test gryffindor or slytherin but never hufflepuff lol. 
1	I solved many online tests to be chosen as Slytherins but always end up with Ravenclaws :)
1	Anything but hufflepuff could work, I think most likely Ravenclaw tho
1	Slytherin with very strong Gryffindor sub-traits here. Did one of those tests that shows you how highly you score on the traits for each. There was only about 5% difference between the two. Also scored fairly highly for Ravenclaw & pretty much nothing for Hufflepuff.
21	Why do “famous” ENTPs seem to be more difficult than any of the other types to actually well...type?	I’ve noticed that famous ENTPs in general seem to be super controversial when they are typed and no one can ever agree on whether or not they are actually one. It seems like people always mistype them and don’t get them right.
24	Well, putting myself in a famous ENTPs position...I don’t think I would really act like my true ENTP self in say...an interview on TV or something.\n\nThink of how you feel when you’re talking to an ESFJ. I don’t find ESFJs difficult to talk to, but I don’t find them particularly stimulating either- and that’s mostly because the conversation isn’t effortless and free, it feels more like an interview. ”What did you do today? What do you think about this and this? Did you see the weather outside yesterday?”...it’s a mildly relaxed one, pretty superficial, not too difficult to maneuver...but you know that if you slip and give that ESFJ a taste of your true ENTP self, everyone and their great-great-grandmother will know about it and you will be judged.\n\nI always feel a little under pressure and like I’m supposed to be on my best behavior around ESFJs. For some reason I don’t really hate this- in fact its kind of interesting for a little bit. However, as time goes on, it gets old real fast. But since I have Fe...and they are a Fe dom...it’s not like I am just going to just tell them to get lost. I’m gonna continue to be nice, go along with the flow, and answer their questions with care because if I don’t I will feel judged and stupid. \n\nI guess I just imagine an ENTP in a position of fame similar to how an ENTP acts in the spotlight of interacting with an ESFJ. You’re very, very watered down and just trying to be polite. It’s not what you consider to be a conversation- its just some sort of interview. I think that’s why people struggle to type famous ENTPs so often. They are putting on a public image because it’s polite and they don’t want to cause shit. We may act like we don’t give a fuck, but we certainly care about our image and how people perceive us. If literally everyone thinks I’m a douche or that I’m trash because some ESFJ spread rumors about me, I’m gonna feel bad and disliked, and since Fe is my third function, that is definitely not going to be healthy for me...so I’ll just walk the walk for the ESFJ and then when they’re gone I’ll go back to my crazy self.\n\nThat’s what I think anyway. Every famous ENTP is basically just neutrally going over to their ESFJ aunts house for dinner, lol.
9	My theory is the the more you act to type the more unbalanced you are. Essentially any person that can be easily typed is immature and the wiser one gets the less stereotypical one is.\n\nSo for example the types here who make fun of feelers are clearly immature, because we are essentially all feelers, how aware we are of our hidden selves is what defines maturity and self awareness.
3	Another reason I guess is that many ENTPs act like ENTJs in front of the public to look better. Steve Jobs for example is probably actually ENTP but seems ENTJ as he is one of the more controlling ENTPs (assuming he's not ENTJ). Also in interaction styles, ENTPs are the most controlling starter types, with ESFJ at second and the EXFPs further behind.
6	Because many of the famous “entps” that people think about are fictional two dimensional characters (amalgams of whomever writes them) - iron man, the joker, tyrion, etc., or actors/celebrities who consciously put on a public face for consumption.   These are all *bad examples* and extremes of what is supposed to be a normal human personality. \n\nIf order to type someone well, you really need to see a candid interview or interaction.  That’s why it’s easier to suss out the type of people like de Grass Tyson, Hitchens or Feynman who seem to have somewhat less variety in their typings.\n\nYou can also type people from their writings if they have enough variety and length so that their personality comes through.  That’s why I feel it’s relatively safe to type people like Hume, Voltaire, or Douglas Adams as ENTPs.\n\nWhen figures like daVinci get typed as ENTPs it’s mostly because “he invented a lot of shit and had a lot of hobbies”.   So while daVinci might very well have been an ENTP, that’s not exactly the best evidence.   \n\n
2	My guess is they would murder their careers in a heartbeat. Lots of ENTPS come across as arrogant when they speak, even though they really aren't being that way, and while they can be incredibly charming at the same time, that could easily be misinterperted as narcissism/ manipulation due to shitty communication skills in general (for the younger ones at least). Famous people, especially in the entertainment industry, tend to have a team that carefully grooms and coaches them how to behave so they come across a certain way and avoid scandals, etc. An ENTP's PR team would probably be suffocating just for the simple matter that people generally tend to misinterpret this type's intentions. 
1	By the time they are famous, quickly they need to observe what expected of them. Defiantly, keep thier true Entp at home, so make it difficult to detect. Infact most matured entp show thier true self only in the right place. 
2	"You Si me? Flair me! " is it a mbti pun?	Cause I always thought it is but now I'm randomly wondering if I understood it right, or if it's not simply because it is how you say the word "see" and has nothing to do with Si as a function (also, as inferior Si pun it does amazing. As Si is a out details, and flairing post is a detail) 
6	Si
1	Yeah, it's a pun lol. Although, I've always pronounced it by each individual letter (i.e. *"Ess-eye"*), but as a word I still wouldn't pronounce it as *"see"*. I'd pronounce it as *"sigh"*...which is maybe weird? But, Pi is pronounced as pie so there's that.
1	Ok
1	No u faith yes.
45	How to Change One's Mind	
5	I hate people who talk too much. Took 150seconds to get to the point. Interesting video 
3	Interesting. Next debate I'm going to try to observe and apply it. \n\nCheers
2	This reminds me a bit of Rogerian argument. Makes me want to see 12 Angry Men again. Thanks for sharing!
2	I was skeptical when I've read the title (sounds like eristics), but looks like it's not that bad. It's actually all about making opponent not feeling attacked.\n\nAlthough I don't like a part about skipping arguments that someone criticizes, unless his critique is valid. That is unless the argument is not that important to the topic as a whole (i.e. a side note).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd the movie sounds interesting, I think that I'll watch it.
1	Tactical dot.
1	I'm not watching this because I'd rather not know if it's easy enough to put in a video. I change my mind enough as it is, I don't need to streamline the process. 
0	am i the only who doesn‘t want to watch this because i don‘t want to be influenced and do it my way
9	The Truth About Narcissism	
2	I like that the video states that narcissism doesnt make you a bad person by definition, Im weary whether there actually are "good people that live virtuous lives" amongst those with the condition. It gives the video a positive ending that it does not necessarily need. In any way, even if that is the case, narcissism is no excuse for wrong doing and should not result in reduced punishment in any way. In fact like with psychopathy, a healthy society should keep a watchful eye out for people like that.
1	Narcissistic behavior should be punished appropriately, severely, and relentlessly. The best part to attack is the Narc’s poor communication skills because bad communication is the biggest source of trouble for casual acquaintances of narcissists. Some narcissists can be useful to others and should be kept around, but they start to become parasitic assholes very easily.
7	which practical tools discovered by you are good for effective planning and fostering the ideas of entp .. [some assumptions and requirements for this]	1. the idea is to quickly save our brilliant ideas\n\n2. There must also be a quick graphic record of ideas\n\n3. we need to know what date and link the idea is (to find it)\n\n4. there must be an editable text version of this idea\n\n5. must give feedback to other people (even infj :-)\n\ndo you have something?\nmaybe a mail sent from a cell? prt sc on the computer, photos of notes and doodles?
2	personally i always use the memos/notes app on my phone. i have 3 different documents: 1 theories 2 inventions 3 business ideas\n\nand these are categorized with\n\n/# 1 (short title to make it easy to find, example: # 1 Dependent Consciousness)\n\nand then i write a very brief summary of the idea so i can just come back anytime and use it as the base to brainstorm about it again\n\nTheories\n\n/#1 title\n\n[content]\n\n/#2 title\n\n[content]\n\nInventions\n\n/#1 title\n\n/#2 title\n\nlike this. :) i hope you got what i mean it‘s hard to describe without a screenshot\n\nit‘s practical bc it‘s always on your phone and easy to edit, it doesn‘t even take a min to capture your ideas\n\nand the ones that i want to dig deeper into, i have Word Documents on my laptop names as „Project/ Suicide Prevention“ „Project/ Number system“\n\nin the Word document i capture all links, pictures, further explanations, like a brainstorming mind map
16	Dealing with addiction as an ENTP	Being aware of the present is not our strongest point so I find it extremely hard to tame my weed, porn and cigarettes addictions. I believe that embracing solitude and boredom is the only way out but I just can't seem to do it and always distract myself. Meditation also has been extremely hard due to low energy levels and a lot of mental fog. 
15	Solitude and boredom is what drives you to this behaviour. I used to wake n bake every day and would smoke the rest of the day too. When I went travelling any cravings just disappeared, because I was in a stimulating environment. New people, places and things. \n\nYou need to fill the void man, work out, start a cool hobby and do more with friends. Thats the only way out.
5	Channel addictive tendencies into something positive/productive? Exercise maybe? Creative projects? 
4	Jesus. I felt this. Weed and alcohol, porn sometimes.. huge roadblocks in my life. If weed is ever in my house I can’t NOT ever smoke it. Sometimes I would scour the floor of my room looking for bits of bud I may have dropped after I ran out of it... I’ve had 2 previous jobs in which I got lots of cash, and I have no money to show from them seeing as how all the money went to weed lol. I’m 17 but I’ve recognized my addictive personality for what it is. I found that being content with life is the best way to deal with that shit. You can’t function normally without feeling content. 
5	Attend 12step meetings. 
3	I'm a recovering crack addict of over 30 years and IMHO " embracing solitude and boredom" is not the best option. An ENTP mind needs stimulation. During my first year I kept myself busy by working 2 jobs, disassociated myself from my old friends that used, and found new non-drug using friends, also played sports. During that time I also learned something very important for me, "Once an Addict Always an Addict" I transferred my addictive behavior to things like playing basketball, reading, video games, cigars, and exploring the mind. 30 years later I am a successful person in the I.T. world in my area. I own 2 businesses, and I am rarely bored. I have a positive outlook on life, even though to some people I can appear to cynical, sarcastic, and stoic. Growing up Spock was my idol :-) What I'm trying to say here is to look at another option "It is the working mind that is a happy mind. It is the idle mind that is the miserable mind." for an ENTP
3	Excersize is great for keeping busy and also helps you sweat out toxins.\n\nAnother thing that I heard helps with deeper-seeded addictions is to go to a safe place with a good friend and take some mushrooms and mediate. It can really help you feel your body and gain new respect for your health and motivate you to rise above your "primative urges"/delaying instant gratification 
1	Fight boredoom and u Will find u need less and less drugs if u got anything fun to keep u from drowning on It,  look ar ir Life and ask u what was fun for u and try doing that.
1	I don't have an addictive personality, but I do have an insatiable one. I crave the new and different. I want to explore, and for a time that meant dabbling in various drugs. I got a bit carried away, mostly with pot. For me, when the novelty wore off, and I felt I couldn't get anything more out of the experience, I felt it was time to quit. I also am a bit of a self-improvement junkie, and I felt it was holding me back from progressing or taking on new challenges, if that makes any sense. I was useless when stoned. \n\nI don't know that I have a lot of advise here other than to allow yourself to dream about the person you want to be, and what type of things you might want to achieve, and let that be your guiding light to start doing something different... That may be crappy advice, I dunno. 
1	I wouldn't be at all surprised if ENTPs as a group are higher in a personality trait called "sensation seeking" than most others in the MBTI. I chain smoked cigarettes through most of college, and even now as a grad student it's a struggle to stay off them. Same goes for alcohol, particularly wine, albeit to a lesser degree. \n\nAs far as solutions go, I strongly doubt that there's a panacea. Two things have helped me, though: 1), evaluate your social circle to see if you are hanging out with drug abusers. I include smoking marijuana daily for non-medicinal purposes in that category, as well as binge-drinking alcohol on a regular basis. 2), get ahold of a notepad to document how many cigarettes you're burning,  how many drinks you have, how often you smoke weed, watch porn, etc. Every time you do it, simply chalk it down in that thing. You'll get a better idea of how bad the problem is and, upon seeing the numbers, may even feel guilty enough to cut back. \n\nBest of luck. It's a daily struggle, but can be helped. 
1	Self-criticism help me overcome all kinds of addictions, when i was quitting smokes, i remember asking myself every time i get desire to smoke "Is this who you are? a worthless piece of shit that is addicted to little white sticks? you are pathetic" and  because of my huge ego, i couldn't allow myself to relapse because i would be beyond crushed 
0	NoFap has so far brought great results for me. Just went for it cold turkey and althought I'm horny all the time and run across acres half naked (Idk either), it really helped me. In which way? I have no idea, but if I fail I fear that I also fail my water fast so I'll just keep going.\n\nGood thing that prostitution is legal in Germany so if the urges get too *hard*, I can always get a helping hand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis has next to zero to do with your post, I know.\n\nReason being that I also **havent found a solution yet**, I'm trying to "fix" it cold turkey now.
10	ENTPs in the performing arts, what is your stage presence like and how confident are you up there?	Just curious because I have sing Earth Song by Michael Jackson in a week and im sort of nervous. Any advice? I just don’t know what to do with my self alone on stage when I’m up there...
8	When you feel nervousness, tell yourself it's just excitement. Makes a world of difference. :)
2	Convince yourself you are the character, that people aren’t seeing or judging you, but only the character you’re portraying. I do this with acting but it works for other performances. In your case they can only see the singer, not the person who is singing. As a bonus it makes your performance that much more powerful too. Good luck!
2	Much like the Leafy one says *use* that energy that your nervousness is giving you. Also, practice *can be* boring, but you keep doing it until it's second nature and even when you're nervous you just fall into the muscle memory and let that carry you until you realize that you already doing it and you don't need to worry about the start. That's actually one of the biggest things I've found on the stage. People get worried about what's *going* to happen. If they stop thinking about it and just go into the work that they've already put in it goes smoothly and then they're just excited because it's happening and the fear goes away.
2	What is the difference between Bono and God?\n- God does not go around the world and he does not pretend to be Bono\n\n\nBono is known throughout the world for his commitment to help the needy and active participation in various types of humanitarian operations.\n\nDuring the U2 concert in Glasgow, Bono interrupts singing and silences the audience. Then, in complete silence, he claps his hands every few seconds.\n\n"Every time I clap my hands, one child dies in Africa," he says into the microphone.\n\nAt that moment a male voice speaks from the audience, with a strong Scottish accent:\n\n"Stop quitting, you sick fuck!"
1	I used to perform in my teens, stage presence was average for the most part, it really didn't bother me being up unless I made a mistake, I'd blush heavily but carry on. \n\nPublic speaking seemed to be more my forte over performance.
1	In an entp actor, I get over nerves by reminding myself that I'm not doing this performance for anyone but myself. If the audience don't like it, I don't really care- as long as I'm confident in it myself. 
1	I stopped being nervous during performances the moment I noticed the spotlight was too bright to allow me to see the audience
1	I went to theater school when I was younger. I was always very confident when acting - and told I had great presence. I think that's because it didn't feel like it was me up there - I was a character. It was helpful to put up that fourth wall to sort of block out the audience. But, I tell you - I loved it. There's no greater high than the post-performance adrenaline, and sometimes I really miss it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe best pieces of advice I ever got when performing was to commit to any action you take on - don't second guess yourself. If you feel like doing a hand gesture, commit to that hand gesture. But don't do something just to do it. You have to play the reality of the scene/piece so if something feels unnatural, don't do it. Also, a good way to get more natural on stage when doing a song or a monologue is to practice your piece while you're doing something else. Act out or say the lyrics of the song while ironing, or washing dishes. This will make it a bit more natural and you may even find some movements that feel natural that you can replicate when you're alone on stage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think performing can be a bit hard for an ENTP, because we're not always in the moment and tend to overthink. Which is why I suggest doing your lines, song, whatever while doing other activities. It helps it become more natural. Practice alone in front of a mirror if you can as well. Seeing how things look can be helpful. Focus on a few spots over the heads of your audience so you're not looking right at them, and let them fade away. Project from your diaphragm. Resist the urge to fidget. When singling, I always found holding the mic helped me to have something to do with my hands. Do you have any choreography to go with the song? 
1	I'm a music major maybe I can help, i perform very often 
3	Why are you curious?	I’ve always thought I’ve been curious to learn things because I seek to understand all the different perspectives and possibilities\nHowever recently I noticed that even when I learn all these new things, I don’t retain it in my head. I can’t recall it to the T, details and names are such buggers to me. So I thought, what’s the point of me being so eager to learn all this useless knowledge when I can’t even remember them..? \n\nMaybe I’m curious not to understand knowledge but to question them. If it’s because I want to question them then it isn’t pointless even if don’t retain the knowledge in my head. But I’m having a hard time differentiating between the two.\n\nI’m about to start college and I hope I don’t find learning to be pointless because of these thoughts. I’m trying to find a an incentive to be curious, so I won’t think it’s pointless.\nWhat’s your two cents? 
5	Simply because I don't like not knowing the answer!\n\nIf you don't ask questions, how do you expect to truly understand the world we live in?
3	I'd love to know why I'm curious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhehe
1	Im curios because it keeps my focused on something until my curiosity gets saciated and i have an intellectual understanding of the topic, and i need to move on on the next curiosity streak im into.\n\nIm curioius because the alternative, would make me insane with boredoom and addictions.
1	I also feel like I constantly forget the facts and details and sometimes even general relations between things, but I think just because we cant access it on the spot, doesnt mean we forgot it. The thing limiting what we can know is not the storage space in our brain, but the time we have to learn things on this planet, so im sure your head doesnt delete it to "save space". I think whatever you read is still somewhere in there, forming the general world view, notions and gut instincts you have about things. And then someday you'll be like "ive heard somewhere that" or "ive heard this before" and you have two cents to contribute to every topic. 
1	> However recently I noticed that even when I learn all these new things, I don’t retain it in my head. I can’t recall it to the T, details and names are such buggers to me. So I thought, what’s the point of me being so eager to learn all this useless knowledge when I can’t even remember them..?\n\nStop trying to learn facts and focus on understanding instead. If all you learn about something is the nomenclature and labels, you haven’t really understood much.  Understanding requires a deeper study, more time, and is generally harder.\n\nFor instance it’s trivial but somewhat useless to memorize naked facts like the stamen and pistil are the male/female parts of a flower but then not being able to point them out when shown a flower, or describe how the reproductive system of a flower works, or say something about plants that don’t have flowers.\n\nAnother more stark example is learning how to do arithmetic. You can compute 14 x (15+ 46) even though you’ve likely never done that particular problem before, and moreover, you can generalize it to figure out what something like (😑+🤑) x (💂🏻‍♀️+🥾) should be.   That shows you understand the concepts of arithmetic.
1	To make connections and therefore to understand. With understanding comes learning 
1	Cause I’m bored 
1	I've been asking this to myself for such a long time. learning feels good, and understanding how something fits reality is like solving a really hard mathematical puzzle, but better. but why does it feel so good? is that all that there is to it?
2	Does anyone else? [Shit post]	Shit posts? Or post shits?\n\nWhat shit is the best shit to shit post, as opposed to how solid or big the shit should be in order to justify putting shit in the post?\n
6	this is so quirky and unique, I've never seen a joke like this *ever* before
5	Podcast Recommendations?	For the New Year, I'm hoping to start listening to podcasts. What are your guys favorite podcasts—the ones that really make you think and can lead to one of those euphoric speed-of-light futuristic idea trains? I'm in college and I love computer science, sports, and sneakers, but I'm really open to anything. 
5	I grew really fond of the Joe Rogan Experience. He invites interesting people and talks to them longform, which allows everyone to expand on topics, go on tangents and just finish saying what they want to say. I like the one where he invites scientists, but others are also interesting when they just talk about life. It really nice when you are doing activities that dont really force you to focus a lot on what you are doing. Like driving, cleaning, sorting things idk
3	I’ve been listening to Life in 2030 from Quantumnrun and it’s been really interesting, I highly recommend it. It’s a relatively quick series of about 20 minute episodes that explores global challenges and tech innovations through the next 5-100 years. Their predictions are well researched and about as good as you can get for trying to see into the future. They have a website with hundreds more detailed predictions too ( quantumrun.com ).\nPodcast is at https://www.quantumrun.com/podcast/episode_type/life-in-2030
1	[The funniest](http://www.mydadwroteaporno.com/podcast/) thing ever. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nInterviews with [Amazing people](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b015sqc7/episodes/player) .  \n\n\n&#x200B;
1	Sam harriss has a lot of AI guys on. Those were dope.  \n  \nSean carrol started Mindscape which is dope.  \n  \nI also love Your Moms House and rogan too

1	You probably already saw this many times while googling your question, but 99% Invisible is really good. It's available on youtube too.
1	Not really a podcast, but I like to go back and watch the Ali G Show every once in a while.
1	If you enjoy history, Hardcore History with Dan Carlin is really good. Kept me entertained for 5000km of driving last summer. 
27	Older-ish ENTPs who don’t have a significant other, what stops you?	For ENTPs who are over 30 and are single, what has stopped you from having another person in your life? And if you have, what ended your previous relationship? What advice can you give younger ENTPs who are going into relationships or want to be in one?
49	I used to have really bad destination addiction. In my last relationship, I recognized how happy I was and how great my partner was, so I became laser focused on the future. When would we get married? What would our future look like in five years? Etc. I spent so much time thinking about it and putting pressure on the issue, that I totally neglected the present. By the time the relationship had ended, I realized it had been over for my partner for much longer and there was zero opportunity to save it. My advice would be to stay present and that things work until they don’t anymore. 
8	I am overweight and lack structure in my life, therefore I do not feel like there is something to present to the world and would come off as intense when finding interest in someone.\n\nI wish that I would have realised that becoming emotionally mature would have saved me from losing "the one". I've had plenty of relationships and have dated plenty as well, only having to find find out that I am very bored and having heard to be both rather immature and harsh in my relationships due to wanting to be funny and new-thinking whilst also being in control since I lacked being able to control myself and my emotions. I was afraid of my own feelings and believe that I projected my own insecurities onto my surroundings and basically made sure that my relationships would come to an end and then move on to the next one...\n\nI wish that I hadn't been the Don Juan and "Breaker of Hearts" in my younger years and that someone could have shown me the path of MBTI and self-improvement during my late teenage years and early 20's.\n\nI am now on a path to make a journey to lose the weight and to focus on becoming more educated and to work in the fields that I know will be the most suitable ones work me!\n\nBeing more active on Reddit and try helping others as I help my self is also a goal.\n\nTL;DR: I wish I hadn't been emotionally immature/afraid and would have been better off if I would have been introduced to MBTI early on in my late teenage years.\nBecome emotionally mature as soon as possible. Find stability in life. Structure it!

13	I don't think I qualify under the conditions set, (I'm 26) but for me it's all about freedom. I don't have an SO because at this point in my life because I don't think I'm ready for all that it entails. It seems to me that I can't give what I think I should in a relationship and still do everything I want to do at the moment.\n\nAlso, happy new year to everyone. May 2019 be the year every wish comes true. (And the Falcons win the fucking super bowl...)\n\nEdit: Fuck the Saints
7	I'm 57 years old I've been married one time for 17 years and had four wonderful kids with that relationship. I have been single now more than I've been married and I like being single simply because I value my freedom and I like the idea of being able to do what I like to do when I want to do it. Now I have been in relationships and I'm currently in two open relationships where we have no expectations of each other, other than spending quality time with each other when our schedule allows, and that works for me.
4	I'm 31. Had a long term relationship from 20 to 23 which resulted in a kid together. Been single ever since.\n\nI ended it because I got bored. And she just wasn't my type in the end.\n\nAfter that I almost started new LTRs, but got really burnt on some very insecure gals that had too much baggage. So I built up a huge emotional wall and started focusing on my career instead. Now my walls are so tall I have now clue how to get started with dating again. I really want an SO, but am unable to figure out how to proceed. When you're young you meet people all the time. At parties. Through mutual friends. It's very natural. But now everyone's working and/or having kids so my weekends are either spent on gaming or with my kid.
3	Really, my only goal is to do what I want to this year. Freedom is my value, and that's really the only thing I care about. 
6	I've been in relationships and I'm over 30. I just left a marriage/relationship of almost 8 years.\n\nI have a hard time staying committed to one thing because I'm so inquisitive. I want to know more about every subject and that includes people. When I am in a relationship with the same person for a while, I get bored. I want to go meet new people. For some partners, that's difficult to handle and jealousy can occur. \n\nI obviously managed to work through that issue to some degree but I didn't think either of us were actually happy with the arrangement. You have to find a balance with a partner who supports your curiosity and doesn't get jealous of what you find. You need to try to be conscious of your partner's feelings and not take it "too far" for their comfort.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nEdit: typos 
2	I’m 24 and never had a relationship. Plan to keep it that way for a while.
1	I think the main thing is always be intentional. If you’re arguing about something, try to remember what you hope to accomplish from the argument. Basically “be present”. \n\nI don’t have one because it’s a lot of work and I have a fwb or maybe open relationship? Lol who knows 
1	I like to be alone for the most part. Really I just need sex and im still good looking enough to get it casually.
1	Not single but it seems heading to that divorce thing. \n1. Don't marry someone who is not your match, mbti or education level, and life experience. Go above or some where similar otherwise you get bored with thier silly routine. Need some kind of challenge. \n2. Don't marry or have a kid before going to premarital counseling\n3. Freedom is important, most Entp like more than one partner, get bored over people and things easily, see all your options before I do. \n4. Be calculative, don't use your N for this, use your T. Process it in detail. Don't be naive, don't, I know Entps are lazy check detail and diffetent aspects, trust me on this one, push away your N and receive feedbacks from friends and family, take your time, be detail oriented. It will save you aheart aches. \nGood luck. 
1	You want relationship advice from people that are not in relationships?
5	How do you function with hypochondria?	I've heard that's it's the domain of inferior Si, so if you are hypochondriac, how do you manage? I find it extra hard,  and even tho I do go out and do things I'm constantly afraid that I'm again gonna feel bad again, have stomachache or faint or any of those things.
3	I was a major hypochondriac at 18 and 19. Honestly, the only thing that helped me with it was getting rid of my ego that somehow I was this “statistical” exception to everyone else and that I would somehow actually get all of these sicknesses. It’s irrational. I think what helped me was talking with people about it....\n\n....Honestly I’m not super sure how it went away. It just sort of faded over time. I know that’s not helpful in the slightest...sorry, ha.
3	I got sucked into that for a couple years when I was super stressed.  I got out of it by calming down.  Literally, destressing decreases hypochondria.
2	I just accepted that I was going to die of something at some point. Still have to remind myself every so often.
2	I have OCD, which contributes to/is the source of any of my hypochondria. There have been times I was convinced that I had AIDS or, another one of my irrational thoughts with frequent flyer miles, that I had gotten a cold sore and now had herpes. Super stupid, I know. Anyway, what seemed to help me was asking myself one question - “If I do have x, y, or z, is my stressing out about it going to change my situation?” The answer, of course, is always “no.” \n\nNow, you seem to be asking for advice about the worry involved prior to believing you have something. It sounds eerily similar to the way OCD has plagued me. For that, I recommend looking into Inositol, which is a vitamin known to help with intrusive thoughts and anxiety. I will tell you, Inositol saved my life. The other thing that I started to do was to train myself to abandon “what if” thinking. This type of thinking becomes addicting, even though it tends to only bring pain to the thinker. You’ll be tempted to swap out the words for synonyms as a sort of negative thinking leeway, but don’t. Instead, focus on just being aware of your thought process when you start to feel the welling of fear/anxiety about what is yet to come. You will notice that most of your negative thinking is wrapped up in words that can always be reduced to “what if.” As soon as you acknowledge that and become more aware as it’s happening, you can start to retrain yourself. Your worry isn’t worth sacrificing your happiness. You’re right, some random affliction might kill your physical body, but constantly panicking about it is bound to kill your overall quality of life. Why be a corpse ahead of schedule? \n\n
2	My hypochondria was a double-edged sword when I had my first period of it: On one hand I diagnosed myself with 7 types of cancer I didn't have and on the other hand, it started my journey into the world of self-improvement, so basically, thanks but you can fuck off.\n\nI have hypochondriac episodes from now and then but I've gotten better at managing them. The first time I had it I was on the summer holiday in 9th grade. During the school year, I used to chew a lot of gum and drink coffee every day and the gum irritated my throat and I started coughing and the coffee probably contributed to anxiety. Summer hits and I get to sit inside my house on my PC way too much, combine that with my coughing, lack of social interaction, and my lacking diet at the time and you have the perfect recipe for depression and anxiety.\nIn August I decided to get more outside time because I just couldn't do with this shit anymore and things started to look better. Once school started everything went back to normal, finally happy (I also made some changes to my diet and I added occasional exercise which is good). Got another anxiety episode in the winter vacation that made me even more focused on health, and then I hit an anxiety episode this summer and winter but these were way lighter than the other 2: got bit by a small dog -> irrational thoughts about being an exception to rabies; got a small pelvic injury from exercise -> yeah that's prolly cancer right? no. Anyway, basically I'm getting better and better at not freaking out.\n\n**The tips:**\n\n- I know it's hard to rationalize with your irrational anxious mind but please at least try to acknowledge fake symptoms caused by anxiety. I can give you the example of my pelvic injury. The pain wasn't anything crazy but dull and annoying. Once anxiety started to creep in on this symptom, a wider area of my body started to ache, but there's a flawed feeling in this pain that just feels a little different from real physical pain caused by a fist fight or something like that. It tries to replicate a duller version of the real pain but it feels in a **really** subtle way empty.\n\n- I know everyone says this on the web even though I still fail to apply it sometimes, but: **STOP GOOGLING SHIT FFS.** Fuck WebMD, Fuck Healthline and sites like that, they are good websites but not healthy for your mind. I know this is hypocritical but: When I get some symptom I search for it only once or twice because I don't want to go to the doctor before I don't rule out my bullshit anxious overthinking mind for basic, small health issues. **HOWEVER** I do my greatest to not get distracted by the more serious diseases that can appear on the page, I acknowledge them and rationalize them to my situation and the thought of having that disease fades away. Then I try to find a more reasonable cause.\nBeware that I only developed the skill of filtering this stuff only after a couple of anxious episodes of googling and wanting to change this. If you don't feel prepared to filter this, please, don't google shit at all.\n\n- Get outside of your head, keep your mind busy, get physical. As you've read above, giving my mind no interesting occupation means there's a lot of time to wander around, which is not good. Go swimming, go socialize, go masturbate in a hot tub, go run, go skate, go play music,  your mind needs stimuly so it doesn't search for its own. Occupy your brain with good problems. \n\nNe - Si is a bitch sometimes. In it's healthy period it finds solutions to your problems and it executes the solution, in it's unhealthy periods it finds a problem for every solution you have. Now with some work you can choose if you want STDs from your bitch or only good quality sex.\n\nThe anxiety is momentary. **Et hoc transibit.**
2	Step 1: Tell others that you're a hypochondriac.  \nStep 2: Now nobody believes the lies your subconscious tells  \nStep 3: ???  \nStep 4: Profit\n\nSource: Was a hypochondriac, this got it out of my system.\n\nPS: Meditation also helps.
1	I can't. Visiting doctors and doing tests regularly is the only way to prevent it I guess. Last year I thought I was suffering because of lung cancer. For the last two months, I thought I was HIV+ because of some common symptoms. Thank god, I am not dying. Live a healthy life, visit doctors regularly. It's the sole solution.
1	Deep breathing like the wim hof method. I think this plus sleep and food and exercise is 80% of the stability factors for a human.  \n  \nFeel free to ask about stuff.
7	What in your opinion makes an individual extraordinary?	If not ENTP please state your type
20	Being able to admit they were wrong or that they didn't know something. \n\nThe people I've met who do this easily, willingly, and honestly (not just lip service, they really mean it) are the best leaders, the most innovative problem solvers, the fastest learners, and the humblest people I know. If they are exceptional in any one of those categories, an open mind towards their own potential mistakes or lack of knowledge elevates them from exceptional to extraordinary. 
15	Positive people with that spark in their eyes when they tell me their passion. I have no idea what type they are. I'm esfp
12	Someone who thinks completely different than me, but can explain their logic. Someone who can do things that I can't, or that most people can't. 
6	Someone with the ability to keep up when I jump through topics. Someone with the same nihilistic optimism I have.
6	Someone who has a plan AND ACTUALLY EXECUTES IT. Now THAT is something so admirable to me. That level of control is something I crave. \n
8	someone who can think beyond what everyone else has thought of. 
2	awareness, motivation, kindness 
2	Their ability to exert themselves
2	People who can stay completely calm and reserved when faced with something incredibly provoking, trying to understand the situation first rather than acting on it
3	Is there a way to see the overlapping/mutual subreddits that the users of r/ENTP have in common?	It would be cool to see how many mutual subreddits we all have.\n\nSome predictions:\n\nr/dankmemes (obvious)\nr/bonehurtingjuice, r/antimemes, r/prequelmemes\nr/pcmasterrace\nr/cryptocurrency \nr/savedyouaclick\nr/DIY\nr/iamverysmart, r/niceguys, r/delusionalartists\n\nBased on interactions on these subreddits I feel like ENTPs gravitate here. I obviously have no data though. Anyone who can make this happen should totally do it!\n\nAlso throw suggestions for some subreddits you'd think another ENTP would enjoy
3	r/ENFP\nr/discordian (maybe)\nr/powerfulbadboys 
3	R/unpopularopinion
2	r/niceguys is the only one out of those I'm subscribed to. \n\nReddit (perhaps intentionally) doesn't publicly publish lists of subscribers by subreddit, which means there's not a place to pull data from to aggregate this kind of thing. Best we could do would be post some kind of poll here, but that'd be a self-selected group and so you couldn't necessarily extrapolate anything from that data. But it might at least be a good way to find subreddits you might like.\n\nPeople do that [every](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/9v8q3i/what_other_subreddits_are_you_guys_subscribed_to/) [so](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/669ud9/what_other_subreddits_do_you_guys_follow_or_take/) [often](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/5a4n05/fellow_entps_what_are_your_favorite_subreddits/) [though,](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/5hq6my/what_subreddits_do_you_frequent_most_often/) [if](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/3w7jcf/what_are_your_all_time_favorite_subreddits/) [you're](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/3y6v99/what_subreddits_do_my_fellow_entps_enjoy/) [curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/39fq2z/how_many_subreddits_do_you_guys_subscribe_to/).

1	I agree with all except for PC master race, don't get me wrong, my dad made computers for fun and because of that I had my own since I was 3 (full freedom 😜) but after I built my own with my money at 15 and the motherboard fried a year later it just killed it for me, plus now with no need for pcs for social media with phones, most of the best games are on ps4 even a lot of vr, and any games that do go to pc are just horrible ports pc isn't that great anymore. I do really miss mmos as a kid on pc though and all the flash games, newgrounds was basically my life haha
1	I should be in r/pcmasterrace and r/DIY damn it.\n\ninstead of dankmemes, ive got memes, wholesomememes and programmingmemes (not for long for any of them. I only joined because some Discord friends are too)

3	Very interesting (and accurate) article. Bohr and Heisenberg were absolutely correct: physics is a *model* of reality. It's not reality itself, which is a subtlety most people miss. But this is nothing new, and certainly not restricted to the quantum realm.\n\nEven in basic Newtonian physics, we can write down so called kinematic equations, assuming no friction and constant acceleration. In some problems, you'll be asked to find how long it takes a particle to travel from point A to point B, given its initial speed, distance traveled, and acceleration. The resulting equation is a quadratic equation in time (which means you'll get *two* independent, possible solutions for time). Often one of the roots will be negative, but we reject it as unphysical.\n\nPhrased another way: we have unphysical artifacts in our mathematical descriptions for physical phenomena. Part of the skillet you learn as a physicist is recognizing which parts to reject as unphysical, which parts to keep as physically meaningful, and how good is this model at describing what we observe? \n\nThis is where quantum mechanics comes into play. It's helpful to have a little bit of an overview of the history that lead to quantum mechanics. As the article explained, physics had always been a cause and effect type of science. When they began studying the diffraction pattern of waves, they noticed some peculiarities. The [image on the left](https://images.slideplayer.com/25/7598459/slides/slide_1.jpg) is the result of shining a laser through a circular hole (a very tiny circular hole). The resulting image is what we call the diffraction pattern of the laser, and you see *discretized* red spots. This discretization is what a physicist calls *quantization*. \n\nFrom the naked eye you can count the rings, and measure the separation between the rings in that diffraction pattern. Physically, we can describe this as an equation as D = An, where D is how far from the center you see a bright spot, A is a collection of terms, and n is just a counting term (1, 2...).\n\nNow a quick detour to wave functions. The famous double slit experiments revealed to use that particles can sometimes behave as waves. [This](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSebLLCN1cToq2Sd9NoSL2akEc1nD9DbRfWo6LASlUxYAzaAmCQ) is what happens when light is shined through a double slit. It's a wave. [This](https://wp-assets.futurism.com/2014/10/Two-Slit_Experiment_Electrons.gif) is what happens when electrons are fired through a double slit—you get a diffraction pattern! So a particle must act like a wave. \n\nBohr and de Broglie had also made arguments for a wave description of particles (for instance quantizing the electron orbits around nuclei). The eventually lead to a wave description of particles in the form of *Shrodingers equation*. It cannot be derived. It can only be prescribed. \n\nShrodingers equation is meant to give you the *wave function* as a description for the wave (even an electron). Due to the nature of the equation, we obtain *quantized* solutions. This is a fancy way to say we get solutions described by simply counting. \n\n[Here's](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Hydrogen_Density_Plots.png) a diagram showing the wave function solutions to the hydrogen atom. The equation is a complicated mess, but it's dependent on only *three* integers, which we use to count. The pictures give you the ordered set of numbers that describe the atom (#1,#2,#3). \n\nAt its core, that's most of what quantum mechanics is. It's just counting. It's about discretized modes of operation (which ironically, Einstein was a pioneer in with the photoelectric effect (which is what he actually won the Nobel prize for)).\n\nBut there's an issue here. An electron is a particle. It's not always a wave. How can we say this wave function description properly describes a particle? It gives rise to the wave particle duality, which philosophically puzzled the physicists of that time. The immutable fact they had to accept is that matter is both a wave and a particle.\n\nThere was a lot of debate also in how to interpret these wave functions. On the one hand, they describe what we observe really well. On the other hand, they imply probabilities. Remember the hydrogen atom picture? Turns out if we want our wave function model to work, we need to invoke probabilities for each of those possible set of numbers. We say that we have to sum over all possibilities. Some are more likely to occur than others, but the physical description requires a superposition of all modes. (Sidenote: this is something we see even in the most advanced areas of Physics too, especially in quantum field theory like Feynman's path integral formulation).\n\nIt's this peculiarity that troubled Einstein. For our quantum descriptions to make sense, they have to be probabilistic. To him, it simply didn't make sense for nature to exist in a superposition of disparate states. This is what Shrodingers cat was meant to elucidate: applying these quantum interpretations to real objects like a cat leads to absurd paradoxes (a cat can't be alive and dead at the same time). \n\nThe conclusion physicists reached is that it's an artifact of our mathematical model. We have to remember that physics is a model of reality, not reality itself. Just like how we reject negative times in our solutions, we rectify this artifact by saying the wave function *collapses* to its observed state, which is a specific probability.\n\nIt raises a few philosophical questions though. Like if nature, for instance, *doesn't* behave like this, why does our model work so well? To the best of our understanding, this is how nature works (probabilistically). Which is just another way to say that our best model to date is probabilistic. 
1	Some believe God or Gods play by the rules of chance and completely random outcomes. They base their decisions on the role of the dice. Snake eyes, horrible things happen. Seven, good luck, etc...
1	I think it's about concepts, or was it religious? that's not what he said it was a series about him from 2017, I think\n\nEinstain also fought against theories that do not fit his assumption of the constancy of the speed of light, on which his philosophy grew\n\nhowever, he did not find a reason to win with quantum mechanics ..
1	Everything happens for a reason? 
20	Have you ever interrupted an relationship by accident?	While talking or discussing about something with girls, if they have relationship, their bf gets in a jealousness with me. Even If I'm not even trying to flirt with their girl. While talking I could make jokes, go in to deep subjects (not kinky) but idk does it look like rackjacking from outside?   \n\n\nIt's hard to understand people's values like morals or ethics or sth'.   \n\n\nWdyd in these situations?
23	It's just that ENTPs tend to have that charismatic aura around them and they often look like they are flirting, when their intentions aren't such. I know this is more of a stereotype, but that's most likely your case.
7	let‘s say that most bfs aren‘t able to connect to their girls on a deep level or their girls might not laugh at their jokes as much. they‘re jealous as to how you manage to do things to their girls they can‘t do themselves. anyways fuck them lol not your fault
4	You have to talk up the bf whenever possible.  If the gf cuts him down, do what you do best and argue with her. They will both like you much more as if you do that. It shows good character and a lack of need for validation from the bf. The bf will also think that your on his side.
3	What does it take to make you angry?	What type of things actually make you angry? Not just annoyed, but really feel anger. As far as I can tell, I haven't experienced this emotion in a long time and am wondering how I compare to my fellow ENTP in this regard
11	It doesn’t bother me quite as much as it used to, but when people make false assumptions about my goals / personality in general, it can upset me.\n\nFor example I make beats that I make for fun and put them up on SoundCloud, I put lots of effort into them, but I have no interest in making it a profession. Despite my clear indifference about being a huge artist I’ve had people tell me I’ll never make it/I’m delusional. One of the people was an ex who I assume was just trying to get a reaction out of me, but it still hurt.\n\nAnother thing that really bothers me and has me going on rants to myself is when I see online marketers who are obviously part of an MLM or is selling an overpriced course, target people and use their inexperience to the industry to make a quick buck by selling them the dream. 
7	Am I the only ENTP that is highly irritable? Lol I feel like there’s a lot of things that piss me off. \n\n**Non-reciprocity/people taking advantage of me**: I used to have a roommate that would sexile me until 2 AM on a frequent basis. I honestly didn’t mind since I knew she had an LDR and she only got to see her boyfriend on the weekends. However, the one time that I needed to use the room she pretended she was “sick” so I couldn’t use it. I got pretty fucking pissed off because I hadn’t gotten laid in months and told her that she was never allowed to bring her boyfriend over again. I think that got the message across. Generally, if I feel like I’m bending my ass backwards for you and you don’t reciprocate, that angers me. \n\n**People crossing my boundaries when I have repeatedly warned them**: Don’t get me wrong. As an ENTP, I love to debate but I also realize when debates can become non-sensical or just downright insensitive. My friend and I got drunk and somehow the topic got onto asexuals. I said life must be so much simpler as an asexual. He disagreed and said that there must be something genetically wrong with asexuals, since biologically our goal is to reproduce as much as possible. And then the conversation went down the slippery slope of how he thought all LGBTQ people and women who didn’t want to have children were biological failures. I warned him several times that we should stop talking about this as I have many friends who identify as LGBTQ but he kept on going until I basically exploded at him. So yeah that didn’t sit well with me. There have been other times like this where I’ve gotten pissed off, because (surprise, surprise) the debate just isn’t fun anymore when you bring Nazi ideology into it.  \n\n**General pettiness/trying to cause drama for no reason**: Lived with a girl who saw me as a threat to this guy she had a crush on but who had NO interest in her. Cue all the pettiness and nasty side comments that come when a girl sees you as competition. Surprisingly, this girl also identified as an ENTP but I suspect she was an unhealthy, insecure one. \n\nThat’s all I can think of at the top of my head right now. 
5	Unlogical bullshit and people that think they can prove their point by being grammar nazis. 
6	I agree with OP, I haven't felt true anger in forever, I definitely get frustrated, especially over anyone who is incredibly ignorant and closed minded, people who are overly obnoxious, liers, etc. But you would seriously have to go out of your way and try something personal to really get me heated.
5	People acting shitty to the people I care about. If someone does something mean to me, I tend to brush it off. But if someone does something like that to a friend or family member, I'll start seeing red. I'm really protective of the people who matter to me. I can be pretty confrontational in those situations, and that's the only time I can actually hold a grudge.
3	Being manipulated by someone that has an unfair advantage over me. 
1	Let's think together.\n\nPressure. Self inflicted or otherwise.\n\nBut no. Let's go deeper. Pressure is relative to time, if there would be no time how can you get pressed?\n\nSo time makes me angry? How?\n\nDo I value/identify myself as an efficient time-spending machine? i.e. not an imbecile, not stupid...\n\nThat's right. I have built an image of myself, of someone who is pretty good with time, efficient. \n\nBut then the outside reality hits and the scrupulously built image turns out to be just that, an image, identity shatters and I feel terrible fear, like a child who has lost his parent's hand in a crowd!\n\nSo what does the brain does? It puts more coal into the boiler. "We have to get our identity back! We must not lose it!"\n\n"Get angry!"\n\nAnger is like self-flagellation that stimulates you to do action which is a reaction, to what we just described. It could be mental action, a thought, a conclusion, or purely physical, impulse based.\n\nWe are always in the grip of reaction which has stymied our evolution.
1	personally when someone crosses boundaries even though me having warned them several times about it. i admit i get annoyed pretty easily, but it‘s never serious. but if someone really lacks respect towards me and think they could handle me like shit, insult, belittle me etc even after telling them they have gone too far, i get angry.\n\nbut my anger doesn‘t look like an explosion. i just get extremely silent and have a serious look on my face. and oh lord better don’t come near me in such a state\n\nsame as you when ppl make false assumptions and i have to justify it/ defend myself\n\nbut yea these are all instances where i get angry but it‘s internalized. throughout my life i‘ve only had 2 explosions, and in both i was still in control of what i was saying and doing.\n\n1st was bc an enemy told me she‘d ruin my life by making all my friends betray me and she already did once and threatened me again\n\n2nd was for my parents after a lot of shit happened and honestly i had all reason to flip out. actually i forced myself to explode at them bc if they tell them with a straight face how it angers me some people just don‘t take it seriously, so i forced myself to actually explode at them
1	People assuming my motives or thoughts is a big one. I am a very direct communicator and will tell you when something is important to me and I think it is the appropriate time to do so. Having somebody assume what I’m thinking is very aggravating. As is people assuming my future actions or reactions like “if that happens you’re going to just do ______” please fuck off lol. I have no idea what I would do and neither do you. 
1	When my mom ignores me because I've made her angry (she's more feeling than I am). When someone tells me I can't do something. I actually get angry quite often but normally it is other people who make me angry. 
1	 Debating with no fact. When people only accept thier truth and judge everyone, lack of awearness. 
1	Anything competitive. Any sport or game I’m playing just starts to fill me with rage. The wrath just builds and I start shit talking. Then if I start losing I start yelling and shit, have to cool my jets. Other than that, condescending people. You’re not smarter than anyone else, and if you are, you just aren’t intrinsically better. Your dumb ass still has to die, like everyone else, so fuck off and be a better person, ya cunt, generally how I respond to this people. 
4	What is the most “ditzy” thing you’ve done lately?	ENFPs are always the one stereotyped as ditzy, but I think it’s just because ENTPs respond to their ditziness with sarcasm and self deprivation rather than positive silliness like ENFPs do. So...what’s the dumbest and silliest thing you’ve done lately?
10	....\n\nSigh. I was late for work last Friday, woke up, gasped at the fact that I slept through my alarm, stood up from my bed in a hurry, tripped, and landed face first into my piano keyboard. Blood everywhere, called out of work (ironic), went to Instacare...and it turns out my piano went all the way through my bottom lip. I now have six stitches on the outside and four on the inside of my mouth. Also I cracked a tooth in the process which luckily didn’t need be tampered with. I was really worried about my tooth (more than my face) because well...I mean you don’t fuck around  with your teeth ya know? It’s like fucking with your eyes or something. That stuff doesn’t heal.\n\nBy far the stupidest thing I’ve done in a while. Even dumber than when I was 13 and pressed on the breaks of my bike too hard and flew over the handlebars, breaking my arm. 
8	Was driving to NY from VA. Solo car trip, beautiful day, so I'm blasting music and singing along, having fun. See a "Welcome to North Carolina" sign and realize I'd been driving the wrong direction for two hours to start my trip. 
5	Got distracted doing the dishes, flooded the kitchen. Again. This month. \n\nI blame having twin toddlers.
3	Sliding on frozen sidewalks cause it's fun and lighted up a smoke while doing so. Ended up twisting my ankle (still have to get it checked though, can't walk aargh want to go outside) and here I am laying here celebrating new year by sending pics of my right foot to my friends.
1	walked against the same door twice within a week
1	Went to get a mug of coffee. -Grabbed a drinking glass instead of a mug -then traded it for a mug before realising there was no coffee -opened the silverware drawer for no reason, then closed it -opened the cabinet, almost put coffee in the machine without a filter -almost forgot the water -started the coffee machine before putting the pot in it. 
5	What do you like and dislike about INFJs?	Just curious to see what people here have to say. I know this has been done to death, but I am curious what you ENTPs think about INFJs? 
17	I think INFJs are genuinely well intended. Like...I think deep down they *truly* think they are trying to help and are doing people a service. If you just let things be on the surface, they’re pretty cool people. \n\nThat being said, they have this amazing ability to make you feel like you’re legitimately crazy once you become closer and closer to them. I don’t think they mean to do it, but their minds are a complete wasteland for anything factual if their intuition goes against it- and they will vocalize it in such a factual, “duh”, and blunt way that they just make me go “Wait what the fuck?” It’s fucking maddening. Everyone’s like “LAWLS INFJs are ENTPs match cuz they’re the only one that makes an ENTP stumped”. Yea, illogical craziness does stump me. Not sure why that’s romanticized. They just turn me into someone I dislike.\n\nI am also not sure where people get this warm, friendly, helpful, selfless idea of INFJs from. Every INFJ I’ve known is as cold as ice and can be really self centered once you get to know them...and I don’t even think they’re aware of it because their perfection oriented mind would never fully accept that, lol. \n\nAlso why does everyone always say they are decisive and driven??? Driven and decisive toward getting all of the trophies in a video games ya sure cool- but all of the ones I’ve met are just recluses who are way too anxious to ever be what most people would consider decisive and driven. Decisive and driven people don’t have so much anxiety that they can’t even get their drivers license until they’re 21, lol.\n\nI recently had an ENFP friend who ditched his INFJ friend because “It’s like he just wants to make everything confusing and wants to make me feel confused. But I don’t get it because he is always confused too. Also...why can he make everyone feel crazy but the moment you tease him it’s a big deal? I just don’t want that in my life.”
7	I’ve only met one INFJ before, I’m pretty sure, ever, so it’s hard to judge. From my experience, they’re much better on paper. Definitely very spiritual and deeply emotional. INFJ’s are fun to try to figure out. On the down side, they often seem quite self-centered (with the whole, “I’m so deep and I understand so much about the universe” mindset some have). The INFJ I was friends with was often offended by my self of humour, and he never seemed to really understand what I was saying, or even me as a person. He thought he knew me, but really didn’t. It seemed like we were trying to communicate on different frequencies at times. INFJ’s, in my experience, are pleasant to talk to, but not for a long time. 
5	I have a difficult one in my life at the moment. It's very hard to work out her intentions, given that she is nice to my face, but then rather rude about other people, so it makes me wonder what she has to say about me when I'm not there. She comes across as extremely cold (& I'm married to an INTJ...), with little sense of humour: completely unable to laugh at herself.
6	I looooove infjs, but it's really because they're hilarious to me. They take themselves so seriously, and they have this complex about being the rarest type to the point that they demonize infps and intjs. That being said, they have this vibe to them I really dig. I call it "ni poise". Intjs have it too but infjs are better at it. It's mostly just confidence about what they're saying
5	Like: Deeply engaging; nice people; mean well.\n\nDislike: Native sense of superiority; overly emotional; covert sense of princess syndrome, gated ceiling of rational input on most complex ideas (Ti never truly getting the better of aux. Fe).\n\nThey’re saintly people, but in my experience (and theoretically speaking), not the type that I could sustain any lifelong relationship with. I require more mental novelty from an NT (ST to a lesser extent) than a lot of INFJs I’ve met are capable of giving.
1	Negatives: Ti. Gets overly offended at my jokes and can't rationalise once they are offended. Very stubborn and will rarely conceded a point as they are emotional before logical. \n\nPositives: Fe. General altruism, Reads your Fi like a book, Interested in things (especially me), Hoplessly ​romantic, Helps give perspective on social situations

-1	> I know this has been done to death, \n\nWhy don't you google it then?
2	If an afterlife exists, do you think you would be a different type?	If you don't think an afterlife exists, then it might not be a good idea to respond.\n\nIf you believe in an afterlife, go for it.
4	No. Why?
2	Unlikely.
1	Yeah. But I think the negative aspects of them might be tamed. 
1	[Insert joke about ENTPs being the perfect type]
1	There's no you, there's an identity image and it "dies" with the body. The mind is not of the body and will "die" when the universe will "die".
1	Jewdiasim believes the after life is unique to each individual. Essentially the spirit experiences G-d'lyness seeing as each spirit is individual it has this experience in a unique way. 
1	You will turn to a butterfly. 
23	I need an INTJ partner or someone to implement all these grand ideas that I have lol.	I really wish I had a partner to think of all the small details in my big ideas. Someone to go through with my plans and use my ideas in real life. To bring my imagination to life!! 
53	if you're dependent on someone else to make your ideas happen, you should *probably* not be in a relationship
11	LOL you think INTJ is the right type for small details in big ideas? NTJs have plenty ideas of themselves.  \n\n\nYou need a sensor, like ISTJ.
8	Ideas are a dime-a-dozen. The hard part and hence most valuable part is always the details and the work needed to implement and the people who can actually do that are too busy implementing their ideas to care about doing yours for free, especially if yours are half-baked and fall apart under scrutiny.\n\nLearn to flesh out and implement your own ideas, whether that means learning to actually do things yourself, learning how to be able to get capable people on board with your idea, or coordinating the funding and structure to outright hire and pay competent people.
6	I can do that...for money!
6	Well first of all an INTJ partner would not be much better at detail than yourself. We intuitives are generally not great with details. \n\nAlso ENTPs have it in them to be detail oriented as they have Si in their function stack. It’s just their last function so it’s a challenge. \n\nNo one can do something for you because that would be a dependent relationship. It’s not healthy, whether romantically or not. \n\nBuild yourself and find people who encourage that type of empowerment. 
4	Serious answer: ideas grow on trees, they’re cheap. I have like a dozen notes on my phone with “business ideas” or “YouTube channels ideas” or “book ideas”. The devil’s in the details.\n\nThe key is to find a process to implement those ideas that forces you to be creative and inventive throughout the whole process (or at least throughout the majority of it). Research the f out of stuff, think hard about new solutions, look for ways to make things better and implement and ask yourself what you actually *can* bring to the world through your projects, and getting stuff done will become easier.\n\nOh, and read “so good they can’t ignore you”, it’s the perfect book for ENxP types.
3	Boy... When I hear some ENTPs' entitlement to their ideas... Assuming others should implement their ideas...\n\nOut of curiosity, share some of these ideas here. (I'd like to see if I'd personally be inclined to implement your ideas)
3	lol we all need a pocket INTJ
3	I have a friend who’s an INTJ and he gets shit done for himself. But whenever he’s around we actually get nothing done. Same with an INFJ. They are both very good independently, but when I hang out with either of nothing gets done. At all. I think I’m the problem as to why crap doesn’t get done.
4	Radical idea:\n\nWhat if you decide to learn to become someone who can implement your own ideas? 
2	That’s how I felt when me and my INTJ ex split.  I then realized I like implementing my own ideas and watching them grow.  It’s much more fulfilling than just having the idea, telling people about it, then forgetting about it.  \n
2	If you dont change that view you will never accomplish anything. 
2	Yeah, INTJ wouldn’t be a good fit for this. You need a solid ISTJ. But the real answer is that you should really develop your own sensing function. 
2	Find yourself an ENTJ 
1	From experience, I think that organizational skills and shared enthusiasm are more important than type when it comes to choosing a collaborator. \n\nIn almost all my collaborations (creative, academic, or professional), **I've** been the organized one, weirdly enough.
1	/u/InTheMindOfM3 what are the ideas? an example?
1	I've been around some I think to have been ENTP. So it's like I know what they are going to do before they so it. So I try to catch what I think is going on and stop it before it gets out of hand.. A part of the learning process is is to know what your doing and correct it at that time. 
-1	U an ENTP?
30	Why Small Talk is Painful for an ENTP	
37	I hate small talk, but I have always struggled with my selfish tendencies. I tend to not actually care about other people’s lives unless I have some sort of emotional investment in the person.
16	[deleted]
11	Think about small talk as emotional, cultural, pacing, and diplomatic protocol negotiation. There are mysteries to unlock and trust to be earned. It's also discipline for concentration and long game improved relationships and information exchange. \n\nYour high speed extroverted intuition is unfortunately off-putting for far more people than you realize. Many of not most people fake responding to those conversations just like you feel like you're'faking' small talk.  Other types are more polite than you. You hate small talk, but they hate conversation hogging ENTPs, only they are much better about not being blunt assholes about it. \n\nThink less about the words, but tone, pacing, eye contact, physical spacing and comfort... But try to be genuine. \n\nYou will find if you quiet your Ne, you're tertiary skills can grow, and you might learn some things. \n\nThis also helps with the ladies. \n\nYou'll do best if you internalize this and learn to connect to your emotional self and not overstimulate your NT and become a psychopath by mining the information I just gave you and incorporate it into your programming. \n\nYou're welcome young Padawans. Learn from my mistakes. These realizations came FAR too late in my life for my own good. 
16	This is an issue for all young Ns, especially Fi users: because they find polite, inauthentic interactions especially draining.  \n\nPeople don't want to be boring so it's good to work on ways to politely steer conversations to where you can both enjoy them.  I think this is greatly helped with age, provided that you spend your time learning and doing things.  For example when people start listing off exactly what they ate you could steer the conversation towards cooking "Oh was that good?  What do you think was in it?  Uh huh cool yeah I've been wanting to cook that for awhile.  Do you cook?  Oh you bake huh?  Do you have a favorite recipe?"  If you don't cook then talking about food is generally going to be boring.  \n\nAlternatively perhaps study the history of food.  Or of sports etc.  I like to steer sports conversations towards the anthropological implications, etc.  I am letting my conversational **partner** know that I prefer to talk about such things.  Someone who is good at small talk will dance with you in this way.  \n\nIf you are making other people always lead the dance, and half engaging in it, you're both going to be stepping on each other's feet.  
8	ENTP and I'm a waiter, personally I think it suits me well. While I don't REAAAALLY care about the guests, I like constantly doing something different, starting and completing the small tasks involved, and of course, the small talk with it. \n\nFast pace dynamic environment, you control your destiny (sort of) with the tips you earn
5	So I get this to a degree. I don’t hate small talk but I do find that I can take or leave conversations with people who don’t open up I guess. I worked in phone sales for 13 years and ran my own gaming business for 4 so small talk is par for the course and I think it helped me to develop my ability to both deal with it but also to make it and that’s really helped me round out my skills.\n\nI’m still always far happier talking about the bigger picture or if I connect at an emotional level with the subject at hand though. I work in Community Development now for example and our office almost never shuts up. Most of what we do is big picture theorising and it’s amazing. I don’t even need to be 100% articulate because we just bat around ideas.\n\nThat all said, I’ve started to really hone in on my weaknesses now and I’m making a conscious effort to build on them (Si’s continued desire to cling to old habits is driving me insane). I think being mindful and genuinely in the moment is one of the key skill we need to learn if we want to be truly great individuals. Maybe read some Eckhart Tolle or something. Discovering some inner space away from your own thoughts has been really handy for me. 🙂
10	I love small talk 
3	Been thinking this "ENTP" thing is just bogus but jesus christ i relate so much to this community that i feel naked reading most posts. Also, i fucking hate small talk and very rarely get emotionally invested in people and im a nurse lol, somehow it works out tho beacause i talk about other stuff and im actually solid as fuck in my field probadly beacause there is Always so many different things to do everyday.
2	in small talk i usually start talking about myself i think. or more like about my *opinions*. i literally add my opinion to every small talk topic, which makes it more interesting for me, but might make others think  i‘m only talking about myself. but if anyone has something to say, they should just go on and say it. it‘s not like people come to you specifically and ask you about your opinion like a special invitation. i talk about myself so are you free to talk about yourself too.

Ian Malcolm's conspiracy theories come in handy for once.\n\nProtagonists + detective(s) of your choice evade shady enemies as they attempt to uncover the gruesome secret before they find themselves on the killing floor or victims of the park's mysterious malfunctions.  Is Hammond a cult leader?  Is Henry Wu cutting feed costs while engineering a brand new line of GMO meats?  Have the Murphys found themselves in the middle of a political scandal??  Only time and a stroll through the dangerous park shall tell...
1	None it’s perfect 
57	who knows how much time we have left	I went to get some lunch today, and while I was ordering my food this lady was carrying around her husband in a wheelchair. They were both a very old couple, the husband couldn't even talk and he just pointed at whatever he wanted to eat at the restaurant. I don't usually go on thinking like this but fuck dude, I mean one day that could be any of us. That could be anybody, like who fucking knows when shit will go wrong. For some reason that really affected me. \n\nThis also made me realise that we don't have a lot time. Especially us ENTPs, we never just finish the things we want, we never end up fully completing that we want, we procrastinate. But imagine if one day something really terrible happens to us and we can actually never achieve our goals because of that. Get up and do something. I think I should. It's ironic that I'm posting about this on reddit and tbh i dont even know the point of this, but I guess I just wanted to say this.  \n\nWe should get off our asses and make shit happen, for real. 
12	I like this and I think about it at least once a week (not to this degree. But often ) \n\nWhat I'm trying atm is really forcing a B/W view of procrastinating: Sit here and feel miserable doing nothing, or be productive and let time fly. \n\nI have a goal to move out of my parent's place and it's been a long time procrastinating it (3 years). I'm saving up for a class that'll help me move. It feels too real, but I'm dreading every minute I waste doing nothing (w/ the exception of this comment)\n\nSo with my previously mentioned tactic my thoughts are "You could spend the next 2 hours looking at Reddit. Or the next hour+half studying for that class then 30 mins of listening to new music" (the latter being VERY rewarding)\n\nI try not to let these concerns drag me down; instead letting them push me to achieve the things I want (job, social standing, coffee grinder, the like)
6	Yeah, I keep on thinking I will accomplish such great things in life and “change the world!” all those stupid ambitious dreams but truth is that I know, Time is running out and I’m not that special to be that 1 in the billion that could make a difference. 
4	I worked as a CNA for a long time: can confirm that growing old sucks10/10 don’t recommend after a certain point.
2	i think about this everyday and that‘s my #1 fuel to *do* sth. time is running.
2	> Especially us ENTPs, we never just finish the things we want, we never end up fully completing that we want, we procrastinat\n\nThe only real reason half the types “finish” stuff is because they only every try to do a handful of things.\n\nEntps abandon more projects because they’re always starting them.  But that is also how we learn things.  
2	As long as you're aim to be happy at every point in life and you choose the things that make you happy then what does it matters what you accomplished. Accomplishment, finishing a thing or achieving a goal means nothing if you are not happy and were not happy getting there. At least that's what I think.\n\nThings that will make you happy at  every point in life will be diffrent. So at 20 maybe playing a video game will make you happy, but when you're 90 it may be going to a restaurant with a person you like.
2	The best think I did (three years ago)was narrowed and focused on things that really matters for me. Which things would bothers you the most, if you couldn't  accomplish them? Start there. We don't have much time left so make sure you try your best to enjoy everything and everyday. 
1	Let me just say, it's not every entp that never finishes anything. Just cuz we don't like doing stuff doesn't mean we don't ever do anything worthwhile
1	Thank you! I needed this. I’m a horrible procrastinator with way too much potential.
1	I sleep 4 hours a day to be more productive. Next level is turning into a machine. 
1	Time is of no importance, complexity is of no importance. Choices and actions are of no importance. The trajectory and speed of a comet has no motive and yet we are in awe of its grandiosity.\n\nWhat gives?\n\nNot reacting, not creating time is the only action there is. It has to be the next step if there is a step. Of course by then these words will be dust settling on a surface.

6	where does the line draw for confidence and arrogance?	For example let’s say I doubt myself to be able to do a task, that stems from the fact that I know I lack the skills to carry out the task successfully. \n\nBut forcing myself to do the task by telling myself “you can do it!”. Is that arrogance or confidence? Arrogance is to exaggerate your capabilities while for confidence it’s more of a matter of “Oh I do have the skills but I don’t believe in myself” ...right?\n\nSo when people say they have confidence by “faking it” till they make it, that means they have no “skills” in the first place but they act like they do so they can be confident. \nIsn’t that called arrogance?not confidence? \nWhen does confidence turn to arrogance? Isn’t faking confidence arrogance?  
17	Arrogance is loud, confidence is quiet.
7	The distinction can at best be roughly made by example.\n\nI'd say an integral part of arrogance is insecurity and the attempt to fill it with an inflated sense of self worth. Arrogant people need to feel superior to others, if not they feel crushed. This constant need for outward affirmation can lead arrogant people to put others down and be cruel at times.\n\nConfidence is more innate, a fundamental trust in your abilities and worth. While it initially is still derived from interaction with the outward world in the form of accomplishment and how you perceive others reactions to you, it is much less fragile and doesnt need to be reaffirmed.\n\nAs for your question, it's neither really.
6	There's no line; they're opposite ends of a spectrum.\n\nArrogance is born of insecurity. It comes from comparing yourself to others and basing your self esteem on it. That's why the ego of an arrogant person is so fragile, why they're always primed to overreact about any perceived slight. Because they need to keep believing (and aspire to keep everyone around them believing) that they're *better* than everyone else; that's what matters to them.\n\nConfidence, on the other hand, comes from having a healthy sense of self-worth. It's not reliant on external circumstances, it's internalized, it's not based on comparing yourself to anyone else.\n\nArrogance says "I'm better than", confidence says "I'm good enough". An arrogant person can't feel good about themselves unless they're the best, and so they'll tear other people down if they feel like their position is being encroached. A confident person is proud of the progress they make, no matter what level they're at. They want to help people that aren't as far along as themselves, and they want to learn from the people that have gone farther. They don't see themselves as competing for rank, and the only thing they aim to beat is their own personal best.\n\nI'd say forcing yourself to take on a new challenge, even if you're not sure you have the skills yet, is confidence. Confidence that even though you haven't done it before, that you'll be able to learn what you need as you go, and that you'll be able to ask others for help if you need it.\n\nArrogance probably wouldn't even try, out of fear of failing, and looking foolish.\n\nMost people will spend at least some time being both, in varying measures. The best practice to avoid arrogance is to stop comparing yourself to other people - nothing good comes from it - dwell on your own strengths and the attributes that you're proud of, don't spend time thinking "I'm better than.." or "I'm not as good as.." someone else.
6	If they like you, it's confidence.\n\nIf they dislike you, it's arrogance. 
2	Arrogance comes off as condescending while confidence comes off as almost motivational. Arrogance usually follows the thought process of "I'm better that you" rather than "I trust in my own capabilities".
2	Using your example I would say in this particular instance it was neither. Acknowledging you don’t have the necessary skills to carry out a task but doing it anyway is just an awkward part of personal growth.\n\nIt can be really quite anxiety inducing and unless you’ve matured enough to have developed your tertiary Te, then externalising that lack of confidence may be difficult. Especially if you feel like not doing the task will likely lead to conflict. In carrying out that task to the best of your ability though you would develop the skills to carry out that task again with confidence.\n\nIf you’re anything like me, an overwhelming internal dialogue around yours and everybody else’s actions will likely be present. Coming to accept this for what it actually is (which is an almost pointless nothing) by working on your Si, will help you move beyond concerns for confidence vs. arrogance through an acceptance of just ‘being’. It’ll also make you more accepting of your Ne’s desire to just try things for the sake of trying them. It’s part of what makes being a ENFP so awesome. We can be the jack of all trades if we just let ourselves.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\n

7	Is deadmau5 an ENTP?	I've been thinking about it, and always thought he was an ISTP, but him being an ENTP might make more sense.

1	That seems more Estp or esfp
66	Yeah most people are in fact dumb as shit	Most of the time people who say stuff like that get made fun of, but really man if you aren't stupid as fuck and talked to more than 100 people in your life you are **bound** to realize that. Most people just don't have to be able to map the world around them to an even slightly approximate degree let alone think with any resemblance of nuance. And you could actually make the point that this is even favorable for the majority of goals you could pursue. \n\nStill, fuuuuck those people. I used to enjoy arguing, but whats the point when most people just refuse to think one coherent thought? Yeah there is no point. \n\nYeah there is a sizable minority of people this doesn't apply to, but when I get out of my university bubble some people just leave me **aghast.** No, in fact most people once you get to know them and their opinions/worldview. How can they function as legitimate adults let alone the *world??* Granted the world is steadily ruining itself but *why does it not burn yet?*\n\nI'd like to purchase firearms but I fear that I might end up in jail for the rest of my life. Yes this wa a rant
31	Another one of these threads?? 
63	I remember I used to share the same opinion as you when I was 18.\n\n Intelligence isn't "Thinking with any resemblance of nuance" {puke} Intelligence is taking this life and making it work. Loving others. Loving a partner and raising a family. Intelligence is seeing the good in everything around you.\n\nThe fact of the matter is most people are intelligent, they're living day to day trying to be a decent person and not putting so much value on IQ or one's ability to argue. They just don't want to argue with you because you're a cynical asshole. You could have a genius IQ for all they're concerned. That doesn't mean they think you're smart and diserve respect.\n\nMaybe you're the one who's dumb as shit. 
16	Dumb people suck blah blah can't fulfill my needs for arguments blah blah. Fuck them hur dur.\n\n\nIt's not their job to stimulate your intellect, it's not their responsibility. Period. You want people to suffer your debates? Find peers on your level, and don't worry about the rest. They have their place and function within our crazy human built ecosystem of chaos. Educating them or removing them isn't your responsibility or right. \n\n\nIf you're smart/mature you adapt, you don't denigrate.

31	You know most people will call you an asshole for that opinion and maybe you are but you’re right. I’ve had conversations with most people in my house and I’ve heard some on the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard from them. \n\nMy brother doesn’t believe in statistics, as when I said crime has been down in the US since the 1990’s in general he countered saying that since he’s heard more news stories about pedos and mass shootings then crime MUST be up, even though i cited statistics from the CIA, Federal bureaus, etc.\n\nMy mother thinks that personal anecdotes equate to evidence and that the conclusions you derive from those experiences are “true to you”, this includes supernatural encounters, pseudo science such as homeopathy and reiki, etc.\n\nThe aid for my brother believes that ghosts are real and that they are composed of energy, and some humans are gifted with the ability to channel energy for healing purposes and others are gifted with esp. She also believes in homeopathy and crystal healing and whatnot.\n\nI get believing in what you want to but they have no standard of objective evidence or the scientific method, and it’s really sad.
8	A very very immature way of thinking. Jung's theory encourages us not only to understand ourselves but also others around us and be more tolerant of the differences. If you are actually as smart as you make yourself to be, you should've realised that by now because intelligence is not a score on a test but rather than understanding things on a deeper level in which apparently you failed to do.
9	If you honestly feel like you're the smartest person in the room, it's probably time to find a new room. There are people in the world doing cutting-edge research in everything from artificial intelligence to quantum computing to space exploration. Having talked to many of these people, they're consistently inspired by their peers and colleagues, not aghast at how dumb everyone around them is. If you can't figure out how to put your intelligence to use, you're probably nowhere as smart as you think.
7	There are people who are dumber than you and there are those who are cleverer than you. We both know you would prefer not to meet cleverer people who would look down upon you, which is simply not possible with those who are more self-aware, as self-awareness in my understanding is proportional to love, as you are able to see yourself in another person... and only the wisest of us see everything as one but fragmented, of course I am not one of them, I am still in the grip of my programming.\n\nAlthough I noticed that if I will give a person who's brain is racing with tradition, habit and identity a chance to begin a dialogue with me, if I truly listen to that person without judging, without shaming, after some time I can SEE something happening, as though something inside us is trying to meet on a common ground, and that something cannot be part of the limited known.
24	Dunning Kruger vs Imposter syndrome\n\nI'm actually in awe how all those 90-100 iq people appear so... well adjusted\n\nThey absolutely refuse to talk about anything that can prove they're fucking retards
5	I think what you are describing is not actually a matter of intelligence. Many people people who are reasonably intelligent are ignorant, uneducated or have not formally developed critical -thinking skills. I also used to love debate -  and still do enjoy discussing difficult topics with thoughtful, reasonable people - but I find that such discussions are in short supply, partly because our culture seems to favor the quick-witted and uncompromising over careful, nuanced reasoning. I have had rewarding conversations with thoughtful people who might not score well on an IQ test and  incredibly frustrating conversations with people who I know are smart but who demonstrate little reflection or humility about what they know.   \nWe all suffer from cognitive biases. The only thing we can reliably do about them is to admit them and be on watch for how they might figure in our opinions. Here's a simple test. Ask someone how they are likely to be wrong in their opinion. If their response is only sarcasm or silence, or more reasons to think they can't be wrong, it is probably because they haven't thought as much about how they might be wrong as why they are right. If they haven't thought about how they might be wrong they don't know.
3	To be honest there are plenty of delusional and overly outspoken dumbasses within my university bubble...and I go to an Ivy League University
4	Interesting post OP, sorry you are experiencing so much frustration right now. If you need to talk things through ever, PM me. Long tangent incoming, sorry in advance. \n\nSimply an observation that might be tinted by my own recent anecdotal experiences; it is incredible to me how negative-minded the people on r/ENTP are compared to r/ENFP. So much negativity, so often. \n\nIt is almost as though because ENTP’s are aware of how analytical they are, and how feelings don’t affect them in the same capacity as others, that they have the license to be more rude and cruel in their observations and responses to different situations. This sub seems to compound the negativity a bit, or give people an excuse to show it more.\n\nI think it’s a good thing that OP feels comfortable enough to use r/ENTP to rant, so this is not a direct criticism of that. As someone who tested consistently as an ENFP up until this past year (I test myself yearly just as a self-exploration exercise), I had no idea what kind of tonal shift I was about to experience between r/ENFP and r/ENTP.  However, it lines up with my own progression into a more strenuous, depressed life these past 12 months (law school + baby, so only temporary misery lol), where I became noticeably more cynical and angry towards people who are “idiots”. I don’t have the time to engage with them either, and at my peak frustration I feel exactly like OP!\n\nAgain, interesting post OP, sorry you are experiencing so much frustration right now. If you need to talk things through ever, about anything, PM me. 
3	That's fucking hilarious that this thread popped up again in a week. Only on r/ENTP do we need to get the point across twice that not every bulb in the box is very bright. But then again, everyone is *smart* at something.
3	I upvoted this just so more people would see it and make fun of you
5	I'm definitely not a fan of these posts, but I think this is still worth talking through. If you feel like this, I think real progress will happen once you accept that you yourself are in fact also mostly dumb as shit. If people don't engage with you on whatever you find interesting (and likely whatever you know a lot about), they're just into different shit, man. And whatever it is they're into, they'll be way smarter than you on that. Dismissing people entirely is not very constructive; you can always learn something from absolutely anyone. Generally you just need to make an effort to talk to talk to them instead of at them.
3	Both /u/Vannak201 's sentiment of making it work = intelligence and /u/ExistentialTomato 's point about many intelligent people being dumb shit are on point. I work in a college environment and see both sides of that coin in action on the regular.\n\nOTOH last year I started volunteering at the local dog park and was confronted with "delusional and overly outspoken dumbasses" that DO have low IQ. And just regular people in the 90-100 bracket who were but a smidge unreasonable. It made me realize the world of difference between talking to those people and my high IQ, smidge unreasonable coworkers. I felt completely useless and couldn't make it work, in that world.\n\nEveryone's a dumbass in the right setting.
3	What is it with ENTP's always being on such a pedestal?
5	> I'd like to purchase firearms but I fear that I might end up in jail for the rest of my life. Yes this wa a rant\n\nAre you a potential mass shooter?\n
4	I was just about to post something similar- although in a less direct tone. People just can't seem to come to an agreement, can they? If someone has a slight differing view from a majority group, they're automatically not viewed as human and antagonized. Why can't people just cast away their pride and make decisions for the greater of humanity?
5	> Most people just don't have to be able to map the world around them to an even slightly approximate degree let alone think with any resemblance of nuance.\n\nYou realize this includes yourself, right? Unless you want to claim that you are somehow the exception to a trait that encompasses "most people?"
2	I honestly feel the same way about people because I come up with awesome ideas all the time and have it shit on by people with no vision. Only to see it be used by someone else in the future. My ESTJ father told me he felt the same way when he was young because his father (my grandfather) and others used to shit on his investments. But then he realized that even though these people were dumb as shit that he had to socially engineer them to make them do what they wanted. Like a I scratch you back if you scratch mine sorta deal. I told my father about the famous Steve jobs and how he basically "never put a hammer to a nail". But yet he was able to make all these awesome apple products we see today. Then he told me about Nikola Tesla and how he was a genius but could never get along with people to the point that his invention were squandered away and never made possible. I was told he didn't even have actual family members who supported him that he would only feed pigeons and that was the closest thing to family that he had before he died. I do need to validate if this was honestly true. But the point stuck with me nevertheless.
2	“To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty” 
2	Other people don't live in their ideas and many simply don't care about whether they are true.\n\nAs long as their feelings somehow accept those ideas, it's okay. Many people live like that. And it's okay, it brings stability to the system.\n\nThis also has nothing to do with the intelligence (IQ & academic results in maths for ex) that matters in real life.\n\nHarvard and Princeton are full of religious people. And yet, I doubt you'd call them dumb. \n
2	People are as dumb in relation to how smart you are typically based on events out of both your control, how you use your intelligence is more important than potential. 
1	You forgot to mention how they are weak. People refuse to listen to facts or dissentig opinions and get uncomfortable or sad when shit is challenged. Fuck them
1	Fucker, DON'T go down that route (I did, this was what happened: [https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/aepzty/my\_emotions\_are\_gonna\_kill\_me\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/aepzty/my_emotions_are_gonna_kill_me_help/)) And don't even THINK to say you're not going thru anything like my hell, you cowboy and your guns.\n\nAlso, how much politics/news are you watching? Stop watching them!
1	This sounds like something an ESTP would say.
4	Any idea how to develop Auxillary Ti?	As an ENTP, what is the best and most efficient way to develop Ti? (besides Math)
6	Develop heuristics and systems. Read and read often to calibrate them both.\n\n
5	What's wrong with math? It's an excellent way to exercise Ti. As are formal logic and programming by the way. \n\nAlternatively, you could grab a non-fictional text and engage with the argument. Try to understand the underlying logical structure, spot contradictions and inconsistencies, etc. 
3	Coding and philosophy. Anything that needs precision and parsing details in sentences  \n  \nAlso why besides math?
2	It just naturally continues to develop whenever you’re by yourself. Math has nothing to do with it. I guess you can “accelerate” it by giving yourself things to think about. Read a book every so often.
1	Try to think about every possibility that could happen when evaluating a situation (wouldn't really recommend it though, eventually you'll just live in your head)
1	I'll second (or third) the philosophy for Ti - it's what I studied as an undergrad and it helped refine my thinking considerably. Math is good as well, but more "narrow" in the cognitive skills that it develops. 
1	Why besides math?  
1	Do not let your emotion cloud judgment. Practice filtering any external stimuli you receive from Ne and Fe through your Ti by stopping to analyze the worth of each and every thing that pops into your head. Take in your surroundings and plot out the how and the why of anything with value.
0	This is like asking how to develop Ne u dont.\n\nUr either creative or not.\n\nU either think or u dont, if u need to think better stop reading on the the Te based thinking approach and simply atain culture from as many sources u can, and learn to cross context, learn to create concepts, try understanding that that doesnt come easy to u, of course someone can develop skill in 2 diferentes careers that ar similar or closely related, but u will be relying in ur prior expertise, if u want to force ur brain to learn new tricks u need to learn things that ur not naturally good at, like if u suck at craftmanship and this kind of detailed work, force urself to learn something related forcingn urself to do something that is dificult and ur brain will be struggling to find answers, ull be looking for solutions instead of the same old lets google how to solve it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nu know what im going to do this week, change the wiring and audio from my car and also sound dampening , im not good at this kind of work, im good at electronics thoug but im not a handyman,i could call an istp to help me, but i have expended last days learning, and ill fucking do it, pretty sure there will be complication i dont expect because i have no experience on this kind of job, but still if something happens ill figure it out, ill always do, pretty sure when im done ill find the knowledge and skill solving adquired will be valuable on another field.
3	ENTPs- how did your view of and approach to relationships change as you matured?	As an INFJ, I was very cautious in relationships as a teenager, so I tried not to get too emotionally attached to the men I was with. This made it easier for me to break up with my boyfriend of 4 years. My ISFP sister convinced me I was acting like an asshole, so I decided to go all in during my early 20s and my heart was broken by two assholes in a row. Now, I am in my mid-20s and going back to being more cautious about love by using my dominant Ni and tertiary Ti to figure out if we even have a chance of working out before considering dating dudes. Yes, this means I have completely given up on long distance relationships. \n\nHowever, my view of relationships and what I want in a partner have remained constant. I view relationships as an exercise in teamwork. I will support my partner with all their endeavors and expect them to do the same for me. I hate fights and drama, and believe a relationship without harmony is pointless.
8	>I tried not to get too emotionally attached to the men I was with.

6	I've had several relationships lasting 3+ years and I am currently in one that is 10+ (with an INFP). \n\nWhat has changed is that put much less demands on my partners as I got older, and became more independent and accepting of the person my partner is.\n\nI think we get ridiculous ideas about how things are *supposed* to be in a relationship from societal norms which doesn't have to be true (or even constructive) at all. For example, me and my partner often travel without each other, we never celebrate each others birthdays/valentine/etc, we have separate circles of friends, we never buy each other romantic gifts, we never got engaged or married. I never met another person that would give me all this freedom, respect and independence and I am immensely grateful for this.\n\nWhat we do instead: We always give each other full respect, attention and an ear when it is actually needed, we always speak softly to each other, we touch a lot, like a hand on the shoulder or hug when we pass by each other, we make an effort to share all housework/cooking etc evenly, and we are just generally really secure in our decision to be together and respect each other. **We also always speak highly of each other to others.** We would never do that lame "I call my wife the government" or "my husband never buys me flowers" talk. These sort of depressing roles doesn't exist in our relationship. I feel sorry about people who live in such roles with the duties/expectations that follows.
4	Love is overrated, films romanticised it too much. It’s just a relationship. However love is still astoundingly amazing. Just not the kiss in the rain. 
3	In my relationships, it really depends. My current girlfriend I am deeply in love with and have been for all 10 years I’ve been with her. I kind of just dove head first for her and got fully attached, and we are so lucky to be as connected as we are, I’m truly blessed.\n\nThat being said, as a dumb high schooler before I started dating her, I was a hyper detached asshole who would typically lead girls on and then end up ghosting them entirely and not talking to them. I was afraid of real attachment and didn’t feel that I had the capacity to be emotionally invested in people. Thus, until late my junior year I was fairly aloof and detached in any pseudo-relationship I had.
1	I tend to get really invested in my SO's and then within 1-2 years their negative traits that they won't change weigh on me and I lose that affection I had for them. I'm not perfect by any means, but if someone tells me something I need to improve on I'll actively try to work on it for them and myself. I find that not many people are as willing to do that and I end up losing respect and romantic feelings for them. Here's hoping my current, fairly new, relationship is different.
5	Any ENTP + 4w5 characters in fiction?? Movies, novels, anime, I don't care. (are you ENTP 4w5?)	I'm an ENTP 4w5xo and I've kept finding [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/6r2t8g/_/) every time I google. While I am familiar with /u/wittyoriginalname as an incisive and insightful thinker regarding personality, I have to say he's just wrong on this. /u/fireice92's comment really captured the experience fantastically.\n\nUgh there's a book I could write about the experience, but I definitely feel defined by the very duality cited as the reason why an ENTP Four is impossible. \n\nWhen I was wondering if I was a Five, even finding some ENTP 5s was hard, as the facet of limited resources and introversion so integral to type Five just ran so counter to my own personality, even though everything else matched (hence my strong Five wing). Dr. House and Rick Sanchez are good examples of this, though, for any curious. (fight me, INTPs) \n\nAny characters you suspect could be ENTP 4w5??\n\nEdit: \nhttps://i.imgur.com/Jor2oKL.png
3	Boy, I tell ya... I have a real hard time reconciling Enneagram 4 with the ENTP type. However, I do identify with some 4 traits as a 7. I identify with 4 *much* more, in particular, when I am depressed. I also felt very 4-ish as a teenager. I wonder if ENTPs who type as 4w5 are actually 7s going through an emotionally tumultuous time?
2	I know this isn't helping, but what is it with this "4w5" thing? often times I see something like that eg "8w7", but I have no idea what that means.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ncould someone please explain that to me?\n\nthanks in advance !

5	Are you happy being mediocre ?
4	I think you'd benefit immensely from a blogspot or facebook account. 
2	Honestly... college grades are not that big of a deal. Get the skills you need to get employed, and explore some cool stuff in other topics that you may never have the chance to learn about again. College GPA is a somewhat important factor in getting that first job after college, but once you have that locked down, I've found (and many others I know have experienced this as well) that opening up more professional opportunities is all about your work experience, ability to learn on the job, and effectiveness in selling/advocating for yourself.

4	Wouldn't say former but I sometimes regress into INTP with my OCD and anxiety. Sometimes I just want to be alone because I can't handle it. Not sure if that counts?

20	I know, this has been posted 9031485x times already, but HOW CAN I STOP PROCRASTINATING ?!	as usual, I have like 293407532490ß53ß2045 things to do but instead I watch music videos on YouTube, scroll through reddit, swipe on Tinder (I legit have as much matches as an empty match box. literally. not lit), bli bla blub just to not do the shit I SHOULD've done not only today, not only yesterday, but basically for the past 1, 2 or 3 weeks or maybe half a year Idk...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsend help, how do I finally start doing what I have to do so the people around me stop annoying me ??
15	Some stuff:\n\nThis is an interesting read: https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html. Also, read the book 'deep work'. \n\nBlock online distraction. Pomodoro timer addon. Blocksite addon to block all procatination websites. Greyscale on your phone. Get a feature phone instead of a smart phone. Put your phone in flight mode during the day. Minimal possible distraction. \n\nThe reason I (usually) procastinate is when a task just seems to big. 'Man, to finish that will be a lot of work. HEY look at that, an endless stream of instant gratification.' Break it up into small batches. Focus on taking a small step every time. Will Smith has a nice quote: *"You don't set out to build a wall. You don't say 'I'm going to build the biggest, baddest, greatest wall that's ever been built.' You don't start there. You say, 'I'm going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid."*\n\nAlso, did you know Winston Churchill was mad about bricklaying? Anyway..\n\nSince you're 20, experiment experiment experiment. It's the best investment you can make. Do weird shit. Have weird jobs. Set a goal you can reach in 3 months and do it (e.g. buy a cheap scooter and ride to morocco, or whatever). Now is your time to do it. The world is way more interesting outside than behind your computer. Don't live your life through people who post on youtube.\n\nOn tinder. Getting stuff done and being something, doing something is way more attractive to most women than a cheap sixpack. Comes with the territory and your increased confidence. Source: not that handsome but heaps of sex, haha. \n\nNow that I'm 30, I'm starting to realise that time in finite. It is the most valuable resource you have. Make the most of it! \n\n\nGet to it my man! \n\n\n\n
12	procrastinate pleasures too. your mind is stupid and will believe it. "I will play xxx whole day, 18hours but tomorrow". Tomorrow repeat the same shit.\n\nAlso, it makes you more happy to fall asleep to make tomorrow come faster
26	Get your shit together and just do it. 
13	One day you are going to die, bitch. Think about what you want and do it for you.
5	Do it as soon as it comes into your head. Move, act; immediately. This is the only way, otherwise you fall victim to your own rationalizations and distractions.
4	Having seperate spaces for work/chilling is essential for me. Having substantial amounts of time completely unplugged helps me stay focused as well.
3	Lists. 
3	This is coming from a person who manages a team of 35 people, has a PhD, and a really stressful job, and has had a lifelong struggle with procrastination. \n\nThis podcast was very helpful to me and the host also published a book: \n\nhttp://iprocrastinate.libsyn.com/\n\nI would check out both of them.  Procrastination is a very complex process, and you will get a lot of responses from people saying simplistic answers.  You are dealing with a real issue and you should be kind to yourself.  Don't listen to sarcastic fucksticks, it is the case that procrastinators tend to be smarter, more creative, and more in tune with the world than the general population.    It turns out people procrastinate for different reasons, but one common theme is how we deal with emotional upset.\n\nI also found this blog helpful as well:  https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/03/procrastination-matrix.html\n\n\nI haven't cured my procrastination, but I control it much better.  Here are things that work for me, but you will need to go on your own journey.  The hardest part is to keep trying and evaluating things that work.\n\n1. Frame things that you have to do into a statement about why you have to do it, and note how you will feel when it is done.  ie I need to start working on this now because that means I can get a good night sleep and can be proud I gave it my best try. \n\n2. Acknowledge the things your a putting off or delaying to yourself and think about why.  I hate writing, I have a hard time organizing large amounts of writing, my grammar sucks, and it fills me with dread.  It's probably the thing I procrastinate on the most, but I try to acknowledge how it makes me feel.  Also, I have a weird perfectionism that ends up biting me in the ass.  If I feel like it won't be perfectly done then I start thinking why bother, I've learned to quiet those feelings through some mindfulness training.\n3. Check out dialectic behavior therapy. you can buy some workbooks, but the goal of it is different than typical therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy) in that it works on your ability to regulate and manage your emotional state.\n4. Pay yourself.  Things I don't want to do or have a really hard time starting I make a little bargain with myself.  I have an app that is for a productivity technique called the pomadoro method which is supposed to be a thing where you work in 25m sprints with 5m breaks, it has a countdown and sound to let you know to move to the next thing. I use it differently, I work on the shitty thing for 25m then play a video game ofor 5+25=30m and cycle.  It sounds stupid but it works so well for me it's easily the best thing I have learned for myself because I can take working on anything for 25m. \n\n3. Willpower is a muscle and it gets tired, it also needs to be exercised to build it's the strength.  Something that fucked me up when I was younger was getting mad at myself and trying to improve my procrastination all at once.  It won't work, just like going to the gym after being lazy all year and going all out will get you injured, the feeling you are having right now will cause you to overdue it and fail. Set small goals in improving if you can.  Spend your willpower on the things that matter, if you can outsource other shit.  I hired a housekeeper, I'm not super messy but I hate cleaning, I don't like it when it is a mess, but I found that forcing myself to clean was leaving my willpower exhausted for other things.\n\n5. Be kind to yourself.\n\n6. If you can afford it, go to a therapist regularly, if you don't like the first one, look for another one.  Procrastination is very complex and is full of irony, for some people it comes from a fear of failure, so they purposefully create situations where they will fail but can have an excuse. For me it comes from a weird perfectionism, if it won't be perfect, I don't want to do it. For others, it comes from anxiety, self esteem, depression, or any number of other reasons. \n\ntl;dr;\nYou are not alone, be kind to yourself, check out the links above.

0	Im great at focusing on a task, but bad at starting them, so I go with lists, as someone said before but the main thing for me is to separate it by the least divisible step of the task. So, if you need to do your laundry, I would list it as: “pick up clothes from the floor, put them in the laundry basket, take them to the laundry room, etc etc tc” that way you get a little bit of that completion high of ticking off things of your list and motivates to do more.

4	We live in a dystopia.	No longer is individualism recognized and encouraged. If someone has a view that differs from the majority, they are automatically considered an outcast (At least from where I am from). Why is there no effort to bridge the gap? This is so severe it affects modern day politics. Politicians today constantly throw dirt on their opponent's name and refuse to focus on more serious problems that threaten human existence. Do you think it's possible for us to one day settle our differences and work towards solving these problems?

The feeling of belonging is at an ALL TIME LOW, not individualism!\n\npeople calling you a shit for being different didn't like you anyway, but had no easy points to score when criticizing you before
15	We're not living in a dystopia. Objectively, things have never been better for large parts of the planet's population, even poor countries.\n\nAlso, the West is obsessed with individualism (or rather phony individualism) right now.
15	We live in a society.
8	A little ethnocentric are we?\n\nI like how you assume preference outside individualism is necessarily negative.

2	oh, look! someone who speaks my language!\n\nno jokes aside, i can relate to this a lot. i‘ve given up any hope for politicians so i‘m not going to comment on that, for me it‘s expected. but feeling like an outcast bc your opinion differs, is me. \n\nall in all i gotta say society sucks. in many many ways. but i have the same mindset as you, who says it has to suck? why don‘t we take any steps to make this shitty world a better place?\n\nif we‘re the ones that have ruined it, we can also fix it. \n\nbut unfortunately everyone thinks „it‘s hopeless“, but still think they have the right to complain when they don‘t even contribute to any improvement. 
1	\>Politicians today constantly throw dirt on their opponent's name   \n\n\nThat's true, there is a low quality of political discourse. Part of it is rooted in the way we consume information, easy-low quality discourse sells just as well or better then intricate reasoning. Media outlets just need to be good enough and diffrent enough between each other to sell, nothing more. Especially certain aspects of media culture thrive on manufacturing the narrative of conflict and winning/fighting.   \n\n\nNo one has time to write a whole Divine Comedy to ridicule enemies and why would they, if a twit is enough?

1	Why are so many people confused on these two types?
25	What are your parents like and how was your childhood?	Both of my parents are very confident and headstrong people but I wouldn’t classify either of them as ENTP. How were you raised?
25	emotionally manipulative INFJ mother and extremely tradition oriented ESFJ father. they were pretty strict, I never really wanted to be close to them bc of several reasons. I ended up feeling like the parent of my parents during hard times bc of how childish and unresponsible they handle situations.\n\nall in all I can say I feel like a therapist sent to this family who is responsible for order and harmony but at the same time lacks any affection towards them except superficial
18	Was raised by my dad, he’s an ENTP as well. We get along great and I’m like a mini version of him. Childhood was fine, although I’m sure I caused his hair to gray! 
12	My mom and dad got married when she was 17 and he was 20. I was born a year later and was a planned baby, despite how young they both were. My dad was in the military and worked as a jet engine mechanic. My mom, a high school dropout, worked primarily as a server. My dad did well, for a few years, before his mental health began to wane. A well-meaning buddy of his casually asked one day, "Doesn't it ever freak you out to think that if you make a mistake with an engine that someone could crash and die?" It was a stupid question, but it struck my dad and he could not shake the thought, no matter how many mantras he recited or how much anyone reassured him. He began checking and re-checking every single engine. He couldn't stop. He was eventually diagnosed with OCD and forced to take a medical leave from the military while he recouped. Not long after this resolved (sort of - he's still a feverish "checker"), his stint with the military ended and my parents elected to move the family back to rural Michigan, where my dad originally hailed. I was six and my sister was an infant. \n\nMy parents divorced less than six months after the move. My mom took my sister and me and moved us into a duplex in a tiny, podunk town in the northern tip of the lower peninsula. My dad ended up moving an hour south to a larger city and dove deep into his work. He was hired as a steel worker and was set on teaching himself to become a programmer. We didn't really see him a ton for many years, as his work took precedence over everything. He did move up, though, and became the programmer that he still is today. \n\nMy mom "supported" us with many jobs as a waitress or bartender, often both at the same time, and was always months behind on bills. Her mother, my grandmother, moved to Michigan from California to be near her, and there were many months that my sister and I would stay with her while my mom sorted out work and bills. I should note that my mom was one of 7 siblings and grew up emotionally/physically/sexually abused. My grandma contributed to the physical abuse my mom experienced, but never laid a hand on us grandchildren, as my mom had apparently threatened her life should she have ever touched us. This proved to be ironic, as my mom ended up exhibiting the very same traits and I grew to know the fear and sadness that a child of abuse comes to learn. Thankfully, sexual abuse was something I didn't have to experience.\n\nOnce I was old enough to comprehend/manage basic household skills (8 years old or so), I was set to the task of laundering clothes, washing dishes, and other tedious tasks. This helped relieve my mom of the burden of basic housework and gave her more time to work two jobs. She had every reason to be stressed, but she struggled at managing her feelings. I grew up being told that no one would love me when I was older, that my sister created her imaginary friend because I didn't love her enough (I was 9), and my desperate plea for help with depression became mocked as attention seeking and was oft referred to as being a "woe is me" attitude. Many a morning my mom would drive me to school only to turn around and take me back home because my lip was bloodied or my face was tear-stained and she didn't want anyone to think she was a "bad parent." There came a time when the principal called to see why I wasn't in school (I was instructed to tell her I was sick; it was a regular thing) and ended up telling me that either my mom had to start sending me or the police would get involved. I don't think I missed a day after that. \n\nMy teenage years were awful, but more manageable. I worked as soon as I turned 14 and I volunteered as much as a could. I spent as much time away from home as possible. My mom continued the physical abuse and routinely threatened to "send me away" because I was an awful human being. I ended up moving into my dad's house when I was 17 and it was the best decision of my life. \n\nWhen I think about my childhood, I tend to think first of the abuse, anxiety, and depression that I suffered. Sadly, I grew up to have OCD, like my dad, and I recognize now that I suffered from it even as a child. Thankfully, today there is so much more information available and I have done a great deal of work to eliminate 98% of my issues. I understand how fortunate I am. That said, the one thing that has always provided a sense of relief in my life has been reading. When I shove all of the bad things aside in my memory, the best part about my childhood is the thousands of books I was able to read, courtesy of the little library we had in town. I would brave the most menacing snow storm in order to have a brief exit from reality through the musty pages of a great book. \n\nToday, I am the most conventionally "successful" person in my family. I earned a degree, have a blossoming career, and am in nearly every way a stereotypical ENTP. My mom still has bat shit tendencies, but has in many ways simmered down into an "acceptable" level of crazy person. My dad, as I mentioned, did achieve the growth he'd worked toward in his field, but is still a wee bit off of his rocker. He recently sold my childhood home because he was convinced it was bursting at the seams with asbestos and had poisoned all of his/our things. He sold it for a 30k loss, threw out everything inside, and is now living in little better than a shack in the woods with a rabbit, a cat, and a hippie girlfriend my sister and I have lovingly nicknamed "Julie Patchouli." She's currently training (?) to be a certified yogi in New Mexico, so my dad has vacations out west to look forward to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
11	ESFJ Mother.\nISTJ Father\n\nThey were controlling and narcissistic. I'm still learning what a healthy relationship looks like and how normal people actually function. \n
9	ISFJ mom and an ESTP dad. Childhood was pretty okay, pretty normal at least the way I perceived it.\n\nAlso,I noticed that almost everyone in this thread has an IxFJ for a mother holy fuck.
5	My parents had me at a very young age (16y/o) were very hands off. They were also as you can imagine, very poor.  Essentially children raising children. They had a motto: "Do what you want, but the lessons and consequences are yours." Due to this I was able to explore my environment in a different way than most of my peers. I was able to find things that I did and did not like earlier due to not being sheltered. There were many times that I was scared and or didn't know how to handle certain situations, and they would step in and provide advice and guidance but that was rare. I got a job and started driving at 13, bought my own groceries and clothes starting at 15. All in all my parents style wouldn't work for everyone ; but it definitely made me more resilient and have a realist attitude towards life. 
13	Well we had it tough. We used to have to get up out of the shoebox at twelve o'clock at night, and LICK the road clean with our tongues. We had half a handful of freezing cold gravel, worked twenty-four hours a day at the mill for fourpence every six years, and when we got home, our Dad would slice us in two with a bread knife.
4	Emotionally unstable ESFJ mother and silent INFP father. \n\nParentified in the worst way. 
3	INTJ mother and possible ENFJ (a very unhealthy one if that) father. Mother was super cold and angry most of the time. She was very exacting and didn’t tolerate emotions or feelings well. Not much love in the house. She never told me I did a good job on anything, only how I could have done better or what’s wrong with it. Dad was extremely manipulative and explosive, highly emotional, basket case. He died when I was a teenager. \n  My moms a lot better now, remarried an ENFP. She’s a lot more open and compassionate. Still isn’t good about compliments or praise, but I’ve learned to not expect it from her. \n  
5	ISFJ mom felt like I was in jail. I LIVED on punishment lmaooo. \n\nForced to be indoors when I absolutely did not want to be. Forced to baby sit and do chores and be altruistic which is counterintuitive for me. Force, force, force. Judgment and critique on trivial dumb shit. Gender roles and irrational beliefs. Indoctrination. Emotional manipulation. Homophobia and bigotry. \n\nShe cut all ties w me after I got outed as bisexual so we haven’t spoken in an entire year. I was pretty relieved when she did do that because I had planned on ghosting her anyways so she sped up the process. Can’t say I miss her. \n\nAlso, can’t hold anything too personally cause she grew up tough w an abusive mom, so I get why she’s the way she is. 
5	Damn, how did this all become a feels thread...
6	Narcissistic father and paranoid mother, but my childhood was bearable because I had my sister. She's alright until she starts getting arrogant and judging everyone else.
3	I made my parents take the test and here are the results. \nMy mom is an ISFJ, despite being an ISFJ she always have been in charge of everything in our family since I was a kid. And personally, I wouldn't classify her as an ISFJ, she is more like an ENTJ for me.\nMy dad is an ESFP and he is the joker around the house. He is peaceful, very cheerful and makes a lot of jokes. If I were to say, I would call him an ENTP though.\nMy brother, who is 10 years younger than me took the test and he is an ENFP. I think that it was too early for him to take the test as he was 9 years old at the time but I can see him as an ENFP. \nI myself am an ENTP and I had a lot of fights with my mom as I was growing up. She always told me to act and dress more girly, my dad on the other hand always respected my character. My brother has always been kind of scared of me even though I try my best to be a loving sister. \n
3	ENFP mother and ISTJ stepdad mostly raised me. My dad is an INTJ I think. I’m in the middle in all 3 sets of siblings. My mom is probably a narcissist or borderline who adopts the beliefs of whoever she’s dating/married to, my stepdad is hopelessly trusting in systems designed for groupthink such as the military and the southern baptist church. My dad is really suspicious of systems in general and I’m more like him. I don’t know him too well because I haven’t been around him for more than a week or so at a time since I was probably 7, but he was my hero when I was a kid.\n\nMy childhood was... complex and traumatic. Honestly I don’t remember most of it. Sometimes my mom was warm and kind and generous, and sometimes she was angry and mean and possessive, same with my stepdad. They were super Christian too, and that was probably the most damaging thing about them because it was a great excuse for lots of normalized misogyny, emotional abuse, and neglect. I didn’t realize I was doing it but I buried myself in school and clubs and friends and suffocated in perfectionism. I developed an autoimmune disease in HS and they waited 6 months to take me to the doctor because they thought not being able to eat (not that I didn’t want to, I COULDNT) and sleeping anytime I wasn’t at school, among other WAY worse symptoms, was just “teenage blues.” Let’s not even talk about the mental health issues I’ve had since I was about 6 that went completely unacknowledged and unaddressed. I’ve been out of the house for 5 years and I will NEVER live with them again.
3	It seems like a narc parent is very common with ENTP's. Interesting. 
2	Dad was ENTP, mother ENFP. Got on with both parents, had very loose boundaries. By the time I was a teenager, I considered them both parents and friends. I found my mother to be the most caring, but my dad to be the most fun. Would love teaming up with my dad against my INTP uncle in debates. 
2	For all of you who is bitching about their parents. I doubt that almost every single one of your parents is emotionally abusive/manipulative/narcissistic.. . ENTPs have tendacies to be drama whores ( doesn't mean that every drama queen is an ENTP or every ENTP is a drama queen ). Just because your daddy didn't say I love you so often doesn't mean he is emotionally disconnected and just because he didn't show you enough attention doesn't mean he is narcissistic jesus fuck. My dad is an ESTP he probably cringes when he thinks of the word "love" , why is he supposed to say it? He loves me otherwise he wouldn't have given me food/shelter/education/ a fucking phone. If your parents actually hate you, you will be living in the streets. Also, He is an ESTP he is a bit selfish, he doesn't give me enough attention to what I do besides school ,he doesn't value my point of view about things a lot, he thinks I'm a kid and I need to EXPERIENCE more life to learn and I totally get it I totally understand because of this theory which brings me to the main point. THIS THEORY, THE WHOLE POINT OF IT IS NOT TO JUDGE PEOPLE BUT TO UNDERSTAND AND BE MORE TOLERANT WITH PEOPLE BECAUSE OUR BRAINS ARE WIRED DIFFERENTLY. This theory has a lot of flaws, but if used correctly, even the illusion of it being right will make life easier by helping us being positive. So be positive and don't use this theory to judge it's so fucking cringy. Just because someone is an INFJ it doesn't mean that they are passive as shit or just because your gf is an ESTP it doesn't mean that she will cheat on you. If she did, then not every ESTP gf you get will cheat on you ( Also if someone is an INTJ it doesn't mean they are confident and batman like some of the most insecure socially anxious bitches Ik are INTJs so please stop.) . Just be positive and know that everyone is his UNIQUE person and their brains are wired differently. Use this theory to be positive and grow as a person not to judge and further make the internet a worse place than it actually is.
2	Narcissistic and alcoholic father, p sure he’s an unhealthy ESTJ but possibly ESTP, sweet mother, ISFJ, and my sister, who’s my best friend, ESFP. I’m still young, I’m 14, can’t wait to move out, childhood isn’t horrible but definitely not healthy. 
1	Mom had narcissistic tendencies but was still loving and responsible. I was 1 of 5, so the love/time was spread thin. My father was also killed before I was born and I never developed a relationship with his side of my fam. As a result, I was mostly raised by my older siblings and myself. I never had a curfew or a bed time. It had it's ups and downs. I had a lot more freedoms than my peers but ive also had to learn a lot of things on my own that my peers were taught by their parents 
1	Narcissistic and crazy OCD mother, and disconnected father. I was born with adhd and as such I was crazy hyper, hardly slept from day one. Both my parents abandoned me emotionally and physically in favour of my younger brother who was not born with any mental illness. \n\nThanks to this abandonment, I developed Borderline Personality disorder. Being an ENTP with BPD is literal hell. And part of how I am confident that I am an ENTP. conflict with people I like is incredibly stressful while at the same time, incredibly compelling...
1	Bear Grylls fan ISTP father and ESTJ mother that believes everything that tv-professors say.\n\nIt was hard, I mean, developing my intuition was really hard and it's still not enough (in my opinion). I wasn't having even a grain of fun from doing social activities, going school trips and family visits. I wasn't having fun from anything at all. But, at the same time I wasn't developing my individuality, I was totally fucked up. After I realized my own personality is better than ones that they are trying to impose me (Work hard, study your lessons, be nice to everyone whatever they are, they do, set your future plans as being officer). It was totally bullshit. Lately, I figured out that the only thing I m pleased with is focusing on future, the possibilities, the unintelligibilities of life and memes. I totally introverted myself against external factors that could disturb my individuality. \n It was hard, it still is, I keep trying, trying to be intellect more than ever, trying to be witty to social interactions, trying to be nice to the people even they don't try it for me. I feel self-sacrificing great scott!
1	Im an intp\n\n\nTrolling, super smart ENTP dad (man of renaissance), pretty cool INFJ mom (Idk, just guessing, lovely woman), ESTJ sister (when she finally understood me, I dont wanna stab this traitor). \n\nI damaged all kind of stuff, I had to check what is inside. Sis was fucking traitor and my mom knew a lot of stuff, that I didnt want to share with her. I get along with sis very well now! I have very forgiving parents, but I had to 'pay' for what I've done.\n\nCuz dad, I love entps, also I have some traits from you, guys
1	My mom is INFP and my step dad is ESTP; my bio dad is ENTP, but he was (naturally) MIA until I was 23.\n\nI was raised Evangelical, i.e. sheltered, backwards, and weird (now atheist).\n\nI suppose my mom and I were close-ish while I was growing up. We always got into heated debates, but since our values aligned (until I was 24), we usually ended up on good terms. However, she definitely had a soft spot for my older INFP brother... and, sadly, favored both of us over my younger ISTP brother. They fucked that poor kid up, although he's finally doing much better in life... with the help of an amazing woman.\n\nI also, strangely, got along with my abusive step-dad when he wasn't flying into a rage over something ridiculous. I feel like I our shared extraverted drivers and copilot Ti allowed us to have interesting intellectual conversations, but... overall, he's just a weird, ridiculous human.\n\nOverall, I felt like an outsider. My mom and older brother were *so very* alike and, even if my younger brother wasn't a crowd favorite, he had both his parents (I'm sure he felt like pariah regardless).\n\nSo... the mom and older bro are super Fi users. Once the views of two Fis diverge, a giant, unsurpassable chasm rips open. They no longer speak. Fi Christian vs Fi Vegetarian Atheist? Watch out. Both are so fucking self-righteous and incapable of introspection; they're both convinced they have the moral high ground.\n\nMe and my ENTP dad now get along great; I understand why he bailed. I don't have time to hold his mistakes against him. Besides, my other siblings are punishing him enough for it already. I get to enjoy fun adventures with him while they stew in resentment.\n\nI really dislike my ESTP step-dad regardless of the fact we can have intellectual discussions. He just tries too hard or something. Even though we also share tertiary Fe, somehow the way he tries to relate to the group just chafes the fuck out of me. So annoying.\n\nMy family is fucked up. I moved across the country to avoid the drama. I love my little brother best. I'm done with my older brother. I love my mom, but she annoys me (now that our views have totally diverged). I love my bio dad even though he's not at all reliable. So, I dunno. Whatever.
1	My parents did the bare minimum. They were bith super young when they had me. My dad was a bit more physical than he should have been with me. Especially at a young age. He was in and out of jail and prison most of my life. My mom i didn't re-meet until I was 7. At which point i had no memory of her. I moved in with her when i was 14. Bc at that point i had been living with her parents. My step grandpa was a narrasctic asshat. Very verbal abuse. My grandma left him a number of times. My mom, I love my mom. But she could have done better. She could have made better choices for me and our living situation. We ended up moving into a ghetto trailer park. It was the definition of white trash. There was a whole lot of questionable characters. I get it. She wanted to move somewhere she had a friend. She was a very depressed anxiety ridden woman. Naturally I wasn't very close to her. Its hard to be close to someone who's not there mentally. So to say the least my childhood wasn't ideal. Here I am 25 years old.  Still working to improve myself. Its kinda hard bc I don't really have someone to vent too. Not anyone id want to vent too. My past doesn't bother me much. Occasionally it sneaks up on me and i start remember everything.\n I know i could have had it MUCH worse. For some reason that brings me comfort
1	Strong and stable parents, ISTJ dad and possibly ENFJ mom. They took care of their businesses and were responsible, rational people in every sense. They never showed intimacy or love towards each other though. They also never did anything but work, and never had friends or leisure time. They were kind of "above" all that, there was always more important things to prioritize. I am still working on getting rid of that same attitude.
1	INTJ mother and ESFP father. I got along with both perfectly fine and my mom has told me I’m like the mix of them both x10. Though when I got lectured it usually ended with something like ‘you need to care more’ which I find kinda funny. My mother and I bonded by making fun of people (especially my dad) and my father and I bonded by movies and jokes. I was also raised by my very sensitive ISTJ grandmother. She didn’t like my sarcasm and humor but despite that, we got along. I had a pretty normal childhood. 
1	FATHER: ESTJ\nMy father is a contractor and has very strong TE also is very direct with people. He believes anything he does will work out if he puts enough force behind it to make it work. But when I point out the TI logic of it not working in the long run. He passes it off as trying to not get any work done at all. He ends up getting into trouble AKA people suing him Because he could not foresee the mistakes he has made and I almost always point out beforehand. Then he has his best friend the ISTJ Lawyer bail him out of trouble for something that could have been avoided with cautious logic. His lawyer is very smart but when he gets into investments. He is very gullible to believe the first thing that seems legit at face value and is already "tried and true". EXAMPLE: pyramid schemes like selling MLM Coffee and/or believing cholesterol is the cause of heart disease. He brings my father into this sort of stuff and it ends up being a bad investment. So they end up losing money or stopping altogether.\n\n\nMOTHER: ESFJ \nMy mother is stay at home housewife with a gambling addiction. She has really bad cognitive bias towards things and on top of that very controlling. If the house was not clean to her standards she will freak out and start   acting all irrationally. But if she has a friend call her on phone. She would instantly switch from mad to happy instantaneously. Like she was never mad in the first place. Which I find very hypocritical on her part. She cannot defend herself in a logical argument so she would demand my father would defend her by acting weak, frail, and astonished. That someone would dare try to question her decisions whether it was correct or not. My father usually just defends her by just saying go away and do something else. It's out of trying to get some rest and not having to argue rather than actually being interested in solving the problem.\n\n\nMY CHILDHOOD: \nI grew up in Los Angeles, California and that should speak for itself. Many Californians in my opinion are lean mostly to being ESFJ or any feeling type for that matter. Alot of people are self centered and will have pity parties to rally support for a cause they are having claiming they were victims while simultaneously acting like bullies to people who oppose them. My parents had me in alot of miltary type boot camps. Which I always never had a good time doing. I grew up alot in my ISFJ subconscious. I ended up very sad because of it. I kept trying to impress people with their feeling standards but could never succeed at doing that. I was abused/molested by family as a child. Which resulted in me growing up with really bad Stockholm syndrome with my relationships. To this day I'm super logically cautious about everything I do because it seems like the only thing that keeps me safe and happy. \n
1	ENFP father and I/ENTP (I think) mother, with only my ESFJ sister to balance a bit of J (order) into our lives. Both of my parents discouraged conformity (in their own, distinctive ways). I remember my sister and I shared one class in high school: Life Skills (a mix of home economics and sociological stuff they had to fit in somewhere) and that was when both of us realized how much more functional our home was than most of the others. She was 3 grades ahead of me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI continue to have a wonderful relationship with my parents, text nearly every day, facetime calls probably every 3-4 days (we live 12.5 time zones apart). My whole family is unusual in that none of us has a proper college degree, yet all are smart and successful, in various ways. No under-achievers, although my mom retired from her career as a ghost-writer pretty early on - because dad made enough money that she didn't need to take jobs other than ones she had a personal interest in. I think our comparative success despite weak paper credentials is in large part the result of living in North America (where they all live). I don't think any of us regret foregoing college (and the accumulation of college debt). Both my father and sister have high end sales jobs, where people skills matter more than degrees.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe moved pretty regularly (6 year stretch where we moved out of state every 2 years) when I was school-age. My sister really struggled with the moves, whereas I loved the adventure and new discovery.
1	My bro is an ENTP so I'll answer on his behalf. My mom is a fiercely independent businesswoman who got in on a full-ride to the top mathematics program in our country and was on track to graduating with honors with a dual major in physics. Unfortunately, the Persian Gulf War broke out during her Junior year, and she was forced to drop out and marry my dad. She moved to a new country, taught herself a completely new language by interacting with the locals and started her own business. Now women travel from different countries for her services. My dad was also a trailblazer. He grew up extremely poor (literally lived in a hut during his childhood). However, he got into trade school on an athletic scholarship and became the first in his family to graduate college and found a stable job overseas. Dad is an INFJ with severe anxiety. Mom is your classic stereotypical happy-go-luck ESFP. Growing up, my parents never got along because of the differences in the Ni-Fe vs Se-Fi temperament, but things got better as they grew older and worked out their communication problems. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe had complete freedom growing up, which meant we were forced to learn lessons the hard way. Our parents didn't really guide us through anything so we all grew up too soon...
1	I learned how to play devil’s advocate in my childhood. I was forced to do what tradition said all the time without questioning. I had to start fighting and debating in early ages (10-) so i am very experinced. That helped me so much and still helping me a lot.
1	Narcissistic mom and an ok dad. She was abusive af which is why I got into reading psychology. I didn't want to suffer anymore, so I thought if I knew how her mind works it would be helpful. :-) I have walls around me, and I'm very guarded when it comes to relationships because they were my biggest example and it waa toxic.
1	My mom is an ENFJ and my dad an ISFP, my mom was really strict for having the freedom I wanted, but I was a curious child with a obsession of trying to figure out about everything. Really. I almost got the house on fire just because of that. Lived some traumatising experiences which looking back and now, are still playing a role. \n\nMy dad is a great man which only problem was and still is alcohol (which sadness me because he is showing signs of a developing esquizofrenia nowadays and is most likely trying to hide it from the doctors, note for whoever is reading this he was never abusive, being alcoholic doesn't mean that, in fact he is the exact reverse of that, and it's an actual problem). We lived  in a house (with conditions problems) in the center of the last remaining "bananeiras" (tree that gives you bananas, I live in a tropical island, don't make jokes of that xd) and I had the pleasure to witness and live with animals and see insects almost my whole life. My dad gave me the freedom to explore and be curious (even thought I became in love with guns as well, we didn't have guns, I simply like them due to the video games and movies, always found and find them fascinating, probably will move to US at one point anyway) .\n\nMy mom was paranoid with some stupid things, like not liking the neighbour or having my friends at home, because she didn't like to hear them, things like that. Really stupid and still is like this nowadays, and was really manipulative when I was a child. Like really. It seemed like I couldn't own my things. The freedom that my dad was trying to gave me, she simply removed, plus he worked 8+hours a day or simply would get to a bar at night spending tons of money and leaving with my mom. She even hit on me, but to be honest, looking back, I really did a lot of stupid things just because of "why not?". However she gave me support, food and controlled a house with 7 people living. She supported my brother and my sisters at school whenever there was a confusion. But, I always felt like even that kinda was manipulative as she was trying to look better than the other moms, principally as I would get easily get the best grades out of the class. I hated that. Still do. I swore that if at one point in my life I reach my goals, I cannot simply give her credit. If anything she always pulled me back because of how paranoid she could be. \n\nNote: I see that there is a lot of parents who are manipulative and a lot of xxFJs parents and manipulative ones. It seems a trend that ENTPs father's were strict or manipulative. And my dad was at military as well. He was the best sharpshooter in Portugal. He could had been the best in Europe, if he didn't drink alcohol.
1	I would describe my parents the same way. Confident and headstrong but not ENTP.
1	ESTJ Mother ENFP father\n\nMy mother is extremely controlling and a workaholic (super headstrong) and my dad kind of doesn’t give a shit about anything. Parents were basically the opposites. Dad wasn’t around most of my childhood, and Mom was working. Overall, I guess it was kind of lonely but I wouldn’t say my childhood was bad or anything, although I think it still could’ve been more pleasant. 
1	ESTJ Dad, ENTJ Mother, arsehole ISTJ stepfather. Went to live with with Dad when I reached high school (age 12ish), who was pretty absent, so pretty much raised myself. Also regularly had to babysit my younger brother (also ENTP) from a young age (9), so not really any wonder I'd had enough of responsibility  & turned out the way I did.\n\nMy older half brothers were raised by my Dad & his ex wife. No idea of her MBTI, as we've never met. One ISTJ & one ENFP. Nobody likes the ISTJ.\n\nBizarrely for an ESTJ, Dad was the far more supportive parent, probably because he was used to raising boys, so having a daughter with a boyish personality was probably easier for him. By contrast, he has always been overly critical of my ENFP brother.
1	My dad: absent, caring but oblivious. Probably an NT; he's a successful entrepreneur who had the foresight to invest in Apple years ago. I can thank him for getting me partway through college. \n\n My mother:  ISFJ who confuses caring and nurturing for controlling. I've had to constantly lay down boundaries. \n\nMy childhood was pretty good until I was 8. I became super-self aware and awkward.\n\n Then my family blew up at 13 and I was the only person there for my mother (who struggled with health issues and a traumatic brain injury).  I grew up fast. Too fast.
1	16 year old ENTP w/ INTJ mother and ENFP father\n\nWhen they had me mum was 18 and dad was 26 and they lived in really bad poverty. Dad was working everyday from morning to late at night supporting the fam so i hardly got to see him much growing up. My mum was there as my best friend. Our situation slowly improved as we grew up and we even migrated to Aus for my dads PhD. Dad has always been a lil bit narcissistic and mums been a bit more fragile. They compliment each other very well in aspects of responsibilities, family and romanxe and I feel fortunate to have them. When they argue, which is pretty often i ussually get summed to act as a judge. We make up and make jokes after 5mins, initiated by my dad. As an entp I am often rough with my actions and this has impacted my mum somtimes. Regardless we share a great bond. My dad is kind of like a close friend as hes engaged me in deep conversations since around the age of 13. As a family we've moved houses 7 times so i havent really stuck to the same group of friends. It has given me an oppurtunity to understand more people from different backgrounds which is helpful for my need to understand people. Sorry about the cluttered information, had a bit of a rough day. I would also add that the intuitive function in my family has helped with easy communication. I seem to group around INFP's and other N types regularly. On one occasion i befrended two ES--. Though fun when it lasted it was a much weaker bond than those i have with N types. I keep track of mbti types on people around me, I have an entire list of around 30 people. Idk of anyone else does this but it helps me manage my thoughts according to people. You never know an ESFJ might go tell their entire family tree about your insexurities. As bad as it sounds studying my friends has been helpful for me in some ways. I like to avoid all drama surrounding my entp nature. Lastly, my enfp dads r gods. I hope to eventually develop a relationship that will last. I still partly am scared on the idea of marriage purely due to the increasing divorce rates. Loneliness is a fear. But seeing my parents perfect type relationship (E&I, N&N, T&F and P&J) with a long lasting marriage i think its accomplishable. \n\nProbably swayed off topic there af the end but this is a very simple summary of my entp life.  
7	tests and many people claim that i‘m an ENTP, but i’m seriously not convinced that i am	* **i‘m **never** serious. never.**\n\ni often answer/ argue about stuff and give my 2 cents without having given it a 2nd thought. people take me serious and want to debate about it, and i try to justify my point where i never even meant it or never thought about whether it was logical myself, from the begin with.\n\n* **i only like debating when i can be 100% sure that it isn‘t anything personal, but **only** knowledge related.**\n\nas soon as a person starts attacking me personally, i don‘t want to continue the debate anymore. (when they get harsh and insult your intelligence, when they get extremely intense and serious).\n\n* **i don‘t know how to manipulate people.**\n\ni‘ve never tried, and am not interested. i can read people extremely well and work that to my own advantage only in a way, that i know how to make them like me, or for Fi users for example, knowing what pushes their buttons so i make sure i don‘t push them.\n\ni hate making people mad to the point that they have emotional outburts. it‘s really annoying for me to deal with the consequences of messing with most feeling types. \n\n* **i don‘t get the whole concept of ENTPs „testing people for reactions“.**\n\nsome seem to test people while directly addressing them with stuff, looking how they will react. most of the time i already know how they will react. i act in a way that is controversial, but never really directed at a person, just making a general statement through behaviour, opinions, etc - just because i want to go against social expectations. not bc i care about their reactions\n\n* **i admit when i‘m wrong.**\n\nif it‘s a knowledge related debate i just want to *understand* it. i couldn‘t care less whether i win or lose. the most logical side shall win and if i‘m convinced i‘ll admit being wrong\n\n* **i don‘t mind looking dumb.**\n\ni‘m never really tryna look or sound smart. people always tell me i‘m intelligent but i don‘t understand what makes them think that. i‘m oblivious to the most basic things by just not taking them serious and speaking without thinking first. so i end up saying really dumb shit where if i thought first, i‘d know it‘s dumb. \n\nbut since i don‘t mind if people think i‘m dumb, i nevertheless just go ahead and say whatever i think without Ti checking everything first.\n\n* **i‘m pretty slow. Ti wise.**\n\nother people seem to get sth right off the bat, but for me to really *get* something, i have to take a step back first, think about it for a while from every angle, step for step, back and forth, imagine myself in a situation, etc. until i can finally really say i *got* it.\n\n it takes longer than for others but i once i **understood** something, it‘s like i‘m an expert at it. i can already apply it, argue for it, test it for any faults. where others who seem to have gotten it right away, can‘t do that. so that‘s why people say i‘m a quick learner, even though honestly i‘m way slower than most at first. \n\n* **harmony is for me high priority.**\n\ni always think of how the things i say might affect others. i‘m honest but i‘ll try to say it in the best way possible without crooking the truth. i really don‘t want anyone to feel bad bc of me, therefore i watch what i do/ say. i don‘t like harsh words.\n\n* **as soon as anything social power games related is on, i disappear.**\n\ni really couldn‘t care less about such stuff. everyone can think i‘m the stupidest retard naive hobo ever. i wouldn‘t mind. in fact, it‘d be funny.\n\n* **i always take things seriously.**\n\nwhen my friends troll me, i‘m extremely oblivious to it. i usually end up getting trolled, because i believe anything they tell me. for me nothing is impossible. so even if they say the most absurd thing ever, i‘ll actually ask „Really?“, and try to consider and understand the possibility first.\n\n* **i never thought i was trolling, just annoying people.**\n\ni don‘t know if it‘s the same thing, but i wouldn‘t call it trolling, i just love annoying people a lot. by for example sending my sensor friends disturbing pictures etc\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nis this proof that i‘m not an ENTP? does this resonate with NeTiFeSi?\n\ni was pretty sure i use NeSi and FeTi. i‘m **definitely not** a sensor. although i wouldn‘t say it is impossible. \n\nif you have any suggestions as to what other type i might be, please let me know.
9	You basically just said "Im not an ENTP bc I do things ENTPs do"\n\nLike? \n\n1,2- Entps generally like debate for the fun of it, we dont usually take our position seriously\n\n2,3,4,,,some more,,,--- mature entps are not antagonistic, value harmony, and wont use their ability to understand people against them\n\nThat one about Ti- functions dont necessarily dictate how fast you learn something. But youre description of how you are after you learn something sounds like Ti. \n\nKeep in mind that you cant always type with behaviors, and all types have steteotypes about them. Not all entps are relentless trolls who will argue about anything. Not many are, I would actually say.\n\nEntps tend to be marked mostly by their curiousity, inventiveness, and out of the box thinking. Your mbti type doesnt designate your entire personality, how you act in every situation, or your values. 
7	Sounds pretty much like me, and I see myself as an ENTP.  I don't know where you got the idea that we are trolls and like social power from.  Social power sounds like EXTJ stuff, and trolls like to self-identify as ENTP, but I think are mistyped.
15	You sound exactly like a TP to me.
13	I agree with /u/Azdahak. You seem like a TP type. 
4	it seems you're someone with Fi instead of Fe\n\nall in all it seem more like enfp
5	Ur and obvious Tps the others has said,and about what u say:\n\n>i don‘t know if it‘s the same thing, but i wouldn‘t call it trolling, i just love annoying people a lot. by for example sending my sensor friends disturbing pictures etc\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is Fe,is like when a group of male humans start poking at each other too see how they will react, is something alost every human does, but Fe takes it better, a lot of Fi types will take any proving or teasing as something personal and pverreact negatively towards it.This what ur doing is in the same ccategory as males showing nude pictures to eachother, making hardcore jokes,or in another sense when someone tries to subtlely star the combo towads drugs or some controversial topic to see if ur another consumer or whatever,we all continuosly do this,but ntps in particular seem to be more cognizant about it,is like everyone has a dark side, but nts ar probably the peopple who aknowldge that side the most, when nfs almost ignore even thoug they can do extremmely shitty things just because they feelings ar in the wrong place.\n\nActually this is a contradicttion with what u say here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**i don‘t get the whole concept of ENTPs „testing people for reactions“.**  \n>  \n>some seem to test people while directly addressing them with stuff, looking how they will react. most of the time i already know how they will react. i act in a way that is controversial, but never really directed at a person, just making a general statement through behaviour, opinions, etc - just because i want to go against social expectations. not bc i care about their reactions\n\nNow:\n\n>**i‘m pretty slow. Ti wise.**  \n>  \n>other people seem to get sth right off the bat, but for me to really *get* something, i have to take a step back first, think about it for a while from every angle, step for step, back and forth, imagine myself in a situation, etc. until i can finally really say i *got* it.  \n>  \n>it takes longer than for others but i once i **understood** something, it‘s like i‘m an expert at it. i can already apply it, argue for it, test it for any faults. where others who seem to have gotten it right away, can‘t do that. so that‘s why people say i‘m a quick learner, even though honestly i‘m way slower than most at first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis may be not just Ti, but also Ne, Ne has too consider every possibility,it gets faster with age thoug because we get a biger set of experience to crosscontext ,but it still needs to imagine every possibility is not fast like a system(NiTe or TeNi ) or a method(SeTi or TiSe)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**i don‘t mind looking dumb.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs one famous Entp said:\n\nAll i know is i know nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout what u say about not manipulating peopple, we all ar different Behavior of Socrates was not the same of the behavior of Talleyrand or Machiavelly both obvious social manipulative Entps, and is not the same of that of  William Mastorn(very attracted to power dinamics as a lot of Entps ar) or the behavior of Feynman.\n\nDont relay just on general behavior to type because u will find that there ar peopple that will idk even type Feynman as an Estp because of things like this :\n\nPhysics is like sex: sure, it may give some practical results, but that's not why we do it.”\n\nor because he was a famous womanizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is very tonned down on this sub, because peopple ar afraid of being called out of not being Entps so they will say what they expect is general behavior of Entps just to fit in, but when u read them u can see how theyre just repeating the facts without thinking about them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is all about Cognitive preference or better called priorization, u seem to clearly prioritize Ne on ur thoug process, and Ti(Ti even thoug is our logic, is extremmely impersonal is not self focused in the same way Fi is, so it doesnt stop or focus or Ne in the same way our Ne is more aimed at others the same way Machiavelly was outside focused all external function ar, and paired with Ti so much more.\n\nIn order to properly self acces u as an entp or intp how much stimuly do u need? do u preffer low stimuly enviroments or burt of high stimuly and no stimuly at all.\n\nFrom what u say here:\n\n>**i‘m never serious. never.**  \n>  \n>i often answer/ argue about stuff and give my 2 cents without having given it a 2nd thought. people take me serious and want to debate about it, and i try to justify my point where i never even meant it or never thought about whether it was logical myself, from the begin with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIll claim that boredoom is a pretty strong motivator for u the same way it is in Entps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nActually when u keep learning and becoming more versed on different topics i think ull become more Open in a general way,people like to talk here about debates being just a limited exchange between intellectual pressenting facts, and they ignore the shyntesiss that can came from the most meaningless of debates ,or actually ignore dialectics in general, Schopenhauer is a must read for every Entp becoming a polymath who has an actual interest on debate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dont know if i helped u or not, but in general u seem an obvious ntp, and is up to u to discern ir ur introverted or extroverted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nForget this all, i read the other day ur post, and ur an entp, and i dont go there tagging peopple for no reason, but u definitevely ar i thoug that when i read u the other day and i think it even more just now, fuck logic even if u were introverted and an intp i still want ur Ne mind in this sub.\n\nUr Awsome, have a great day¡
5	ENTP-T with a more developed Fe.
3	hmm I can relate to a lot of stuff you’re saying, particularly the desire for harmony, being able to read others & steering clear of what might hurt them & not being adept at manipulating people. I typed as intp/infp, leaning toward the former later in life. 🤷🏽‍♀️ 
3	Dude, you just described me... sounds pretty ENTP
3	Dude. You’re one of us. Welcome. You shall be spared during the purge of inferior personalities.

5	Voting Time! r/entp Best of 2018	Hey, all! You may remember [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/a7uf4g/rentp_yearbook_superlatives_win_gold/), in which we introduced the Best of 2018 contest. Nominations are closed now, and it’s time to vote! Go [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Y39WMBR) to vote for the Best of 2018 categories, and go [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YB2FPRY) to vote for the Worst of 2018 categories! Voting closes January 4.\n\nYou may notice that there are some additional nominations in the voting surveys. As we pretty much suspected, you guys are a lazy bunch. This meant not all categories had enough nominations. Us mods threw in some additional nominations to allow for some semblance of competition. But don’t worry, any gold the mods win for nominating will go towards recognizing quality content in 2019. Our egos are big, but not big enough to gild ourselves. \n\nTo refresh your memory, these are the categories:\n\nThe winners of these categories will be awarded with Platinum, and their nominating comments with Gold:\n\n* Most Thought-Provoking: Did a post or comment seriously blow your mind? Nominate it for this category. \n* Best Wall of Text: Okay, not all walls of text are bad. Size has nothing to do with quality, but there’s nothing better than a big wall of text that fills you with quality information and leaves you satisfied. Nominate any post or comment that was worth reading despite its intimidating length. \n* Best Advice: If you encountered some genuinely helpful advice, nominate it for this category. \n* Best Mistype Redemption Arc: Personality typing is pointless if you get your type wrong. The moment a person discovers their real type is a glorious, freeing moment. It allows them to embrace who they truly are. Any post or comment in which someone realizes they are not ENTP is eligible for this category. \n* Best Wigi Time: You know him, you love him, you may be confused by him. He’s Wigi! Any post tagged “It’s Wigi Time!” or comment submitted by /u/wigi1 is eligible for this category. \n* Most Coherent: Flawless logic. Crystal-clear prose. You couldn’t have said it better yourself. This post or comment is incredibly coherent. Nominate it! \n* Most Emotional: Contrary to the stereotypes, ENTPs are not emotionless robots. Whether a display of remarkable emotional in-touchness or a raging hurricane of feels, any post or comment that displays off-the-charts emotion is eligible for this category. \n* Best Comeback: Nominate the snappiest comeback, the zingiest zinger, the wittiest retort. \n\nWe also have “Worst Of” categories. The winners of these categories will be awarded with silver, as will their nominating comments:\n\n* Least Thought-Provoking Post: Not even worth the brain cells it took to read. Any post or comment that is completely obvious, derivative, or otherwise asinine is eligible for this category. \n* Worst Wall of Text: Nominate a post or comment that makes you ask, “Can I get a tl;dr over here?”\n* Worst Advice: It may be intentionally bad. It may be unintentionally bad. Maybe you can’t tell. But if it’s bad advice, it’s eligible for this category. \n* Least Coherent: You try to understand it. You squint. You read it again. But… the words… you just… they don’t make sense. Any completely incomprehensible post or comment is eligible for this category. \n* Worst Comeback: Sometimes your zingers just don’t zing. Nominate any comeback that fell flat. \n\nThe winners be announced at the beginning of January. Have fun!\n\nThe Mods\n\ntl;dr: Survey links below.\n\nBEST OF SURVEY LINK: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Y39WMBR\n\nWORST OF SURVEY LINK: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YB2FPRY \n
9	>As we pretty much suspected, you guys are a lazy bunch.\n\nProbably like 10 people voted Hahahahahah. \n\nNominating is boring. Voting on and complaining about the nominations after, now THAT is fun.
3	Oh damn, the way this was written sounds so much [like this](https://youtu.be/5p5qPd3oVFo?t=25).
3	It's an honor not to be nominated.
1	was there ever a post with the results? I'm not finding it
10	What do you think about doing things for the greater good?	If not ENTP please state your type. \n\n(Also: did I make a mistake in the title? Not sure if it shouldn't be "what do you think of doing (...) ) 
17	Are you asking if the ends justify the means, or if it's good to feed stray cats? Your question could go either way! 
9	It feels great. Helping others for the greater good gives me a sense of purpose.   \nThere's so much you can do, I choose not to donate money because I personally don't trust anyone and don't see the numbers myself, so I dedicate my time to places like the Knights of Columbus (helps widowed women and their families and the unfortunate), and the Lions Club (The largest charity in the world).   \nI don't give them a penny (besides the small sign up fee) but I do give them time. It's great for connections because most of the volunteers are elderly and wise and it looks fantastic on a resume or as a first impression. 
8	It depends on what that greater good is and how much effort/sacrifices would be required on my part. For instance, I have no issue recycling for the greater good, but if you told me I would have to haul my trash 30 miles on foot for the greater good, I'd tell you to fuck off. 
5	I think it's a hollow sound bite people say to feel justified in martyring themselves. What exactly is the "greater good"? It's a nebulous concept. As far as i can pin it down, it seems to be a concept related to person X does negative thing, but they argue in time, or on a global scale, it has a positive effect. They then argue this net positive is greater in magnitude than the minor negative they've done. \n\nBut how do they know that? How is it quantified? It reminds me of the Heroes episode *0.07%*, whereby they wanted 0.07% of the population to die in an explosion to achieve world peace. Only in Heroes, they had seers who could see the future. We don't have that in reality. \n\nI think it makes more sense for people to feel justified and vindicated in defying social norms by saying it's "for the greater good". I think it makes more sense for people to say it's "for the greater good" when they commit crimes. 
12	The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
3	I think a mix of for the greater good and fair/equal is ideal. I value whats for the greater good much more then I value what is "ethical".
3	Who defines what the greater good is? \n\nGeneral speaking I put others needs before my wants. But as with most things, it has to be decided on a case by case basis. I'd like to think I'm a generally ethical person, but I do find myself at odds with common knowledge a lot of the time because I prefer to research and make my own choices, rather than rely on what I'm told. \n\nI'll take frugality as example. I like being frugal, largely because I'm broke, bu5 also because I don't want to waste resources. Because of that I don't shop at certain stores or buy the cheapest thing possible, because I'd rather save up for something that will last and not endorse companies that harm the environment or other people (looking at you Nestle and Walmart). It can be a sacrifice because I really do miss hot pockets, but to me it's my (small, insignificant) way of working towards what I consider the greater good (not destroying the world to make a small group rich). \n\nThat was long winded. But yes, I try to work for what I see as the greater good.
3	The biggest objection I have to "doing things for the greater good" can be explained through medicine. Yes, it would benefit all of humanity of we could do certain dangerous trials on people to find cures and the such, but we don't.\n\nI suppose if the people was willing to participate it should be done, but what if, hypothetically, we could find no willing people. Would it be "for the greater good" to select and force people to participate in these trials, especially if it could help cure humankind's most pressing illnesses?
3	INTJ\n\nThe title is fine. \n\nI'm okay with doing things for the greater good as long as it doesn't violate the fundamental rights of the individual. Increasing taxes to take care of the most unfortunate, sick and needy is fine even if it takes from the rich, unfortunate and lucky ones because it is necessary in the bigger picture. \n\n \n\n
2	In my country, sadly, it's so hard to help others by doing activity, or social efforts, even if u criticise any single thing that pro-government, u're in custody. And I don't think our government wants its folks improved. I mean, even important sites like wikipedia are restricted.   \n\n\nSo I can only help my community (school, friends, followers on few social media).  \nBecause my notions are so severe.  \nIf I could, would I do everything I could? Yes. Sure. But would care about individuality more (not piggishly).
2	I do my bit when I can but I make no promises
2	Each person should have the ability to figure their own shit out independent of outside forces. What this means is I want the freedom to choose how and where my money is donated. I want to donate to support charities I believe have a purpose and will actually do some good in the world, a la “the ends justify the means.” I don’t agree with the government taking my shit and redistributing it for the “greater good” because idk where the money will be used or whether or not I will agree politically with what it is being used for.\n\nFuck socialism this is America \*smile\*
2	The greater good is subjective and anyone can justify anything because the people who have the power to change anything only have their own perspective of the situation. Everyone’s got their reasons for everything. Perhaps it comes down to morals? But that’s another conversation..
4	Hitler tried to do the greater good. 
1	It completely depends. Why is it a greater good? Who is getting hurt in the process? Why are they getting hurt? It all depends. If you’re violating the rights of individuals then the greater good is irrelevant to me. 
1	it will give you a feeling of accomplishment to contribute to anything great, whether it is good or bad. once your in your death bed you don't wanna think that you just lived in your small little bubble that only benefited your small circle, but maybe want to leave your foot prints and change sth, anything to feel satisfied and free of regret. if it is of importance to you. it is still your choice though
1	I love art and dream about making an animated movie. I could even totally settle for an 9-5 office job as long as I'd have simulating hobbies on my free-time.  But I'm also into science and believe it could change the world and with the climate change going on, art means (almost) nothing to me. I'd feel very guilty if I, while having the burning to try to "save the world", didn't try. Somebody gotta do something? 
1	Small scale, always yes. Things like picking up trash when as you’re walking by, recycling when you can, giving your change to the homeless. Casual goodness that takes almost no additional effort is always worth it. Does this make a difference large scale? Probably not, but it puts good energy into the world.\n\nIn terms of ends justify the means/needs of the masses vs individuals, on paper I agree that we should do what’s best for the majority, but in reality this is always an ethical quandary. For example, when we think of democracy and making decisions based on majority rule, it sounds fair until you realize that so many of our systems and policies (USA) put a lot of strain on the minority to prohibit their participation in democracy. So the results aren’t reliable, even though most people agree that majority rules - the needs of the masses - is a fair way to make decisions and define The Greater Good \n\nI hope this made sense. It was a bit rambling and I don’t have a way to conclude but...those are my thoughts lol
1	The greater good is relative. That's what I think.
1	I think it depends on the situation. I like doing nice things for people occasionally, but there is a limit and people have to take care of themselves before others. \n\nI donate occasionally and have helped out. I would rather help those I know and see that impact though to make sure it functions as it should. \n\nI think in situations where it’s the greater good versus the people I care about, I’m choosing the people I care about most likely. 
1	The only justifiable course of action
1	Well by definition I am part of the greater good, so by assisting it I should be putting myself in a better position than I was before, correct? I rather like the whole ego centric altruism idea, I find it speaks well to those who aren't captured by the usually "because its the right thing to do", myself included. That said what is the greater good? I like to think I'm a utilitarian but the problem with that philosophy is that the whole "Greater Good" thing is rather subjective. What benefits some, or makes them happy, might not do so for others. In fact it could come out to a near 50/50 split.   \n\n\n&#x200B;
1	The "greater good" is such a nebulous concept - there's little point in answering the question without trying to define it first (IMO).\n\nIf it's a "do the ends justify the means" type deal, I think the answer is always that "it depends". Universal moral axioms are hard. 
117	So just wanted to share this with you guys. This is me and my ENTP friend. We were like born to be the same. My name is Wilfred he was Willard. We worked at the same place, we have been to the same college (Gender Studies). We reacted the same way most of the time and even rode in the same car.	
36	OMG that's so me and my ENTP bff. We met on MBTIDating.com (such a great platform!) and clicked immediately. I'm generally good with ENTPs because both my parents are ENTPs and my family is full of INTPs and INFJs (actually, I only know one Sensor!). \n\nMy ENTP friend also introduced me to sub types and that's how I figured out why I use more Ti and Fe than the other INTJs. It's because I'm an INTJ-NeTiFeSi. 
23	I see what you did here, 100% approve.
20	> he was Willard\n\n> he was\n\n> was
16	Fake ass bullshit, neither of them looks like an asshole. How could they possibly be entp???? Real entp have no emotions and especially dont care about yours sorry not sorry. \n\nWe are defined by being mean to others all the time, but for some reason tertiary Fe just makes everyone love me for some reason. Im such a charmer and ladies man, I can only recommend light teasing even if it makes them cry, im so funny hahahaha
5	"Rode in the same car"\n\nWell, technically, I guess that's sorta true...
3	Wow this reminds me so much of me and my friend. We’re so similar I can tell if he wants to be at a party and for how long just by being in the same trunk, erm I mean room as him. So weird! 
3	Gender Studies? Are you an idiot?
2	That smirk = ENTP confirmed
2	Everyone barely knows sensors and here I am my whole family being sensors and I'm the only nt
2	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
2	Kinda unrelated, but how's that gender studies degree working out for ye
2	You guys would like r/shittyMBTI
1	Hate meeting other ENTP's. Makes me feel common and common sucks! 
1	It's amazing having an ENTP BFF, especially as a woman. The nature of where I live (I'm a filthy immigrant) & the business I work in tends to attract a lot of female sensors, particularly SF types. I'm respected for my leadership qualities, but considered too 'weird' or 'unfeminine' to be a friend to most of them.\n\nWhen I met my bestie, we just clicked straight away. It's so nice being able to have an intelligent conversation without having to sensor (pun intended) myself.
0	if you want to make people think, ask that question: if the sun is over 5 billion years and the nearest galaxy of Andromeda 2.52 million light years from the earth this humanity seems to be about 2,000 years to come up with something ...	so, there are chances ..? that is, we have to look for a new place for today with a pedicle of 0.5 km/h..\n

19	waste less time in the shower by simply putting a clock there	**if any of you want to spend their time more effective** \n\n**and don’t want to spend unnecessary time in the shower jumping from one thought to another,**\n\nforgetting the time and leaving only after you’ve made 10 rounds around the world, \n\n**this is a simple life hack.**\n\n____________________________________________\n\n*EDIT: except you get so absorbed in thoughts that you forget the existence of a clock altogether or looking at the clock from time to time*\n\n*EDIT2: if that‘s the case, set an alarm on the clock so you‘ll have no choice but to remember the time haha*\n\n*EDIT3: for the ultra hard ones of you who say an alarm wouldn‘t stop me, i‘d just step out for a moment to stop it and continue showering - put it outside on the floor. unless you like walking out naked and wet and don‘t mind going back to shower after, this should stop you. remind your co-habitants to NOT turn the alarm off for you.*
6	My solution to that was taking cold showers.
3	I did this about a year ago! Can attest. My showers at least halved in duration 
3	The funny thing is, this is one of my main life problems. It causes my mother’s Fi to become angry >:(.
3	I find that the shower is the only place I have to myself. Just like the toilet, I find tranquility and brain relaxation more than anywhere else. I will stay in here for as long as I need until I am not mentally exhausted anymore. Then I get back at it.
2	I usually put on music that I assume are about 3-4 mins long so I generally know to be done by the third or fourth song when I get ready for work.
2	I just leave myself <20 minutes to shower when getting ready.
2	If you want to waste even less time in the shower on a large scale, make sure it's an old clock that plugs into the wall.
1	So...how long did you and do you now spend in the shower?
1	You spent the weeks worth of time you saved to write this post instead 
1	Here's an even better life-hack. Set a 3 minute timer on your smartphone or computer, decide on a small task you can get done in that time, and race against the clock. It works quite effectively. 
2	This guy must be an ENFP or ENTP, he must be!	
1	this title implies that ENTPs are extremely smart, and boii, you're right af\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(ock that was kinda cringe)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\[Edit:\] thanks for sharing the video tho, enjoyed it !

1	Any Ne dom female strippers?	It has always been my dream to pair up with a Ne dom female stripper in order to influence her into dancing to offbeat unconventional music while on stage.  \n\nThe stuff the DJs play is so uninspiring and dull.  Hang the DJ!   Would be fun if we could troll the audience and experiment with obscure tracks just to change things up.  \n\nI have a habit of doing this at bars.  Choosing tracks that are out of left field, especially to the crowds congregating at the bar.  There was a time I played “Heroin” by the Velvet Underground at a bar that was mostly playing rap and pop music.  The song was played super LOUD and when the place was popping.  Good times.  
4	>The stuff the DJs play is so uninspiring and dull. Hang the DJ!\n\nYou know the strippers tell the DJ which songs they want to dance to, right?
5	Yo, I had this same thought literally 3 days ago minus the fantasy. I wondered if strippers are mostly Se or Ne doms. I don't remember exactly what inspired this thought, but probably porn lmao 
2	Personally I prefer INTJ strippers. Awkward, clumsy and icy glares, just like I love my women.

3	Where can I find ENTPs?	What are ENTPs like and are they really compatible with ENFJs like myself?\n\nI hope by reading descriptions online of ENTPs and watching youtube vids that I'm not overidealizing you all already...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I should;ve known I'd get these half-assed sarcastic responses
19	To find an ENTP you will need the following things:\n\n* A proclivity for banter\n* Varied interests\n* Great sense of humor\n* Hair of an unicorn\n* Blood from three virgins\n* A pentagram\n* Some marshmallow fluff\n\nWait for the full moon and then slather yourself in marshmallow fluff while standing inside the pentagram. Dip the unicorn hair in the virgin blood and set it on fire. That should summon a few ENTPs.

5	I'm right behind you
6	ENTP usually finds you, if you talk with someone that think REALLY quick, have the ability to flirt easily, great culture and able to switch mindset as easily as you can watch your smartphone that's propably one of us ;)\n\nSometimes we could be very gentle and sometimes we could be complete asshole depending of our relation or mathematic/computer problems...
3	Not here.
3	I have several ENFJ friends. We get along well, but the arguments are intense. If I violate one of their values (anything from showing up late to having a different political opinion), they get very crusader-y and difficult to reason with. They don't back down, either—they're as hard-headed as I am! But once the conflict is resolved we're thick as thieves again. They are frighteningly loyal.\n\nedit: phrasing\n\nedit #2: Uh-oh, I didn't answer your questions. Yes, you are probably over-idealizing ENTPs. If you find an ENTP who has similar values to yours, you will probably get along with them. If you disagree with them on issues that are important to you, you may have a hard time. ENTPs can be strong ideological allies, but formidable foes. \n\nMy ENFJ friends have about the same energy level as me... which is very high. We're enthusiastic and passionate. We have a lot of fun together. They admire me for being smart. I admire them for their social savvy. We admire each other for our confidence and drive.\n
2	Coincidentally my brother is an ENFP.\n\nI honestly believe he's the ultimate. But really the combination of us works so well. His natural leadership skills are insane but he trusts me to point in the right direction and to see what he doesn't.\n\nWe work together and have for nearly 9 years with a staff of around 80. Its been joked in the past that at times we need a referee. \n\nBut in all honesty we challenge each other and I see from the hardcore objective and he sees from the hardcore relational.\n\nWhen we find the solutions that fit both they tend to be pretty awesome.
2	Three for $1. The factory is overstocked; will throw in free hot cross buns. They are really compatible with ENFJs like you ;)\n\nEdit: I'm sorry for the snark. I do hope you'll find someone compatible, entp or not
1	look under a rock, if there‘s internet, there‘ll be ENTPs\n\nEDIT: ok ok jk, i think it‘s hard to find us bc we have such various interestests, we could literally be *anywhere*

10	You worked hard to make this thread, hard to earn a down vote. I can respect that. 
6	Even worse is arguing with someone who refuses to read or acknowledge the source that I provide! Just continues blatantly arguing under the fallacy that it’s an opinion thing and not a fact thing despite the fact that I’ve provided multiple reliable sources 
4	i mean, this is a great example of how Te works in contrast to Ti users.
3	Looks like someone is salty that they lost to an STJ.
3	Hello other me. Yeah. This is so much of whats wrong with intellectual safe space reality now. I could go on with this circle jerk, but I'll just say, sigh, yeah, tell me about it. Story of my life:\n\nA former friend who was a theology PhD student helped drive me to a mental breakdown in 2012 when he kept saying 'what you're talking about is (philosopher's) (pre-existing concept) but you're wrong because (philosopher) actually means (that interpretation presented as fact). \n\nHe had no ability to argue the underlying idea without referencing all the things he had essentially been taught by rote and I've only seen the world get worse since. Deference to authority created by an academic industrial complex. (you heard that one here first)\n\nBeing an entp, you'll find my last comment here defending 'sensors' and ironically, right now I'm saying 'yeah, you'll see this bullshit a lot from sensing types.'\n\nI just wish we all had better understanding that these differences are real things.. We all have different skills and abilities that contrast and compliment each other. \n\nI'm no conservative, but so much of this comes out of PC academia. It's kind of ruining us. Well, at least it's ruining me.

15	How do you think that male and female ENTPs differ?	Or you think that they don't differ at all? 
57	Male ENTP’s tend to have more outie genitalia on the lower half, whereas female ENTP’s tend to have more innie genitalia on the lower half. 
27	I'm here for the comments..
25	Either the pocket is inside, or outside. 
18	I doubt they'd differ much at all, beyond cultural effects - e.g. 'men/women should behave a certain way'. \n\nThose probably go against a female ENTP's natural inclinations more than a male one.\n\nEdit: auto correct
17	entp men are more obnoxious because society lets them be,, but i love them anyway
14	It's harder to spot ENTP women because we're not as obnoxious as male ENTPs. I can spot male ENTPs from a mile away. Female ENTPs I actually have to talk to before I can type them. \n\nFemale ENTPs are in a weird situation because just like other NTs, we aren't always traditionally feminine, but unlike other NTs, I think we care a little bit more about being liked and getting along with others. So, we're kind of stuck in between wanting to be loud and opinionated (traits that traditionally looked down on in women), but still wanting to be liked. Women who argue (even in jest) make people uncomfortable. My friend even told me that when she is having a debate with a man, it feels fun. But with me, it makes her uncomfortable and anxious, but she couldn't say why. That tells me everything.\n\nIn a way, I'm grateful, because I think I've become a more well-rounded person overall. On the other hand, I'm resentful, because I feel like I've been punished more for doing what a man would be rewarded or at least given a pass for. 
10	Women, in general, at least here in the US have to be "nicer" to fit in with other women.   Culturally guys, when surrounded by their peers, can say anything they want and do anything they want.  The more ridiculous and outrageous the better.   Girls really can't.  Giving an honest opinion, not fitting in, not dressing right, etc... can negatively impact a school age girl's social standing.   So, I think ENTP girls, because of this (and probably because this is true of females in general) mature faster and figure out how function in society better than boys do.  \n\n\n&#x200B;
7	from what i‘ve observed (i know 2 male entps and 2 female, one being me)\n\nthe male ones are usually very open about the controversies, like they‘ll just scream things out loud in class for everyone to hear (playing classclown kinda) \n\none was making sexual puns and the other just toxic jokes\n\nwhereas me and my entp female friend only say controversial things when we‘re 1 on 1 or in a group of people, where we have a target group, not just screaming it out on the crowd not knowing whether anyone will react at all.\n\nalso me and my fem friend are extremely chill, we debate but we still watch our words and actions and how they might affect others more than the males i know. \n\none didn‘t care at all, the other cared a bit, but i still think us females give the effects, that our behaviour has on others, more thoughts\n\nso all in all, i think females are a bit more smooth and maybe not 110% confident but only 100% or so, and yea males opposite\n\n but i gotta add that personally i do everything to go against what is seen as „normal“ for females. i‘m not really feminine, rather masculine in behaviour next to others just to make a statement about going against usual gender definitions usually. idek
6	I think overall we're pretty similar. Almost exactly alike. After experiencing multiple encounters with ENTPs of both genders, I think females tend to be a bit more emotionally self-aware than our male counterparts. IMO, the guys are worse at debate because they get emotional before they realize it, and it clouds their argument. They seem less cool-tempered. Maybe this is just the ENTP guys I've met, but who knows
5	I think female ENTPs are likely to face two possibilities: either they get misidentified as ENFPs (if they have well-developed Fe), OR they get accused of being "unfeminine" on a regular basis. Generally, I do think female ENTPs have better social skills and are less "annoying" (especially as teenagers), just because - as others have already pointed out - we're socialized to "play nice" from a very young age. We run our mouths off just a little less, maybe.
4	There aren’t many cognitive differences between a male and female ENTP, besides general masculinity/femininity. As a female ENTP, I do tend to present myself differently than male ENTPs publicly. Being a female ENTP means naturally defying a lot of social norms. I know that people can be taken very off-guard by my personality upon meeting me. We definitely aren’t stereotypically feminine, tend to be loud mouths, very smart, but argumentative. Sometimes our dark sense of humor isn’t as much tolerated. Many of us will feel slightly insecure because of this, but it doesn’t last long, as it’s so difficult NOT to be ourselves. All ENTPs in general seem to be that way. In terms of functions, many female ENTPs tend to have slightly more developed Fe than males. This is why many of us have been mistyped as ENFP. 
2	Stop sign illustration for all to answer, just indicate your gender, man:\n\nDriving in a desert. Road goes on fuh-evah. Though, a wild stop sign appears...\n\nWhat dos u do?
2	I've only met another ENTP male for sure IRL and I'm a girl ENTP and the difference in age might have accounted for it but pretty much everything that came out of his mouth were sexual jokes (some pretty inventive though) but that was pretty much it. It made me perpetually get tired of this type of joke which I would only do say, once every other month? \n\nSo aside from our topics of conversation being totally different, I noticed the same need to take care of people's feelings before speaking your mind and the same scanning for people's intentions. He was actually quite nice underneath all that crassness or whatever. But there also seemed to be this neutral effect between us, just this perfect neutral understanding, like: I couldn't get pissed off at him because I knew where he was coming from and his charm, these were all very familiar. \n\nEventually he used the excuse of "I'm bored" to get out of this routine-based job, when I had been bored for months before I asked my ENFP father how to cope with the boredom and he told me that there's actually something new in everything, that every day is new and brings novel things. Then I saw that too so I looked for it and I was bored no more. So I don't think ENTP males and females are that much different cognitively.\n\n&#x200B;
4	Vaginal bleeding 
1	Me and my dad are both ENTP’s and we’re pretty similar. There’s some differences, but I think age is also a factor. There’s nothing truly noticeably different, but I am a more stereotypical ENTP. He gets a lot more done than me. 
-3	The males are physically stronger and the females are more caring
-13	I'm skeptical that a female ENTP would genuinely enjoy going at it back and forth for sport to the extent that dudes will. 
47	What was the most extreme thing you argued for while playing devil's advocate?	Do you have any boundaries regarding this?
47	The public perception of the engagement ring, and why men are justified in requesting jewellery (or Rolex watches) in return.\n\nWhat was it’s original purpose? A form of dowry in times past to signify an affluent seizing of a woman’s affection. Given any patriarchal sort of trope would’ve been magnified in a kingdom centuries ago, it begs the question as to why the women of today still put a ring on it when marrying.\n\nNow, the addendum. Engagement rings serve as a substitute to a dowry and reinforce the notion that women are to be chased, seized and kept. In many of the industrialised first world, women are the most liberated they’ve been throughout history — notably able to work and live as they wish. Therefore, any process of engagement should not be unidimensional, but a fair balance of exchange to represent the equality of man and woman within any future union.\n\nNow where’s my damn Swiss watch?
30	I almost convinced my brother that because oxygen is flammable we are slowly burning up from the inside out and that’s why we age.

32	things that people with “unfavorable” traits rely on should not exist, as it hijacks evolution. nature should determine if one lives or not. so for me, being nearsighted, I should get rid of my glasses, and if i die due to faulty eyesight, well, then i guess its for the better cause im unfit to live and i dont taint the gene pool. \n\nplease keep in mind I dont fully believe this. its just one of the many ideas ive entertained but not accepted. 
14	You just started a comments war. Clever you!
13	That necrophilia is totally fine, personally I couldn't care less about either side of the argument, they are dead after all.\n\nI decided to be pro necrophilia for fun at a family dinner because why not right?

9	I’ve argued communist points.\n\nI’m a second generation Cuban. My family has had certain negative experiences with communist ideals due to the whole Castro thing.\n\nIt was fun, though!
9	Not necessarily just to be a devils advocate, but I constantly argue for democratic socialism/socialism with people who get really angry.

5	That while Hitler was of course an evil man. We place too much blame on him looking back.\n\nHe was a figurehead of existing xenophobia and distrust in Europe.

2	Big age gap relationships while one of those people is underage (about 15 y.o tho, it was mainly about the age on consent). Also, murder isn't always 'wrong'.

That one was pretty fun, as I personally am part of lgbt community and I support both of those things😅
2	my entp friend argued in class once that you don’t need women to have a democracy. 
4	My top three. It makes me livid just thinking about this: \n\nCarrots. Fuck you carrots are good for your eyes. No they don't give you super vision because this IS NOT 1945/WWII era and the propaganda surrounding it , but that doesn't mean the high amount of Vitamin A in carrots isn't good for your eyes. It's fucking 2018, we are at the pinnacle of things where cannabis being outlawed in the 1930s and legal af today. How can you be so narrow and dense minded to not see the evidence of today vs things that happened nearly a century ago. \n\nVaccines. Mother Fucking vaccines.  There is a huge difference between CURING and PREVENTING for fucks sake. My brother and his wife think I'm an anti vaxxer for correcting them. PSA: YOU CAN NOT CURE SOMETHING BY USING SOMETHING THAT PREVENTS IT.  Another friend of mine (and normies) who thinks I'm a loon says things that annoys me like "oh you meant it literally"  wtf does this even mean, but it reminds me of my first girlfriend way back when I was a child and admitting my love to her; her response was "wait you like like me"? WHY THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO SAY LIKE LIKE TO CORRESPOND LOVE I HATE YOU ALL and I digress =D\n\nGod. Fucking religion. God if you can read this, fuck you for making so many people dumb. "GOD IS ALL POWERFUL AND CAN DO ANYTHING HE WANTS" oh yeah sure but when i ask questions like is there a creator for the creator? Can the creator create something so strong like a stone that said creator is incapable of moving? Or even something stronger ideas forming form Hawking(rip my guy) such as is the creator bound to a set of laws from the universe or did he create those laws along the universe?  My favorite being, "why do you want to explore the realm of ideas from a guy who studied philosophy for almost a decade and not explore them?" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese might not be the extreme, but this is just me ranting and an example of why I spent Christmas alone.\n\n[https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/honors/455/](https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/honors/455/) CARROTS.

0	NO boundaries...isn't that what Devil's Advocate is all about?\n\nBut to answer your question, there is no answer to your question. You see, all "my" positions are equally extreme.  From the legitimacy of infanticide to Pepsi over Coke, it says more about you how you grade the extremeness of any given viewpoint than it does about the viewpoint. That is the whole point.\n\nThere really is one argument to be found underneath any argument made by a Devil's Advocate: Why do you think I'm being extreme? Is your own assumption objectively any less extreme? How come the focus on extreme over correct??? How do you know you're right, and if you're not sure, what gives you the right to be so emotional about it?\n\nI don't care what people believe: Yesterday, they were homophobic. Tomorrow, they'll be pedophilic and proud. I just care WHY people believe. It may seem heartless to hold people hostage at the end of my pitchfork, but it's my way of coping with the madness.

1	Weed and cognitive functions	Just wanted to know if anyone considered the effects of cannabis in relation to cognitive functions. \n\nI’ve had sativa strains that made my Ne feel like it was on steroids. Writing essays and painting and shit. I’ve had sativa that energized me and drove me to do household chores... without the dread, since normally I’d get sidetracked from not wanting to do them. \n\nI’ve had indica that made me hyper-introspective and not wanting any human contact. Other indica have made me pretty sensitive when normally I’m not. \n\nAny correlations you’ve spotted in your own experiences?\n\n 
6	Doesn't matter the strain unless its sour diesel but generally my Ne is heavily stimulated everytime I smoke.
3	Yep feel the exact same way! Usually I’ll come up with a ton of weird ideas or realizations, doesn’t matter the strain
2	Depending on the mix, I believe you're bang on with the sativas and indicas. Beyond this, strains are difficult as without legalization (until recently) or growing your own, quality control is near impossible.\n\nPretty easy to tell an indica from a sativa.\n\nWith regard to cognitive function, I was chronic for years and years. I found that if I want true cognitive function, I'm so so so much better not smoking at all. I may not get the extreme insight as predictably but execution is over9000.\n\n10 years ago I never thought I'd say that.

5	How do you communicate to esfj as entp?	 My case entp/f with esfj/m. Does any one has closer relationship with esfj and what is your communication style especially after conflict? 
9	Sign language
11	1. Look at them  \n2. Get their attention  \n3. Open my mouth  \n4. Sounds come out  \n5. I communicated with them
5	1 - Make them comfortable. How you present yourself is all important to an ESFJ. Wear your best clothes, talk with gravitas, don’t stutter, watch your body language and be the least “creepy” or “cringey” as you can. I can guarantee that as an ENTP this is much harder said than done, but if you’re trying to impress an ESFJ this is what you gotta do. They are very shallow beings, remember that. \n\n2 - Pay attention to their reactions and always look out for their physical state. If they are too cold, warm them up, if they are thirsty, get them a drink etc. Make them understand that that is what you want to do. You want to fulfil their physical needs and give them a good time.\n\n3 - Make it about your feelings and what you want. With an ESFJ, never make it about what they want, they won’t know. You make the decisions but always ask for their opinion. “Hey, what do you think of etc.?” “Yeah it’s pretty good I went there before” “Ok, let’s do that then”. Also you need to emphasise your feelings big time.\n\n4 - Be emotional. If you straight up show that you like an ESFJ and want them to be around you, they’ll instantly gravitate towards you. They’re the type of person to go “I like people who like me”, so you gotta show you like them. Be as sugary sweet as you can. Make sure you differentiate this from thoughts or logic so don’t go “I think you’re the best” instead say “You’re the best”. It needs to be emotional.
3	My boyfriend is ESFJ and things are great. When we have a disagreement he can sometimes take stuff really personally and be really hurt at first until we talk about stuff more. 
3	You try and not move not to disturb them, they are gentle creatures...Afterwards you could lure them in with some mating sounds to show them they're appreciated..but NEVER initiate a debate. These species react unexpectedly to this - they will shout, they will cry, they will attack...the only way to keep the preswnce of those creatures is to constantly boost their egos...Now all jokes aside, I don't know about you but unless they are intelligent ESFJs, it will be an absolute pain in the ass atleast from my experience with an unhealthy and cocky ESFJ mother. Just try and find as much common ground as possible, but try not to initiate debates or arguments - you will win them all and the ESFJ will be a bitch about all of them and the end result won't be beautiful.
3	Dated an ESFJ for 4 years. Was an amazing experience, but in the end it didn't work out and I had to break things off. If you want to know how to get one to like you, just know you will have to do a lot of compromising (mostly to their benefit).
3	I dated an ESFJ guy and there was rarely any dispute. I found that trying to be calm and respectful and apologizing if you hurt their feelings unintentionally really works. We were super close and had a ton of fun together. My best advice would be to approach humbly and tap into your feelings (even though this may be difficult.) Communicate how you feel, why you feel that way & ask questions about how he feels. REALLY listen, and ask questions if you don't understand. And make sure to hug it out after :) 
2	My mom is ESFJ and let me tell you I could never be in relationship with someone of this type. \nBut we'll after conflict the communication is not really there as she gets mad about everything and I prefer to keep quiet cause no matter what argument I'll give it won't matter. She will get over it eventually. I usually try to say some time after it something humorous, something to laugh at. 
2	Sort of been forced to cultivate a friendship with an ESFJ over the years, as circumstances keep throwing us together. It's been difficult & we have fallen out a LOT (particularly as she has zero understanding of MBTI & we are both the assertive variant of our personalities), but we have finally gotten to a place where she understands where I am coming from.\n\nI think the most frustrating thing with SF users is that they generally don't tend to have any understanding of MBTI (usually because they fit in very easily & rarely search for answers as to why they don't) & therefore tend to assume that everyone sees the world the same way that they do & therefore don't make allowances for us, where as we know to make allowances for them & their approach to things.\n\nFind common ground & bond over what you can. Find small talk that you don't mind. For example, mine loves her cat & I have four of the little buggers, so discussing their antics works well.
1	Shallow is a great description.

8	I'm feeling offended but this guy is funny in other aspect... You should clear why you think this guy is a representation of an entp. (I don't annoy people for no reason.)
5	Yeah and what's the point of him harrassing normal people? At least Sasha harrasses frauds. But that is still really not decent sometimes.

15	What are your theories for what happens after you die?	Edit: Please feel free to give wacky, out there theories. I'm not asking for anything legit, just looking for other creative, imaginative ideas from the same type as me. Have a little fun with it my goodness.\n\nIf it's one cited from religion I don't want to hear it, sorry. \n\nThe other day I was thinking, what if when we die we "wake up" and this life was all some sort of simulation? \n\nI heard of some [technology](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10697529/Prisoners-could-serve-1000-year-sentence-in-eight-hours.html) where inmates will be able to serve life sentences (all in their head) in just a few hours. It got me thinking that this life could very well be something like that. Put in a world where you have to develop character, personality, learn right and wrong, and have no information about where you came from or why you're here. We clearly stick out like sore thumbs on this planet and we have to work to survive. What better punishment is that? Maybe how you behave in this simulation determines how long your sentence is; if you wind up in jail here, you failed and have to restart.\n\nIdk just my fun theory, what are yours and what are your thoughts on mine?!\n\nEdit: Religion could be a thing on this planet to try to give us a sort of moral code to learn and to keep too many questions at bay. Or it could be a massive mind f*** to make us docile or more likely to obey when we're done being rehabilitated lol
38	Lol am I the only ENTP that believes that the answer is: absolutely nothing? I know that's not possible but after reading your comments I'm surprised.
21	If time is infinite I think it's certainly possible I'll experience consciousness in some other form eventually.\n\nEither that or it loops\n\nThinking this stops me freaking out so much about dying
14	Simulation Hypothesis:\nOur world is simulated and after death we realise that we are just rich old guys in a futuristic society who played through the life of their great grandfather.
7	I believe our consciousness or soul is a closed energy loop, which continuously cycles through our hardware, until one day it just doesn't. Our energy will spread out instantaneously to our surroundings when we die, probably imperceptibly. Our hardware rots and nourishes new life, and that's it. Sounds grim, but from this my whole outlook on life is born. All signs point to the meaning of life being to create life. Keep making more loops, it's the Occam's razor solution to the question "why are we here?"
6	Everyone who ever lived and had offspring will be revived in the great hivemind mother-computer in the far future eventually. It is an easy task in a few million years, as we only need to trace back all the dna/cells etc in the lineage. Not going to be the same instance of conciousness of course, and it will be a completely synthetic version of us, but it will still be an exact copy. Just requires a little math and blippetiblop here and there, nothing fancy.
5	Just like before you were born, or when you sleep without dreams.
5	Our consciousness exists as a multi-dimensional field that can output truly random probabilities that machines made of refined matter called “spirits” use as a randomizer, introducing free will into an otherwise deterministic universe. These spirits are however just a starter interface for our consciousness. More experienced spirits, “Gods”, help consciousnesses to getting these highly complex spirits, and then like a mecha-anime upgrade, add a physical body on top of that. The consciousness interacts with the spirit, which interacts with the body. When the body dies, it’s just a reversion to the using of the spirit. Likewise, when the spirit is destroyed, you are left with the indestructible field of consciousness. However, the Gods have become so adept at manipulating the universe that the death of the body is purely optional. Spirits, and by extension bodies hold great power, and with it great responsibility. The Gods allow those consciousnesses who have proven they won’t abuse their power to have more control of the universe. This test is called “Mortality” and reports show that it’s one of the most terrifying and trying experiences. Spirits who choose to go through this ordeal are all given authority to own immortal bodies by the community of Gods, but those who excel and hold onto their morality are given greater manipulative powers of the universe, as they have proven that they can be trustworthy even while going through hell. Mortality, despite the belief of those going through it (see: memory wipe) is a carefully controlled environment. It is tailored specifically to test the very foundations of a being to find what will make and break them. Collateral damage has been paid for (see: Jesus Christ). Death is simply the end of Mortality, where one temporarily loses their body for processing of data, pending results of their authority level they earned in mortality. Eventually, results will be given and the body, as well as any additionally earned universe manipulators will be given. This volunteer basis system has been rebelled against several times (see: Satan), but all rebellions have been quashed by the community of Gods, whose powers exponentially grow as their community does. Those who go through mortality with the best results are given joint projects with a “spouse” and are given the highest responsibility of forming spirits and conducting Mortality tests. This system is set up so the Gods will only elect those who, from their very core, want the best for the universe and those who have found themselves living in it. \nThat’s my theory anyways. Definitely religious, but what did you really expect?
4	When I was a kid I was (still am) hella curious, and every time I couldn't find an answer I just started assuming "when I die, I'll get to know the answer". I pictured myself in an ethereal ambient talking to the characters I was so willing to get to know in order to obtain the answers I always longed for. \n\nGrowing up, I learned so many theories about the after life, but I'm still very found of my childish version of death. I kinda enjoy thinking of death as a state of conscious knowledge of Life, the Universe and Everything.\n\nEdit: formatting.
3	I used to be deep in religion heaven and hell but with in the past few years. I reached two plausible answers. One, our spirit convertes to some kind of energy and be part of this planet. We just decompose and turns to dust, no such thing of spirit. 
3	I'd like to think that this is all a video game or a big participation of Souls agreeing to manifest a physical body to experience the taste of flesh and desires.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt also is a test for what happens to you after you leave said dimension. Like more credit or tokens to give you access to more better experiences. The shittier you are, the more you have to compensate in the next life.\n\nIE: someone born with a disability was due to his own self harm in the past life.
5	You're banishing religion from this discussion but then contribute a quasi religious explanation yourself. \n\nHere's an austere but very likely theory: Consciousness is a biological phenomenon and we cease to exist as living beings the moment we die. The only shot we have at an 'afterlife' is through the fruits of our labor, i.e. the intellectual or physical achievements we leave behind. \n\nThat's why grade A criminals like Jesus Christ and Adolf Hitler will be virtually immortal while you'll be forgotten in a generation or two. 
2	If death causes us to cease to exist, is your lack-of-existence a thing capable of impeding the experience of the organism born immediately after you cease to exist?\nAnswer: No.\n\nNothing < An Experience \n\nWatch Alan Watts on YouTube talk about Rebirth and Reincarnation & Death.\n\nAlso, look up a guy named Tom Clark. His Generic Subjective Continuity Theory is pretty much what Watts says too. 
2	lol, are ENTPs known for formulating wild, head-in-the-clouds, purely "creative" theories that don't attempt to strike out something that feels actually "true" or sincere to them, especially about topics that people are typically fairly passionate about?\n\nI feel like your question would have been more successful for getting the answers you were looking for if asked as "I'm writing a book, what are some creative ways I can have the afterlife situation in my plot that don't just 100% copy real world religious beliefs line for line." (In fact, I'm not totally convinced that's not the case— you here getting writing shortcuts? /s) \n\nPhrasing it as specifically "your" theories for what happens after you die triggers that possessive "I gotta make a really convincing argument for the solution I've gathered seems the most plausible and correct" trap ENTPs love to fall into when challenged in an argument.
2	I have been wandering in uncertainty about the question for a while.  But then I learned there are likely a few hundred NDE (near death experience) accounts per day.  I recently looked into them and it now seems very unlikely to me that consciousness does not exist outside the physical body at the very least.  There are too many accounts where people travel outside the body and view events out of the range of natural perception (hear conversations or see things down the hall or miles away, only to verify what they saw at that time was indeed true and while they were dead/in the hospital etc)(AKA veridical perception).  Before I thought there were only a handful of people with NDE stories but it turns out there are many thousands and they are not usually wacky fringe people.  Many ardent athiests have them (they just don't usually stay athiests).
2	Perhaps 'you' get trapped in your head in the last flash of life for what feels like eternity but really it was a final flash of life and by the time the flash finishes it will have been 14 trillion years and you immediately shut down.\n\n\n\nAfter this obviously nothing (unless God/judgement exists). But still it's pretty cool to imagine all that's been longing for release in the recesses of your brain your whole life all gets to simultaneously explode together, who's to say you don't envision yourself as the protagonist of a very real very fantasy life lasting for almost eternity with nothing but bliss??\n\n\n\nOooooo and that's possibly why evil people stare at the ceiling while shaking their fists before they die; all that's in their brain is guilt, pain, horror, and the lingering bitterness that has yet to be avenged. Someone write a Black Mirror episode on this.\n
2	I think we would be reborn. Those paramount stories of children talking in such detail about their past lives despite zero exposure to such subject convinces me. 
2	I'm a conspiracy theorist first and foremost so my oh my, does this get my juices flowing! So many theories. I think after we die, we realize we never really died, people just make a big deal of it, so we scream and yell and throw things at them until we realize there's a place...this is where it gets interesting...there's a place where the more chocolate you eat, the more sex appeal you get! This place is chocabundant btw. If you eat too much though, you become a baby again....and that's where babies come from...which reminds me...now what came first...the chicken or the egg?
2	>If it's one cited from religion I don't want to hear it, sorry.\n\nThen what, exactly, are you looking for? Because the secular, non religious answer is that our bodies decay to the constituent elements and withers away. There is no soul. There is no afterlife. When you die, you're gone. Forever. So why are you asking about what happens "after life" and rejecting religious answers? Because you're asking a religious question. \n\n>Religion could be a thing on this planet to try to give us a sort of moral code to learn\n\nIf you think religion is a great moral code, then you are truly lost, padawan
1	> If it's one cited from religion I don't want to hear it, sorry. \n\nSo what are you expecting? What differentiates your "fun theory" from the religious views regarding death and "after-life"? \n> The other day I was thinking, what if when we die we "wake up" and this life was all some sort of simulation? \n\nNow, use your Ti and back up your assertion with proper argumentation and scientific evidence if necessary.\n> Idk just my fun theory, what are yours and what are your thoughts on mine?!\n\nI haven't theorized about it and it'll be like that for a long time. I remain skeptical about the possibility of "something" after death, so for the moment I believe that our bodies decay and that's it. Nothing else.
1	We shit ourselves and get buried in a expensive box. But hey, at least my bones will have its own piece of land not owned by the bank for the first time!
1	I think the absolute funniest thing would be that life is some kind of VR/simulation game that we pay for to learn something from the experience (much like other video games).\n\nAt the end of the game, you gain consciousness in the "real" world (a gaming arcade) and you wait for your brother to finish too. You can't wait much longer, you had such a good life, and are looking forward to sharing your story with him. \n\nWhen he finally wakes up you say "wow, that was amazing, I fell in love with the most beautiful woman of my dreams, we had loads of sex and raised three kids together." \n\nYour brother turns bright red and says "that was me, I've always loved you".\n\nSuddenly you realise that your heavenly experience in the game was you essentially being raped by your brother for 50 years, and you've just woken up to your worst nightmare - reality. \n\nEverything suddenly goes black and you hear some strange noises and a sudden SNAP! \n\nYou are lying on what looks like an operating table and somebody with white overalls is pulling cables out of your head.\n\n"We're really sorry, this has never happened before. Unfortunately, we had to terminate your session in GoL as we need you to reenter your PIN on your credit card, you typed the incorrect one. Would you like to enter your PIN again please?"\n\nYou enter it again and this time, you're the brother. 
1	That you die and either decompose into the dirt/earth or cremation where you turn into ashes. \n\nI’m an atheist and base all my beliefs through science and biology.
1	The people closest to you will discover your porn stash and go through it.\n\nProbably judge you heavily for it, sort through it and then add the bits they want to keep their collection, discarding the rest.
1	God is a programmer. We are currently on one thread of this universe’s cycle and our mind gets transported to a holding room a la the NPC cadaver room in Skyrim until our thread gets restarted.

0	I actually believe in God. Heaven and hell? Did anyone forget about that? Yes I believe in science. Don't attack me.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI swear I'm still an ENTP. 
7	Brain Food or complete nonsense you decide	so i‘m kinda tired of letting all my theories and ideas and thoughts rot away bc i‘m afraid i‘ll end up like the quote below, it made me realize sth important \n\n„The wealthiest place on the planet is the graveyard, because in the graveyard we will find inventions that we were never ever exposed to, ideas, dreams that never became a reality, hopes and aspirations that were never acted upon.“ - Les Brown\n\nso i‘m gonna regularly shit dump my thoughts here and u can downvote me all u want, you‘re welcome\n\n#1\n\nsince mankind is thousands of years old, and despite common beliefs that mankind only reaches up to 6,000 years, recent discoveries prove that our beliefs are pure shit (search of Göbeklitepe findings, underground city which is 12,000 years old)\n\nso now i do know that the civilization has been getting bigger and we‘ve not always had the same amount of humans on earth as now, but nevertheless a plenty amount of people have died up until now.\n\nwhich made think that what if the current soil we know wouldn‘t have the same properties if it wasn‘t mixed with dead bodies/corpses? what if every part of earth is already mixed with so many corpses that we don‘t know what „pure soil“ would look like, and imagine if we‘d ever find „pure soil“ it would have way better results for growing plants etc bc it‘d be the most efficient nurturing soil ever found bc it‘s pure. \n\n(i know this is absurd but idc)\n\n#2\n\nalso universal language. currently it‘s english but bc language is a fundamental part of what defines a culture, no language will be fully adapted by every single person and we couldn‘t create an universal language without being biased towards one nation. (bc a language is influenced by culture\n\nEDIT: another option would be defining a universal language which gets constantly improved w new words added to its vocabulary bc it is trying to absorb and implement all foreign culture etc related vocabulary to it\n\ni do know we could just use a basis language and use all foreign words in latin letters)\n\nso now the only tool we have which is universally accepted is the number system. no one denies numbers going from 0 to 9 (1 to 10) and even if it has different notations and spellings/ pronounciations everywhere, it is universal. \n\nwhat if we transformed that numerical system into a language, and thus everyone would by default be able to speak the universal language\n\n#3\n\nor another thought, what if numbers where originally a language in the past, but we‘ve always misinterpreted it as being mathematical etc only, and never looked at it from a „decoding a language“ point of view. if this was the case everything number related would literally tell whole stories\n\nimagine the perfect proportional numbers of the pyramid of giza, what if these number actually told a story? (yes i do know about numerology that‘s not what i mean tho)\n\nyea anyways just some brainfood i didn‘t wanna take to grave w me, thanks for listening
2	Every time you have an idea go test it. Test it for real or go debate it like you do here. Train your mind to create better ideas by testing them. We are ENTP and what we can do best is solve problems but we need to train to be better at what we do best :)
1	>also universal language. currently it‘s english but bc language is a fundamental part of what defines a culture, no language will be fully adapted by every single person and we couldn‘t create an universal language without being biased towards one nation.\n\nIf you want to *create* a language, what keeps you from keeping cultural influences at a minimum? [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) is such a language and it doesn't strike me as culturally biased mainly because it doesn't have a host culture. \n\nThe more important question is: why reinventing the wheel? English serves well as a quasi universal language (note: it's *not* universal. There are places where knowing English is a useless skill.) because of the political power of the Anglosphere and the cultural dominance of the US --  Hollywood, pop music, etc. It is also, at least for Europeans, a relatively easy to learn language. \n\nYou only really need five languages to get by on this planet: English, Spanish, Russian, Mandarin and Arabic. English and Spanish are comparatively easy to learn for most Westerners. \n\nSince you mentioned culture and cultural bias, who says English doesn't evolve into a truly global language given enough time? Maybe Dutch English will be much more influenced by Dutch culture than say Australian English? Think about the cultural differences between the US, UK and Australia and how it reflects in each variety of English. \n\nI don't think cultural bias is that important ultimately since it either gets eliminated by design or through evolution.  
1	Maybe you would enjoy r/Showerthoughts. Also, part of Reddiquette is: "**Use proper grammar and spelling.**"\n\nSo please use punctuation and such, as it is hard to understand your otherwise well thought-out sentences.
3	Any ideas on what to do for fun in the NYC area these days?	I’m bored and I’ve run out of things to do.
5	I did a ton of photography (main reason I went) when I visited back in March. If you’re a photographer it’s an aesthetic overload 24/7 and for me photographing it is an effective way to make sense of it all. The met & nat history museum are both fantastic (particularly the nat museum). Times Square is fun to just chill in, especially late at night. Great place to talk with people (usually some sort of protest or a couple people holding picket signs looking for discourse). 
4	You live in the cultural and economic capital of the world... and you’re asking people on the internet what to do for fun???
1	Flashdancers
1	I enjoyed the Met. Just visiting or do you live there?
1	You type yourself as Ne dom, type 9 enneagram, and you want to do stuff in NY, because you have done everything. \n\nHow mistyped is it possible to be?
43	Books	Am I the only who has problems at being able to continuous reading books? Like I'm fine reading books and 20 pages of it but all of sudden I get lost in my mind and lose the interest of it and most likely start searching "another dot" that could be adaptable into the book context. In other words, I fall into the abyss of curiosity. As an ENTP fellows can someone tell me how to fix this problem? Like God damn, happens every fucking time more as well procrastinate at playing games. (No, I don't have ADHD, just ruling that possibility out for everyone willing to reply).
15	I absolutely anihilate audiobooks, talking 4-6 hours a day. They might be a better option. Whenever i get caught up in mu own thoughts, i stop reading for a bit. I allow my thoughts to play for a bit before continueing. It could also be a matter of discipline, or the writing style of the author. I fond that it makes a huge difference to me wherether something is well written or not
22	ENTPs are more than capable of finishing books. Millennials, on average, read fewer books than our previous generations. This is an artifact of our engrossment in entertainment culture. We as a generation truly do have a shorter attention span than our parents and their parents. \n\nAn ENTP in an earlier generation would be on the opposite end of the spectrum as you, whereby they bury their head in books since that's the only source of fantasy exploration. Today, we have the internet and TV and movies and video games and well developed table top games, etc. We don't need books, we prefer instant gratification. \n\nBesides, we're too busy reading Instagram, Reddit, Facebook, wikipedia, text messages all day anyway. We're reading almost around the clock. It's almost *boring* to dive balls deep in a book. It's almost better to just leave reading to daily life and allow that entertainment aspect to be handled other ways. \n\nSo whether you like books or not will be somewhat how you're raised, I'd argue. If you're taught young to explore fantasy in books (before you learn you have all this technology available), you'll prefer books. The millennials are really split in this generation somewhat. The older millennials grew up with the internet, as well as with the evolution of video games. So some will be immersed in this new tech, others will be reading more. It's the younger millennials who I expect to be reading almost no books outside of school. \n\nThe next generation will be reading books even less. We have the world at our fingertips in our pocket. How can you bury your head in a book? Books are almost archaic now. And if they're not archaic now, they will be in the future. \n\nHere's my prediction. In the future (assuming we don't die from cataclysmic climate change) books will long be dead. They'll be relegated to the elite college sphere of learning, whereby you **have to read** to learn. They may be more 3D and interactive, but books as we know them today will only exist in academia, and be considered relics of the past (this would require religion dying out, and the Bible being thrown to the wayside). We already see religious  numbers on the decline. \n\nActually, you'll also see books still being used in the fractioned off microcosms of religious sects. They'll still cling to the holy Bible, which will also be a relic of the past like the Greek Iliad and Odyssey, like the Song of Roland, and other texts. 
5	Tl;dr I don't do well with 'em\n\nI also have a stupid time reading books. I will go on a book borrowing high and check out 3-4 books from the library - ALL the books on subjects I want to grow in so desperately - and cannot for the life of me pick up the books again. It's like I adopted kids, feeling charitable. And the next day I completely forget and regret my decision... (I don't know what it's like to adopt and I'm not knocking anyone who was an orphan, please don't feel things):\n\n"Oh, I know. I'll read one chapter and if I'm still interested I'll read another!"\n\n*One chapter* - "That was amazing! Absolutely fantastic!"\n\n*Another chapter* - "JUst as AMAzing. How is this even possible? I shouldn't over do it. I'll start the next book now..."\n\nRepeat cycle. On the same day. Then \n\n*Next day* - "What the hell was this book even about? Why do I have it? Who are you?"\n\nTl;dr So yeah, books. I don't do well with 'em
5	Me: man this book is so good why didn’t I read it before? \n\nMe 10 pages later: annnnd that’s enough \n\nMe 1 year later looking under the bed “ ohhhhh yeah... oh well. Wonder if it’s on audible?”
5	Reading is a skill.  You have to read substantial things to get good at reading.  The more you read, the faster you learn to read and your reading comprehension increases. \n\nI think, given today’s multitude of easy fix distractions, reading anything substantial (100s of pages) is something most children only do in school, if that, and the reason why so many struggle with reading is simply because, much like penmanship, it’s not a well-practiced skill among Millenials.  So it’s also not surprising that Millenials rarely seem to read for enjoyment.\n\nUnlike penmanship with typing however, there’s no technological replacement for reading comprehension.
3	Yes, but when I was younger, before iOS, I read books everyday and usually to completion. I think I have Internet enabled ADHD.
2	THANK GOD I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
2	I haven’t read many books lately (I’m not going to count audiobooks) but as a kid I was an absolute bookworm. I would finish school books so quick I would be reading something totally different in class lol
2	Reading a book is a great way to get yourself away from a screen. Also grew up reading a lot because no internet until high school. So maybe it's just a conditioning/age thing.
2	I have this problem with nonfiction but not so much with fiction. Because nonfiction is often just a more boring take on real life, while fiction (when done well) is a new world to be explored in which many of your standard assumptions about our reality may not hold - especially in stuff that's sci-fi, fantasy, alternate history, doesn't follow a linear in-universe timeline, or has multiple (or one unreliable) narrators. I think books that play with reality in this kind of way are a lot more engaging and I have an easier time getting through them because I have to constantly think and adjust my assumptions/frame of reference as I read.
1	You may want to consider [incremental reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_reading). Or perhaps try actively taking notes and writing out your thoughts while you read; perhaps use something like the Feynman method.
1	I have the same symptoms but I finish books in my own way:\n\nI prefer to buy 3 **or more** books that I'm interested in on Amazon, and then proceed to read the first few pages of each. If my mind becomes engrossed in one book, I'll read that until it becomes boring or my mind wanders to one of the other books, after which I will proceed to read that one, *et cetera*.\n\nSometimes I will have huge reading spurts where I'll read 200+ pages at once, but these are rare. Most of the time I will read between 20 and 50 pages at once.\n\nMost people would find this scheme of reading highly chaotic, and I'm gonna be honest: I kinda did too. But I've since realised that it's definitely working for me either way. It probably helps a lot that I exclusively read non-fiction.
1	haha, I have exactly the same problem. Althought I believe that the books I own would really help me a whole fucking lot, I still dont read them because I'm too lazy / they're not interesting enough :D
1	Much as it pains me to be "ageist", I think this is a generational thing. I of course can get distracted from finishing all the books I start, but I have no problem reading books that are hundreds of pages long. What I found was important for me was to commit to it--to close my laptop, put my phone on silent (or off), and just read. I usually read only nonfiction so I often have a pencil in hand where I make marks in my book as I go. 
1	i love the greek philosophers!	i love the greek philosophers.!\n\n\nmainly because they used pure logic to deduce things.\n\n\nthere wasnt much science back then so they would reach the hieght of there cognitive functions.\n\n\neg.lets take heraclitus(intj by idr labs(also voted intj by far in mbti base))\nParmenides(intp by idr labs)\n\n\nyou can see how they both differed according to there dom cognitive functions yet reached to the hieghts of there dom cognitive functions!\n\n\nParmenides said that there is no change the world stands still.\n\n\nheraclitus said that everything is chaning and the only constant is change\n\n\nnow if you look at all the ti philosophers they all point to a one.somehting which never changes zeno of elea(entp by idr labs) proved through logic that nothing moves and everything is one\n\n\nyou can also se ti.in plato with his theory of froms...\n\n\nnow if you take heraclitus and nietzsche you will see more fluidity in there theories.like nietzsche said.there is not facts only interpretations.and heraclitus who said nothing is perminent exept change.\n\n\nso you can say intjs vs intp.\nintps=reaches the height of logic.nothing changes\nintj=ni+te everything changes\n\nthoughts opinions?

16	ENFJs: The one ive met is a little scary and he got a bit too close, to the point where he was literally breathing down my neck and private life, after which I pushed him away. Sometimes cringy in the way he wants to be likeable to others. Complete social life and I feel sometimes he looks down on me for lacking what he has (and I dont want).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nINFJs: Best on paper, but the one i have met was full of herself. They often come across as self-centered and narcissistic and full of bullshit. You cant pretend to be all open-minded and humble and a "*pure soul*" or whatever but  only talk about yourself all day and shut me out when I point out your character flaws. The one ive met was warm on the outside ice cold on the inside. Also in a sense they are equally good at fake socializing to the point where it can get really edgy when both people fake likeing to be around to each other in an ice cold way. Edgy. Maybe just a bad apple, but ive met people that shared my experience. That being said the one ive met was unconcentional and an original. Havent met anyone like her before or ever since. That was what originally drew me to her. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nINFP: I get attracted to them for reasons I dont understand. Not as individualistic as people say, its just that Fi doms have this vibe around them that makes me want  to wrap them up and protect them. What I would call truly pure souls. Can be extremely hard to deal with though, because they suck at communicating and avoid conflict and get angry at you for totally unreasonable reasons.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nENFP: Very fun people. Have met kindred souls and best friends. Funny and stimulating to be around. Good communicators, good care takers, good conversationalists. On the other hand, some of the worst fights ive had with ENFPs. Too similar in terms of arguing or fighting but completely opposite ways of seeing the problem. Equally relentless which results in an unending conflict between two aggrevated egos. Its like these people see the same things we see and interpret them completely wrongly. A lot ive met have had weird and factually wrong opinions. How can someone be so open-minded, yet still be so rigid in their undifferentiated beliefs. Most of the time most people only know half the facts but still have preconcieved notions about things, thats just humaning (you cant always know everything about everything), still its like these people justify radical view points by summoning dubious sources, that are hard to fact check and if need be world propaganda and manipulation of the industry and government and then argue with such vigor, that is so aggrevating, that the resulting shouting match can only be ended by giving in frustratedly or negotiating a ceasefire. Radical.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn general my experience with NFs is that they are usually very socially aware. They care intensely and are either conceited or very self-aware. I would say I get along fairly well with most, and they make great hosts and caring friends. Can be cringy, which makes me unconfortable, sometimes cold and social strategic which is threatening. Sometimes unrational and unreasonable, which can be frustrating and off-putting. Whilst I find dominant fi introverts attractive, I generally value Fe a lot more across all types, at least these people tend to be well behave and easy to get along (even if its just superficially).
14	I LOVE NFs!\n\nSlight caveat in that I prefer NFs who use Fe as one of their top functions. They're so cute with their feelyness but also have a great intelligence with people - which I strongly admire.\n\nENFJs and INFJs are people I would like to know better.
6	I love the NF's for a short time, but I'd never want to permanently live with one.  It's exhausting having to constantly watch out for stepping on someone's feelings.
6	One note from my current ENTP (Male) and ENFP (Female) relationship:\n\nThe ENTP (me) is terrified of advocating for myself and speaking up about what I truly want, maybe worried doing so will cause conflict? I wish she'd ask me more.\n\nThe ENFP (her) is terrified of asking me what I want because she's worried that doing so will force her to sacrifice her own wants. She wishes I just spoke up more.\n\nBoth of deeply care about the other's well being yet have this exact opposite approach to communicating and learning about each other's needs in the relationship. I should also mention both of us had very neglectful childhoods and carry those scares into adulthood and neither of us are very confident individuals.
4	I have an INFP friend and our discussions are great !\nWe both have Ne so usually we give good insights about each other.\nThe To enables me to analyse those ideas while her Fe reminds me of what is "acceptable" to do or not. (which I usually don't care about)
5	I really like and admire them
4	I dated an ENFP and all the ENFPs I've met have been super appealing people to me for some reason. I can't speak to the other NF types ("rapper," etc.), but ENFPs have this air about them and I love them.
4	Thank you guys for all the love ! Makes my lurking here all the more meaningful :D
4	Best friend is INFP, second best friend is INFJ, most of my family is ENFP, and most partners ive had were ENFJ. \n\nThe INFP I know, I really enjoy. He's calm, chill, and we share the same interests: skateboarding, surfing. We've been friends for 20 years. He's a pretty simple dude, not very well educated so he doesn't intellectually stimulate me, but because of our long standing history as friends, we share a very strong bond.\n\nI know 2 INFJ's. Both are very well educated, and both have enormous social circles, with hundreds of friends they seem to know everything about. Not sure how they keep up, but I do notice they are sort of flaky, not because they don't wanna hang out with people, but because their social lives are so huge that it is difficult to find a place in their schedule to hang out. They are both intellectually stimulating people. \n\nI know so many ENFP's and I love them. Being both primary Ne users, I tend to bounce off them, and situations turn very hype when I'm around them. These NF's make great partners in hijinx. I find they hate arguments, even though they are sometimes good at them, and I think that has prevented me from making close friends with any of them. \n\nENFJ's have somehow been the personality type of every partner I've ever had, except one. Because of their protagonism, if they get in a bad mood, it puts me in a bad mood as well. Since I spend so much of my private life around them, that aspect can get exhausting. But what I do love about them is their passion. They're incredibly caring for others, and they are very good at convincing people to be caring as well. I think this is what I keep getting attracted to. I also like supporting them in debate, because all the ENFJ's that I know have a great reputation for integrity and honesty, which is the opposite of my reputation. Therefore, as debate partners, I let them set the opinion / conclusion, and I supply the tact and logic and support their premise(s).
3	Never met or encountered an ENFJ sorry\n\nI know one ENFP and I'm amazed by his sentimental abilities. He's constantly coming up with fun creative ideas or rather little stories about everything. I don't know him personally but I know enough I'd be great friends with an ENFP.\n\nI know three INFJ's, one of them personally. My least favourite NF because in my experience the FJ combination is just too much. These three tend to use truths as an insult and are more prone white lies, even if they hate to do it? Some of them are more prejudiced to some things or ideas that they even realize. \n\nI know one INFP personally and yeah we are okay, sometimes we get each other real good but sometimes they are way too accepting that seems rational to me if that makes sense. Like their lack of wanting to fight back is in a funny way disappointing to me, almost suspicious. On the other hand she at least seems to think I'm a little selfish at times. 
3	I usually like/get along with them. If they start getting super hippie on me and talk too much about the universe and the cosmos too seriously, I tend to get bored and/or have to tiptoe around the conversation as to not offend them with my real thoughts ("this some dumb hippie stuff"). But sometimes it comes out and thennn they think I'm an asshole.\n\nBasically, as long as it they're not too sensitive (which obviously some are), I mostly love their company.
3	Perfect, I've been waiting for this. \*claps hands like a psychopath by himself\* Not gonna hold back, NFs don't come chasing after me. Thanks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nENFJ - My self-proclaimed best friend. Literally lives their entire lives by social rules. Cringe as fuck at times. Similarly to what u/Back_off_Track said, seems to look down on me for being slightly weird at times. Don't know if you are being deliberately manipulative but I definitely am not gonna tell you who's next on my FuckWithMyEyes list. Used to be a good conversationalist till he got so self-absorbed.\n\nINFJ - Very private. Only met some online but I always had to initiate some conversation. When I tell one my type,  withdraws and waits for me to chase after her with my 'charming ENTP abilities'. Dude, it's not 1969. Only met one mature one but we never managed to talk well. Good if we are of the same age though.\n\nINFP - I literally spot them by seeing them talking about their sad pasts or something along that line. Once I tell them their type, acts so surprised like I'm some weirdo fortune teller. I mean like, you aren't that rare and unique, you know? The mature ones I meet are adequate. When I think of INFPs, I kind of weirdly want to protect them and that turns me on at times. It's like, they have this really vulnerable side and shit. Also, most of them I can communicate well with unless I make a joke about their emotions. Then here comes the hurricane. (Or the menstruation) I like those that are smaller sized than me. Adds on to the vulnerable flavor. Then I sprinkle myself on them. Sexually, in my mind.\n\nENFP - Alright, uh. The ones I meet in real life are those populars (and wannabes). Always those girls spamming lots of HAHAHAs and LOLs. For boys, don't think I've met any. Oh, Barry Allen is one cool ENFP. But he's one of the only cool ones. Some bitch a fuck ton. That Fi has no limits. I have one depressed ENFP friend though. Can be recklessly tactless sometimes. Managed to deflate my ego and piss off my ENFJ friend at the same time. She's like, the only one NF that managed to be effortlessly rude to my ego. Yeah, stupid bitch. I relate to the Ne though. It's how I managed to survive around her. That and making fun of her mannerisms. It's how she socializes anyway.
2	Love NFs except for ENFJs. Have yet to meet a decent one.
7	INFPs are the fucking worst. Incapable of working through conflicts. What good is understandanding other people’s emotions if you can’t control your own?\nMerry fucking Christmas. 
3	I utilize INFP as a great 1 on 1 private friend whom teaches me warmth, authenticity, and they have a great tenacity for logic, they will see the things clearly we don't. Sometimes they're hypo and, other times closed off and quiet listeners, My best friend whom is like a brother is an INFP. Alot to be said but what I gain from them in terms of insight I can't quite utilize until I have ENFP time lol.. INFP's darkside is horrible and doesn't like my cold nature or suggestion's/ideas. They love animals.. hate people, love being loved by people. Get shit on alot because of that weakness. Best listeners ever.. just don't allow them to get pessimistic.. everyone will know when they've had enough, trust me.\n\nENFP: This is a partner in crime for small doses. We usually are foregainst each others idea's  thin and through however seemingly co-operate, they help me unlock the pure Fi learnt from INFP, they have many friends, are well liked and expect you to know everybody in their tangent stories. They question the things I'm confident about and don't bother worrying over and vise versa. Because I don't care about being liked it's draining to hear the concerns of ENFP and see their underlying selfishness at the end of the play. They migrate like birds, and allways fuck up on purpose whilst knowing people will let them off the hook. They are great at lying to themselves.. and being in the moment, enjoying it. They also have very selective hearing and/or absorbing. They are happy go lucky people to do task's with and like to voice issues only to argue with your advice they seemed to be asking for, by belaying it. They like certainty what they're up to. Also ENTP/ENFP have rare ability to exchange a million parallels of an idea a minute to each other and some how absorb both. The transcontextual thinking paired up with the energy is real. We allways walk away from each other feeling like we reached new height's and grew. But it's draining on both sides. \n\nENFJ: These creatures are great fuzzy ballers whom are very people orientated. We subversively understand each other due to Fe, however I slowly realized these Fe doms can use there natural abilities to be deceptive with their cunning social adeptness and chameleon acting skills. The selfish nature usually backfires. They seem to love me as an ENTP. Find they're rare but they tend to see alot of potential in me seek me out, they have a parasitic and advantageous nature I can't tolerate for too long and ever permanently. Great in small doses and reliable gossiper's/social angle. Predictable and hedonistic.\n\nINFJ: Obviously they're a clear winner and I think they're awesome, alas they allways seem to like ENFP or atleast click more. They are pretty full of themselves too though, but a good honest nature just like mine. Have ENTJ traits which OF get shit done, now, go! Their Fe-Ti and my Ti-Fe really see eye to eye on most things and INFJ is surprised how thoughtful I can be. Feels like they confuse us for having Fi-Te, or atleast wish for us too. Can be a great partner in crime but feels like work/being controlled. Can't handle it! They get mad we aren't Sensors or FP's for them to get to do stuff for them lol. They mistake us for ENFP or ENTJ I think. They make me think alot lol. Still haven't quite figured them out :)
2	I've been in this community for almost two years and I still don't know if I'm ENFP or ENTP, but here ya go: \n\n\n\nI LOVE THEM, ESPECIALLY xNFJs. I feel like they complement my personality. They're the only people I've fully opened up to. I let my guard down around them. My bestfriend who I don't know if I have feelings for or not, but if she's still single when she turns 30 I'm definitely marrying her cuz our combo is the best is an INFJ. Just last night when we were driving around at midnight she was asking me the best questions---'what was the most painful moment in your life??' stuff like that. It felt so good I didn't want it to end. :) 
2	Well if you are an mature ENTP you can understant better ENFP but that T part of you will be hard to manage. A good relationship ENTP ENFP is one where we understand that T is better then F in some situations and F is better in other situations.\n\nI will personaly enjoy a relationship with an ENFP just for the fact that i can learn to be more F... i am a guy btw :))
1	I am a huge fan of Nicole Byer from her podcast Why Won't You Date Me? and Nailed It! and I'm 99% sure she's an ENFP. My dad was (he's deceased) an INFJ and I really looked up to him. Yet, I have an ENFJ friend who pisses me off sometimes. I've never gotten close to any INFPs. 
1	Part of me loves NFs; they're so cute. \n\nThe other part of me is BAFFLED at how you all function. Or, rather, don't.\n\n...yes, including you, ENFJs, although you do the best job of pretending out of the lot.
1	What are your plans for the new year and what do you have to finish this year?	so, what are your plans for the new year and what do you have to finish this year?
3	Need to write 3 term papers till 01.01.\nNo plans whatsoever
2	For this year I'll progress with the not work-related stuff I've been putting off, like finalizing my flat's new design plans. I'll also meet friends and throw a NYE party, which is nice. Next year? More of the same!
1	Driving 10 hours to my bf's house for NYE. I need to clean my car and get my mother's name off the title; we had a confrontation and she took it to force a meeting. 
1	Plan on buying a boxing bag, try staying at where I am to see if it improves with the training, and figure life out haha
1	quiet NYE, start prepping for a day or two before going back to work (I have 13000 emails that I need to clear), get organised for getting back to the gym because I have a wedding to attend in May
1	Meditate, I feel that I did okay 2018 but I want to have this energy that I recently learned "Embrace your energy body. " by Jeffery Allen. I picked this from fb ad and sounds intersting. Something new to explore and practice if it is useful. If any one has this energy body field type of info welcome to share. 
1	Will be a calm fun time with my associate. In 2019 I push my podcast to the next level (it is at 200 episodes with solid guests along the way) by including more creators, makers, scientists, authors, and notable figures.\n\nThis life is short and we have to reach for goals that fit us.\n\nI will write my way through 2019 so I keep track of where I am and where I'm going.\n\nWe are the whole thing. Hope all of you close out 2018 solid. We are a group of people meant to be innovators and creators.
1	- Make a list.\n- Clean up my room (Dr. Jordan B. Peterson for reference).\n- Set up daily routines for what I am supposed to do on a daily basis (become more orderly and focused).\n- Start with a ketogenic diet.\n- Lose the weight I've gained and focus on reaching a set ideal weight (preferably body type) for myself.\n- Conclude whether I could start modelling again or not.\n- Set up a long-term plan with several milestones to be able to feel like the end goal isn't too much to bear and so that the feel and need for gratification of reaching certain milestones would be achieved and would motivate me into challenging myself to reach the next milestone.\n- Finish several music tracks, make a plan for an album release and complete the task of releasing that album.\n- Educate myself more by reading more literature, take certification exams and earn more certificates (not that passing certification exams has to mean that I am more educated but hopefully become more valuable for future opportunities and prove both to myself and to others of being a very driven and a countable person).\n- Sell the things that I do not use nor need.\n- Start investing more of my income.\n- "Think less", act more.\n- Spend more time with people that share the same values and ambitious lifestyle. \n- Spend less time with shallow people as well as people who aren't ambitious and tend to keep me from evolving to something greater (of course my own realisation to get rid of people I thought to be my friends but are just people I partied with).\n- Learn to realise that I am on a journey and that I need to enjoy that journey.\n- Go into business with the right people (people I could see Running the business at least as good as I would) and not with friends (not worth losing friends over money disputes).\n- Start working on a plan to create the solutions and the products that can ease life for everyone in the world, both creative-wise and necessity-wise.\n- Travel to places that can expand my mind.\n- Make decisions to either Finish projects or to just scrap them.\n\nThis is what I hope to be in store for my 2019.
1	Complete my MBA. Then shift the time I was studying into developing an app I want to make for personal use. 
42	What can happen to you with reddit and every other website/app	
8	Few weeks ago I've installed an app which locked reddit. I set it up to allow 10mins of reddit everyday.\n\nFirst few days were frightening. It was like it was the 90% of what I do on my computer.\n\nThis helped me with focusing on tasks better, I have since completed some overdue tasks etc. I still have reddit on my phone, but I find that I don't need it as much anymore. Now, I went from several hrs/daily on reddit to two hours per week. I still love reddit, but I've come to the point to admit that I've become addicted to receiving new information and it kept my brain in hyperactive mode. I feel better now.
7	1. [Recycle the obligatory comment, trying to be funny: "I am going to watch it, later..."]  \n2. (ESFPs mistyping as ENTPs): "HAHAHAHA SO FUNNY".  \n3. Upvote  \n\nBut besides that. Thanks for sharing. Genuinely seems like interesting content. Recently I have also been looking a little into internet/social media addiction. Based on curiosity, but also an interest to find better balance in my life.  \n\n
3	Yeah, this is interesting. A lot of people do this without even realizing it
4	Define "doubt".	Define the word "doubt".    \n\n\n&#x200B;

10	INFP - How to become friends with you ENTPs?	So, I know an ENTP, but he lives many hours away - we used to date a millennia ago (okay, 10 years). We've been in friendly on-off contact since then. I still think he's cool personality-wise, and we both have separate awesome families. No feelings or anything like that; he's got a gorgeous wife and my husband is awesome as shit.\n\nWe hung out when I was in town in September, and I've tried to keep up occasional contact since then. When I text him, we'll end up texting and chatting for 2 hours about random shit, like he'll ask me what I think about the future of the marijuana industry (he doesn't smoke, just curious/random like you ENTPs are) or we'll discuss how each of our respective couple's business plans are going. \n\nThen he'll randomly drop off the conversation. But it'll have gone for 2 hours prior, mostly at his direction.\n\nI like keeping up the friendship, but it's only me texting him like once a month, and then I worry if I'm being a creepy weird INFP. I just can't tell with you ENTPs - he's not reaching out, but he'll literally send me paragraphs in response, like 5 in a row, when I text him.\n\nIs this how you guys are? I think it's fun chatting but if I'm bothering him I'd just leave it be.
20	IMO With people We approve of, \nWe tend to "make the rounds"\nIn cycles...lol
12	Yeah that happens a lot. Can only speak for myself but i hate reaching out but i love the conversation. 
7	It sucks when a good friend moves, but an ENTP will typically replace the void with more friends. Nothing against you, it's just more of a convenience aspect than anything.
6	To be honest, don't think about the "on-off'ness" of staying in touch. Sometimes I don't talk to my best friends for weeks but when we do, it's like there hasn't been any break at all and I just waterfall them as usual. \n\nPersonally I find the long good conversations nicer than the casual small talk about how life's going even when it's less often. 
2	lol i do the exact same. never reaching out (ok maybe once in a few months), accidently forgetting answering until i remember 2 weeks later, but if the convo is ON, it will be on for fcking 2 hours
2	I had this problem. Was hard for me (ENTP guy) to be able to say goodbye to people. Must of the time i don't say goodbye becouse i don't want the conversation to end ever... But if you focus on Se you will be able to be more respectful. And also, if an ENTP is responding then he or ahe wants to talk.. if not you will get a seen. So i will assume that its ok to give him the pleasure to not end conversation and if i where you i will be nice as much as i can and ask why he never text back and tell him that you will feel beter if he will text first. Of hes a frient hi will text back :)\n\nSorry for bad English ;)
2	you sure you have no feelings for this guy? You're actively trying to make contact with an individual you've been romantically  interested in the past (and him with you if ya'll dated before) to the point where you're asking reddit for advice on how to get the ball rollin'. What is compelling about this dude? Btw sorry if this comes off as accusatory cause thats not what I'm going for here.  I'm just curious what the motivation  is. Why do  you want to keep contact with him? Cause if ya'll are just gonna be homies then this whole disappearing act is kind of how they roll. They're usually picky with their group of friends and even those within that group can get sparing contact. Time is weirdly sacred to the ENTP's in my life. I've been told by more that one that the fact that their even present is sort of a gift in it of itself. "You interest me, therefore I am physically present around you."
1	I don't know whether this is true for him but I know for me that I have no problem holding up conversations but having to start them, especially when texting is very difficult. So if he suffers from this also, it's probably just that he likes talking to you but doesn't feel completely able to initiate conversation like he would usually be able. So I'd recommend you try chatting to him more frequently, if you still have these long conversations, then that pretty much proves my theory correct. 
1	When I send paragraphs of text, I am very, *very* interested in our conversation. And I want to talk to you more about it. \n\nYou can text him back with well thought out texts that triggers the Ne, it's something we share in common and that can spark up days of conversation, imo. When you disagree with his thoughts or ideas, tell him that. We enjoy some debate. Just don't let your emotions affect your argument though. Some playful bickering is excellent too. 
-7	If you really love the ENTP, and want him the best. Never contact him again.  
7	How to remember things?	How do you remember things? How do you learn some random facts that you can later pull out of your pocket and talk  about it out of nowhere? How do I train my Si?
20	I remember stuff best by explaining newly gained info to someone else asap. 
6	Get a personal scribe 
5	Personally, I just tell people about my findings as soon as I find them. Generally I think you'll find it easier to remember stuff by linking it with something you like. 
2	I talk to my ISFP friend about cognitive functions and often times we'll use the voice recording feature. \n\nThat is a lot harder to stay on topic bc I don't have the text in front of me to remind me of what I am talking about\n\nSO. When I do v-record and lose track, I start with the most recent thing I've said and work my way backwards. \n\n"Why did I start talking about pendulums when the original question was about intertype relationships? Oh, bc this this and that..." (I have an illustration with some theory that I plan to post about and get y'all's thoughts on it)\n\nShort term memory is stupid dumb for me, but to retrieve a reason for why I said something so outlandish and grandiose I retrace my thoughts and usually come to a conclusion. It's like reversing the direction of an ESTPs way of thinking (which is typically linear forward)
2	Let's say you have just learned something new and interesting. You question it. You tell it to other people and discuss it with them. Alternatively, you start to use it regularly and you remember it effortlessly.
2	Like everyone else remember things?  \n\n1. Google: How to better remember things.  \n2. Study and understand the theory \n3. Put it to practise\n4. Now you better remember things
1	Stimulant medication. 
1	Visualize a memory. That's all Si is. If you ask an Si-user what they're thinking, they're remembering where they were when they learned information.\n\nVisualize social memories first, and then move on to thoughts. The more often you visualize the past, the stronger your Si will become :)
1	I'm a sponge so some things stick well for no good reason and other things get lost. I'm a wealth of useless and sometimes useful information.
23	Dead giveaways for an ENTP personality?	Fellow INFJ here and I love you ENTP’s. What are some dead giveaway things that would show ENTP characteristics if I was talking to one in a group, 1 on 1, or at a party?
78	"Did you know that *insert random, vaguely related trivia*, What's your thoughts on it?"
60	In group/school: Half raised hand in back of class and either 1) makes a bomb ass well timed joke or pun or 2) relates the topic to a few other concepts and says things that sound like they make no sence yet are perfectly clear and understandable. \n\nOne on one: If tired: lots of "yeah" and "noice" but not interested. Not tired: very interested and makes lots of good points. Very diplomatic and Socratic. \n\nIn general: Very blunt and to the point. "Um" and "Er" instead of "like" and other filler words, if at all. fills out pretty much all symptoms of being a phycopath (sad but true) 
30	I’ll just list a few observations.\n\n1. They’re not afraid to give their opinion on something controversial without knowing yours.\n\n2. They occasionally transition into a different conversation topics without warning or without voicing the mental connections they’re making out loud.\n\n3. They can talk about philosophy and different world views for hours.\n\n4. They “collect people” they find interesting because they’re genuinely interested in how their lives will play out.\n\n5. They’re not great at voicing their feelings, but they have a lot of love for the people they hold close.\n\n6. Parents usually love them because they’re so dang charming.\n\n7.  They’re not afraid to openly love nerdy things.\n\n8. They don’t give a shit about another person’s opinion of them unless they already like them.
14	If you ask us questions, you will leave informed but not quite sure you got an answer.
12	I would say generally opinionated, though depending on the setting, fairly polite—if it’s just a kickback with a group of friends or 1 on 1 they won’t be afraid to speak their mind. Sarcastic, witty, probably throws a couple puns into the conversation for good measure—really enjoys discussing political and philosophical perspectives (which is something we know you INFJs enjoy as well)
26	you could also look out for people in class who seemed like they didn‘t listen, just heard the last sentence of the teacher and think they already got the whole content and are trying to discuss about it even tho they didn‘t listen and are now saying bs bc that one sentence was not enough to understand the connection to the topic\n\noh and those who are kinda always doing „taboo“ things, could be in any way.
19	My ENTP brother in law and INTJ brother left the room when I turned on “The Muppets Christmas Carol” and are now ranting about US immigration laws in the kitchen.
10	Genuine curiosity in the *why* about the what. If someone is asking questions about why the other person thinks that way or if they say, “What about if *this* were **that**, then what would your thoughts be?” \n\nthey’re probably an ENTP. \n\nedit: also, just like the (mostly true) stereotype of ENTPs where they accumulate information for the sake of information, they will do the same in social situations as well (probably more so 1 on 1). \n\nKeep an eye out for someone listening to another person describe something like, I dunno, the cuisine of their home country and then follow it up with questions that summarize things in a different way or ones that lead to tangents. 
17	They LOOK like they're thinking instead of being in the conversation BUT not like IxTPs where everything looks like it runs slow for them, like you have to repeat it for them, or like you have to grab their arm and shake them back into reality. Present in the moment, looking at the speakers, looking at something unique about the speaker or other members that they can comment on (usually turning into a funny remark with/without their conscious effort). \n\n\nAlso they smile the exact same way in pictures. Well most anyway, think of it as a knowing smirk. A slight squint in the eyes. google it. google ENTPs and look at their ingenious smiles.\n\n\nENTPs also can make asshole-ish remarks or create an inappropriate or hurtful Fe atmosphere but then switch to smiling generously and apologizing (sort of an insincere 'apology', just telling you it's a joke) just because it was funny and they slightly sub consciously knew they would get the Fe laughs/attention.\n\n\nr/shittyMBTI but you didn't say purely factually! Ha!
7	We tangent real hard in discussions and getting us to discuss things in general is really easy.\n"Do you know anything about brass doorknobs?"\n"DO I?!?! Did you know they're naturally antibacterial! Along with Silver! Thats why they are represented as cleansing the unholy, like werewolves and vampires, in old myths!... Speaking of old myths,..." And so on. You get the point.
7	"I'M AN ENTP"\n
6	I'm an ENTP and have successfully spotted out my own kind a few times. I never got deeply engrossed into MBTI so have only ever asked people when I suspected they were ENTP, as opposed to 'diagnosing' types.\n\nCommon behaviors and characteristics I've noticed (for ENTP-on-ENTP interactions) include:\n\n* Lengthy discussions on either a practical or abstract topic\n* Working out the different angles and nuances of said topic, often through flip-flopping Q&A\n* A general sense of apathy/indifference when it comes to emotions\n* Blunt, quick, and often inappropriate/insensitive humor\n* Jack of all trades, generally skilled at or knowledgable across a wide spectrum\n* Very open-minded, no boundaries basically on conversation topic\n* Adept at both amusing small talk/meaningless quips and deep, even profound discussions\n* Seem socially aloof despite being engaged\n\n&#x200B;
11	Asking "why?" even when it's not necessarily appropriate and getting pissed off when their question is ignored.
5	In a group a person who controll the direction of the conversation and sounds like a mediator, and who enjoy the conversation, consumed in a debate, purposly throw idea so the conversation to have a spark and continue. \n \nOne on one, who engages you well, forget detail, like name you introduced, jump to the point and ommits detail. If opposite gender, one sounds flirting with you,  give you a vibe of wild and into you feeling. One sounds confident and give quick suggestion then change suggestion when the story change with no trouble, one can be both side, will say, "why don't you quit." then after new information added, then say "may be you shouldn't". If they connect with you, at first entp may sound clingy or needy, so probably push him or her self to you, follows you around. But that could be just for that day. Entp like to enjoy the moment so don't be afraid. \n \nAt the party, most likely who is dancing or impressing others with conversation or humor or quick response. Trying to lead the grouo or suggest smart idea or after party plan. One usually stay until the end of the party unless really hate that party. \n\n\nBut how about Infj, if you don't mind? I want lots of Infj people around me. What is the dead give away, tricks to identify and get you guys attention. 
3	ENTP's have a magnificent ability to simultaneously think about, see and discuss multiple sides of a situation or argument on command. Seeing many possibilities and connecting dots quickly are one of our strong suits.
3	God some of these descriptions sound annoying as fuck. 
7	Generally I'd say opinionated, unafraid to offend, and being disagreeable can be signs! \n\nI'm never afraid to disagree with someone or share my personal opinions. Some take it very personally, like I'm attacking them, but the way I communicate, I guess, seems argumentative because I think it's the fastest way to hear someone's best points on a matter. So that could be a good sign, but my ENFP friend is that way too. I focus more on the facts and logic behind beliefs, while my ENFP friend wants to know their feelings behind why they believe something, so that's an important distinction.\n\nTalkative, witty, random, and wise/profound/wacky thoughts can be signs as well, at least imo :)
2	Actively listen to how they move from one topic to another. Sometimes it seems random but in their minds, they found a connection but haven't shared it. My siblings say I "spit out a conclusion or a thought without saying how I got to that point." Thats the Ne working and Ti extracting information.\n\nSometimes they're quiet. You'll have to say something interesting or thought provoking that will make them spit out random facts or ideas.
2	INTP here and I hate you guys so much. My stepfather and niece are both ENTPS and I cannot stand being around either of them, I'd much rather avoid them completely. But anyway, dead giveaways would be constant arguing over trivial stuff. Arguing a counterpoint to almost EVERYTHING even when the other person is right and the stuff youre arguing about is really a useless thing to argue about. Very irritating. And continuing arguments when they clearly are over. And making clear things that most people know already, that would be a giveaway, almost condescending because it seems like you guys think everybody else is stupid. 
2	1 Staring at the ceiling (they're thinking/imagining something) - Ne\n\n2 Insulting people until an introvert finally breaks and then the ENTPs gets his charming self out to mend the situation - Fe\n\n3 Switching from one group to another because they're bored with the topics of conversation (Ti)\n\n4 Either sharing trivia and everyone listening to him or listening intently while obviously being far away mentally because they don't care what someone else is saying because it's boring\n\n5 Taking the DJ's job for a while at a party \n\n6 Walking funny/Standing funny/ Contorting in funny ways
1	1000 items on their desktop, many tabs/browser windows open. 
1	the brilliant but lazy trope is fairly accurate, I've failed classes just because I wasn't interested, and I think a lot of ENTPs can attest to that. I know one million words, and I can pronounce about half of them correctly. I walk around with this nice girl demeanor and then I start talking... I also seem to have this cool persona, but I am, and always have been, a nerdy, nice little boy. my family seems to think i'm always two steps ahead and somewhat sneaky. I'm good, but sometimes not good enough. that's just me, i'm sure others relate tho
1	Getting butthurt about tone on r/entp
1	They make some really bizarre (maybe brilliant as well) metaphors and analogies when analyzing something.  It makes perfect sense to them, but other people might not follow along.  No joke, I've compared being offended by cultural appropriation to being offended that someone brought a corgi to a  dog park even though you were bitten by one in the past.  The point was that in neither situation did the offending party do anything wrong if there was no intent on offense.  It was completely lost on the person I was talking to.
7	ENTP attitude towards other people?	I feel like, in general, I'm predisposed to be or quite prepared to be disappointed in other people -- don't get me wrong, I can be just as (if not more) disappointed in myself as I can be in others -- so it's rare for me to develop a proper crush on somebody. But once I do, I become hopeful that they're some amazing person and exaggerate in my mind whatever trait/s I seem to admire in them. In the back of my mind I know I'm going to likely be disappointed by them and they're not going to be who I thought they were. On one hand, I tell myself I should probably be more optimistic towards other people but when I do and people disappoint, I feel more disappointed in myself in those moments of optimism.\n\nI know we're all flawed and we're all amazing and disappointing in our own ways, maybe my standards for others and myself are just really high and that's conflicting with how I recognise myself and others really are? Maybe it's just recognising the potential we all have that's never achieved? Do you guys think this is a reflection of the ENTP's attitude towards others? (ENTP here)\n\nHave you ever experienced realising that your crush (or anyone you really admire) isn't who you thought they were? Are you predisposed to be disappointed in others or do you easily find things to admire in them? How do you deal with disappointment?\n\n**Edit**: Sorry, I've felt the need to apologise for how horribly I seem to have worded what I wanted to discuss. I guess the crux of it is, as an ENTP, not being able to find individuals I feel challenge me and tiring of challenging people who don't respond open-mindedly to it. I think it's my tiring of challenging others that's lead to this unfulfillment in the interactions I have with others. I think if I pursue my nature by tirelessly challenging those around me, I'll find those who welcome it and will challenge me back. I just wanted to share my experience and ask about others' experience with that.
7	Don't pedestal people. Do judge character and try to surround yourself with quality individuals. Most people are pretty disappointing. 
6	This is why I don't date. Most people bore the shit out of me and I can't handle it. I used to get excited to go on dates, but now they seem like a chore. I always keep my expectations as low as possible. Probably not a great attitude, but it's not exactly harming me, so I have little motivation to change.\n\nI think the idealizing of others is more related to age than type. When you have less experience with real relationships, you tend to romanticize/idealize it. Try not to build people up in your head.
5	I generally have no predispositions to people, negative nor positive. 
4	Sounds like you have so many expectations not even a God could live up to them.  \n\nGlad I am not going to be that partner. Poor person, having to deal with such negative outlook and judgement.  \n\nHaving standards are normal and intelligent. But when no person can live up to your standards. Then you have some acceptance to do.  \n\nEither you accept you have those standards and valuing being alone, rather than settling for less or you value lowering those expectations, because being with a person is more important than not being with a person.  \n\nPersonally I prefer being alone and content, rather than with people and miserable.  \n\nI would not say I have high standards. I am just very picky when it comes to people, and being alone > settling for less, seems to provide me with the most joy. So that is what I stick with. Even if it means being more alone than most people. \n\nThats the balance each individual need to find for themselves.\n\nFreedom is also my top value. So having a partner and committing is not really a top priority or what I crave the most.\n\n
5	You right, this is entp thing. Chasing the next greatest then when you get closer hmmm they are really that good. Then going after other smartest, cutest thing in this world. It is trcky, I would say not only predisposed to disappointment but to depression due to this unsatisfied feeling. \nWhat helped me, hmmmm "I wonder the flaws of this person? " in advance, and expect some kind of turn off. It really minimizes the disappointment and increase acceptance.  
3	When it comes to people, I tend to be disappointed too. But I think my longer lasting relationships have been with people who are way smarter than me, so it takes longer to understand them. They tend to be disappointing in other ways, like having the emotional maturity of a 5 year old, or randomly becoming judgemental of me over a particular subject. But I prioritized and think that as long as the person challenges me intellectually, I can handle the other stuff. Maybe that sort of approach could help you.
2	When I was really young, yes. It's a product of idealistic thinking and unrealistic expectations. I grew out of it
2	aah. the wonders of having idealized versions of people, and always searching for people who meet the criteria instead of objectively analysing them\n\nedit: after reading your comments, I believe I understand what you mean. Yes, I think it's not unusual to recognize people's potential and be disappointed by the lack of effort put into achieving it. \n\nThough there are people who are trying to improve, and those shouldn't be too hard to find.
15	What is the key difference between an Entp and an Enfp?	All right so I'm pretty sure I m an ENxP.\n\nAfter reading a lot about both Entp and Enfp I still can't decide for sure what I am. \n\nWhat is something I can ask myself that would help me decide?\n\nAny help appreciated.\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit:thank you all for your responses.
29	I’ve tested at an ENTP my whole life but the descriptions never really made the connection for me. An ENTP friend asked me what I would do if someone told me the sky is purple. I shrugged and said “I don’t give a flying fuck if someone wants to believe that, it’s not my job to convince them and personally I don’t give a shit if they believe that, because it doesn’t effect me.” Apparently that’s how he knew I was an ENFP. Fi values authenticity, Ti values accuracy. 
33	I think Ti dissects EVERYTHING. There’s no such thing as good or bad it’s only true or false, consistent or inconsistent. Ti imo is more keen to understand intention and interdependencies which can come off as insensitive because it could rationalize why an unethical practice could be most efficient. You have a detached view because you want to understand things in its fullest extent and you know your biases, feelings and personal judgments can blind you to what’s accurate.\n\nFi judges based on whether or not something has a positive or negative impact. They could make an argument that you shouldn’t tell the truth because it will have a negative impact on someone therefore the truth isn’t always good. Which is subjective to their own beliefs because i personally think letting someone believe something that has been proven false is kinda unethical.\n
9	If you put me (ENTP) and a good friend of mine (who is an ENFP) in the same room, and needed to discern the difference between our "types", one way would be to ask our opinions on a controversial or disputed point, and then observe how we arrive at our conclusions.\n\nI am more likely to ask you questions that force you to clarify what precisely you mean (e.g., asking you to define certain terms). I would probably then preface my conclusion with, *"Based on the evidence I've seen, the most likely answer is..."* This is heavy Introverted Thinking (Ti), peppered with some Extroverted Feeling (Fe), at work.\n\nMy friend is more likely to start talking about his feelings on this particular subject -- and to sort of "think out loud" until he has spoken enough factual information into existence to then arrange it, *post hoc*, into reasoning that supports his conclusion. This is Introverted Feeling (Fi) mixed with some Extroverted Thinking (Te) at work.\n\nYou could figure out the ENTP and the ENFP by seeing whose behavior most closely matched each pattern.
6	Another difference I've seen between me and my ENFP friends that comes from Fi is that ENFPs are very in touch with understanding what they are feeling based on that values. For example, when they are happy, they can explain things like I am happy because my friend respects my opinions, or I am upset because what happened is not in line with my idea of justice. As an ENTP, I tend to make up explanations when people ask me why I'm feeling what I'm feeling because I have no clue.
9	Definitely do function research. Only difference between ENTP and ENFP is whether they use Ti or Fi.\n\nENTP: (Ne>Ti) > (Fe>Si)\nENFP: (Ne>Fi) > (Te>Si)\n\nSorry I wasn’t trying to be a dick. I apologize if this came off in a wrong or weird way.
3	ENFP is more conflict adverse whereas ENTP likes to debate, kinda enjoys being a dick and can be kinda blunt or cold about the facts. \n\nWhen it comes to helping people who are hurt, enfps are very responsive, they'll say "I'm sorry!" if they hurt your feelings or they'll get you to laugh about it. Entps can be a bit inept about comforting people and they frequently accidently hurt someone's feelings with their bluntness or awkwardness and even if they didn't mean to hurt your feelings their response is more like "I'm sorry?" \n\nENFPs and ENFPs are both pretty ADHD, hyper, flamboyant, etc but ENFPs come off as silly and ENTPs come off as witty. \n\nENFPs and ENTPs can also have bloated egos, but when ENFPs say "I'm the best!" you don't feel like they actually have narcissistic personality disorder, with ENTPs you kinda worry a bit. \n\nENTPs have this smugness about them that kinda makes you hate them a little, but then ENTPs often will lay on the charm after being antagonistic, which can frustrate you. They build sexual tension (or just tension), Kinda like a rival that flirts with you. ENFPs are more friendly, not really like a rival, more like Labrador retrievers. \n
2	Enfps get really sensitive when you insult them in a constructive manner
4	One has coherent arguments and the other has healing crystals.
4	ENTPs are dominant personalities. ENFPs are more emotionally expressive.
3	lol shouldn't you take the MBTI? Or are we just guessing who we think we are here?\n\nWhat you think your type is, and what it actually is might not be the same. 
1	Personally I think the key difference between my ENFP friend and me is that she's more expressive and sure of her emotions and isn't gonna hesitate to say when she feels like shit and seek out for emotional support rather than advice.   \nWhile I take forever to dissect everything I'm feeling for ages until I'm sure of it, let alone can express it properly. She also tends to be offended a lot quicker than me when things get personal. 
1	ENFP here. I can't find a single key difference but a bunch of little ones. In my experience :\n\n\- ENFPs get easily offended\n\n\- ENTPs have trouble aknowledging facts\n\n\- Both are very curious, but ENFPs seem more interested in people, while ENTPs seem more interested in things. In art and literature, NFPs tend to focus on characters or expressionism, while NTPs prefer to study the structure, the composition. In that, they're truly objective. It's as if they constantly viewed the world from above, as in a strategy game, while ENFPs would rather experience the world from inside, putting themselves in other people's shoes etc.\n\n\- ENFPs easily identify their emotions. I always know precisely what I feel, why, and what I can do to fix that (Te seems to be all about fixing stuff).\n\n\- ENFPs love  a e s t h e t i c s.  I often like things simply because they please my eyes, for instance a movie with a stunning atmosphere ; even if everything else is crap, I'll still be kinda hooked on it.\n\n\- ENTPs display an equal mood (and a neutral/good one)\n\n\- ENTPs care less about being liked, and more about being right + helping people improve their critical mind. They annoy people for their own good, which makes me see them as "long-term humanists". They don't mind being criticized or causing some harm for a greater, collective good. While ENFPs prefer to prevent all individuals from being hurt. ENTPs are selfless, ENFPs are empathetic.\n\n\- many ENFPs hate generalizations like in the short list I just wrote (but I personally don't care about "putting people in boxes").

10	Nowadays the people only asks dumb questions. You can go to the forums or the internet and search:\n\nENTP with ANY OTHER FUCKING MBTI\n\nAnd you'll see the pros and cons.\nI'm not angry, I'm just tired of the questions they make at the ENTP subreddit, we could talk about how you would cause a financial crisis but no, it's more interesting to talk about intersections and traffic. 
1	infx talks a lot about oneness and ego death you know 
5	Michael Pemulis from Infinite Jest	If any of you ever get the patience (or time) to read DFW's *Infinite Jest,* you'll be happy to know that within lies the most ENTP-esque character I have EVER encountered (and I am always on the lookout lol), tied possibly with The Joker.
1	I have just started reading this book (only a few pages in) and it was recommended by a fellow ENTP. I had never heard anyone speak of this book before her. So, I cannot speak to your revelation but love this delicious little coincidence and now am thinking about how ENTPs likely enjoy similar things. It makes me feel like there’s totally a community out there for me and people like me, and makes me totally stoked to keep reading! 
1	I forced my book group to read this and it's an amazing book. I'm sitting around P. 800ish and waiting for everyone else to catch up at the moment.\n\nAgree about Pemulis as the apotheosis of ENTPism (at  least wrt fulfilling the common stereotypes), although he is a pretty immature example, I think - not a lot of Fe from him as much as just a desire for pure chaos and nonconformism with Ne running wild. The whole Eschaton game setup and scoring thing did strike me as being possibly too detail-oriented and bogged down in unnecessary specifics for an ENTP, but then again that may just be me projecting my lack of deep understanding of some of the math and programming discussions tangential to Pemulis's position as the inventor of the game.\n\nRe: Infinite Jest overall, many people think DFW himself was an ENTP, although I've seen some strong arguments for him being an introvert, and the pure level of sensory detail he provides in his writing could also make a case for him being a sensor rather than an intuitive. But his general writing style, with tons of random knowledge (especially in the footnotes, and the footnotes' footnotes!) and disparate character arcs pulled together to connect with each other in service of a couple of common themes strikes me as very ENTP, along with the way his writing constantly reminds you that A) he's very intelligent, B) he knows that he's very intelligent, and C) you should also acknowledge that he's very intelligent. You kind of want to hate him but he's just too smart and likable even when he's showing off -- that's very much in the ENTP wheelhouse, as I understand it.\n\nOverall, great book so far and I'm looking forward to checking out his other novels and essays.
5	I NEED HELP	I need help with my math homework. \nHas x^4 an inverse function?
2	Hint: does x^(2) have an inverse function?
1	It does have an inverse, but it's ambiguous, so it's not a function. It's +-x^(1/4). 
1	If you are more visual here's a tip. Plot it y vs. x. The reflect across y=x line ( eyeballing it will work).\n\nDoes any vertical line cross than more than one point on your parabola/hyperbola/ line (forgot the word)? Then there is no  definite inverse.
3	Most compatible music genre for ENTP	I'm not asking what your personal favorite music genre is, rather I'm wondering what music genre you think is most compatible in theory with the ENTP. Like an average.\n\nMy first instinct is something really chaotic like dubstep, or something really loud without a lot of order...or maybe something with lyrics that are difficult to understand without lots of thinking/discernment.\n\nThoughts?
13	progressive rock. lot‘s of experimenting with the instrumentals, never gets boring. also metaphorical lyrics that make you think what the writer might have meant\n\ngenerally rather heavy but up beat music
13	Ok sorry to offend you but if you call yourself an ENTP and not absolutely love this, GTFO\n [The epitome of ENTP music](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzxrzFCyOs) 
10	For me, it needs to be a complex, not haotic just complex. The message and the felling need to be somthing that makes me procces.
7	Hmm good question. Maybe classic rock? Long intros, guitar and drum solos, not always a distinct chorus but instead a few different catchy areas thrown in? \n\nFree Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd is an example off the top of my head lol, Long Time by Boston could be another one, though that one has a very distinct chorus. 
8	Mathrock. Different rhythms and musical lines going on at the same time, but still coherent.
6	Jazz. It’s very cerebral and lets us think about the theory behind it, and analyze the changes and their harmonic effect.\n\nOr progressive metal/fusion a la Plini or Owane, there is something very carefree about music in this vein that really resonates with me.\n\nLastly would be vaporwave. Something something memes.\n\nIn reality I listen to all genres these just happen to be my most listened to... I don’t necessarily thing music genre is correlated to Jungian types.
3	\+1 for progressive rock. I really like Camel, Rush, Renaissance and Wishbone Ash.\n\nHowever, I am in love with Technical/Progressive Death Metal mostly. Fast tempo, difficult guitar riffs, complex drum partitions, intense emotions, influence from other genres like classical or jazz music. This is perfection for me. I really like these bands: Death (best lyrics), Cynic, Necrophagist, Obscura, Gorod, Quo Vadis, Gojira, Beyond Creation, Pestilence, Edge of Sanity, Opeth (until Damnation album), Vector (let's call this one progressive thrash metal). I also like other metal genres, but techdeath/progdeath is my favorite.
5	Seems to be in a minority here but I find the EDM/*insert a billion sub categories here* terribly lackluster, it's repetitive and quite base.\n\nPersonally I love songs with intricate lyrics, and that tells a story. I've always loved how changing your perspective changes an object of observation, so using a set of words to convey an entirely different meaning is great.
3	Personally I think the rap music that has legitimately good lyrics, such as some of the Fire in the Booths. Akala, Lowkey Wretch 32 etc. Lyrics that make you think. 
2	Retro wave or edm. They make you enter in an insane mood, the perfect one for ENTP.
2	I don't know why I have a fondness for Trip hop/and everything that has kind off the same tempo even if it isn't Trip Hop.An off example of a non Trip Hop song would be Skunk Anansie - weak(wich is also one of my favorite songs) 
2	I tend towards instrumental, intense music. When lyrics are introduced, I cannot escape believing the story being told and find myself neglecting the emotion of the chords and progressions. Bands like BMSR disguise their lyrics and make them more rhythmic and instrumental than narrative. I prefer that. Almost like I can’t do the intellectual understanding of the singer’s story and the intuition of the actual music behind it simultaneously. That said, electronic music gets me most of the time - as long as it’s powerful and driving, I can’t turn away. I like to feel the build. Like, FEEL IT. Lately it’s been Monomer, Modeselektor, Magic Sword etc. \n\nEDIT: but also agree with complexity and experimentation being important. Tortoise comes to mind as a great moody option for ENTPs
2	For me the lyrics have a way of... going over my head until the perfect moment. For example there will be a song that I absolutely love right off the bat and then later on in life I realize it was describing my life at that point or describing characteristics of mine. I also love music that literally IS a vibe or it's own MOMENT. like I think you guys know what I'm talking about, just a song that brings along a mood that is absolutely consuming in a good way. Pot can definitely make it so that you pay attention to the detail of why that is though. 
1	 Metal or whatever the fuck Electric Mantis.
1	EPs like kickass music. Being an N, you like to use your imagination as well. So that is why you put on ready steady go with Paul Oakenfold to feel like Tom Cruise chasing a bad guy, and not brain dead ESTP music like italo brothers with jump jump.

2	Tertiary Fe and apologizing for the sake of peace	I think this topic is pretty much that, but I'm gonna give a few more points so you can get a clearer picture of what situation I'm in now.\n\nSo basically I was having seasonal depression and I yelled at one kid in class that I was in good terms with and now said kid doesn't like me. Kid gossips and disrupts peace for people she doesn't like. Kid also will be showing face in my next few years. \n\nSo I'm thinking of making peace with kid with Christmas as an excuse (Ha) and part of me is curious as to how kid will reply while another part of me is still wishing to be on diplomatic terms with kid.\n\nDo you think I should apologize? Please help \n\nEdit: She yelled at me first
6	Best bet is to use your Ti to check/balance your Fe. This means you should ask yourself if you truly want to be on good terms with this person: do you forsee a close working relationship in the future? Do they have the power to spread hurtful misinfornation to those who you are close with? Are they someone that you want to be friends with? \n\nIt's always good to be on decent terms with people, because you'll never know when you might need something from them, even in a non-sinister/manipulative way. If you value their regard, apologize. If not, treat them cordially anyway. Try not to burn bridges. \n\nAlso, if you find yourself perseverating on this situation, then it is likely festering in your consciousness and should be dealt with (confronted). Explain the seasonal depression to the person, and you will probably feel much better, even if they don't consider your explanation to be enough to mend your relationship. You are likely focusing on this situation because you are aware that your friend doesn't recognize your logic for why you snapped at them, which is ruffling your Ti. Your Fe is also likely suffering from its inherent desire to maintain the peace. \n\nGood luck~
4	Did you have a good reason to yell at the kid? Is yelling a normal disciplinary measure for you? If not, you should probably apologize. 
2	If you yelled at them for bad reasons, apologize. They're not wrong if they start shit-talking about you if you did indeed say some messed up, incorrect stuff.
4	Social experiment time: apologize with “It’s Christmas.” Any decent human being will let bygones be bygones, but if she bitches, whatever. One less useless person in your life😉

1	Hey guys I have seasonal depression and therefore no consequences for my actions 
2	Can an ENTP ever want to be a housewife?!	Because to be honest, I am an ENTP and my plan A is to be a housewife. Is that wrong?!
29	I'd love to be a stay-at-home dad!
12	Stay at home mom/housewife here.\n\nThe first two years I did okay. \n\n3.5 years in, and i have days where i want to peel my skin off with a potato peeler and put my own head in the microwave. \n\nI talk to myself, the toddlers and google assistant and live in a hole of self loathing desperately looking for any stimulus outside of my familial unit. \n\nAnd the piiiiiiiiiles of shit everywhere... but I have twins, live outside a tiny village that I'm new to, and there's a shortage of childcare and part time jobs in the area. Being stuck is different than by choice.  \n\nJust don't give up your freedom to go back to work.
23	no, it is absolutely impossible. the last time this happened a huge blackhole was created, ending everyone involved.
7	This question is so weird. Why would it matter? You shouldn’t need validation from the internet to do what you want. If that’ll make you happy, go do it. 
7	What does housewife entail to you, and why do you think it would be wrong?
4	it‘s not wrong if it‘s your decision. if you‘ll feel satisfied go straight for it
11	Based on your post history, I’m not convinced you’re even ENTP. 
5	ENTP woman here. When I think about being a stay home mom or a housewife, at first it sounds cool, because I'm lazy af and I just wanna (as Ali Wong says) sit home and watch Ellen all day and eat snacks and I'm like hell yeah. But then I realize I'd go crazy bored out of my mind doing the same shit everyday. Sounds like hell.\n\nIt's not wrong, but I wouldn't do it. 
10	After looking at your post history, lol... good luck dude.\n\ni don’t think you’ll find your kind here at ENTP.  
3	It appeals to me to be able to apply many different skills to the home. I'd probably enjoy having a part-time job too though. The idea of being stuck in the same full-time job for the rest of my life scares me (first-world problems).
3	I personally know 2 ENTP housewives. One is my aunt, she had 4 kids, they’re all grown and married now. One was a a girl I went to school with. She was a couple years ahead of me, and she got married at 18 and she has 4 kids now 7 years later. Both of the ENTP women I personally know irl are housewives, and they love it. It can happen.
3	Being a housewife is appealing in that I might get to stay home, do nothing, and get money from Daddy®, but I know that's not what housewives do at all. They have to constantly maintain the house and deal with annoying kids.\n\nSo no.
2	Depends on what it "entails" being a housewife. Are you going to do Si-chores all day, like being a cleaning lady, taking care of kids, and making food.  \n\nWhich is SiFe heavy.  \n\nOr can you actually have a lot of freedom to spend on projects/hobbies. Then I could understand it more.  \n\nPersonally I could never be a housewife... because it would require me to get an operation to remove my dick. Not that there's much to remove. But you get the idea.

1	Nothing wrong with it.  You get to be in charge of everything and produce as many minions as you need.
1	Honestly, you do you and don’t let anyone shit on your choice of being a housewife if you want to do so. Screw people who disagree with you.\n\nPersonally, I would go crazy after a year or two. I like taking care of the house, I absolutely love children and would love to have them & take care of them, but I also love working. My mom lowkey resents me and my brother for ending her career, and I’d hate to end up like her. So for me no, but that doesn’t matter because your life is completely yours. Do what you love!
1	No, tried it,  No no no , you will be miserable. Don't,  atleast have part time. 
20	Jungian Cognitives Result	So I finally took the functions test.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinal Results:\nNe (95%)\nTi (65%)\nFe (65%)\nNi (65%)\nFi (50%)\nTe (35%)\nSi (25%)\nSe (5%)\n\nNe>Ti=Fe=Ni>Fi>Si>Se\n\nKinda wonky percentages though but makes sense considering I never fully fit the ENTP stereotype of "Not having internal values etc."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did a bit of research into the actual functions, function loops, and  inferior grips too. Below are strength and weaknesses of ENTP's and why they occur based on functions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**iNtuitive Extroversion (Ne):** dominant\n\nY'all should know how this works by now. You remember shit based on "reminders" the outside world gives you .\n\n*Technical Response:* Outer stimuli produce a memory-related response in which the subject can relate a past experience to the present and paint a bigger picture of their understanding. Subject verbally gathers information from others and recognizes patterns between inner information library and outer stimuli. This, in turn, creates a brighter, more fluid picture of a theory or concept created by the subject. **Ne** and **Si** work in tandem to help the subject better understand their surroundings by using past experiences as a reference to patterns observed in the outer world. Heavily driven by new experiences and changes to expand the memory library of the subject.\n\n**Thinking Introversion (Ti):** auxiliary\n\nBasically helps your brain throw out the useless shit your **Ne** picks up on and focus on the stuff that makes sense.\n\n*Technical Response:* **Ti** filters the outer stimuli observed by the subject's **Ne** using an internal understanding of logical consistency while matching what has been proven to work through the subject's past observation of similar stimuli. Main purpose is to form coherent concepts and theories which the subject can then store in its memory for later use. Constantly seeking to refine and revamp gathered knowledge.\n\n**Feeling Extroversion (Fe):** tertiary\n\nThis is what is called "reading the room." Helps you not be an idiot in social situations. Works with **Ti**.\n\n*Technical Response:* **Fe** allows the subject to seek guidance from outer stimuli to help the subject better understand emotional situations and views of others. Conforms to typical social norms to help the subject reach higher status. Also grants the subject more freedom to move through social circles with greater fluidity. **Ti** guides **Fe** to allow the subject to form emotions and opinions based on the outside world and allows the subject to portray an optimal image to the outside world.\n\n*Side Note:* **Ti**\-**Fe** axis is reactionary in nature, guiding the subject to optimize the end result of a scenario by reading the emotional input of its surroundings and filtering its response so as to illicit an optimal response for the subject. Without **Ti**, **Fe** runs the risk of "looping" with **Ne**. In the ESFJ and ENTP, **Ne**\-**Fe** loops take form by causing the subject to completely bypass their introverted aux function. For ENTP, this takes the form of the classic "trolling" where the **Ne** takes advantage of the subject's wit and the Fe observes a positive response in the outer surroundings (other people) at the expense of a target (whether this is self-deprecating humor or verbal/psychological bullying of a target) without the filter from **Ti** to help the subject decide whether their actions in the current situation are beneficial to the group or not. For ESFJ, the user becomes overly concerned with the outer "image" portrayed by the subject. Causes the subject to disregard internal ideas completely and conform to "groupthink." Subject is perceived as "fake" due to **Fe** overcompensation. (For comparison, an ESTP experiencing an **Se**\-**Fe** function loop would exhibit more physically detrimental behaviors at the behest of the crowd, whether this would entail a physical altercation or peer pressure into a physically dangerous situation.)\n\n*Helpful Tip:* Ne-Fe causes trolling. Use your **Ti** and don't be a jerk unless it's for a good reason.\n\n**Sensing Introversion (Si):** inferior\n\nThis reminds you of that idea for world peace you had like 5 days ago and forgot about till your Ne saw a white stick figure and a black stick figure holding hands in a drawing your daughter showed you two seconds ago. Don't forget to do your chores-\_-\n\n*Technical Response:* Stores information for the subject's Ne to use in the future to form new ideas. Helps the subject follow basic survival. requirements and rules. Heavier usage requires the subject to compartmentalize and organize its inner thoughts to allow for optimal usage of thoughts. Adheres to existing patterns stored in the mind.\n\n*Side Note:* **Si**\-grip can cause the subject to become uncharacteristically quiet and reserved. Self-consciousness appears due to circumstances that arise due to subject's lack of self-care ("I'm too fat cause I can't consistently make myself exercise", "My teeth hurt cause I never brush them", "I have no friends cause I am a mean-spirited person", etc.) **Si**\-grip can cause the subject to lose drive and get stuck on the small details, inhibiting the subject's ability to see the bigger picture and think outside of oneself.\n\n*Helpful Tip:* **Si** is incredibly draining for the ENTP, so a good dosage of time with people you care about will help you prevent the development of an **Si**\-grip.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you got bored and skipped to the end, you’re missing out. But at the same time I get it.\n\ntl;dr: Ne-easy Ti-meh Fe-meh Si-git gud. Don't be dumb and forget about Ti. You're not an unfeeling bastard so learn to be nice to people:)

6	This is a pretty good overview of ENTPs. And the stereotype of ENTPs being valueless isn’t accurate. Or rather, needs further explanation.\n\nIt’s that ENTPs lack internal feeling awareness (Fi) which all Fe users suffer from at various degrees depending on personal development, growth and where Fe is on their stack. \n\nValues and morals are also subjective and personal which conflicts with Ti, a function that strives to be objective, impersonal and logically consistent.\n\nSo ENTPs can be seen as lacking values, but that’s not necessarily true. It’s just that they don’t buy in the idea that morals are black and white and rigid. But rather that they can be interrogated and rethought. They also lack personal reflection on feelings to truly know exactly what their values are. But overtime with growth and self development, ENTPs learn to stand for something and understand themselves better and how they truly feel about things. Fe helps in this respect. 
2	How and where can I take this test?
1	Mine was\n Te: 80%\nTi:85%\nNe:85%\nNi: 70%\nSe: 25%\nSi: 90%\nFe:60%\nFi:60% \n\nWtf is going on here? 
-1	>Side Note: Ti-Fe axis is reactionary in nature, guiding the subject to optimize the end result of a scenario by reading the emotional input of its surroundings and filtering its response so as to illicit an optimal response for the subject.

How do you "know" all this, or where did you get it from?  \n2. There's so many conclusions, but not a single reason, or logical deduction to any of this. Ti users wants to understand things, not just get fed some conclusions without the reason for those conslusions.  \n\nI guess you came up with this. Since you haven't quoted any sources.  \n\nSo if you came up with this, and you think you're a Ti user, how come there's no Ti, or any personal logic, behind any of it?  \n\nWhat I just wrote, could be applied to nearly the entire post. But I got fed up after reading till Fe.  \n\nAlso your "dumb smart" attitude, made it nearly impossible to digest.  
2	Internet tourism with u/eternalstardust. Not funny like 'Drunk History'	Back story: I watched an informed informative video on YouTube. A friend asked me to tell him more about [Mother Shipton's Cave and the Petrifying Well](https://youtu.be/RYNUG3-KGIY) and this ensued. The thought of starting a satirical tourism account seems fun. I hope to follow through.\n\nSo it's the oldest tourist site in England and was "discovered" 500 years ago by Henry the 8th's people. The water comes from one of the largest underground lakes and passes over rock that contain a high amount of calcium carbonate. Leave anything under the dripping water for months and it "turns to stone". Of course, Mother Shipton was a witch who lived near the skeleton shaped rock formation. She predicted the world's demise of 1881... who knows, maybe the monarchy was forever changed that year. Some bathed in the water for healing, while others stayed away because it is blessed by Satan himself. It is located in Knaresborough, England... I always thought Satan was Canadian but whatevs. Drinking the water is forbidden; could it be Satan or the high calcite levels? I believe it is both but does science and spirituality coincide? You decide. \n\nEdit: grammer
1	> I always thought Satan was Canadian but whatevs\n\nWait what?
41	How well do you take being made fun of in a non-constructive way?	I've noticed that this tends to be both an ENFP and ENTP trait so I found this one curious. I've seen many ENTPs mention that this is something that really annoys them. For me, I think it isn't so much "oh that hurt my feelings", but more about how "illogical" it is with some of the stuff people come up with and then think they somehow have won a debate by using  Ad hominem remarks. It always annoys me (but I don't try to show it) when someone's arguments are so stupid and they keep proudly repeating it no matter how many times I have disproved it, and then they resort to the group by making it into a big joke to use the emotions of the group to support their stance, usually resulting in me appearing as though I'm taking things too seriously. I just tend to give up but yes it does irritate me and no it is not an Fi thing.\n\nTLDR; It depends on the joke. Jokes at my expense are taken in good fun unless they're repeatedly saying something so stupid and trying to turn the group on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's your opinion on this? How do you take "being made fun of", for lack of a better term, in a non-constructive way?\n\n&#x200B;
50	If it actually is funny and makes sense I don't mind. \n\nHowever, if it's illogical or stupid it makes my blood boil.\n\nSome days ago I was talking with some people on discord and said a joke that went right over their heads, and they started making fun of me because according to them I had said something really stupid. When I told them it was a joke they started saying I was making excuses and kept calling me stupid. The dumbest part of that was thay what I said, even if I said it as a joke, was actually true. So they were laughing at me thinking they were smarter when they were completely wrong and I was the only one who knew it. I was in a situation where defending myself sounded just like excuses and nobody believed it, and if I got mad it would only make it worse. The only rational option was shutting the fuck up about it and changing topics.\n\nSituations lile these make me want to punch somebody.
21	When I'm arguing with someone in front of many people and they try to poison the well by insulting me on something I can't control (looks, sex, age, etc.) I get very frustrated because I find that the people around them **WILL** take that as valid and give them verbal support, making it appear as if they've "won" when they haven't done shit.\n\n.\n\nAlso, my biggest pet peeve with arguing in a group is the "you're taking it too seriously" defense too. I don't know how we both can be sitting there discussing, but the moment I catch them in a corner they say I'm too serious and end it with a joke in order to look better in front of a group. Weren't they just arguing with me too?\n\nI know I'm not being the annoying "achtually" kid because I keep my mouth shut about discrepancies half the time in public due to people's tendency to do this. I find it better to argue alone with people now; they're less focused on impressing a group.
9	Never defense, always offense. Sooner you learn that the better. 
5	when I argue with people and they seek to the friends for support and it ends up like me taking it too seriously i just do the same thing. \n\nPeople like being smart if I say to one of my friends “of course it’s so and so if x wast y x would be y, even a fucking monkey would understand that. I’m glad I got you to understand my point though” they will play along because you recognized them as one of the smart people.  That’s just my manipulative mind.
3	Are they evading an argument by teasing me? Annoying af. Are they just talking shit to talk shit? Let's do that all day gimme a sec I'll think of a good one for you
5	I have one real trigger and that's being called stupid.  The reason is that of all the shitty things I am, that's not one of them.  \n\nI was in a situation where a woman called me a stupid bitch.  I went into pure rage blackout where the first thing I heard in my head was the line from Mortal Kombat, "3...2...1...FIGHT."  I then unleashed all of my wrath on her like a fucking bat out of hell.  Needless to say, it didn't work out for her.
3	Context is everything. \n\nSitting at a pub or cafe and bantering with chums? Sure providing the other person is respectful of boundaries (I dont have a lot of them, respect the few I have)\n\nWhile I'm working or doing something relatively serious or important I can be impatient with a person. \n\nHuh. I seem to have different boundaries for different situations. Neat. \n\nThanks!
3	Usually I just don't care. If I feel like they are not worth my time I just move on. If I'm in a situation where I can't get let go (like at work or a social situation) I destroy them with logic. I'm also physically dominant over most people so I rely on that if they get too out of control. 
3	I didn't take it well in my youth and teen years. But as an adult I actually enjoy it. I'll laugh at myself and trade blows back. \n\nIf you're roasting yourself better than they can it kinda makes them look bad.
2	And if you start talking about it with them and giggle people will wonder what is so funny and they will join too. Exclusivity effect :)
2	As long as there's no malice behind it, I don't really mind. I'm secure enough to see the humour in being the object of the joke most of the time.\n\nIf there's malice behind it, I'll hit back equally as hard, if not harder. Fair's fair.
2	If it is all fun and games I do not give a shit. Most of the time I'm the one doing the teasing(I tease out of love though and enjoy being teased myself). I can tell if someone is joking or trying to talk down to me, so if it is the latter I will call them out or be sarcastic, questioning their reasoning. Sometimes I just ignore it.\n\nENFPS will almost always get butthurt and take it the wrong way though. They even get offended for me.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Well it doesn’t happen much as I’m now an adult, but I got called out once on a personality quirk of mine (I’m loud. I don’t always mean to be, it just happens) and I felt a little hurt. \n\nIt wasn’t funny or constructive, and I’m human. I have the occasional feeling. 
2	Grew up with three other siblings and we fought and made fun of each other a lot. It doesn't bother me. The second you let it bother you is when you look like a loser and they'll keep rubbing it in. 
1	That part is easy. Depending on how bad they tried to get me, I’ll just deflect and try to get them back.
1	Depends on context, if they might be serious, and if I give a shit.\n\nIf I don't think they're serious or I don't give a shit, I'll just get them right back.\n\nIf it's something I care about and they seem to be serious, I'll be a bit hurt and get them back much more aggressively.
1	I am an ENTP and i don’t really take it personally. If it goes on and on I’ll likely exit the situation because it gets old, but I won’t feel like I couldn’t go back or have hard feelings.
1	I relate quite a bit. If it's funny and logical it's okay. However, especially if it's illogical, I will take note of the occurrence as a permanent loss of respect for people unless they quickly redeem themselves.
1	I usually try round things up with a self deprecating pun among a  paralleled quirky brush off of the topics importance using a simile or metaphor to make an analogy.. Im usually mocking everybody in the group subversively through the guise of history, human nature, probabilities and the "larger-scope" to diffuse the conversation and shut down any perceived retorts I can see coming from there subjective emotional biases. \n\nThis usually fails, goes way over everybodies head and get's me in your exact situation.. in-which I either go quiet..Or ifnot I can often catch  myself taking it "too serious" (by responding with logic in-which the group is delighted by as they make eye contact, smirk and try not to laugh) and stop myself before it's too late. However not without responding to the initiator either way as an ENTP I cant help that.. so my final trick is to take them literally and remark back with a stupid way too far sick and twisted joke they "infered" playfully and sarcastically(borderline retard should be obvious). This usually get's it to that "too far" moment which stop's the clique from grabbing pitch fork cause everyone shuts the fuck up, but it's me showing I can be a stupid asshat aswell and take them out of context in a silly way to attack their character too ;)
1	For me is about respect, i have done this to other peopple and of course have it done to me in the past, im way more serious about respect now.\n\nBut i did this to my brother one year ago in a family gathering because he was being a dick an stirring me in a debate for no reason(he is an enfp).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  more about how "illogical" it is with some \n\nI dont see it this way, is quite logical aproach to deturn a debate onto a shit fest if ur not looking to delve onto the premises of it, but instead use it to score points with the group(in order to date someone there later, earn some social points or being perceived positively as someone non serious, ''funny'', and devilish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat ur asking here: how do you take "being made fun of", for lack of a better term, in a non-constructive way? \n\nIs the same as asking how do u respond when u cant come with a comeback and peopple mock u for it,or how not to loose some insult competition.Because frankly is the same, the reality is u cant always win,but  if u use humor and if u can come with a joke about the other person regarding whats being discussed u will win,and u can learn to do this easily, and most people ar not ready to get their jokes responded with a bigger joke, because most people like urself dont know how to respond to this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nActually this is featured on the book the art of being right by the philosopher Schopenhaur as a legit tactic to win an argument.
1	Honestly, for me it depends. Even in arguments where the opposing party clearly is more concerned with gaining social points rather than being right, I just try to ruin their chances doing that by making their goal apparent the group. \nOr the joke can be funny and I join (most of the time). I'm from a family of "if you don't have a quick comeback or one liner you lose" so my tolerance is incredibly high compared to what I see others loose their shit over. \n\nHowever, if we're talking "insults disguised as jokes" where my few but non-negotiable boundaries are getting stepped on (or I'm just having a remarkably bad day), that's when I get pissed off. Usually people say it on the side and I just give them a death stare, and mine is good so it usually works. However, if that doesn't work I actually let myself get "angry", but not **angry**-angry, if that makes sense? \n\nI show my anger and tell them, in front of the potential group, why they overstepped boundaries and why that is a problem. I also usually end it with: "... and don't you dare say I'm being over-dramatic. Only I get to decide where my boundaries are, and that's just something you have to accept. That is, if you want me to continue to respect yours." (that's my go to sentence actually) and the last sentence, after saying" that is," I purposely change everything about my composure from emotional to cold and lower my voice register and look them between their eyes (a psychological trick). They always look super uncomfortable and low-key scared after I do this. They actually start backing off in general after these situations, which I don't mind since I rarely like them before they get cocky. \nSo far has this worked about 99% of the time, and I'm still perfecting it. But, yeah, as you can see... It has happened enough for me to have a method. You are also welcome to try it for yourself. 
1	i could add more but your initial post basically sums up exactly how i feel.\n\n\nhaving a big haha with stupid reasoning just makes me go 😐 and shut down. “oh don’t be such a party pooper!” they say as I literally scream internally at how stupid and proud they sound. 
1	BOY if there's an ENTP advisor to Trump right now, he must be living thru HELL right now!\n\nAnyways, I've had this problem in one of my Discords as well where I just started taking jokes too seriously, which was odd because I didn't have that problem in school before. Then again, it might have to do with how I'm usually the least wholesome and honest among my friends in school.
7	question: if people can do that JUST before death they will sustain life forever, what about "life after death"? paradoxically, such a person can return to this world in a thousand years and how can he live after death? What about reincarnation? etc	and then what? Is not this a hell?
11	What
6	You’ve done it, you’ve discovered the trick to everlasting life. Just “do that.” Brilliant.
3	How do you deal with not being able to meet unrealistic expectations?	This may sound like an idealistic and childish thing, but I'm wondering if any other ENTPs can relate to this. Whenever I need to commit to or do something, I am always being held back by unrealistic expectations. For example, I only want to get married to someone who will keep me entertained every second of my life, or I want a job that will never be tedious or boring even for one day. I know that these are unrealistic expectations, and in all likelihood, I would have to settle for less. But the disappointment that my life is getting more and more boring is not only putting me down, but also making it hard for me to make decisions. I keep putting off choosing things because I wonder if the next opportunity will be better than the current one. I don't want to settle for something less than what I could possibly get, but at the same time, I don't want it to go past me because I am unable to gauge that this opportunity is at the local maximum of my procurable curve, even if it is not the global maximum (if that makes any sense). I was wondering if any of you guys feel that way, and if so, how do you deal with it. I have to make some really big decisions soon and I don't want to be held back by my unrealistic worldview and incapability to evaluate. For example, how do you know that this girl is the one, and not the next one who rolls along? It's more obvious when you have quantifiable measures like "oh, she has an IQ in the 99th percentile so she's a really good find", but actually meeting someone from that 1% of the population is pretty unlikely and everyone you meet is in the 40-60th percentile range of the normal distribution. Or do you just choose whatever and just resign yourself to your boring fate? Does this make any sense?
3	Therapy? Maturity?\n\nI saw a meme on fb a while back that I can't find now of course.\n\nThe jist is as follows:\n\nAn art teacher divided a class in half.\n\nOne half was instructed that they were to make and submit one piece of art in order to get their final grade. And it had to be perfect, or they would fail.\n\nThe other half could make and submit as many as they wanted and get graded accordingly.\n\nThe first group spent the semester, trying to imagine the perfect piece, and by the end of the semester hadn't produced any art. And failed. \n\nThe second group produced many pieces ranging from average to perfect. \n\nThey passed.\n\nBlah blah. \n\nYou will never achieve perfection or even greatness if you get stuck in ideals. \n\nJust pick something that fits kind of, and act on it. Any mistakes are opportunities to learn and improve.\n\n\n 
2	I know exactly what you're talking about. I'll leave the "ideal" partner part out because I am not getting married so I just enjoy the company of whom I decide to spend time with in that moment.\n\nAs far as the other stuff goes... You cannot achieve perfection so stop pedestalizing this idea. Life is a journey but you are not moving forward because that requires action. I used to do what you do, think out every possible scenario to try to find the perfect path to what you want but it simply doesnt work that way because you can never have ALL of the information. What you need to do is try to decide what your end goal is and then take one, JUST ONE, step in that direction. This leads to a multitude of options, decisions, perspectives, ect that you didn't have available before you made that step. You continue this process over and over adjusting as you go forward. So, what you do now may not be ideal or the "best thing ever" but pick the best or most exciting thing to you right now and follow that until you find the the next opportunity or something more exciting.\n\nI'll tell you a little about my journey. I'm 36 now and have done a ton of different things over the years but was always kind of lost trying to find that one thing. I have always liked to make, build, invent things so I sat down at 32-33 to try to figure out what goal I should work towards that could encompass many or all of these things. I have always loved cars and especially the customization of cars so I decided I would like to build my own cars by either taking an existing car and stripping it down to make my own thing or to build my own from the ground up. I have learned and taught myself many skills over the year like wood working, electrical, plumbing, casting plastics, electronics and so on but I knew I would need to know how to weld to achieve my goal. To learn to weld I knew school was my best option. Honestly, it was pretty rough for a while. First I was broke after my bankruptcy not 6 months prior. Second, I worked full time nights waiting tables while doing a year of school but I knew it'd be worth it. After school I continued serving and got a second job for the money. I wasnt able to find any non-production welding jobs in my area that I liked so I found a "welding" job 2 hours away and I moved. The job I moved for sucked and wasn't anything like what I was promised so after 3 months I was already searching for something else. One day I randomly got a call from a temp service that had visited my welding school. The guy told me about some jobs in the area I had moved from but I asked him what he had in the area I had move to. Well, the company he hooked me up with is exactly what I needed and was looking for. I have made as much money in the last 2 months as I used to make in 6. So here I am now, enjoying my work, making good money, keeping an eye out for a small shop that I can start doing side work as the next step towards building my own cars.\n\nIf you notice, I never could have thought myself to where I am now. I never would have even heard of the company I'm at without going out and taking action. Sure I could have taken other job and had other opportunities elsewhere and maybe they'd be better, maybe they wouldn't. Stop second guessing your life with what if. What if I would have bought bitcoin when my friend first introduced me to it way back when? I could be a multimillionaire, but I didn't, so what! I can take action now.\n\nSo, take action, move forward and keep your mind and heart open to opportunities. Knowing yourself is important though because some things will look like opportunities but are really just distractions. So make a goal, look at what the first few step may be and take step one, adjust as necessary. 
2	I think it's good that you recognize you may have a problem in this regard.\n\nPractical advice is difficult to give, because experience is the real teacher here. Re. work... yeah, work's going to suck a lot of days. You put up with it either because hopefully, in the future, doing the sucky crap will allow you to do the stuff that's actually interesting, in both your personal life (because you now have the money to pursue cooler vacations) or your career (because you've now paid your dues). 99% of the time, there's no way around the boredom. Even people who do "dream jobs", like - idk, Twitch streamer - run into a lot of boredom and disillusionment. \n\nRe. your romantic life, be prepared for boredom as well. Definitely not ALL the time, but... it's okay to want to be entertained; it's just not okay to want one person to be your constant source of entertainment, because they're a person in their own regard, with their own thoughts and feelings. Trust me, you're not going to be entertaining to anyone else 100% of the time - so why expect that someone else can possibly entertain you 100% of the time? Obviously, you know this is unrealistic - I'm just trying to inject a little common sense into why it's so unrealistic. \n\nTL;DR if you don't want to be bored, figure out a way to entertain yourself. \n\n(On a final note, I'll just point out that there's a philosophical upside to boredom. Some [light reading](https://www.iep.utm.edu/boredom/), if you're interested.)
2	I see what you are talking, perfectionism, efficiency and fear of losing your freedom working against you. Typical entp.  My suggestion, continue to grow and move to better thing only only only after you accomplished the plan. Let your idea touch down, learn to be practical. Force yourself to take full or partial  action ony our idea or plan. As of relationship hey please do premarital counseling  and see the option of open marriage, and check her view in marraige  to save yourself from nasty divorce. Because for some marriage is sacred and for entp one excitement to another.  Be careful, don't be naive on this one. Relationships is not philosophy but real and practical. Something most entp suffer. You can undo many of your mistake and start new careers if it is needed but relationships is different so please use practical steps. Start with premarital counseling and see if there is a potential. 
2	There are three types of factors in our lives:\n\nOur known knowns (what we know)\n\nOur known unknowns (what we know we don’t know)\n\nOur unknown unknowns (what we haven’t even fathomed as a possibility)\n\nWork towards making things known. Use the tools you have to increase your knowledge base. The more you know and the more research you do when making a decision, the easier the decision will be. Just do your best to expect unknown unknowns, because those will change everything.
10	Idea Tracking	Does anyone use anything to keep track of their thoughts/ideas? Thinking about starting to carry around a small notepad and a pen to start keep track of the thoughts I have/things I want to accomplish. Not really a fan of the notes app, but have thought about recording voice memos. Does anyone do anything similar? Have any recommendations on notepads or something else? 
8	Yes, google app called "Keep". I hope they don't steal my ideas.
4	I used to have a couple of notebooks lying around  in the house/in my bag. However at some point these notebooks are not “neat” anymore or used to their full potential. Instead I would have half drawings/doodlings and half arsed list that I once started and don’t have a reason to finish anymore. Feels like wasting paper and not giving my mind any ease because everything is so unorganised! \n\nTried to use a voice recorder (on my mobile).\nHonestly; I never listen back to them.. or it takes too long to listen to them (plus its always kind of cringy listening back to your own voice..)\n\nTried to even record myself with a video, did not work for me either. Same reasons as using the voice recorder.\n\n\nNow I use the simple phone notepad. It works for me, because:\n\n1. It pushes me to note thoughts and plans down in as less words as possible. (No doodles or any kind of unnecessary notes to waste paper on)\n2. I can organise it to my liking. For example: categorise it to wherever it belongs AFTER a couple days whenever I feel like it.\n3. Easier to look up and scan through all your notes efficiently and much faster. \n4. It is always possible to rewrite them in an actual notebook so it does look neat and organised.\n5. You don’t have to go through all your old/new physical notebooks to find a memo. 
3	I send myself text messages. It’s fast and easy to search/reference, and is something I already use regularly.  I have tried to organize myself in lots of other ways, but this has been the only one to really last for any length of time. 
2	I tried to carry a notebook, but i'm so scattered that i usually forget either to carry it or to write anything down
2	I have thought of it as well and it worked for about two days and then i convinced myself that I am capable of remembering everything without it and i threw it away. It is not a bad Idea though.
2	I have an “idea journal” i keep. Normally what will happen is I’ll think of an idea, concept, or phrase and write it down in my notes app to transcribe in my journal later. It’s not super organized but it gets the job done by relieving my fear of forgetting a lot of my thoughts.
2	Just save 'em on your phone.
2	> Thinking about starting to carry around a small notepad and a pen to start keep track of the thoughts I have/things I want to accomplish.\n\nYes! Do it! Highly recommended.
2	I used to use legal pads, now I just use the Notes app.

1	when thinking about anything interesting, I make fucktons of connections about it.  "oh, maybe a new kind of race/creature could be created? well this race/creature reminds me of what x person said, which reminds me of that one animal, which as a whole reminds me of the process to create new maps. etc." so when I see anything that was related to the original thought, I'll remember it. \n\nif it ends up being forgotten, it's because it wasn't interesting enough in the first place.\n\nwriting this down in notebooks leads me to forget the notebooks themselves, as they're full of half formed ideas and uninteresting unfinished thoughts. for things that *need* to be written down, like whole explanations on fully formed ideas, txt files.
19	Cleaned my workspace today	I've just reorganised my workspace (including the large bookshelf I've stuffed all sorts of things into for the past few years) and threw out all the useless "nostalgia items" I've been hoarding and it frankly feels amazing. I hadn't realised that I'd been actively avoiding productivity because of the clutter, but the lack of organised mess is a lot less... immobilising. Apparently having all sorts of things laid out in front of you at all times makes it harder to imagine new possibilities or move on from the past or something. I don't know how long this is gonna last but I figured it was at least semi-relevant to the people in this sub, so. To all the disorganised hoarders out there: being neat once in a while is a pretty good feeling
5	I tend to do monthly deep cleans where I get rid of a bunch of shit. I don't know how things accumulate, I don't even buy stuff really. I find messes really distracting but I'm great at making them.
3	hell yeah! it’s probably about time I do a cleanse lol
3	Im studiyng paying someone for some hours every two week to clean my house for this same reason, i like cleanliness but i hate the routines that keeps messyness from happening and i dont have much time to espend cleaning and if i do have is at the expenses of my hobbys and pasions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> the lack of organised mess is a lot less... immobilising \n\n&#x200B;\n\nit is indeed, i wonder if this is the reason a lot of people here believe isfj isthe perfect match xD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	I suppose cleaning my house of demons is a good idea... cleansing time !
53	Tired of pretending I know what all the Fi Fe Ti Te Ne stuff is about	I thought I’d figure it out after a while but it still isn’t clear to me. Can someone explain or point me in the right direction? Thanks
34	*Look at edit 2 down below*\n\nThink of the e in Fe, Te, Ne, and Se as outward.\n\nThink of the i in Fi, Ti, Ni, and Si as inward\n\nPerceiving (The consumption of information)\n\nS and N \n\nJudging (The usage of info to make decisions)\n\nT and F\n\nS = facts/data\n\nN = patterns/methods\n\nT = reasoning \n\nF = values\n\nOutward perceiving is gathering\n\nInward perceiving is organizing\n\nOutward judging is considering others \n\nInward judging is considering your own \n\nPUT IT ALL TOGETHER (caps for subheading effect)\n\nSe - gathering facts \n\nNe - gathering ideas \n\nTe - considering the reasons of others when making a decision \n\nFe - considering the values of others blaaahh\n\n>But, u/MechRico, what about the internal stuffs?\n\nSi - organizing facts\n\nNi - organizing ideas\n\nTi - considering your own reasons when making decisions\n\nFi - considering your own values when making decisions\n\nThere's more fun stuff, like interfunction activities, function-grips, and shadow functions. But that stuff you'll learn throughout your research. \n\nEdit: I edited it because I wanted to. Deal with my reasons\n\nEdit 2: Look at my convo with u/The_White_Baron. Downstairs. There's a deeper discussion on defining these terms. *Leaving my original text for those following along*
24	There are eight "cognitive functions", which are mental tendencies of an individual, based on thinking/feeling and sensing/intuiting - giving the first letters of each function. The second letter represents whether it is introverted or extroverted. So "Fi" is introverted Feeling, and "Fe" is extroverted Feeling.\n\nIn total there are these possible functions: Fi, Fe, Ti, Te, Ni, Ne, Si, Se.\n\nEach of the sixteen types in this system (which are the four-letter identifiers like ENTP) is said to make use of \*four\* of the above functions primarily, and they are ordered based on how powerfully they influence the personality type. (They are also ordered by balancing opposite pairs - Se to Ni, Ne to Si, Fe to Ti, and Fi to Te - but don't worry about that if it's confusing right now.)\n\nENTP's functions, for example, are:\n\n1. Ne, extraverted kind of iNtuiting (this is the strongest influence on my personality)\n2. Ti, introverted kind of Thinking (this is the next strongest influence, and so on)\n3. Fe, extraverted kind of Feeling\n4. Si, introverted kind of Sensing\n\nThe functions are the ingredients to the personality that you then label with a type. It's like the functions are the recipe for cooking a personality, and "ENTP" is a way of describing the prepared dish.\n\nTo understand what each of the 8 functions specifically means for a personality, like the other person said: Google it. That definitely can't be summarized in one comment.
8	I use this site to start out - https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nAnd then this one https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/117161086682/masterpost-mbti-type-descriptions \n\nFor the nitty gritty for what loops and grip and each function looks like in different places.   
9	Go to cs josephs youtube channel. His oldest vids, one per cognitive function. Detailed explantation he is very good. \n\nSummary (My interpretation of what I’ve learned in layman’s terms, still learning)\n\nHad a few beers also,have mercy\n\n4 cognitive functions in each persons ego (conscious side of the mind, primary part of the mind but just 1 of 4). These are your mental priorities for how you process life.\n\nEntp: Ne > Ti > Fe > Si\n\nNe-Hero Function (also called primary)\nTi-Parent Function (also called auxiliary)\nFe-Child Function (also called tertiary)\nSi-Inferior Function \n\nHero, well developed. Unstoppable and sometimes leaves a wave of destruction\nParent, developed. Protects the child\nChild, underdeveloped\nInferior, underdeveloped \n\n(Need to learn more on difference between child/inferior. But child > inferior) one difference is the inferior function leads into the unconscious side of the mind\n\nNe: What could be (outward) options for better systems in work, other peoples lives etc. Unbiased in the sense that it doesnt have to benefit yourself. \n\nNi: What could be (inward) options for better systems in your own life, all possible futures for yourself and futures of those who have a knock on effect to yourself.\n\nTe: Established facts (outward). Logic requires sources, stats and external rational to support a statement. Opinion can be changed with the above \n\nTi: (inward) Established facts need to pass through the persons own True/False process. More likely to process information as it appears as either True/False rather than requiring external rationale. Seems better than Te but it can cause us to jump to conclusions and think we know everything on subjects we have very few facts on. ie ignorance when we miss pieces of the puzzle\n\nTe looks for the missing puzzle pieces from a reliable source FIRST then does a logic check after, Ti looks at the existing pieces to make a logical educated guess what the missing pieces MAY be\n\nFe: understanding making judgments based on the feelings of others. As an ENTP we come in swinging our Ne/Ti logic axe but we don’t do it to hurt others feelings. The truth is more important than your feelings and I’m expressing it to bring you into my logical vision/idea and help you. Or else help the system/work place we are both a part of\n\nFi: judgement based on your own emotions. As an ENTP bot this function is irrelevant\n\nSi: Past experience\n\nSe: What is \n\n\nI got tired \n\nEdit. Typo. Said ENTPs have Te, corrected to Ti
2	Read Jung (see the sidebar).  Stop reading people's bullshit online.  They're projecting their own egos into the definitions.  
2	Ne: divergent theory development \n\nNi: convergent theory discovery\n\nSe: reality interpreted directly from the senses\n\nSi: reality inferred from the mind (via memories) \n\nFe: morality, good/bad, is to be determined by others collectively \n\nFi: morality, good/bad, is to be determined by the self individually \n\nTe: facts are separate from one another, veracity and existence is not necessarily related to other facts\n\nTi: facts are connected to others, veracity and existence is in relation to other facts
3	Honestly you just have to google it. "cognitive functions jung" Jung is important there is a lot of garbage out there.
1	I suspect that no two persons/websites have exactly the same notion of the cognitive functions... Maybe there is no universally right direction, and one just has to cobble together the parts that one finds theoretically/practically meaningful.
5	Relationships and social class	As an INFJ, in the past I haven't given a shit about a man's social status. In fact, I've mostly dated dudes from lower classes. However, as I've grown and matured, I've come to realize that dating someone from the same class as you is the wisest decision. If you date someone from a lower class, they'll depend on you for financial support and/or fail to understand your ambitions. If you date someone from an upper class, there'll be a power inbalance in  the relationship and they'll look down on you.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Does class matter in relationships?\n\nAlso, although I come from a working class background, my morals and behavior align better with upper class folks. Due to my academic prowess, I've spent more time with kids who come from more privileged backgrounds and discovered my ambitions match theirs. However, experience has shown me such men look down on me for belonging to a lower class. Are women like me fucked?
11	I think your descriptions are mainly shaped by the 'nuevo riche' people you're surrounded by and frankly speaking I don't blame you for it. \n\nIn reality, class doesn't mean shit, what matters more is a Work ethic and the drive to chase a dream those are the qualities that make you successful , not how much money you're born into. \n\nLove doesn't need any particulars yo, Love is blind haven't you heard ? What you're speaking of here sounds more like an arrangement of sorts.
6	>What do you guys think? Does class matter in relationships?\n\n[you tell me](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergamy)\n\n>However, experience has shown me such men look down on me for belonging to a lower class. \n\nWomen have been doing it since forever. If you can't land a man of higher social class, that means you're not beautiful enough. Because men, on average, value looks. It's why you see young strippers and not old ones. It's why old men prefer young, 20 year olds. That's our reality. \n\nSocial class matters for more women than for men (insofar it's a factor of their decision-making tree for relationships). On the other hand, its typically secondarily sought after by men.\n\n>Are women like me fucked?\n\nSounds like from your post you're having a hard time getting fucked. 
4	\n\n>Also, although I come from a working class background, my morals and behavior align better with upper class folks. \n\nWat
3	Most UMC people I know don't care too much where you come from unless (a) they have to deal with your messed-up family; or (b) you have incongruous habits that seep into your present life, that you aren't ready to change. They care where you're going. Of course, some will be snobbish, but many will be just fine.\n\nI think I'm probably in the minority of ENTPs who does care about social class to some extent, particularly in a romantic relationship. It's just easier to be with someone who has a similar background/set of experiences, and who wants to build the same kind of future. My SO and I do come from more or less the same social class and still (just because of the difference in our upbringing) he makes a LOT of fun of me for having "privileged" habits, e.g., me buying "privilege water" (i.e., any beverage that... isn't water or some other drink from home), although this is mostly a joke. I think. (He's an ISTJ.) That being said, I can also make fun of him for having his own privileged viewpoint (e.g., thinking the neighbourhood ends after a certain street). It levels the playing field. Neither of us are constantly watching over our shoulder.
2	Social class has never even come to mind with the women I've dated. It's not something that guys even care about. Looking back, three have been richer and two were about the same. Not sure why that is. I probably wouldn't want to date a trailer park redneck girl, but that's probably because she would act like... well... a trailer park redneck girl. \n\nIs that you? 
1	I’m a first generation immigrant and probably considered lower class. I’m also well educated and an entrepreneur. Entp. I’m also objectively attractive (did some modelling, had famous men want to hook up with me etc). And a bit of an asshole I guess? \nI can tell you that from my experience the upper class men are the ones most often interested in me. Lower class men see me as intimidating. \nI guess you need to work on your looks/date actual upper class men not nouveau riche dudes. 
1	Women rarely date below their station after high school.\n\nMen, by and large, rarely, if ever, even consider social class in dating.  They will date up, down, or side to side. All they care about is a pretty face and a compatible personality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a guy who once dated a girl who was of a higher social class than the one I was raised in, it meant I had to conform to some serious expectations.  It took some practice, and a new wardrobe, but I was able to adapt.  However, it was definitely an adjustment and could feel a little restrictive at times.
2	Reaching out first then going silent ?	Hello hello ENTP Fellowship ! \n\nI tried to get some insights on the dedicated "mbti relationship" subreddit first, but it's not as active as your subreddit is, that's why I'm posting it here. Thanks to anyone who may have something to say on that matter ! \n\nTo be very clear about my intentions, I know that you guys have that tendency of giving good " get your shit together " advices and are more down to earth, and that's quite practical when you tend to just wander into endless mental loops that leads to nowhere. \n\nAnd just because you guys are ENTP doesn't mean that you will obviously have a good interpretation of one of your fellow ENTP bros actions but since you're supposed to share some patterns in the way you think, well, it just feels more logical to ask you. That's why I'm here !\n\nSo, the whole thing is a tiny bit more complicated but discussing the whole thing would take ages and would make you run away.\n\nLet's just stay that we used to be best friends - LDR - but then we both contemplated the idea of us being together and after a bit of headache and heartache realized that it just couldn't work, based on our priorities and other things.\n\nI thought that we could just turn that page and go back to being friends but at the end of the day he ( ENTP M 26 ) just took his distances and so I ( INFJ F 27 ) took mine too, perhaps in a more "drastic" way than he did. It was very hard because even though I did my best to be the most transparent about my feelings I didn't really felt the very much needed feeling of closure from him. That gave me a bit of ressentment towards him but other than that, I never felt hatred or anything, until now I sincerly wish him the best and it seems to be the same with him.\n\nIn any case, that happened like one year ago, after quite a while we exchanged some mails and in november he finally gave me some closure on some matters and it felt great ! Like the feeling of properly ending a book rather than turning white pages with no end in sight. It was very very hard for me to let go of that friendship, and the lack of closure made it worse. Only time slowly helped to heal that scar.\n\nAnyway, at that point I was convinced that this last mail would definitely be the last, and I made peace with that. I was slowly progressing in the road of forgetting all about him but when I almost reached a good place he suddenly popped up from nowhere ( early december ).\n\nI would lie if I'd say that I wasn't happy to get a message from him but at the same time I had a " You really can't let me forget you quietly huh ? " feeling. That being said, I was glad to see that I wasn't as worked up about it than before. It affected me, but not as strongly as before, when I would have started to "obsess" about every little thing like a weird psycho looking for inexistant meanings everywhere.\n\nIt was a friendly mail exchange with no mention of feelings or other "heavy subject". I had mentionned in what I assumed to be our last discussion that I had started a course in application developpement and since he's a programmer himself he asked for some news about it. We just talked like old friends and there was nothing bothersome or strange about it really, but then at some point he just stopped answering for some reason ?\n\nI mean, I really didn't expect us to talk as much as before and assumed that our discussion would be brief and end at some point, but it was such an abrubt end ! Like, in the middle of a conversation.\n\nIt's a bit annoying because I have no problems with clean endings as long as they are clean, but ambiguous situations like that just piss me off because I can't help but think about the why and all... I feel like I'm inconsciously waiting for an answer that isn't going to come, rather than just pushing it aside and forget about it. I really hate that side of myself and I'm trying to change but it really is hard. \n\nAlso it messes up a bit my "progression" in getting over that loss. Like, if I were making two steps every day his random message felt like taking 10 steps back, and now I'm not walking because I don't know if I'll get another message later or not at all.\n\nI'm aware that this must sound a bit too dramatic for you guys who are kinda known from moving on quite easily but as for me, especially because things didn't end in a "bad" way, I can easily fell back into old and unhealthy overthinking that prevents me from moving on properly. It's nothing compared to the first months but still.\n\nI don't really expect a magical answer but I guess that putting it on the paper always helps a bit !\n\nWhatever insight or advices you may have to share will be more than welcome ! Have a wonderful day :)
6	I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but there is a possibility he just got bored, found something else more interesting than the conversation and completely forgot about it.\n\nI have done it countless times and will probably do it many more. My other ExxP friends also do it. \n\nAbout reaching out, something (good old Si) reminded him of you and he wanted to check how are you doing. I am not sure about him, but if it was me I would have accepted that what has happened has happened and there is no way to make things the same as before, so the only thing left would be shared memories, which are quite nice to have with somebody, but nothing more.\n\nTL;DR: He wanted to see how you doing and got distracted.
2	for me it happened often that i approached someone i decided would cut off contacts w (romantical wise) and then i regretted approaching them bc i was scared things might escalate or i might get attached unnecessarily, so i convinced myself that i don‘t care, and distracted myself. while doing that i forgot answering or sometimes would think of answering but thought it might be better to end it before it gets worse\n\nbut i‘m a female and idek if what i said makes any sense
2	[deleted]
2	Not sure but as entp female, I wouldn't lie sometimes we are so self absorbed and not pay attention how we affect others feeling. He probably messaging you when ever he remembers you or feels lonely or even misses you. I strongly believe this is not a game or definatly not intentional to cause you this conflict. So, see it as simple texting or delet his number. \nBut also it seems you still like him. So this is not about personality, it is more of you guys still have feeling for each other. So, both of you need to decide to move in or out of each others life. \nImo you guys were best friend, mbti best match, and still  you miss each other, hmmm...may be you need to recheck the potential of this match. May be with some maturity and life experience, may be you can reconnect. Otherwise simply delete his number. Time is against you, so move on.  
4	I can't fucking stop procrastinating. Please help.	I am an INFJ and I'm not used to procrastinating. However, these past few months my anxiety has gone through the roof. Tl;Dr I'm going through a brutal breakup, facing immense pressure from my family to get married, taking hard classes, and taking on a research project I'm horribly underprepared for. Because of all this stress, I just sit and marinate in anxiety every day. I have accomplished absolutely nothing for the past five months. How do I get out of this cycle?
14	You're coming to an ENTP sub and asking for a solution to procrastination ? Good luck with that 😂\nYou should go ask the xxTJs , they'll be able to help you better. \n\nBut here's my two cents, I just try to remember my 'why' like why I want to do this particular task and where it will pay off in my life . 
5	don‘t be so hard on yourself, stop looking at the big picture and getting lost in it and just think of what you can do NOW. \n\nyou‘re at the point where you cannot manage everything like you used to, so you need to learn how to SWIM, or you‘ll drown\n\njust do what u can at a time and be ready that not everything will go 100% perfect and once you START doing sth, you‘ll feel the anxiety going slowly away bc if u‘re not doing anything it feels like a mountain on ur shoulders
2	INTJ here, \n\nWhat to stop: Worrying. \n\n\nWhat to start: CATCHING THE FUCK UP\n\nHow: Prioritize YOUR happiness and what's vital to it. Forgive yourself for time "lost" and focuse HARD on what you still have left. \n\nOne minute at a time one step after another. Until it's DONE.
2	Jordan Peterson has an awesome video somewhere about this. Treat yourself like someone you care about. What would you advise to a friend who is struggling with procrastination? Then do that thing. Also conceptualize the fact that you are working for yourself. So you have responsibilities. You don’t have to like them, but you have to get them done. So get organized. Schedule out your responsibilities, and then schedule things you like to do as rewards for fulfilling the duties of your “job”. Building a good habit structure like this will enforce positive results in your life and most liked reduce stress. 
1	How do you get out of this cycle? By getting out of it.\n\nHow do you overcome procasinating? By overcoming it?\n\nThat's all the help I can provide :P\n\nAnother thing you should know your cycle ends by itself, so try to find some instant sensory gratification (e.g eating tons of food, exercising,)\n\nINTP btw
1	Man, I’ve come to terms with the fact that I will never stop procrastinating. The art of it is knowing how much time it will take to do something to your desired quality outcome, and leaving yourself with just the right amount of time to get task (x) done. 
1	In terms of procrastination, just do whatever you want. If you need psychological help go seek it out, stop consulting souped up horoscopes for it. 
1	Honestly? It sounds like you need to see a therapist. I've hung out with INFJs in this state before; they've generally needed professional help to get out of it. I'd book an appointment with your school's MH provider.
1	As a serial procrastinator for over 15 years, my advice is to fill up your time with a structured list of work items. If you have time to sit down and think you are in trouble. An idle mind is a devil’s workshop. :\n\nFor example,\n\n2- hour morning window\nTask-1: workout in the morning ( run or bike for 30 min)\nTask-2: review this task list and eat breakfast/coffee\nTask-3: take one baby step related to your research project\n\n2-hour evening window\nTask-1: do one thing to help you move on from breakup. I would advise getting rid of all old items related to your ex.\nTask-2: talk to your parents to not talk about marriage for 3 months since you are dealing with a lot of things\n\nHope that helps. To focus, keep telling yourself “one thing at a time, write it down and finish it completely”.\n\n\n
1	Listen to motivational spots on YouTube and Spotify. Throw in some cardio. Pull back from the emotional drainers (people) until ur back on track and can reassess their place in ur life.  sleep well, definitely make a list like mentioned above, be good to you. Remember ura feeler, so you experience pain deeply. Journal, have coffee with healthy friends, write a penpal, etc. Don't hibernate but weekly make yourself spend time around healthy people who care about you. Positive inflow will eventually = positive outflow. Watch more comedies.

In the US, people look down on and make fun of those who work hard because historically the only ones who have worked in this country have been poor people of color (esp black slaves). Thus, hard-work isn't valued to the same extent it is valued in other cultures. People respect you more if you become rich from exploiting others.
27	I think I found a winner for “dumbest post” or whatever categories we have for the bestof awards.
11	this is a dumb post. the well known ideal of “the American Dream” is LITERALLY centered around the idea of hard work. people who work hard are praised not looked down on. studies also show Americans work among the longest hours of developed countries.  there are always exceptions, like the antidotal experiences or examples you may be using to support your arguments, but it’s ignorant to claim hard work\nis not an admired attribute in US society.
6	I’m actually impressed at how stupid this is 
6	Pretty much every country has had slaves not just the US ya know 
3	To be honest America has atleast average or better work ethics. Have you been in different country? People chill at work. In fact I would say America loosen up. 
3	Not sure what circles u run in but I'm a white single mom who worked 80-100 hr weeks busting ass for several years. Anyone looking down on me is an idiot bc I'm damn impressive...as are many in the US.  I think u need some new influencers. 
2	Man, I hope you weren't expecting anything less from posting a premise like that in an entp subreddit. It was like watching an egg thrown in to a blender.
1	Losers and junkies don’t value hard work. And if your idea of hard work comes come watching tv then it’s incredibly fictional. America is the only country where no one gives a shit about your background if you work hard. OJ Simpson and Louis Armstrong were respected because of their hard work. There’s an immigrant crisis because poor people can make a name for themselves is they work hard enough.

10	What introverted feeling looks like to an ENTP	
10	I understand what you mean Shaun. Yeah I think Fi users just assume people intend statements as if they themselves had said it. They’re not imagining the context the other person is thinking in. \n\nAnd if they use Si AND Fi, they have pretty much no imagination for someone meaning something in any other way. 
3	Nosering = Fi confirmed
2	Great vid - I used to notice that in people.
2	You implied that there was a discrepancy between your bosses behavior/personality, and your idea of what a copywriter should be like.  Your idea of such seems to be based on your own perspective and personality.  You broke Fe.  IMO Fe gently informed you that what you said was negative and rude.  \n\nI think your boss uses Fe.  I'm not sure you do though haha.  \n\nFurther this whole spiel is about how you are different from everyone else because of your "core authentic self".  Doesn't seem very TiFe to me.  At the very least it's not a TiFe form of argumentation.  \n\nDon't you find it odd that these other people are running around interacting in a seemingly homogenous, harmonious way, which you're just not comfortable with?  It's almost as though there is a shared concept of appropriate behavior which you just can't seem to jive with.  Hmm. \n\n
1	Pewdiepie 
0	TL;DR?
0	how do you behave at the intersection where someone signals turning to the left and is going straight to collision? how to feel the real behavior of the driver..?	check that eg: https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQi3bTuIZ5xrggC7mi4H_7K1j0h5hfmeonB1XuPHNATuMUPVxqI
2	First, I begin to analyze the situation, what brand is the car, the brand of tire the car is using, the passengers of the car,  what combustible the car uses, if has any imperfections on the car.\n\nThen, I analyze the driver, calculate which are the probabilities that he had an accident before, see his expression, his haircut, the music he is listening, and then, after analyzing everything about him, I create a mental summary of all his traits and percentages of having a dysfunctional family, car accidents, unpaid taxes, etc. I begin with a physical analysis and then proceed with a psicological one.\n\nAfter analyzing the car and the driver I begin to observe the environment, I analyze which are the escapes, which are the possible dangers (a kid in the road,  a bike, etc) , I analyze which is the type of terrain I'm on, the type of plastic used, and the method of creating the road. \n\nThen, I calculate all the numbers related to velocity of the car, the resistance of the air, the pressure of the air, and which are the distractions and probable velocity of the brakes for slowing down the car.\n\nAfter the analysis of everything, I proceed to select the best option based on the risk and conditions.\n\nBut, before I proceed to apply the option I chosen, \nI argumentate why I did everything in case I end up getting sued or reported to the cops. \n\nThen I plan an escape from the nearest prison if I end up there because of this possible accident. I analyze how good is the security, the convicts that are there, the day I will arrive, the economy of the prison, if the prison tends to have volatile situation, etc.\n\nThen, after all this I proceed to act in real life.  I would turn to my right if I were the car in the up side of the intersection.
2	Usually I don't go unless I see him actually starting to turn. Better safe than sorry.
5	Your emotionally dead cousins, INTPs are strolling through	Also, while I was browsing around and might as well ask, what do non INTP’s think of INTPs? As far as I know, we’re the depressed-incel-emotionallyfuckedup part of the personality types. Honestly, if the personality types had neighborhoods, we would be the one where you go down if you have no other option and you roll down your windows and tell your children to not make eye contact.
20	I'm always really confused by INTP stereotypes, if only because the IRL INTPs I know are generally pretty well-adjusted. Like, not depressed, although perhaps a little prone to nihilism. Definitely not incels. Independent thinkers, but generally quite warm/kind. A little shy, but has good friends/family. Internet INTPs literally sound like they all have Asperger's or something.
8	>roll ~~down~~up your windows\n\nftfy. 
7	If you’re really emotionally dead why do you care what we think of you?
7	Intp- weird people for some but not for entp. We understand you and prefers to be around you. For you to enjoy life accept your personality, work on self acceptance, enjoy your hobby, circle yourself with similar people. I kind of envoius of intp for your sophisticated, detail and accurate brain. Just learn to accept main stream life style, jokes, music and small talk. That is your survival kit. Use your brain and be successful in life. Atleast you are always not bored like us  we are vibrant from outside because we know the game. At least you guys are real though. 
4	**I love INTPS.** We are so similar but you guys are way more thorough in your thinking.  The smartest MBTI and it's proven. (Highest concentration in giftedness and in grad school, particularly STEM subjects >90%). Robotic, but it's part of your charm. Funny, witty, 100% logic and it is the best shit ever. A weakness is that you guys are emotionally stunted, but w.e. You guys are good people(bonus) and way more selfless than you appear. I don't think you guys are weird at all, but I guess that is a stereotypical ENTP trait, I really do appreciate "strangeness".
7	I see ENTPs as like me, but not interested in group social interaction at all and also less neurotic; at least that's how it looks from the outside.\n\n.\n\nWhen talking to an INTP, I'll be the one yapping away while they just say "yeah" and "mhm" until I hit something they feel the *need* to reply to; then they'll respond with the same intensity as me. \n\nIt really looks like they want you to shut up, but when I genuinely ask if they want me to or if I stop talking, they ask me to keep going. I know they're annoyed with my talking the longer it takes for them to look away from their book/phone everytime I want to catch their attention for some dumb meme or the like.\n\n.\n\nEdit: and I've seen some function very well in group social interaction, but only because they are secretly seething/dying inside from it and have learned to appear sociable.
3	Both of my parents are INTPs, and they're not so bad. Not emotionally dead, just takes a little more work. 
3	The one intp I know is socially anxious and shy, but very interesting to talk to if he isnt afraid of you. I actually quite adore him and would fight anyone who ever tried to hurt him.

6	Best way to deal with an unhealthy ENTP?	Let’s keep it brief: guy at work (ENTP) annoys me (ESTJ) by constantly questioning by supposedly ‘love life’ (I should probably include the people he’s talking about work at my work as well) and constantly picking at what I’m doing. Both these things are done in a joking manner, because that’s how ‘fun loving’ (someone else’s words, not mine) he is. \n\nHe can read emotions really well, so he knows I’m pissed. I don’t mind when he makes other jokes, about how I’m too ‘stupid’ or ‘everything comes too easy to me’, just when he says things which don’t concern him.\n\nDo I just try to ignore him? (Because I attempted to for the whole year, then I kinda blew up… but I can continue trying)\n\nThank you for your help in advance :)\n
24	Just take said individual aside and tell him that he's crossing some really personal boundaries tell him which ones, and let him know its unacceptable. He may not realize how much its actually upsetting you. Document it.\n\nHaving fun at another persons expense, is not only immature, but makes for a toxic work environment. If he keeps at it, then have a chat with HR.
13	It almost sounds like he's into you. With the constant poking at your social life
5	It almost all situations, I have found I am unaware of or the extent of which I’ve hit a nerve. As another post mentioned- highly recommended taking him aside and being serious with him about what he’s doing and how it’s bothering you. Don’t let him brush it aside- he will probably try to. Let him know exactly how he’s making you feel- regardless of his intentions- and how if he ignores what you’re saying he is intentionally harming you. \n\nIf he’s actually just a shitty person, odds are he will be too cowardly to continue- if not he will try to change or stop the behavior. Win win 
4	The best way to address an aggressive entp is circumspectly, i assume hes an ass to many people.\n\nSimply point it out that noone likes him and use the things he does to you as an example.\n\nThen tell him how people feel behind his back.\nBasically punch him rights in the nuts ( Fi )\n\nKeep doing it until he learns his place.
5	I 100% appreciate when people tell me I'm being too mean or annoying with my jokes, because I can get carried away sometimes, and not realize the people are "real mad" and not "jokingly mad".
3	I mean it completely depends on guys relationship. If you guys are equals and I would take him aside and just call him out. By just saying what you wrote to us. ENTP take a little bit longer to fully reach their cognitive stack. And maturity awareness can be lacking. \n\nI remember a couple times in my life, where I was flatly called out for it some immature  action. And while all those times were uncomfortable, they were a real catalyst for personal growth and change.\n\nObviously if this just an ass-whole at work you don't have to care about is a personal growth. Irregardless it's important to set boundaries as in I really don't appreciate when you talk about this. The seriousness will completely cut to the Core that it is behind all of these games.\n\nIf this person has any character or intelligence, maybe they can learn from this and not alienate and upset the people around them. \n\nGood luck
1	That's really hard. I don't know if this advice pertains to an ENTP jackass in particular, but in general, I think people tend to give subtle signals as to what they're willing/not willing to put up with. I'm usually pretty easy-going and nobody bothers me at work, but I've definitely had to shut down classmates in the past. The most effective way (I've found) is to put on your most deadpan stare and say "I don't care". They're keep badgering you; you keep just saying "I don't give a shit" - and if they still keep talking, you literally remove yourself from the situation. 99 times out of 100 they'll leave you alone after that. You don't have to be friends or even on friendly terms with everybody, especially if they're just annoying asshats.
1	entps can tell when you're pissed but come to the cponclusion that if they just frame what they're doing as teasing, witty and good natured enough that you'll be pulled out of it. Well at least i do. 
1	Just tell him straight up! Where is all that bluntness ESTJS supposedly have? ENTPS are not going to take it personally. Just simply say: I do not like that you are doing X, Y, and Z. They'll get it. They will most likely even apologize. If they keep poking and prodding even after that, then escalate. I don't think he means any harm, so don't take it personally. Just tell him straight up and he will stop. Bam. Simple. No need for drama. 
4	Need more input	I'm an ENTP stay at home mom and live in a tiny village and I'm losing my mind. I need new sources of info, knowledge, something...\n\n\nEverything has become an echo chamber amd mom brain, and kid chaos has impeded my ability to "find more puzzle pieces" \n\n\nAnyone have any interesting muses as of late that they would be keen on sharing?

1	[deleted]
1	Are you into podcasts?
1	> I need new sources of info, knowledge, something...\n\nYou should get the internet.
1	How about starting a part-time Internet business? Do you make anything? Have any particular skills?
5	ENTPs and view on originality?	Okay so I have seen a lot of people saying that it's Fi domain, but I still wonder, is it? Wanting to be original/individual/special/one of a kind/etc etc. Isn't it something what people want, doesn't matter their type? Why is it attributed to Fi? What are your opinions?
10	It is more common with Fi to emphasize it outwardly, this is why it seems like an Fi thing I guess. But the way in which Fi and Ti want to be original differs from what I've observed. Ti tends to want to be an original thinker, while Fi tends to want to be an original person in terms of their likes, lifestyle etc. Both want to be original, live their own life and not succumb to groupthink pretty much.
7	From my personal experience I know that all the stuff I create is a complex blended mix of the stuff I like where I sprinkle some personal experience on top.\n\nFor example: One of my big passions that I want to turn into a career is video editing. My style of editing and my ideas for future projects are influenced by the games I've played, videos I've wateched, music I've listened to, content I've read, and overall the stuff I've fed my brain with. I can make a fast paced action tripland short with a bunch of my favorite special effects and style of cinematography with raging analog synths playing in the background and I'd call that original if it's not obviously derivative from something already existent.\n\nEverything original is just a bunch of existing parts arranged in unique complex ways in order to create the next cool thing.
2	People say it's an Fi thing because Fi cares more about expressing their curated self image while Fe is more socially accommodating aka more willing to present themselves closer to the norm. Of course all types have their own way of being original and every human on the Earth needs to simultaneously feel part of the group and individual. It's just about gauging who is more likely to value it more/express it.
3	Do you think that personalities percentage's in the population vary between countries ?	For example, while staying in Mexico for vacations, I have been thinking that there are a lot more sensors that intuitives. This is not a bad or a good thing, it is the nature of the place and society, and that obviously the demographic is different than in the United States thus the percentage of each personality changes depending on the social environment. What do you think about that ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
5	That there are more Sensors than in Intuitives holds true for virtually every society. Ns are simply rarer than Sensors, with NTs being the rarest. \n\n[This](https://www.truity.com/blog/personality-type-universal-across-cultures) article could be of interest to you. 
5	There’s also less Jews in Mexico. 
2	I don't think so. I believe unfit personality based on a the country culture will be supressed so we don't see it much. Like men expected to have masculine personality so he hides his F and vise versa. 
2	same here. I think the same. in Germany majority of people seem to be judgers and thinking, while in turkey id rather say most people are feeling and perceiving. in asian countries there might be also more judgers, or introverts.
18	To all mbti Merry Christmas, happy new year, happy holiday, what ever fits you.	Enjoy the last few days left of 2018. Remember, we are on this planet called earth. Until we get shipped to planet mars or worest mercury, enjoy your stay.  
5	Hey, I have a problem with earth. How can I change the atomic composition of the materials I have? I called to the Earth Maintenance and they told me they don't know anything about that but I think they are lying.
9	Is it possible to gaslight oneself? And blame others for it?	Alt account. Is it possible for somebody to perceive someone else’s actions/words in a way that is effectively self-gaslighting in nature? Then blame the other person for manipulation? Thoughts please? I’m stressing out. 
20	Yes, it’s called paranoia and projection.
3	As an extremely paranoid person I can tell you this is very possible
1	I don't understand sorry purr English my friend, I'm Romanian.
1	Sure.  It’s called N that’s gone off the rails and “reads between the lines” to discover things that actually aren’t there.  
8	Travelling across the world, and I have yet to meet like-minded individuals. Where are you guys? What kind of experiences have you had while travelling if you have?	I am travelling in South East Asia for two and a half months with a friend (ESFJ, yes I know. Old friends). Don’t get me wrong, I’ve met some great people so far, lively, fun, interesting personalities, but I have yet to meet someone on this trip to enlighten me on their perspective/s on the current state of the world, world politics, their upbringing along with their theory on how certain life experiences can affect the human brain, the logistics of space travel and if it’s even really useful/progressive or not for our advancement of a species, what they consider advancement of our species even is whether it be spiritual, intellectual or materialistic, how different cultures must’ve come about and just how amazing but horrible the world really is or could be. I want your elaboration. I want to know how and why you think everything is connected. Or independent. How are we all connected? How do we connect? Why do we connect? What is it all for? Why even question it in the first place? Why does it all make sense but make none at the same time? I have yet to meet you. All of this is stuck, trapped, clouded inside my head and I get lonely here sometimes. One might ask why I couldn’t be that person, but the truth is I’m simply not at this time in my life, and frankly (look at my use of vocabulary I sound like a douche 😂👍) have sufficient information. I long to meet a like minded individual or one who possibly wants to meet another as well. I’ve met people, people with opinions and mediocre ideas, but no one with the kind of thirst for knowledge that I’m looking for. I have yet to meet them. I want to meet you. Where are you guys?
4	A higher percentage of Ns pursue higher education.  On the road you're going to meet more ESPs.  \n\nI stopped bothering talking to a lot of travelers haha.  They generally just get me into trouble.  \n\nHave fun!  
1	I’m here too, full moon party tonight for some spiritual enlightenment 🙏🏻😉\n\nI was able to connect deeper with people in India and Nepal because people aren’t there to party really and are more there to dive into a vastly different culture or do some awesome hiking. Thailand has been more of a challenge. I’ve met awesome people but I’m in my late 20s and I cant be bothered to party like I used to and that seems to be the big thing to do here. Heading to Vietnam (Hanoi) on Christmas Eve. If you are around and want to meet up, PM me. Have fun 
1	I mean, it's SEA, mostly people go there as some sort of spiritual excursion or to party, so... probably not a ton of NTs hanging out, if that's who you're looking for. You sound like you should be on a college campus smoking a ton of something with your philosophy major friends, if those are the types of conversations you want to be having.
4	ENTPs, am I one of you?	This baffles me. Every time I read you guys, you remind me a lot of how I would say things. Not fully convinced, but from my perspective it kind of sounds that way, maybe?\n\nI am typed ENTJ, however with a much stronger Ni than Te. Maybe that has something to do with it? Both being the NT extroverts with very strong intuition, maybe that's why it seems that way.\n\nI have really gone through a lot of online MBTI tests, socionics, enneagram. Initially I was typed INTJ most of the time, then people suggested that I might be mistyped so socionics got me Lie-Ni and enneagram 8w7 (although too common with ENTPs) lead me to a somewhat solid ENTJ... but it still seemed a bit off.\n\nWhenever I talk to ENTJs (or at least self-described) they seem different to me. On ENTJ sub-reddit (Which is probably flooded with ESTJs) they talk rather simply and boringly to me, it's not even playing a role of being the "direct and to the point ENTJ", to me it seems like many people on there don't have any interesting to me points.\n\nA lot of things that I have read about ENTJs seem right, but a lot of things that I have read about ENPs sound right to me too. But I am just tired of going over it again and again. The function stacks are also mostly about self-evaluation and I can see using both introverted and extroverted intuition/thinking - so it's difficult for me.\n\nBut whenever I look at people on the ENTP sub type, they just seem to me like something that I would write, it's strange. OR maybe that's just my perception.\n\nAnyway I thought that maybe it could be a good idea to just do short AMA, maybe something that is not specifically related to MBTI (re-rehearsal of questions) and maybe just see how I answer things, whether I reason the same way you do guys.\n\n
5	MBTI =/= Socionics. Don't mix the descriptions on each functions together, they're rather different despite having the same names.\n\nFor the question, give examples about what you find similar on how you would write in this subreddits. Then maybe someone will talk about that.
9	>I am typed ENTJ, however with a much stronger Ni than Te\n\nIn other words, you're an INTJ.
5	Is the same as the reason intjs and intps often doubt betwen those types albeit having totally diferent functions, even jungian cognitive theory, should be taken with a grain of salt as it respond directly to the dichotomys, and even thoug Entjs lead with Te, theyre an extremely similar type to Entps, and even thoug u can notice TeNiSeFi on Entjs fairly easily theyre stil similar.\n\nThis has to do, with the fact that the usual dichotomys of Extroversion and introversion, ar directly based on Jungs, more so than the functions, Jung was the one who created the concepts of extroversion and introversion as we understand them, low stimuly vs high stimuly.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion\_and\_introversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion)\n\nAnd as u said Entjs and entps ar both extroverted intuitive thinkers, so they share a lot of similaritys.And yes, there ar a lot of Misstpyes on Entj subreddit, mostly people who ar looking for power because theyre insecure about themselves, so they go to the power boss mbti and type as one of them.\n\nActually if ur extroverted instead of introverted doesnt matter how much u think u use any cognitive function, if u after carefull self assesing accept that ur an extrovert u must be leading with an extroverted function, bby it Ne, Te ,Fe r Se.\n\nThere ar several studys written about it.\n\n[http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1976-27058-001](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1976-27058-001)\n\n[https://www.psychologistworld.com/personality/pen-model-personality-eysenck](https://www.psychologistworld.com/personality/pen-model-personality-eysenck)\n\n>Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung (1875-1961) suggested that extraversion-introversion levels depend upon the focus of an individual’s *psychic energy*. In extraverts, he believed that this energy was directed outwards - towards other people - resulting in more social interactions. Meanwhile, introverts’ psychic energy is projected inwards, leading them to indulge in inner-focussed, less sociable, activities\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was Jung definition of extroversion, sounds familiar? there is a correlation with functions theory , atleast if were typing under Jungian standar we should accept what Jung said about E and I, as he was very clear about it.\n\nSo u just found one of the problems of cognitive function theory, and is one of the many this is consided anecdotical at best,this shouldnt keep u from delving more. In fact we would to read a lot more about u, in order to properly type u, i think if stereotypes of Entjs uberdetermined bosses were less rampant we would be seeing more people with the same doubts that u have, instead of the usual Entp/intp and Entp/enfp that seem so prevalent. funnily enough u dont see people doubting between Entp/esfp even thoug is a common misstype.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIll write further about what cognitive prefence means and why we should also call it cognitive priorization as it may help u understand why u can see urself using all kind of functions when ur honest with urself.
2	oh boi you‘re going to burst a nerve by trying to come to a conclusion. i have the exact same issue, i somehow relate to ENTJ and especially INTJs way too much. and the stuff they say sounds relatable to me. so i was thinking and thinking which one i might be. then just accepted that even tho i do relate to NiSe and TeFi too, most of the the time i rather use NeSi and FeTi so yea; try to see which functions seem to be most idk fitting and feel right to you
2	Do not type by the behaviours, you may easily be mistyped that way ( "This baffles me. Every time I read you guys, you remind me a lot of how I would say things" )\nI'm ENTP but was mistyped as INTJ because honestly, I can act pretty much the same as them. My first result in tests etc were ENTP then I read about cog functions and it fitted but then.. oh boi. Then I was mistyped as ENTJ, then INTP, then ISTP, then I thought I am ESTP or ENFP, and then I was like nah, it's ENTP but now I'm wondering if I'm not ISTJ. Don't even ask where the last one came from.
1	Given the fact that you spent a lot of time finding out what type you are, it's a solid indicator you are entp. As when we find something interesting, particularly the self, we tend to get sucked in and lose track of time.\n\nPS: who cares what type you are? You are your own type. Nothing should limit you in being you.
1	How goal-oriented are you? How much do you secretly (or not-so-secretly) judge other people for their life choices?\n\nAs an ENTP with quite a few ENTJ friends, these are the main differences I notice. I'm far less goal-oriented (I do have goals, they're just not to make partner by the time I'm 30 - maybe 40?) and I'm generally very live-and-let-live, whereas my ENTJ friends frequently rant about how stupid so-and-so's decision to drop out of school/start dating random person/start her own business without financial security/etc. was. I mean, I'm sympathetic to the ENTJ POV most of the time; I just... literally care a lot less/am a lot less appalled in comparison.\n\nSo, if you're constantly shaking your head at everyone else's life choices, you're likely a J; if you're mostly just chuckling and going "k, wutevs", I'd say you're likely a P instead.
1	>Every time I read you guys, you remind me a lot of how I would say things.\n\nI feel the same way looking at these guys.\n\n>Not fully convinced, but from my perspective it kind of sounds that way, maybe?\n\nYou sound like me when I talk...\n\n>I would write, it's strange. OR maybe that's just my perception.\n\nThat "OR talk" is a quality *most* ENTPs have. Verbally, I talk about different ways someone could drive to a location and often the wording and emphasis goes "You can turn left here and then head straight... OR YOu can go to the right, straight, left then left again"\n\n>maybe just see how I answer things, whether I reason the same way you do guys.\n\nI have 2:\nA girl wants to dye her hair a different color, so she asks you for suggestions, what do you say?\n\nDo you like red, or blue? (Unrelated to the first question)
8	Siblings and mbti	I am personally an enxp and i have a sister who is an isfj (so pretty opposite to me) and an istj brother. Is this just a coincidence that the oldest brother becomes somewhat opposite, and what are your siblings types?
7	Older brother and myself are ENTPs whilst younger brother is an ISFJ. I get on better with and have more similar interests with my ISFJ younger brother.
5	I'm an entp and my brothers are as follows from oldest to youngest (I have four...) : enfp, intp, infp, entj sooooo not quite? I will say that my parents are the most stereotypical parent types, istj and esfj, so maybe that plays into it, since we're all pretty intuitive and my dad only cares about monotony and tradition while my mom only cares about conforming and making other people happy, so you can imagine how much stress we all bring them
5	I'm an xNTP have an ISFJ sister too. There's a lot of unstated common ground between, but we are also in so many ways very different.
3	I’m ENTP and my sister is ISTP. \nBasically, we hated each other until we were 12 and 13. I was always trying to “get a reaction” out of her and she didn’t want anything to do with me. She’d literally take things apart for fun and see how they worked—I’m not exaggerating—she’s like the poster girl for ISTP. \n  When we were older we started getting along. She appreciated my humor (most of the time) and I appreciated her calmness and cool demeanor. \n  HOWEVER. \nWe’re 23 and 24 now and we still have huge problems communicating. We speak different languages. We think and reason totally different. Things that are important to her are not important to me and vice versa. We rented a house for a while and that was a huge challenge. To me it was like trying to talk to a brick wall and to her I must’ve seemed like a volatile POS. \n  All in all, we get along on surface issues but we have so little in common it’s hard to have a deeper relationship \n   
2	ENTP here and my sisters are ISFJ, ISFP and INFJ\n\nit‘s pretty normal for females to be SF, me and my INFJ mom and sis are the only intuitives in the family. interestingly 5 out of 6 of use FeTi only 1 FiTe\n\noh and i get along w my ISFJ sis the best bc even tho we‘re extremely different, she‘s funny and chill
2	I'm(f) ENTP and my older sister is an INTJ.
1	ENTJ self, INFP half brother, ESFJ mother, ESTJ father.
1	Oldest sister is an ENTJ, middle sister is an INFP, and I’m the youngest (ENTP). Dad is an ISTJ and my mom is an ENFP.  The lack of Ti and Fe is torture, lol. I’ve always felt like the black sheep in a very self-absorbed family.  The only person in my family I’ve felt pretty comfortable around was my ISTP step-brother but he died in 2016.
1	I (ENTP) am the oldest of four siblings. I am a male, and my three younger sisters are ISFJ, ENFJ, and ESFP. My mother is ISTJ and my father is ESFJ. We all get along pretty well, although my best relationship with my siblings is probably with my ISFJ sister. My two best friend are also an ISFJ and and INFJ. So I guess I tend to get along with people more opposite than me.
1	Weird, seems lots of polar opposites. My sister is an ESFJ. We are very dissimilar yet very close (both over 40, live around the world from each other, talk 4-5 times a week).
1	Yes lol
1	ENTP here. My older brother is an INTP and my older sisters are INFP and ISFJ. The ISFJ constantly complains about being the "bullied" sibling, even though we pick on each other equally.
35	If countries were separated by MBTI type, who would be most efficient.	If everyone that lived in a particular country was its own personality type, what type would be specialized in what industry. \n\nConsidering from the Stone Age to modern times, what would the result be in modern times?\n\nWho got to tools first? Did anyone try to invade another country first?\n\nWhich types are allies and enemies. Why are they at war? \n\nEtc. 
87	ENTJ would conquer its surrounding areas and ally with ENTP and INTJ. \nOrrrrr, if ENTPs got a work ethic they would conquer the Globe within a month.
39	None. Each type would falter for its own reasons.\nAn istj would be productive doing that same thing over and over but never progressing or imagining a better way.\n\nThe esfp would get drunk and give each other stds until they died.\n\nThe istp would die of loneliness because even if they like each other they would keep it to themselves.\n\nThe entp would wander from the unfulfilled obligation to the other.\nThe major lesson of type theory is that the types need each other. 
23	ENTP world would slowly crush in a self destruction mission
13	Ns would falter, Sensors would thrive. \n\nThe NJs would create their humanitarian totalitarian dictatorship and soon devolve into the Fourth Reich. NTs would have plans for a techno utopia readily available but nobody could be bothered to actually implement anything because we're thinkers, not doers.\n\nThe Sensor societies will probably be fine in the long run since things would develop similar to our world line.
27	INFP would be a spiritual forest tribe living in peace and harmony with the earth in a system of beautiful lake houses, taking only what they need from mother nature. And they'd be brutally crushed.
9	ISTPs would have discovered pretty much all tools first. I imagine an agrarian society or like the Aztecs with the Chapultepec aqueduct.\n\nINTJs would be like ancient Mesopotamia with its ancient library. Cool and ahead of its time, but ultimately just information gathering. Probably keeps to itself, no one else would know about it.\n\nISTJs I think would be like a monarchy. I'm thinking France before Louis XIV. Very into tradition, etc. Louis spent *way* too much money and essentially caused the French revolution ("apres moi, le deluge") so it'd be like France before someone tanked it. \n\nENTJs: Holy Roman Empire when Charlemagne was running around and doing shit. Organized, united cause, ultimately benevolent but maybe too pragmatic? Trying to get the other countries to be part of their rule.\n\nENTPs, ESFPs, ESTPs, would all essentially live in the wild west. Kind of a nowhere land where nothing gets done, people party too hard, there's lots of shooting, poker, hookers, and gold mining. \n\nINFPs and ENFPs would unify and essentially become Switzerland except more of a pussy. So Poland? Poland.\n\nENFJs: Ummm... Amsterdam? A place of regulated fun! With a large tourist industry because it's so pleasant!\n\nINFJs: Ancient Chinese mysticism, acupuncture, herbs and shit. Some of it probably works but everyone else gives it the side-eye. Keep to themselves until they get invaded.\n\nISFJs: The west side of Canada during the time period Anne of Green Gables takes place. \n\nISFPs: Does anyone actually know what an ISFP is like? I'm going with a country sized version of Haight-Ashbury.
5	INTP, since without any NFs around they'd basically all become Vulcans
3	ENTJs obviously! Also, ESTJs and INTJs are not to be trusted. However,  if ENTPs felt threatened by anyone else, they will lead all other countries to a rebellion against ENTJs, INTJs and ESTJs. So, ENTPs will win eventually!  \n\n\nVIVA LA RÉSISTANCE!!!!
2	As an INFJ I can confidently say, not us.
2	INTJs and ENTJs vie for dominance while ENTPs constantly mess with both of them for the sole reason that they can. \n\n
2	Entp with neighbour with intp country. 
2	I think enfp would win becuase people would love us too much to hurt us :)
2	What society would be the most efficient? Well, ESTJs are build for efficiency cognitively. \n\nI simply can't come up with an answer that is logically consistent in this scenario.  \n\nA Muslim ESTJ vs a Jewish ESTJ. Both highly traditional, but totally incompatible, and both want status, power, and to spread their shit. They are just bound to be on a collision course.  \n\nEven if ESTJs had the same traditional path, they would still fight to be the alpha within their own system.  \n\nIt is said Julius Caesar would rather be number one in a village, than number 2 in Rome. Imagine an entire society based on that mentality.  \n\nI know it is a hypothetical question and meant for speculating, while having fun, but still make sense. But I just can't make sense of it.  \n\nETJs would be the patriarchy. ENTPs would just stealthily pick the winning side, or make people play each while being in the shadows.  \n\nETJs also prefer SFP women, because they are often the most feminine/caring about their bodies beauty, so they can become the trophy wife. But they will have no power in the ETJ society because they are not seen as competent types worth listening to. They would just be a possession for the ESTJ.  ESFPs would fuck their way to the top.  \n\nENTPs would hate the ESFP and see no use for them. But they would please the need for the ESTJ to gain protection.  \n\nNFPs would be some pacifist tribe like the society which would just get fucked by the might and power of the patriarchy.  \n\nIf NFPs were in the ETJ society, they would be the witches.  \n\nSFJs would be the plebs. ISTJs would be the academic upper class citizens, soldiers, priests, or craftsmen. STPs would be craftsmen, or soldiers.  \n\n
1	ENTJs. INTJs a close second.
1	An INFJ country would survive only because it would be the country first to try to learn and internalize the skills of other countries. 
1	Each one would collapse from the inside because of how imbalanced they all are.
3	About Converting Self Qualities to Extravert Skills	Hello fellow extravert NT’s,\n\nI am an inactive member of Reddit community who happens to come to a decision of participating online international sphere.  I turned 24 this year and live in Turkey. While I have not been using internet participantly for a long while, here I come to change my mind on that. For now, I decided showing up in Reddit as it contains a broad sense of people. I myself is considered as an ENTP for around two years. Before, I believe I had an Introverted perspective on life, though I cannot recall the exact code of my MBTI results except the I and N parts.\n\nAbout the topic, I have a problem in life that needs to be solved somehow for me to achieve living a proactive life. For so long now I feel isolated from the public sphere, starting with my family, then the society I live in, then the internet and then now my friends. I have struggles to settle a steady yet dynamic circle. I used to have pleasure joining my friends, though I was never a fan of the family and yet an active person of the countrywide internet. I used to be able to find common occupations with other people in a particularly wide range until around when I was an high school senior. \n\nI have been creative writing since 13. I wrote almost every piece in my main tongue Turkish. I am a very efficient user of Turkish language. I tend do become a published writer in future. While this is the case, I am not a very productive writer because I dislike the idea to promote my own work. I think, in order to make a meaning out of publishing online without any help of the patrons, one should have put so much effort and faith on his own writings. To shorten it, I do not think it would worth to put resource on creating a blog. And if I do like to start one, I know that I will feel the need to adapt my writings into the Market. Also I will need to add other context in order to be shown to and attract people. The problem is, while I cannot use my talent to improve in the market itself, I cannot also use them in social area.\n\nI must say my mood can change during the day for a few times but I am generally a very understanding, kind yet bold, smart, funny (and can make people laugh), and when in mood, very attractive. The last part makes me feel like I am also in the “go get the ladies” game. My skills mostly come from my thinking style. I act and speak from the way my mind works. I make difference in a room with that. My problem is, I do not know how to make my skills useful or appearing to other in social areas. Although my previous relations have almost happened because of the interesting mystery and ambiguity inside me, my skill to use the language successfully has helped me to get the attention. I mostly had the need to try to attract first and enjoy the interest but now I believe I have hit the rock for some time now. I feel the need to be explored but I cannot put myself to showcase.\n\nSo I ask you fellow ENTPs, knowing from your own experiences, do you have systematic ways to convert your skills into extravert qualities? 
5	can you guys help me type this guy?	can you guys help me type this guy called william james sidis?\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James_Sidis\nhe was a child prodigy im just really curious to know what type he could of been?
15	He has a face of an ENTP
2	>Eventually, he avoided mathematics altogether, writing on other subjects under a number of pseudonyms.\n\nThat sounds like Ne (INxP or ENxP)\n\n>MIT Physics professor Daniel F. Comstock was full of praises. ‘His method of thinking is real intellect. He doesn't cram his head with facts. He reasons...'\n\nTx, but not sure which one...\n\n>Shortly after graduation, he told reporters that he wanted to live the perfect life, which to him meant living in seclusion.\n\n>The paper reported Sidis's vows to remain celibate and never to marry, as he said women did not appeal to him.\n\n>he briefly served at the League of Nations before leaving because U.S. president Woodrow Wilson would not withdraw troops deployed during the Great War. He was outspoken about his pacifism.\n\nThese tell me strong Ti. \n\nI don't need/want (more ”don't want to” tho) to read anymore to figure out he's ENTP. Unless someone can bring up other quotes
44	What are your core values? And do they connect to being an ENTP?	(F)eelers are often mistaken to be synonymous with "values". But every type got values.  \n\nSo what are your values, and why? To simplify it. Let's keep it at 5, let's call it "core values".  \n\nIf you need inspiration you can obviously google: "List of values". Or use the one I draw inspiration from. [List of values](https://scottjeffrey.com/core-values-list/).  \n\nAfter thinking a little, I ended up with these, so far.  \n\n**1. Freedom  \n2. Balance  \n3. Curiosity  \n4. Playfulness  \n5. Logic**  \n\nReasons for values and ranking  \n\n* **1. Freedom:** Because having the freedom of having a choice is ultimately which makes all the other values possible. How can you find balance, if you're not free to do so? How can you explore your curiosity if you're not free to do so? How can you be playful if you're not free to be playful? What is logic worth, if you're not free to express it, or it gets trumped by repression?  \nIf we should sneak some ENTP into this. Then ENTPs also in general seem to be the least satisfied in environments where they are as restricted as possible. With as little personal freedom as possible. Living the cubicle 9-17 life, and having no freedom or influence, might be the most draining way for an ENTP to spent his time and life. Or in the military as a basic soldier where you have to follow tradition, bureaucracy, and a billion of lists, and rules. Where following orders is valued, not asking questions. Do as you are told and shut the fuck up. We can't have a Socrates beginning to question, and challenge every damn thing when we're in war.  \nENTPs seem to thrive much more when they have the freedom to creatively express themselves, and be spontaneous about it. Suiting NeTi.  \n\n* **2. Balance**: Because life is essentially about balance in all aspects. What is your passion worth, if your health takes you down, because of neglect? What is anything you like worth in excess, if it ends up destroying you in the end? Balance is also a value/word that can be applied to everything, with only a positive outcome.  \n\n* **3. Curiosity** Well, I guess this is closely related to having Ne as a dominant cognitive function in MBTI. Life is about being curious, exploring, and seeking novelty. That is what makes life exciting, adventurous and exciting. Which also runs into Ti. Be curious, explore, and understand. I spend a lot of time being curious, exploring and understanding. So logically I see that as a value in itself. If I couldn't be curious, or explore. Life would be nothing more but a rebroadcasting to me. I see curiosity and freedom as being strongly correlated. Or at least it is difficult to be curious if you're a slave being whipped working at the same repetitive task day in, and day out.  \n\n* **4. Playfulness:**  Also closely related to freedom, and curiosity. Being able to fool around, experiment, click some buttons, and see what happens. If everything had to be 100% serious, and being playful was banned I could imagine most ENTPs would feel rather dead inside, at least I do.  \n\n* **5. Logic** This is where Ti comes in. When all the shit and giggles with Ne is done and dusted. I want things to make logical sense. I want to break things down and understand them. Living a totally irrational and illogical life would not be a life worth living. It would be meaningless/random. Curiosity to me is also about making sense of the chaos life and the world is, and Ti is a tool for that. Because it tries to explain life/the world in a logical and consistent manner. Just by being an aux Ti you naturally value logic. Which is why it also has to find a place in my personal core value list.  \n\n**So what are your core values?** I am sure we can see a tendency based on our MBTI types, even though we might not have exactly the same.  \n\n\n
25	I'd give a similar list, possibly replace Balance with Self-Improvement.
9	1. Independence\n2. Honesty \n3. Self-improvement \n4. Individuality \n5. Love
6	I don't think mine are really related to being an ENTP. I guess these are things that I value about myself and others regardless of type.\n\n* Accountability - own up to your shit. You don't have to apologize. But if you did something, you've done it.\n* Assertiveness - If you're not willing to ask for what you want or say what you feel, you don't deserve to get it.\n* Candor - Be open. Be clear.\n* Competence - Don't be stupid. You don't have to be great at something, just don't be stupid.\n* Creativity - Don't be boring.\n* Curiosity - Don't be boring.\n* Generosity - It makes me uncomfortable when others are generous to me, but it is something I value in myself.\n* Self-Reliance - Be able to take care of yourself. Dependence is lame.\n* Playfulness/Fun - Don't be boring.
5	Freedom, education, genuine, self growth, yep 100% Entp style. 
5	Agreed on all. My priorities have changed over the last 10 years but no matter what I've kept these core values until this day. Most of them make me exhausted in my daily life but I cannot give up on them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1-) Creativity:** I literally can't feel alive without being creative all the time. Since childhood, my biggest motivation was always creativity.  I admire the human brain. The capability of it in terms of creativity. Plus I am so obsessed with it that I insult non-creative people. Not because I think they are stupid, it is because they don't want to use their potentials. That makes me feel so angry. I cannot control myself. Sometimes it is a disadvantage. Being always creative makes me feel exhausted. I only sleep 4 hours a day since childhood. I sometimes feel dizzy when I am working at the office. Age is important. I need more sleep but I hate it because I am missing more chance to be more creative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2-) Productivity:** Productivity comes with the creativity of course. For the same reasons above, I want to be more productive as much as I can. I use my physical and mental potential to its limits. And I push my family too. They sometimes get frustrated but they still respect.  I have tons of active hobbies all are ART related. I spend every night sculpting, drawing, painting, composing music, developing games, etc... never get bored. I want to copy myself to experience more. I think I will keep pushing myself until someday I physically not capable anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3-) Open Mind:** Humans always develop by open-minded brains. I am all against the term "tradition" because I was raised in a traditional family, in a very traditional country. In childhood, I spent most of my time, fighting against traditions and I still do. As an ENTP kid, my family always tried to push me down with traditions where I was open-minded and thought every possibility being super neutral and rational and trying to explain it to others. They never listened because they were not open minded.  So I understand Socrates very well.  Being open minded is super important for humans. I value this a lot. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4-) Self-Confidence:** Now most of the time a self-confident person is called a narcissist. This is wrong. Specifically, in business life, I learned that self-confidence is very important. In business most of the  Manager profiles - because they have  Dunning-Kruger effect - loves to blast away on employees who have less self-confidence. I observed that the only way to fight back is to have a strong self-confidence.  %100 of my experiences tell me that if you are so aware of yourself with a high-confidence, there is no way to bully you. It is impossible. I heard this directly from dozens of executives and people with high titles in business life. They respect me a lot and sometimes they fear. They prefer not to have a conversation with me because they know they can't beat that confidence. So be sure before acting, do not ever hesitate. Do or do not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4.5-) Devil's Advocate (not a value but I wanted to mention)**: Being able to play this role is a gift. I have not many close friends but I never remember that I leave my close friends and never fight with them because I choose them wisely. When I first meet with a stranger I play Devil's advocate. I go further, deep down to hells edge to see the real face of the person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5-) Balance/Love:** Balance is the key to the universe. Love is the key holder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Honorable Mentions** : Humor / Trolling / Freedom \n\n**Special Thanks to :** Curiosity 
10	1. Courage \n2. Humility \n3. Graciousness \n4. Productivity \n5. Self control \n\nI don’t think these relate to at all to being an ENTP, but the people I admire more or exhibit these qualities. \n\nHowever, I think a lot of the qualities ENTP’s value in themselves - Objectivity, open-mindedness, logic (truth seeking qualities, generally speaking) tend to flow from these values. You have to be courageous to say what others aren’t willing to. You have to be humble to acknowledge when you might not have the answer and to defer to others. You have to gracious to understand what’s valuable before racing towards a “clever” solution with unintended consequences. You have to be productive to see to it that the truth is acted on. And self-control is just, you know, a valuable thing for us impulsive types to aspire to. 
5	1. Exploration\n2. Truth\n3. Integrity\n4. Gratitude\n5. Compassion
7	1. Independence\n2. Curiosity \n3. Cynicism \n4. Open-minded\n5. Stimulating 
3	Yea I would generally agree with all of this 
2	  0. Having the ability, competency ( so this is the value "0" cause I think I value it the most. Being able to to something, having enough skill and power. Just wow, this concept alone leaves me in awe. Doesn't mean that you have to do this thing, but the fact alone that you've gone ability to do so is amazing)\n1. Individuality (being your own person,not being forced into one and the same thing as everyone)\n2. Freedom (having a choice, not being forced and told what to do)\n3. Connection to someone who knows your brain (didn't know how to name this one. I'm talking about being connected with someone who knows your brain and truly understands it. Seems like it would be amazing experience,but I've personally never experienced it)\n4. Logic (also, I value logical decisions more than those made purely based on emotions. I admire people who are able to make decision that goes against what they feel, and actually get on with it)\n5. Shrewdness. I admire people who display those traits a lot. People that are actually clever, sly and resourceful. (It's number 5 but it doesn't mean I value it the least of those)
2	\n**1. Morality**\n\nFor me, the most important thing is to be a moral individual. Morality includes maintaining the freedoms of others, which I believe to be human rights. \n\n**2. Decency**\n\nNot to be confused with morality, decency is day-to-day stuff. Being nice. Morality, on the other hand, is really just not breaking the rights of other people. Decency is just not being a jerk, not doing things that I know will make other's feel bad. This is kind of different from most ENTPs because we're normally abrasive, but it's really just what I TRY to adhere to, but usually I fail.\n\n**3. Self-Improvement**\n\nWhat's the point in life if you stop striving for something? If I stop improving, in my view I must be going backwards. I'm a stick-shift with no brakes going uphill. Gotta keep going. Foot must be on the accelerator.\n\nIf I think of more later, I'll give it to you
2	Same as yours, OP, but maybe replace balance with something like friendship or belonging. \n\nI enjoy logic and learning new things partly because my curiosity makes it satisfying, but also because understanding the world and ourselves could help me be better able to secure the freedom I need to do the things that are most important to me, which are enjoying new experiences and spending time with those close to me. \n\nSo you can see how the “real world” for most of us is my worst nightmare. Trading away my freedom to work jobs where you often have to conform to rigid, inefficient, nonsensical rules, surrounded by people who take themselves too seriously, so that I can pay for the remaining 1/3 of the day that I’m alive/awake, but I’ll be too mentally burned out to read or pursue a social life or have a family. \n\nMy entire personality (which has more or less been present for as long as I can remember) is built to go against the script. And this kind of personality is liberating and advantageous, IF you have the competence, luck, and opportunities to find a way to succeed. 
2	1. Freedom\n2. Freedom From\n3. Freedom To\n4. Freedom With
2	Here seems to be a divide between the perspective from wich people describe their values. I think quite a few people wrote about what they would like to be rather than what they are, but maybe thats just the cynic in me.\n\n
2	These are my core values:\n\n· Authenticity: being genuine.\n\n· Appreciating/Beauty: appreciating the beauty in things that others don't seem to notice.\n\n· Curiosity: to be curious, open-minded and interested. \n\n· Freedom: to live freely and choose how I behave.\n\n· Intimacy: to open-up, reveal and share myself emotionally.\n\n· Optimisation: specifically, best results for minimum effort; pareto optimality.\n\n· Self-Care: to look after my health and wellbeing and get my needs met.
2	- Integrity : I can sense a weak moral structure from miles away and it is an instant turnoff in any form of relationship. I like to believe I have a solid core of integrity and expect those I keep around me to adhere to a similar conduct.\n\n- Honesty : The kind that comes from within, that makes one so comfortable with themself that anything other than the truth is an absurd waste of time.\n\n- Levity : I recently became aware of how much I appreciate being able to break any tension with humor. I don’t believe in taking anything too seriously. Life’s a joke, laugh. \n\n- Emotional Articulation : I like myself and others to know how they feel, where they stand with themselves, how they’d likely react in certain scenarios. I like people who know who they are, we can rely on people like that. I like people who know how they feel and can articulate that feeling instantly after stimuli are applied, I like to believe I possess this ability. \n\n- Self-Improvement : This shit is N E V E R finished. Every day, all day, I am brainstorming with myself about how I can improve myself, my surroundings and my life. I view myself as a real “fixer upper” and enjoy daily mental renovations. \n\nI find it challenging to maintain relationships with people who don’t understand or share these values. I have like a thousand more but those recur in importance for me. 
2	1. Open mindedness\n2. Independence\n3. Skepticism \n4. Creativity\n5. Flexibility 
2	I can describe my core values in 3 words:  \n  \nHard worker  \nAlpha Male  \nJackhammer  \nMerciless  \nInsatiable
1	What do you understand by "value"?
1	Logic
1	Understanding. Not just knowledge, but actual, in depth understanding. Seeking understanding of myself, of others and the world. Also accuracy.\n\nI think people might not think of this as a core value, but it’s something ENTPs consider important more often: having fun! So just like being playful I guess. There’s so much terrible shit in this world and people are always so serious. But if I’m going to live in this crappy life, I might as well try to enjoy it a little bit.\n\nI’d say both of these are pretty ENTP. 
1	1. Truth  \n2. Freedom  \n3. Justice  \n4. Life  \n5. Strength  
1	- Freedom of speech/thought.\n- Decentralised power.\n- Humility - Not being a smug bastard who thinks they're entitled to things because they have more money.\n- Curiosity and open-mindedness - I believe you should always approach a situation by thinking that you can learn something from someone by not being judgmental. For example, someone who is 50 should not treat a 25-year-old as though he is always wrong and should, therefore, be quiet and show respect. Fuck that. \n- Self-improvement - You should always try to learn new things but also improve your emotional and philosophical outlook of life.\n- Never try to control other people\n- Independence and self-respect. For example, don't try leaping into new relationships straight after another because you can't stand being single and think you can't handle life by yourself. This is a sign that you need to work on yourself. I think this is never a healthy move. \n\nI'm sure I could think of more but the ones OP listed are good 
1	Pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath and sloth, and self-improvement.
1	I do almost everything to become a more\nIndependent\nCompetent\nHardworking person
13	As entp, do you ran out of brain stimulation?	It is not easy to provide brain simulation all the time. Is there any advice, med, food, activity, place to go, things to do you may suggest?. I go many days without brain simulation, and sometimes that triggers existential questions. 
12	It’s probably worse off for ENTPs or people diagnosed with ADHD (such as myself), but to an extent the inability to tolerate boredom is learned/conditioned by the world we currently live in.\n\nWhen you check your phone at the first sign of boredom, like waiting in line or in an elevator for example, that exacerbated it. Now a lot of us can’t even watch a tv show or movie without also checking our phones. I can’t enjoy a meal without watching a show at the same time or being around friends (the latter of which is at least healthy and a good form of stimulation). I had to relearn how to enjoy reading (and even then it takes effort compared to just going on the internet). \n\nAnd as you get older and experience more things, there’s less and less novelty. Everything you experience is more or less a variation of something you’ve experienced before (especially in terms of people you meet, fiction/media you consume, places you visit). The bar is always going to be raised and time/energy/resources will limit your ability to pursue novelty even further. \n\nThere’s likely always going to be new things to do, but it’s even better to develop your capacity to endure lower levels of stimulation for longer periods of time. Meditation is the most obvious form of this. I also use the Forest app to block my phone (and Self-Control or Focus to block fave sites on my computer) for an hour at a time to just read. You can even use baby steps and force yourself to watch an episode of a TV show or movie without looking at your phone or opening browser tabs. It’s an uphill battle given that we’re bombarded with stimulation everywhere we go, but you can train yourself. 
4	Keep clicking [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random) over and over.
7	Dude, you have the fucking *Internet* at your disposal. If you can't find any "brain stimulation" with the internet, that's a you problem. 
3	Of course we are living in a bran simulation
3	My father said only dumb people are bored. There are literally a billion things to do, but human beings in the US only have a lifespan around 80 years.  
2	Try a free online class: https://www.edx.org\nOr even just Khan Academy. Bound to be something you might like on one of those sites. 
2	I debate vegans and leftists full time on reddit.\n\nDoes that count?
2	No way dude. I never *stop* brain stimulating. I've been going hard for over 30 years. 
1	Existential questions are a way to kill boredom! Instead of thinking about it you can read about it and experiment with your life as well. Instead of reading cray cray philosophy like Sarte, Nietzsche, Camus, I recommend the book "Finding Meaning in an Imperfect World". Analytic Philosophy suits an ENTP :)\n\nI find that, instead of looking for brain stimulants, how about looking for brain commitments? It is easy to be bored with things, but takes mental training amd durability to discover details in ordinary things and ask questions. My example, I had been bored with Renaissance music for a year before I got into it. Now it is my shit.
1	[deleted]
1	Well, what I try to do is not to run out of brain stimuli. Going out to different places can help, but if I can't do that then there's Internet. I just dive into some topic I find interesting. Like, lately I've been researching what you can tell about a person based on their handwriting. I get bored of almost every one of them but it's at least something for short time 
1	I am familiar with the existential ennui, the eternal boredom that is hard to remove from your psyche.  Monotony can cause you to stop seeing interesting possibilities.  Even activities that normally mentally stimulate you can become a bore if done to excess such as constantly internet surfing as mentioned above.  Try totally new things.  Something that requires you to learn a new skill would get your wheels turning.  Do you enjoy your daily activities or have they become monotonous routine?  I quit my job a few years ago for a lesser paying but more exciting one with way more future possibilities because it no longer provided anything new and there was nothing but boredom and jadedness on the horizon.  You could even pick up something you lost touch with, such as a old hobby or even seeing old friends.  Anything that will kickstart your brain by providing new thoughts and possibilities.
1	Yes, i am running out right now.
1	Try weed. For real. 
3	Fe in contrast with the troll stereotype?	Hi all,\n\nI've been confused for a while now about how an ENTP's Fe manifests in day-to-day situations. The seemingly commonly agreed upon definition of Fe describes the function as a compassion-enabler, and allows the user to 'read' the emotions of a group, and respond accordingly. This definition makes me believe that Fe-users would be highly diplomatic and ultra-respectful which is true for many, yet, according to stereotypes, ENTPs are described as being contrarian at best, and trolls at worst. \n\nTherefore, this relationship between the Fe definition and the troll stereotype seems like it would be impossible, as the diplomacy of Fe and the shit-stirring of the troll type are drastically different.\n\nI know that many believe the exaggerated troll personality to simply be a marker of emotional immaturity, so would that mean that a troll ENTP is neglecting their Fe? Or does this personality facet somehow stem from the Fe itself? Or does it even come from Ti?\n\nTL;DR - How does an ENTP's Fe function affect the troll stereotype that some ENTP's display?
16	ENTPs use Fe to read emotional reactions and gauge the energy of environments and individuals. \n\nIn my understanding, trolling would be an immature use of Fe because you’re using your Ne-Ti to create an experience that will evoke an “entertaining” emotional reaction which you get pleasure from. 
9	> I know that many believe the exaggerated troll personality to simply be a marker of emotional immaturity, so would that mean that a troll ENTP is neglecting their Fe? \n\nYep, that's the theory.  Healthy use of Fe develops with age\n\n&#x200B;
7	Healthy Fe tells you when it’s time to quit once you have offended or holds you back from offending in the first place - you are mature enough to know that the need to be correct is not always worth the consequences regarding others.  Now, if you feel really strongly about the topic, not just poking a sore subject to get a rise, then you may be inclined to say no to your Fe to stand up for truth because in that case Ti tells you logic really is more important than harmony.\n\nUnhealthy expression of Fe goes to opposite ends of the spectrum: intentionally creating discord and trolling to mess with people for fun; despising people and only thinking of the possibilities in which they suck; lashing out at people and being mean.  It can also manifest in devilish fun with some people at the expense of others. Or it can be the opposite: people pleasing; eschewing things you value for the acceptance and compliments of others; unable to say no; following along with the crowd when you shouldn’t.  You may put on a face of sincerity and genuine care for others but under the radar do things that aren’t right with an attitude of “it’s only bad if people find out”.  All these behaviors could create cognitive dissonance and cause Ne-Fe loop; you get out of it by not ignoring logic, listening to Ti tell when it’s telling you to evaluate your unhealthy Fe behavior.
2	>This definition makes me believe that Fe-users would be highly diplomatic and ultra-respectful which is true for many, yet, according to stereotypes, ENTPs are described as being contrarian at best, and trolls at worst.  \n\nENTPs are not Fe users. But Ti users, which is the opposite of Fe. They value accuracy over social harmony.  \n\n>so would that mean that a troll ENTP is neglecting their Fe?  \n\nNo, it means they are an ENTP Ti>Fe, and not an ISFJ Fe>Ti.  \n\nSeTi and NeTi are both very observatory types (Ne/Se) and both want to understand things, and put understanding things (Ti) above being superficially friendly, warm, and kind (Fe). They prefer toying with stuff NeTi/SeTi, above just playing it safe, and please people FeSi/FeNi.      \n\n
1	Did you mean to put Te in the 1st paragraph?
1	As a huge troll I can tell you that its Fe motivated. Part of me resents my and other peoples preference toward Fe as I think that it inherently obscures the truth. When I troll people it's with the intent of subverting what's normal and seeing how jarred people get
1	Fe affects me in this way additionally: I feel ashamed because of others who don't know how to react in social environments. When someone say stupid things, I don't how to react and I just ignore.\n\nI don't think trolling is that bad. I troll new people I meet, I just make a fake introduction myself. Most of the time, I have fun and they have fun because of me, too. When they're buying my bullshit, I become more entertaining and confident to talk about much more freaky stuff. After this kind of nonsense trolling, it becomes natural to have a small talk, because our bonds became more stronger thanks to a funny conversation.\n\nSometimes I troll my own father who tends to have strong bonds with traditions. This is because I hate traditions and society rules. Narrow-minded people freak me out, so why I don't troll them? However, it isn't trolling most of the time, I just say what's on my mind in a harsh or sarcastic way.\n\nIn high school, most of my friends were not telling me anything emotional. I think that was my undeveloped Fe era. Before high school, I was banned from one internet forum. I am still disliked on a forum, because I object most of the ideas. In past, I didn't know whether a girl likes me or not and I didn't know how to response they. So, they ran away from me mostly when I made a move. People got mad at me because of the pranks I did. Though, many of these problems have been solved for me. I think Fe is developed through failures and experiences.\n\n&#x200B;
1	You can read the room that doesn't necessitate how you'll use that information. I could see that people are feeling tense and on edge and decide to antagonise them or to comfort them or do nothing honestly. If I can read the room the cards are in my hands and I can choose how to play them.
1	Trolling is a manifestation of the Ne-Fe loop, if I am not mistaken. It is a result of the subject completely bypassing their Ti and feeding off of the energy they get from trying to impress those around them by essentially bullying a target.\n\nSummary: Ne-Fe loop causes the user to attention-grab with trolling/bullying
0	I actually made a thread about it yesterday, cause I'm young (18) and so my Fe isn't apparently very mature, and I troll a lot - and it's not for other people entertainment, it's for my own - it's like an urge to just tick this person and see what happens, make them loose control enough to get emotional response from then.  Not sure why. So yeah I think it may change with age (at least that what people told me) and as Fe is a third function it requires time 
7	I tried modifinil	It worked very well. I only had 50mg and I cracked out my whole to-do list in record time. With hours to spare.\n\nI actually listened to my girlfriend attentively.\n\nI actually felt focused.\n\nNe scatterbrain vanished.\n\nI was able to ignore distractions very easily and implement my ideas instead of thinking of more.\n\nI felt calm. And in control.\n\nNow I’m interested in learning the mechanics of why it works so well. Something about dopamine but I need to dive in more.\n\nMy only concern is the potential for SJS but I hear it’s extremely rare.
8	Be careful with meds like Adderall and Modifinil. Use them only in emergencies cause it is very easy to get addicted. Also, overuse of your neurons due to stimulants will cause your brain to fry sooner. Just be careful my guy.
5	I love modafinil but use it sparingly and don’t drink alcohol while on it. Try to find the smallest dose you can to get benefits, I can utilize even 1/4 tablet. And ladies, these drugs make hormonal birth control ineffective, just keep that in mind before you take it or share some with your girlfriend. 
2	Wait, why can't we get the same effect with practice of discipline? 
4	ENTP + Modafinil = Perfection.\n\nWhile I don't know the specifics on how the drug works, I have used it twice, and holy shit, life-changing. I wrote a 3000 words essay in 2-2.5 hours, I didn't even know that would be possible under any circumstances.
1	Did a whole stint of vyvanse for 2-3 months last year. It loses its value quickly and the side effects suck. Just keep it for special occasions and its a wonderful drug.
1	I’m a *peach* on adderall. I enjoy small talk, which usually feels like slow cruel torture. I get my shit done. Other stimulants are the same basically. Except if I’m too stimulated then I get all quiet and weird. Being out here in the Midwest means I’m smack dab in meth country. So that’s everywhere. But it’s no fun when no one really keeps up w you. Even tho they are equally fucked up. \n\nI’m trying to be cool being un medicated. Bc having a monkey on your back gets pretty old after a while. Even if it makes other ppl and/or yourself more tolerable. 
22	We're building a dating site	We're building a dating site for people who are into personality theory. Because we believe compatible personality types have better chances of relationship success over the long term. Right now I'm looking primarily for NT types to test drive the site. A good number of INFJs are already on board -- a type that has been shown to be a great match for ENTPs -- but we still need a few more ENTPs to balance things out. Feel free to take our quick [5-point survey](https://melentp.typeform.com/to/EvaKNM) if you think you'd like to get involved. Thanks.
17	It is already obsolete, my friend.  Eveeyibe on the internet already knows you come to /r/ENTP for relationship help.
14	I think the only part MBTI should have in dating is realizing where someone else is coming from and conflict resolution. I think I’m that way it could be useful, but dating only on type seems like a bad idea, especially when type trumps other more important issues. 
2	Well guess what, F it. Im down. Things going pretty well lately in other aspects in my life so this might turn out to something good as well. 
2	Great idea! I might add that female INTP’s are a great match for ENTP’s too. 
4	If you're using MBTI for dating, you're using it wrong. \n\n> good number of INFJs are already on board -- a type that has been shown to be a great match for ENTPs\n\nShown by whom? INFJs pining for ENTPs? They're not even predicted to get along too well via a coherent description of the functions. \n\nYou keep saying we're making.. or our survey. Who is "we"? Your multiple personalities?

28	Is there a specific mbti type that we tend to butt heads with?	I have a friend who is an ESFJ and I tend to get so annoyed by him, I always call him out when he's being fake or trying to hard to fit in a social setting and he ends up getting clearly upset about it. Is there a reason as to why him and I tend to not click? Would it have anything to do with our type? 
26	STJs and SFJs in general. Mature versions come along better I think. Also SFPs tend to be rather uninteresting to us because of flipside functions, but no real headbutting there. Have several SFP friends myself.
20	I definitely feel you with the ESFJ. My mother is one. She is very much stuck in her ways and traditions. This bothers me to no end. As I was born break traditions. 
19	I tend to not get along with other ENTPs. We tend to be immature morons...
13	I can't understand  how I always end up surrounded by just them ESFJ's. Where would I even find fellow xNTx's? How do you guys do it?
13	And yes, I really dislike Esfj's, they are too fake, and make a huge effort to fit, they are very judgemental and stubborn and mostly of the times only take into account their own personal experiences instead of seeing the wide panorama, (i am Intp btw).
14	Has to be any XSFJ normally for me.\nMy mum is one and all we do is butt heads. 
7	I don't know about ENTP's in general, but most of the serious conflicts in my life have been with SFJ's. Honestly, there are a lot of them that I love.. but the ones I don't get along with I REALLY don't get along with. I don't get the STJ hate from other ENTP's. They are sticks in the mud sometimes, but I can depend on them.  They don't start petty drama and spin everything to make themselves look like martyrs like SFJ's. 
5	SJs definitely. I get along with SPs, but they tend to be a bit shallow for my liking. NFs and NTs are great though.
3	personally ESFP. their Fi makes me mad sometimes 
3	Maybe every xSFJ I’ve met has been unhealthy, but all the ones I know put on a face and go about life not thinking past “What am I gonna wear today” or “Oooh did you hear about this drama with him and her” or “how do I optimize my rigid schedule to be in the right place at the right time to impress everyone around me?”\n\nMy mom is an ISFJ and she is the stereotypical rigid-ass mother that is set in her ways and gives “Because I said so” as a reason for everything. Every ESFJ I have met both in high school and in my last 3 years of college has been some dense surface level jock that is failing out of school but “hey, the team won last night” or sorority girl that wants nothing more from life than to be a housewife to some rich tech mogul/doctor/lawyer.\n\nOn the flipside, I don’t get the ENFP or xSTJ hate. ENFP’s are very similar to us and while I can understand the disdain for their emotional stubbornness most of the time the world needs people who are better with emotions and use their Fi to make life better for everyone, cause lord knows I sure ain’t gonna take time outta my day. Girlfriend is ENFP so I might be a bit biased but hey, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ she hasn’t driven me away yet.\n\nxSTJ’s make the perfect implementation partners. One of my best friends is an ISTJ and he and I group together on every project we get in our Computer Science classes together. I come up with the design and after we finish implementation he writes all that boring testing shit. Match made in heaven lol\n\nTL;DR every type has their place. Except xSFJ’s, housewife robots will be available in a few years that ofc won’t produce drama;)
5	From experience ESFJ’s are melts, ENFJ’s are to but to a lesser extent, ISTJ’s are annoying, ENFP’s are little emotion balls that have to force their emotions on you to feel valid. The only thing I’d say about xSFJ’s is I’ve had a couple ISFJ friends and we can clash heads sometimes but I feel like their caring, understanding and loyalty make up for that quite a bit. Not like ExFJ’s who will suck anyone’s dick If it will get them a higher social status. ESTJ’s are weird cuz they can be kinda funny but it always feels like they are trying to hard. 
2	There is a Esfj in the chat rooms who says she is Infp but she fits so much the description of your annoying friend haha.
2	I'm somewhat fond of ESFJs but chances are I'm going to be frustrated by SFPs
2	I do have some conflicts with ESTJ's..
2	ESFP women. Because they're wired totally differently in their head compared to me + if we don't even share the same sex we have absolutely no common denominator other than the superficial EP semantics.  \n\nWe just find each other fucking stupid. ESFPs and not ISFPs because ESFPs are aggressive about their stupidity. ISFPs are not.  
1	My ex used to be an esfj, so maybe
1	Se-dominant/auxiliary & \*especially\* Fi-dominant/auxiliary types. \n\nCf. Socionics Gamma quadra
1	Dated an ISTJ and that was the worst 3 years of my life.  It seemed like the harder as I tried to make that relationship work, the harder she tried to make it miserable.
1	Sometimes I think it's more a question concerning which MBTI type we don't butt heads with...\n\nI seem to get along with a small amount of people.  Not sure if this is a MBTI specific occurrence, but I tend to keep a small amount of friends.  These people aren't in a friend group, but rather people I felt I had connection with and kept in touch despite losing touch with the majority of remaining friend group.
1	I cannot stand SFJs. My mother is one, and we can never see eye to eye on anything. Every time  we speak, it feels as if there’s a language barrier there. She’s very traditional and stubborn in her ways, just because she says so. “Because it makes me feel good,” is her response to everything. She can be very entitled, like when I argued an illogical decision she made, and she told that she was correct because it was her birthday. She doesn’t understand my unconventionality, and when I told her that I’m getting into neuropsychology, she asked why I’d want such a boring occupation. When she found that that we were almost opposite types, she got very sad and said “but we’re practically twins!” There is so much conflict between us, as there is with almost every SFJ I might.\n\nOn the other hand, one of my best friends is an ISFJ. Opposites attract, I guess. She’s curious as to my spontaneity, and I’m just kind of attracted to her curiosity in me. Every person, regardless of type, can be very different. No two ESFJ/ISFJs are the same, just as ENTPs. It depends on the individual. 
2	as an entp you are in an inquisitorial commission, and poor infy is accused of witchcraft: what test will you use for infi? and why?	a list of tests available here: https://www.thevintagenews.com/2018/10/23/salem-witch/?utm_campaign=QsalemwitchLAL_Image&utm_source=quora

3	bruh u sure u aint schizo or something
2	The obvious answer is witch cakes. That one's outcome is completely independent of the accused (e.g. they don't have to know the Lord's Prayer for example to pass the recitation test). \n\nBut, the one area of concern is the person baking the cake. If they have some sort of malicious intent they might add some ingredients to produce a certain effect in the dogs. I still think it's the best test to get away with a not guilty sentence though. 
2	Witchcraft???\n\nEasy...\n\n1) Woo her.\n\n2) Then mention the top few other \n"lady friends" *you were starting to neglect anyway*...\n\n3) Sit back and wait to see who drops dead from a hex or curse first... \n\n4) win-win...

5	Social sanctioning	What are the short term methods you use? Please help out a female INTP who keeps getting shit tested by xxFJs
5	What does this mean? 
2	I think I know what you mean, but I dont know the answer. I think its a game that you get good at with time and all I can advise is to keep your calm and your cool and not get riled up or angry. If need be say nothing or aha and walk away. Shit testing tests your reaction. If you dont know how to react well its always better not to react at all than to come across as insecure or react poorly. 
2	What is social sanctioning? 
1	ISFJ: Si->Fe->Ti->Ne\n\nESFJ: Fe->Si->Ne->Ti\n\nINFJ: Ni->Fe->Ti->Se\n\nENFJ: Fe->Ni->Se->Ti
1	They only thrive based on you reacting to them.\n\nYou reacting to them is what they feed on.\n\nSimply do not respond to anything they do.\nIn fact dont even talk to them. Stick to facts. Simply dont engage.\n\nFor isfj passive aggression is the name of the game.\nUse their need to help against them.\n\nFor esfj the name of the game is control. Dont cede any control ever. Dont accept anything from either one. \n\nThere are always strings attached.\nDo not take anything that is said seriously. Laugh it off when you get upset. They cannot stand ridicule.\n
1	Are xxFJs usually shit-testers? \n\nIn any case, I think you just kind of smile and nod as condescendingly as possible and let them know you think they're children. \n\nThe less you engage, the better. 
1	Maybe a solution for your problem is to search for the cognitive functions, like all of us 😎.\n\n/s\n\nBut seriously, I don't get what you are requesting.
67	The difference between ENTP & INTP	
42	https://i.imgur.com/v6j2RDB.jpg
10	I wouldn’t say that Ti alone is depth of knowledge because Ti is more about logical consistency and building an internal framework than knowledge. Ti + Ne drives an INTP’s curiosity and motivation to learn, hence making them knowledgeable, but by itself I wouldn’t say that Ti represents knowledge. 
21	i‘d say the exact opposite. Ne is breadth of knowledge and Ti is depth of understanding
10	I disagree.  Some of the most knowledgable people I know, the real domain experts with a plethora of solid facts at their fingertips, are ISTJs.  \n\nI also don't think Ne automatically leads to understanding. But it does lead to noticing similarities between disparate things -- which *may* lead to more nuance or abstraction in understanding after Ti gets a hold of the Perception.   I guess you can call that a broadening of understanding.  \n\nI would argue that TiNe does something similar, except the understanding is more focused on finding abstraction in the thing itself, rather than between things.\n\nSo if someone is studying, say, prime numbers, NeTi might be more prone to see connections to *other* areas like music for example.  Whereas TiNe might be more prone to see connections between two seemingly unrelated theorems on prime numbers. \n\nSo perhaps I would label the horizontal stroke NeTi and the vertical one TiNe. \n\n

0	I find the way many ENTPs go around entertaining themselves at others expense really pathetic. The thing is, if everything is a joke you end up looking like a fucking clown. Sincerely, a Te + Fi user.	I mean it's borderline bullying others for your own amusement. I mean people can do that if they want but the ENTP always plays the ''it was just a joke bro'' card. They will NEVER admit to their faults. Super annoying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm posting this here because I'm angry and I hope you all make jokes out of it like I know you will do. Nothing is serious right? Nothing at all? Ok.
29	You must be fun at parties.
19	Guilty. I do it to make people like you upset.
41	To be fair, this is one of those posts that should be made fun of. Stop bitching about your personal issues to a group of unrelated online strangers.\n\nSincerely, a Te + Fi user. 
17	Oh wow, it hates ENFPs too
17	While you're at it, would you mind bitching about the KKK to a group of Christians and the Taliban to a bunch of Muslims for me? \n\nBut tbh tho your thinking process is flawed. You can't judge all Entps (if mbti even exists) by one. Legit. Chill. \n\nI'ma upvote you now to expose u dumbness to others lol.  Yo I just found out you also called all ENFPs insane. Damn I sure get a laugh outta you. 
13	Breaking news: some ENTPs are jerks, most aren't. More at 11.

6	I don't really enjoy making jokes which might make an eavesdropper think I genuinely think like that, so if it provides you any solace, I don't act like that, but it's mostly out of fear.\n\nAll types have assholes, but we happen to make an exorbitant amount to **some** people because they take themselves too seriously. Oh well \#notallentps™\n\n.\n\nI think you think they're not admitting their faults by not conceding to your arguments, but have you considered that your arguments might be too bunk for them to logically make sense to the ENTP? You may think they are wrong, but that doesn't make them wrong. \n\n.\n\nTl;dr I think you may just be whining and I don't know what your point was posting this, really.
8	Ok
6	This is pure shit, i dont do this at the expense of other people, sometimes i tease a little too much yes, and the people i trust i insult them lightly and they insult me back is just a trust thing, but i never have fun at the expense of others if i see im making them uncomfortable.\n\nActually what i do, is get others to get loose, do silly stuff(this can be embarrasing for them, but is all in the sense of an ongoing joke),and flirt relentless in a joking silly way, and make jokes even at my own expense, and light tense situations with humor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheck where ur throwing ur rage, and why, maybe ur feeling bad at urself because theres a voice in ur head that kept telling u to make a comeback and u couldnt and now u came here with all that frustration i dont know why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAtleast as a Ti+Fe im not going to blame or tag  this on some sensor type,fuck that and fuck  ur tears\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;

4	what a waste of a thread. all people and all types have flaws. whining about it on an online forum because you need to project/need validation is almost as sad as believing that the entire population of a type is the sum of its worst attributes \n
8	Sounds like you are hanging around immature ENTPs. \n\nMoreover, if our natural aloofness and carefreeness is something you don’t like you don’t have to hang out with ENTPs. 
9	:eyeroll:\n\nNo one cares, nerd.
3	Lmao if you know we’re going to make fun of it, why do it? You’re actually setting up yourself for failure, then you’re gonna blame us? 
3	Well, for me it's not really bullying. For me, people keep thinking I'm flirting with them. Honestly though, I have bad social anxiety, and I have trouble getting into a "normal" conversation with someone. I think I do this not just for my own amusement, but Also primarily because I struggle to interact with others in any other way.
3	Allowing yourself to be this upset over other peoples’ perceived actions, especially stereotyping a whole group of people as if they all act a certain way and have the same intentions, says more about you than them.  Sounds like you have some insecurities you need to address.  One of my best friends is an ISFP and when he is really stressed he starts thinking people’s intentions are bad and that they are trying to personally attack him (usually never true) and he becomes a moral crusader on that assumption.  Time to re-evaluate where your feelings are coming from.  ENTPs are rare so I can’t imagine you’ve met many irl and of the ones online sure there are plenty of immature ENTP trolls
3	Let me guess. Your trying to pull a sneaky one on us. You want that Golden Toilet award don't you!!! \n\nYOUR TRICKY LIES HAVE BEEN EXPOSED! \n\n\nPS : You are the joke.
3	>They will NEVER admit to their faults. Super annoying.\n\nLiterally walked around the city talking to an ENTP last night with great self awareness and plenty of faults admitted.  Stop going around the MBTI subreddits being an insufferable cunt!
3	We enjoy being fucking clowns
2	I make jokes that entertain me. If other people laugh that’s great! If not then they probably have a shit sense of humor. But usually I can sway anyone. \n\nI don’t make fun of ppl in a mean way. Sure I pick at my friends. But they’re friends and they know what’s up. \n\nKinda seems like a risky move to just make that blanket assumption. That we’re all assholes and clowns. I’m happy being a clown tho. Saved my ass tons of times. Never been fired Bc of my excessive tardiness Bc I make great jokes. 
2	The person you described, might be immature entp and/or also might has personal issues with you. To be honest entp has hard time finding the  right match so it is frustrating too. Either you stay away from entp or have certain level of tolerance. Otherwise you will continue to experience this . 
2	 Not sure if trolling, good arguments tho
2	WELCOME TO GUILT TRIP WORLD! COME GET  YOUR FRESH TEAR JERKERS! 
1	Haha uhm okey! Plz give us an example of us "NEVER admit to our faults" because i can name alot of cases when we do! \nYour emotional outburst make you look weak!\n\nI guess why you never experienced an entp, admitting theyre wrong/did something wrong is because youve never succeded to prove one wrong! \nYou are just acting and argumenting based on feelings and we Will not respect that!\n\nAaand btw we dont care what you think about us so go somewhere else where you belong :)
9	If you could have only one requirement about your partner, what would it be?	Everyone can list a long ass list of traits you'd like for your partner to have, but if you could have only one requirement?\nIf not ENTP, please state your type.\nI think for me it would be matching me in temperament.  I want someone as intense as myself, someone who will be a challenge because they will be my equal in this ground.

6	ENTPf working for ESTJf in family business >.<	Hello - I have a career problem that I’m very much stuck on: \nI work at my family’s law firm as a legal assistant (7 years experience here), but I’m having a hard time with clashing personality types in the workplace. \n\nMy boss is an estj-a female (68) and I’m an entp-t female (23). My boss is also my aunt, and she is a famous local attorney who wants me to eventually take over the law firm that she and her husband built from the ground-up. As such, I’m currently applying for law school. It’s an opportunity for which I’m infinitely grateful, as I’m essentially an inner-city kid who grew up in a low-income, single parent household headed by a teenage mother. If I can do well with my own career in law, it will allow me to help my immediate family financially within the next five years-time. \n\nThe problem is, as much as I am in incredible and honestly, awe-inspiring, appreciation for this career opportunity, my aunt/boss doesn’t like my personality. She doesn’t like when I am opiniated and talkative, quiet and observational, sweet and nurturing, or intensely hardworking on her files with lots of hours in the office. \n\nBasically, she only likes if I act like an ISTJ at all times, but I’m in a place in my life where I’m trying to find my voice and be authentic to my own strengths professionally. Her husband (ISTJ-t, 70 y/o) thinks I need to speak up more - “an ungreased tire doesn’t go far,” he tells me, and he seems to like my natural ENTP-ness. I know he would like me to be more centered with who I am. This advice is in direct conflict with my aunt/boss who wants me to be less personally opinionated, individualistic, and talkative. However, even on days when I’m very quiet, which is very often, she takes this to be quietly rebelling against her, just because I’m not vocally complimenting and kissing up to her every hour on the hour. She cares a lot more about me being submissive and kissing up to her than she does about my work ethic - so she loves my brother who is an Enfp because he displays mounts of affection, even though he almost always sits on his phone or naps during his work hours for her. \n\nMy boss/aunt can be extremely giving and nobody would ever say she’s not a generous person, but she hates not only when I am outspoken about anything, but also screams at me in front of her clients about her other workers taking time off and groups me with them, then proceeds to scream at me for taking classes on the side of working, or about having any romantic relationships she doesn’t agree with, or about my fashion sense if she doesn’t like what I’m wearing. She also likes to tell me that I wasn’t brought up right and that she can teach me to do things right, like how to be cleanier and more presentable- she does this at the office, embarrassing me in front of everyone. \nRecently, I was quietly working on something and she said, “if you have your own mind, this isn’t going for work!!!” Loudly in front of her other workers and clients. As an ENTP, who is trying to be respectful and considerate at the workplace, this is kind of killing me. I’ve tried to just become the ass-kissing ISTJ at work she would like me to be, but it’s caused me to feel sick to my stomach at work, to the point where I become nauseous during the day and so emotionally drained at night that I have panic attacks and oversleep at night.  \n\nAny advice would be appreciated ... I don’t want to cause conflict between her and I, or ruin this career opportunity, but I’ve recently had to take a month off of work because I was starting to have signs of depression and anxiety while working for her. I started having suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life, and often, which is just strange because I have always loved being alive even when things suck lol. Before this month break, my brother and friends have described me as having started to “lose my soul”. Now, I’ve had a ridiculous amount of time to get centered and I just need to fix the situation...\nI want this job, bad, to help my own family- and I know that I could be a competent lawyer of my own to eventually run the firm, but I’m having such a hard time coping each day around my boss:aunt with our personality types clashing. \n if you’ve read this far, thank you for reading my rant...and help please if you have advice for this Entp!
6	I'm not so sure if this is a personality clash or just a toxic relationship.  She's clearly lording this job and her position over you and manipulating you into wanting this job, which gives her more power to lord her position over you and manipulating you into wanting this job... the cycle continues.  If you are worth your salt and are a competent person, once you get your law degree you can find other firms to work in.  It sounds as if your aunt is not respecting your boundaries and is used to bullying people into getting what she wants.  I'm sorry that you're going through this.  This is tough.
3	Do you want this career opportunity, or do you feel obligated to your aunt? Have you stepped back and considered what you really want for yourself?\n\nEDIT: Basically your situation sounds intolerable and impossible to win. You should give this position over to an SJ or whatever, and get a job that really suits you and your personality. It's very sweet (or narcissistic) that your aunt wants to offer you this position, but it really sounds like she just has some vision in her head that has no room for your individuality and personhood.
2	Hey - I hope you don't mind me popping over here! I was creeping on your profile after our conversation on the other head re. ENTP legal careers.\n\nFirstly, I'm sorry your work situation is so awful. Your aunt sounds extremely difficult. I will say that lawyers, especially ESTJs, are *extremely* hierarchical. I don't know your aunt, but from what you've written here, my suspicion is that she is likely never going to give you the respect that you deserve while you're a "lowly" legal assistant. She will likely continue to lord her authority over you when you become a junior associate at the firm. If anything, she may be even ruder because she'll feel the need to keep your behaviour "in check" with what she believes to be correct for a lawyer. Lawyers are notoriously bitchy about policing one another's behaviours, trust me.\n\nHonestly, as a legal assistant with over 7 years of experience, you're probably a tremendous asset. I say this because pretty much every law firm has trouble finding good legal assistants - all the halfway decent ones don't stay for very long because they all end up going to law school/becoming lawyers (or pursuing some other traditionally "prestigious" track). Most firms are, in all honestly, constantly cycling through assistants, either because the good ones leave or because the bad ones get fired due to gross incompetency. Really, it's something lawyers constantly gripe about.  \n\nWhat I'm really getting at is that you probably have more leverage/bargaining power than you think. I know feel a certain amount of family loyalty, but... well, you can still be loyal to your family working a different job, or maybe just taking a break before you start law school. Yes, it's a great opportunity for you to be able to do substantive work at a law firm before going to law school, but... it's also a great opportunity for her to have a legal assistant who actually knows what they're doing.\n\nAs a fellow ENTP, I know we have more ~feelings~ than we're typically given credit for, but... I also know we're objective thinkers who don't shy away from a fight when necessary. My advice, honestly, is to stand your ground. You cannot simply be submissive and expect your aunt to treat you better. The more submissive you are, the more she will mistreat you, because she'll view you as being "okay" with that type of dickery from her. I've seen it in ESTJ lawyers. Honestly, the head legal assistant at the firm I work at (who has a ridiculous amount of power for whatever reason) is an ESTJ and she is significantly meaner the more you try to cater to her whims. \n\nTL;DR stop trying to please your aunt. Recognize the value that you add. Yes, she is your boss, but you likely have more power than you think. Besides, even if it goes poorly, you'll be going to law school soon anyway. If she gives you crap, just say "I'll take it under advisement" and go on with your work. You don't need to engage with her shenanigans.
1	This sounds like a harsh time. Could you tell me more about your situation? I don't have enough to go off of to give any great advice....
3	Is anything better than hope?	For fellow ENTP’s - is there a word or conception better than “hope”? \nTony Robbins states that hope is not as good as massive action - personally, I’ve always equated hope as something along the lines of faith. 
9	Love.
6	Hope is a 4 letter word. It is a lie we tell ourselves when we arent willing to take action\n\n
3	I suppose that hope and faith are pretty equal, but I don't see either as a place to focus your life. Don't really know who Tony is, or why I should care what some guy always says. If he's out there telling people how to live their lives then he doesn't sound worth my time.
3	Pope.
3	Nah, fuck Tony Robbins. He’s kind of the scum of the self help shit storm. 
2	A really gray plate of well-cooked pasta! Noms.
1	Yes.
1	Closure
3	Difficulties with ENFJs?	I used to know a girl who is an ENFJ, and for some reason, almost everything she did got on my nerves (which is actually a pretty hard thing to do).\n\nShe thought so highly of herself and believed that she had some sort of higher purpose in the world. She bragged and bragged about every little achievement as a way to hide her insecurities and flaws.\nOur friendship finally ended because I realized our constant arguing wasn’t exactly normal or healthy and stood my ground when I confronted her about it. She was expecting an apology for making her feel uncomfortable and I refused to give one to her, she cut off contact with myself and the rest of our mutual friend group not long after that.\n\n\n I’ve never really had such a negative experience with an MBTI type, and after this I’ve started noticing more of these traits in other ENFJs... Has anyone else had similar experiences with this type? If so, is there anything I could have done differently?\n
6	Being an ENFJ doesn’t stop you from being a shitty person, neither does any other mbti type\n\n
4	People brag when they feel insecure.  She was asking you to affirm her.  I have seen in a few xJs they resort to bragging when they are uncomfortable: "please tell me I measure up **objectively**".  They think of the world in primarily objective terms, and are less focused on judging self or others in any other way.  \n\nFor primarily subjective judgers (FiTe, TiFe) this can be grating as fuck.  They are asking you to accept their metric for how people "measure up" and then accept how they themselves measure up on that scale.  \n\nThis requires you to squash your own scale of meaning and value.  \n\nAnyways one of my closest friends is an enfj and I absolutely adore her.  She does this shit sometimes, but less and less over time.  I told her what I thought she was doing and why, and essentially that it was neither necessary or enjoyable.  She actually really appreciated it.  Ymmv.  \n\nWe all do really obnoxious shit.  The good people are constantly trying to keep a lid on theirs.  You didn't keep a lid on yours from the sounds of it.  You acted like your perspective was a truth that she had to swallow.  Neither of you are right about what matters or how to interact with people.  We are all just guessing.  \n\nSo even if she was annoying you could have been more compassionate and humble both.  \n\nBut I mean whatever I generally don't tolerate this shit from INTJs when they're doing their narcissistic thing.  You should enjoy thr company you keep ftmp
2	Most ENFJs I know: Attention-seeking, manipulative and fake af. They praise you one minute in front of youwhile treat you as a best friend and talk sh*t behind your back just to elevate themselves.\n\nI have yet to meet a decent ENFJ.\n\nEdit: You did the right thing OP, don’t give her the satisfaction.
1	Well the fact that she left the friend group over it really shows her immaturity. I would definitely say she's a low functioning person. Which is sad, but honestly sometimes people just have to make mistakes to learn from them. There was a guy like that in my friend group, except he was an ESTP. He caused a whole manner of problems until eventually his friendships broke down. Everyone found out we were better without him.\n\nYou did the right thing, not apologizing. People need to learn their place. What you are doing wrong is analyzing it with MBTI. It's a rabbit hole you don't want to go down, seeing people as their negative traits.\n\nEdit: I wouldn't let this effect how you see ENFJs. Maybe it's because I'm "talking" to one right now 😉, but they actually can be really cool people.
1	>She thought so highly of herself and believed that she had some sort of higher purpose in the world. She bragged and bragged about every little achievement as a way to hide her insecurities and flaws.\n\nENFJs crave recognition, the opinions others' hold of them is of utmost importance (primary Fe). They also see recognition as a fair price for their contribution to their relationships, be it with society or an individual.\n\n>She was expecting an apology for making her feel uncomfortable and I refused to give one to her, she cut off contact with myself and the rest of our mutual friend group not long after that.\n\nThis is the ENFJ version of the INFJ doorslam, they leave the door ajar, with a way for you to get into their good graces again (whether or not you deserve to be judged so harshly).\n\nIf she doesn't feel valued by you and the group, she won't feel the need to keep contact.\n\nIf it helps, she feels super guilty for creating this situation (you know this as she wouldn't make you apologise otherwise).\n\nIt's possible she actually liked you more than just a friend, since ENFJs don't usually argue, they would prefer to avoid conflict. They tend to argue only with people they care about, in fact the more they care about a person, the more likely they are to be argumentative. 
36	Commitment	So we are supposed to be REALLY bad at commitment. What does it take for an ENTP to commit? Have you committed to anything? Why?\n\nI read one theory stating that when ENTPs commit we commit 100% all the way and that’s that, which might explain why we are soooooo slow to commit to anything.
43	An otherwise rational person with a tendency to over analyze is only going to commit when absolutely certain. A person with high levels of passion will commit to their maximum. This leads to the behavior described and implies the requirements for commitment. 
24	In regards to commitment to people in relationships, I have to be 100% sure of their motivation, feelings and that of my own before hitting the commit button. When I do, you can be sure I'd always put the effort in to keep things strong.\n\n\nIn regards to goals and tasks, commitment requires an interest in the subject matter at hand, otherwise I really don't see the point spending my time and energy on it. Though if I'm forced to do it, I will end up using the ENTP power of doing an ungodly amount of work, in a short space of time. So I can get it over with, but still make it half decent and maintain a good degree of care in said work. Ish.\n\nWell that's what I'd like to think anyway 😅
9	In my situation, I am doing a PhD, which is a pretty long commitment. There are times when I feel like I am punishing myself for putting myself through this, but never did I once consider quitting. I guess that says something about my stubborn, illogical, passion-driven commitment. 
7	I'm fairly non committal. Except real friends, amd my offspring.\n
8	I can commit when I find more logical reasons to do so than to do otherwise.
8	I am in the Army and have committed myself to doing 20 years. \n\nAt first I believed I was only going to do just 8. I began to enjoy many aspects of becoming a career Soldier and also started to set long term goals that could be assisted by doing 20 years.  Now I'm passionate about what I do and look forward to seeing how much I'll accomplish at the end of my 20 years. \n\nI'd say at first it's difficult to commit because you would like to stay open to new possibilities. Once you learn it's great, there's no problem now building off that long term. \n\nEdit: to reference, I've done 9 years at the moment. I'm excited because I can't wait to see how the next 11 years will be after learning all I have and gaining the passion I have for the profession. 
6	A real portrait of me vs commitment: \n\n"THAT'S IT. I'M DOING IT. THIS TIME I'M ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND NO ONE CAN STOP ME"\n\n(3 seconds later)\n\n"... Why am I doing it, again?"\n\n&#x200B;
3	Do we struggle with commitment or do others find it too easy to commit?\n\n\nTo answer your question and avoid semantics, to me, it makes sense that it's more difficult for us to commit. For one, we value our freedom, or in other words, our time. We're only going to commit to something/someone that makes that time better spent. Another point, when you commit to a person, you're most likely limited to sex with one person - schedules need to match.\n\n\nAnother reason, we "overanalyze". Instead of having a feeling for someone/something and acting on it, we have to think about what we're feeling exactly, why, and if the feeling is worth acting on. Eg "Am I feeling happy with this girl because of who she is or what she is", "A witty, kind, intellectually stimulating person - a booty call? - someone that just makes me feel not alone?" And of course "will she and I grow together?"\n\n\nNext up - we aren't planners. We think about the future but we also have different probabilities for what can happen. At least for me, I don't have a plan for what age I'll be married or have kids. I don't care when I meet someone. It'll happen when it happens.\n\n\nSoooo when it comes to it, what we're committing to needs to be worth our time - which we find valuable because we have the most valuable time obviously.
1	It's so hard to stick to one thing. There's lot of stuffs that the world offers and sometimes.it feels like a waste of life if you just stick to one path. However, if I'm is interested to that path, my vision narrows down until every thought is consumed or revolved around it. Until it tire me out, and move to the next one XD
1	i don‘t really plan to commit to anything but i don‘t really care enough to stop doing sth either, for ex my major which is dislike and i still but not out of commitment but bc it‘s currently logical. i only know one thing im committed to and thats my dream/goal even tho i‘m kinda „we‘ll give our best and see how things work out“ kind of attitude idk
1	My experience proves that last statement. I'm fully committed to my relationship right now and I literally started with little to no commitment to it, but once I decided to commit, there was no looking back.
1	>So we are supposed to be REALLY bad at commitment.  \n\nWhy are we supposed to be bad at commitment, do you have any reasons for that, or did you read it somewhere on the internet, and if you did, what was the reasons for that statement?  \n\n>What does it take for an ENTP to commit?  \n\nToo vague and too general a question. It probably takes the same for an ENTP to commit that it takes for most other types. That they think there's more pro's to being together, than con's.  \n\nThen the pro's and con's are probably a little bit different on average based on the different types. For example ENTPs probably value "freedom" more because of Ne. Se would value that kind of freedom as well. Because they are exploratory and novelty seeking types. Compared to ISFJs and INFJs.  \n\n>Have you committed to anything? Why?\n\nI have committed to making you think, and ask you questions. Why? Because otherwise it is a useless post.  \n\n >I read one theory stating that when ENTPs commit we commit 100% all the way and that’s that  \n\nWhere did you read that, and what were the reasons for that conclusions?  \n\nI can't really see the value in just posting random statements, without an explanation for those statements. It's totally Te, giving a result, but with no need to understand how we arrived at that result, which Ti craves.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n
1	I think I’m committed as much as I will commit to someone lol. Marriage scares the bejesus out of me but I broke down the math. I have a 3% chance of having a high probability of liking someone. This should be lower as out of those 3% there’s gonna be things i don’t jive with. And the guy I’m with let’s me pick his personality apart Bc it’s what I’m interested in. \n\nNo one lets me do this. It’s fuckin great. \n\nSo while I toy around w the idea of getting out, I doubt anyone else I’m likely to meet will give me the support I’ve grown accustomed to nor will they let me tinker around in their brain. So when I weigh the pros and cons, I’m committed lol. He’s an exact opposite as me so ISFJ. And much better at looking “normal” to other ppl. 
1	I change my mind a lot, so commitment can be hard. I’ve found that if I can stay interested for more than 2 months I can usually commit, assuming I still feel strongly by the end of the 2 months. This applies to almost anything. Thinking about switching jobs? If I still want to in 2 months I’ll be gone. College? 2 months. Relationships? 2 months. 
1	Dated the same woman for twelve years and two kids before I decided to marry her. I can see where this stereotype comes from.
1	> So we are supposed to be REALLY bad at commitment. \n>w hen ENTPs commit we commit 100% all the way and that’s that \n\nSounds to me like being *pretty good* at commitment.\n\n\n\n
1	There are too many new and exciting things. When it comes to relationship commitment; Why can't you be with someone flexible then commit with that person to discover the world together. You will tolerate this version version of commitment. Commit to self growth, change, and new discovery. 
1	Committing is really, really hard until it isn't - or at least that's the way it worked for me. Career-wise, I still have a very difficult time following just one path, but that's because nothing has felt quite right so far. Relationships-wise, I was commitment-phobic for ages before I met my now -partner - but when I did, I really didn't have a moment's hesitation. I really can't explain why. It's not even that I "commit 100% all the way", because I actually don't. I guess this is antithetical, but other than my partner, I've always had one foot out the door for every boyfriend, friendship, job, sports league, etc. I'm always afraid of losing out on a more interesting opportunity.\n\nFunnily enough, my partner is an ISTJ, which is probably the single most stable type of all the MBTI. Maybe that was part of it - I met someone who made me feel incredibly comfortable, and who I knew could ground me. I apologize as that's probably not a very ENTP-y answer, to seek stability instead of "excitement". I can really only explain it as everything falling into place.
1	My fear of fearing commitment makes me commit to a cause i put my mind to. I have this fear because time and time again i keep seeing the almost magical results of commiting  to a cause
8	why exactly feedback from infj is so important for entp?	check that for entp https://static1.squarespace.com/static/559cedd1e4b0a6ed5cd6d57d/t/59c2468f37c5816512866ef7/1505908153328/Screen+Shot+2017-09-20+at+11.44.02.png?format=750w
4	Per jung we operate most optimally with our conscious and subconscious in balance.  \nFurther Jung said that the subconscious functions cannot be spoken to directly but must be accessed through the conscious mind.  That trying to speak to Fi in Fi ways (to an entp) will be resisted by both conscious and subconscious.  That to tlreach Fi you have to go through NeT, in a manner it can understand.  \n\nIf entps primarily use NeTi in their conscious minds, and those functions are [anchored in the subconscious](https://i0.wp.com/carljungdepthpsychologysite.blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7b155-1372bdiagram2b8.jpg?ssl=1)  with FeSi (most of the time) then one could argue we would be better balanced by ISFJs SiFeTiNe in terms of implementing practical decisions.  We should choose similar courses of action.  \n\nThat we would be better balanced by INFJs in navigating the abstract sphere of philosophy and ethics, where we should be well aligned with our heavy focus on abstraction and relatively balanced FeTi.  \n\nAnd that we should experience considerable consternation with most INTJs because they speak directly to our subconscious.  Basically they act out what we suppress in our subconscious, and vice versa.  The bits of our thinking our ego can't control, which exert themselves in often harmful ways, are said to arise from those constructs we refer to as the INTJ functions.  The gold standard is to get on flawlessly with our inner INTJ.  However the pathway there is perhaps equal parts speaking to latent FiTe with ENFPs, and NiSe with INFJs...  since there is a path through the conscious mind via Ne with ENFPs, and somewhat FeTi with INFJs (see diagram above).\n\nGiven that Te and Fi are somewhat accessible, a balanced healthy ENTP would likely grow healthier interacting with a balanced healthy INTJ/INFJ... however since both types are usually lame as fuck: I tend to hang out with ENFPs when I wanna hear some weird shit.  \n\n
1	Idk, can you?
6	Do you think exterior stimuli can influence how you use your functions?	A while ago I "thought I" realised I was an ENTP, rather than what I first believed I was, an INTP. I have always known I've been somewhat of an ambivert, however to what extent? How dies this play out with others? Regardless of type, do they look like another if pushed to their psychological limit "so to speak"?\n\nTo use myself as an example, since I am ultimately asking to figure myself out.. :\n\nI have noticed that if I am EXPECTED to be available for conversation by anyone for every second of the day I start loosing my shit. I posted earlier this week about some temper issues I'm having and I think these two might be related, however, not necessarily correlated (still working on it).\nHowever, for my point.. I noticed that in times of too little social stimuli I become hungry for it, as if I feel like I'm losing some part of myself. But if I have access to enough stimuli through a job as idk... a waitress, I find myself completely drained of the mundanity that is small talk. HOWEVER! Here is the kicker: if the conversations challenge me intellectually all energy is back, until I'm faced with my rather dull situation. (although, there we are back to specifics).\n\nI am too tired to be able to care enough to improve how I tried to convey this dilemma, however, I do wish you understood what I am asking. Please, talk about yourselves, I'm curious to see if anyone else has thought the same... And how many other people here that are way better than me at writing. 
3	I never really respond to any self-help mbti posts, but I recognise myself in this post.\n\n>. I have always known I've been somewhat of an ambivert, however to what extent?\n\nSame. I like being alone, I like being with others. They need to be in balance for me. If they are not I begin too feel like 'I'm not worth' or that I'm supposed to be doing something. While no one is telling or pushing me to do this. If anything is the opposite.\n\n>I am EXPECTED to be available for conversation by anyone for every second of the day\n\nThe sad reality of today. Everyone on their phones   checking useless stuff, scrolling mindlessly through their useless instagram. Very boring.\n\n>temper issues\n\nI can't stand people asking many questions that they could have done way more efficiently. Just ask what you want to ask and leave me alone. If this happens a lot on one day it might get too much. (rarely happens though)\n\n>But if I have access to enough stimuli through a job as idk... a waitress, I find myself completely drained of the mundanity that is small talk. HOWEVER! Here is the kicker: if the conversations challenge me intellectually all energy is back,\n\nExactly. I love talking, when I learn/gain something from it. However if that's not the case and I'm just wasting my time then it's very draining mentally.\n\n>I am too tired to be able to care enough to improve how I tried to convey this dilemma, however,\n\nBecause you already concluded that it isn't that big of a problem as you originally thought? Or because your nocturnal biorhythm is tingling.\n\n>I do wish you understood what I am asking.\n\nI know how this feels, at least if I think what you're thinking.\n\n>I'm curious to see if anyone else has thought the same...\n\nI'm actually surprised I recognise myself in someone on the Internet behaviour-wise and convinced me to post on something like this.
2	> I start loosing my shit  \n\nThere was a thread recently about a new type of fidget spinner that might help with that.  \n\nAnyways...  please repost with some cognitive function analysis per the DAE Barnum statement rule  
2	I would say that external stimuli can at least influence how they manifest—if not our personalities would be more uniform within a type. \n\nI think this would probably be most visible with the judging functions since that’s what we see readily. For example, I think Fe would be the most obvious since that’s based on an external group, so the exact form that takes would be influenced. However, maybe if you have Ti and are constantly criticized every time you look into details or pick apart a problem, maybe you would be less willing to at least show that externally or doubt your abilities to do so?\n\nAs for general extroversion / introversion, sure. I think when you’re overrun by stimuli it might make you retreat, and if missing you might be more willing to pursue it. Personally, in small groups I’m much more able to me extroverted as I’m not overwhelmed by everything going on where in big events I feel washed out by everything around me. \n\nThis might have went off on a different train that original expanded question, but it made me think of this aspect of it. 
2	Definitely think that other *types* affect my use of functions. I personally prefer to make friends with everyone and see who can handle my nonsense. \n\nWhen I'm with my INTP friend, he helps me think through problems and to really use Si to pull past experiences. \nMy ESTP friend helps me see things in an "is what it is" point of view, Se usage, I guess. \n\nSocial stimuli: Sure, that'd affect my use of my cognitive functions\n\nI have a theory that maybe self confidence has a major affect on our cognitive functions. I wouldn't have been able to talk out my ideas with my ISFP friend if I weren't confident in myself. \n\nMy Ne would go down the drain and my Fe would heighten, trying to figure out what's best for my friends and family rather than myself.\n\nI'd use my Si to beat myself up, reminding myself of the poor choices I've made, or opportunities I didn't take.\n\nMy Ti would take the largest hit because I would actually use what little Te I have to figure out what my friends and family think about my decision. \n\n
5	Other people's ego	Hi people of r/entp,\n\nI have a question for you, I met a new student in my year. From the get go I found out that he was a little insecure in general, a little anxious maybe but a smart lad with a good heart who I suspect is an ENFP. I have a hard time with ENFP's personally for some reason.\n\nMaybe it's because I'm an entp but I have a hard time dealing with other people's emotions so when they get in the way it's tough for me to make judicious decisions.\n\nI started socialising with him and he spent some time bragging about things he has done. So I listened to him and told him I thought that was pretty cool and such but he kept going on and on and on.\n\nAfter a while (a few days), I started changing conversation subjects but he kept insisting somewhat and at times during conversations I grew quiet for a lack of something to say because I didn't know how to make him stop without making things awkward.\n\nHe would then take little jabs at me, I guess as tests of some sort (for perceived weakness maybe ?), but as relentlessly as the bragging.\n\nThis pissed me off and I stopped talking to him because I grew tired of his awkwardness and slight narcissism.\n\nTurns out he ended up being a good lad but I was already in bad terms with him, I believe he considered me as one of the people who would be good friends with him during that year so even if it got better afterwards and he grew a little more confident and stable it was too late.\n\nI do see this kind of problem happening later in the work place, having good relationships with people is obviously one of the things that get you further in life. Pushing people away isn't a foolproof method, especially when you work in an organisation...\n\nI think I may also be at fault for not knowing how to deal with him in a mature way.\n\nHow do you personally deal with insecure people ?
11	>How do you deal with problems like this ?\n\nI deal with them by making a throwaway acct and posting to /r/relationships\n\nOr I tell close friends who know me best and who can advise me best on what to do.\n\nOr I tell a therapist so they can help me process why it bothers me.\n\nOne thing I don't do, however, is ask /r/ENTP.\n\nThat'll be $35, your next appt is in two weeks and will cost $50 a session from hereon out. \n\nThanks for stopping by Baron's Therapy Tavern. Happy to help, satisfaction not guaranteed. 
7	> he spent some time bragging about things he has done.  \n\n> he kept going on and on and on.\n\n> I started changing conversation subjects but he kept insisting somewhat\n\n> He would then take little jabs at me\n\n> as relentlessly as the bragging.\n\nA guy like this would have to undergo a radical transformation for me to want to be friends with him. He may have some redeeming traits, but I think your gut was correct. Don't feel guilty about not befriending him. :P
3	This type of situation is just one of many things that make me feel like a true ENTP yet also a hypocrite. As -P types, we should be adaptable, but these kind of moments where I notice I'd act cold or reluctant to meet certain people sounds very -J  type behavior.
2	[deleted]
3	I'm going to agree in part with GellasTheLeafy, but also assert that:\n\na.) Sounds like an INTJ you may have met - awkward and brilliant and both insecure and narcissistic in the same breath.\n\nb.) IF assertion 1 is correct, his way of relating to you was dis-interesting on your end, and usually works for him (all other types give kind golf claps, we ENTPs care little about WHAT you did, but would like to know the why and, if that's interesting, maybe the how...).  If meeting one in the future, cut through and ask "why questions" to break that plane.  Secondary response:  "glad you found joy in that.  i don't personally find it interesting."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe may have seen you as a potential friend - another innately inquisitive and intelligent thinker.  I have found that the INTJs in my life (all men, btw) identify me as fun and witty but we mismatch on intensity.  I'm curious and by the time I've figured you out a bit I'm bored, and by that time they feel understood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
5	What are you most afraid of?	I saw this post on r/entj and most of the responses seemed to be centered around not being needed or disappointing people. I wonder what keeps us awake at night.\n\nFor me the scariest thing I can think of is to lose my freedom. Like to be captured or enslaved, or even enslaved in plain sight would be unbearable (like if the cartel told me to keep working or they'd kill my family). The idea of losing my autonomy keeps me up at night, especially with all the one-world, silicon valley bullshit that's going on these days.
11	I reckon it's failure for me. I hate failing things with a passion, and letting others down falls into that regard. \n\nThen again, spiders are pretty damn freaky 
9	feeling dumb and incompetent
6	Missing the bigger picture or simply deluding myself by using false internal logic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, unfathomably huge, shady-looking man-made structures:\n\n[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/H%C3%B6gdalsreservoaren\_2011.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/H%C3%B6gdalsreservoaren_2011.jpg)
4	Rejection, being incompetent, being unknowing of something I should have known by now, failure. 
5	Having potential snatched from me.\n\nIt's one thing to sit on the couch and waste it away, and another to finally want to genuinely do something to better myself but can't.\n\nThink training for a high-profile race, having a real chance at winning, then hurting your leg badly two days before.
4	I’m most afraid of failing to avoid the 8 to 6 because I’m not competent enough to secure a different path. And then I’m stuck at a job where I’m miserable, following certain pointlessly inefficient rules out of tradition, or finishing my work early but having to pretend to be busy because I’m on the clock. Stuck in traffic that could have been avoided with more flexible hours that let me out an hour earlier. Then too physically and mentally fatigued to do the very things one needs to do to for ideal physical/mental health, like prepare healthy food, exercise, read/practice self-improvement, hobbies, socializing/dating. Essentially working to pay for a place to crash so the process repeats the next day.\n\nAnd this leads to loneliness. Being around close friends is the most important thing to me. It’s hard enough to find people I genuinely click with. To some extent it’s a numbers game and a bit of chance and it gets even worse in adulthood as people have careers, families, stress/fatigue, etc to deal with. I can count on one hand the people I’ve legit clicked with and became close friends with, out of a few hundred acquaintances, during college (social easy mode). In a 2014 survey that asked how many close friends people felt they had, the most common answer was 0, in contrast to 3 or 4 back in the 80s. I also can’t socialize for shit when fatigued from things like work (my desire to do it and my skills are absolutely merked).\n\nSo that’s my fear. A life that makes me unhappy (because of a stupid and outdated system), while keeping me broken down enough that it’s too difficult to do what I need to be happy. A reality countless people face so why should I be any different? I’m keeping expenses very low for now (I pretty much never buy anything) and reading 1 - 2 books a week while I can to try and find a path and build a skillset. Working remotely is the gold standard, but even one of those Euro 4 on/3 off schedules would be the bees knees. 
3	Loosing my freedom, commitment, being hurt emotionally, and of course: wasps 
3	Death. I can fight most everything else; if I feel I'm losing my freedom, I can fight for it. If I feel I'm failing, I can try, try again. If I feel stupid, I can try to learn. But health, and specifically the end, is completely out of my control. Accidents happen. Bodies decay. And I'm still quite young, but death is the thing that truly makes me scared.\n\nThat, and bees.
2	Lobotomies, brain damage, memory loss, dementia, psychosis.\n\nBasically, losing my mind.\n\nI have a strong ego (in the psychological sense, not like in the conceit sense), I think. My identity, who I am, my opinions, my how I think and how I perceive myself are things I probably hold way stronger to than I should.\n\nThings like brain damage scare the ever living fuck out of me, because it forces me to acknowledge that many things about me, such as my beliefs, how I process information, my likes and dislikes are just dependent on some squishy thing inside my head. Someone could go in there and mess with a few wires and I could literally have a different personality. I could become a moron. It makes me wonder what actually makes me *me* , and like not just a robot or something.
1	Probably failure- I hate feeling incompetent or like I wasted potential. \n\nExamples would be, my friend needs help with something and I try to help but it fails lol or like another commenter said, training for a high profile race and then breaking legs.\n\nIt's not that failure makes me insecure tho lmao I shake it off pretty well, but I hate it with a passion.\n\nAlso on a more trivial note, paralysis + braindamage \n\nI hate the thought of being helpless or not who I was/just dumb tbh.
1	Used to be idea or solution looks or sounds dumb infront of others, though learned to accept flaws through time. 
1	Being inferior
1	I think what terrifies me is the notion of spending a significant portion of my life believing in something that's not true and falling prey to that -- possessing false beliefs I'm strongly convicted in and a lack of acquaintance with truth and reality in other words. I think I would also be absolutely horrified if I realised I've been deluding myself. I'm also afraid of not having control over myself, that one's a bit complicated and deep-rooted.
1	Specifically the lack of control or freedom - that’s probably what manifests my intense fear of the ocean. Just, all that water and not being able to even touch or see the bottom, terrifying.\nNot a fear exactly but I also hate not knowing things, and hell if I know what’s lurking in the deeps.
1	Failure and feeling inadequate. \n\nI don't know whether it is my personality (as one of you guys) or my mild diagnosed ADHD but I keep hopping from topics and careers. This makes me lose interest in things and half-assing things.\n\n\nDoing a complete 180 on my career and going from finance to development. I know I have the brains to do it, i just lack the drive and sometimes the motivation. I am teaching myself to say fuck motivation and become disciplined. It's crazy to think I thought I was the only one with this kind of mindset but I realized there are SO many of other people who are ENTP's and are so much like me, speicifically calling themselves Jack of all trades and master of none. I want to at least become a master of one, so my plan is to dedicate my time into getting REALLY good at this one thing and to absolutely own 2019.\n\nBest of luck to all!
1	Rejection and failure are good ones. Feeling powerless though is just damming. 
1	Being able to present logical arguments on how things can be done more efficiently and being ignored\n\nNothing drives me more of the wall then confronting people with why I am right with cited sourced and logically consistent argument and being told no we will just keep doing things the way we are \n\nBecause when people chose to Ignore fact based argument and logic I lose a massive amount of respect for them and can't work as well with them

3	What type online, casino, group of gambling buddies?
3	You've done very well to beat the odds there. I used to play online poker but it's all so filled with bots these days I just don't bother. Still play poker with mates irl all the time though.
11	Why do we have such a low subscriber count compared to other N types?	With the exception of ENTJ which only had 6k plus, INTJ, INTP, ENFP, INFP, INFJ have us beat by 2 or 3 times.  \n\nEven on YouTube, ENTP videos get much lower views than all the others mentioned above.  I am  glad C.S. Joseph’s channel is starting to take off since he is one of the only influential ENTPs on the platform right now.  \n\nHowever I know a lot of people on this sub don’t care for him.  Anyways just interesting how our xNTP counterpart is #1 when it comes to subscriber count and INTP videos on YouTube get the most views.  
11	[deleted]
10	[We don’t, we are 6 out of 16, and there is a pretty big drop off after position 7](https://imgur.com/a/RFhISYz)
9	Because we don't actually exist. \n\nEveryone knows that. Next question. 
11	Because after a while people get tired of reading questions by moody awkward teenagers and unsubscribe.  
5	I always thought we were a small sub because the personality type is one of the rarer ones, together with a little dash of all the mistyped edgy teens that comes over here and spread their angst. 
3	I'm surprised that no one hit on the fact that we (don't come to bum rush me here) aren't exactly KNOWN for being interested in the same thing over long periods of time.  I'm an ENTP woman married to an INTP guy.  I get my N interaction with him or with colleagues, so I don't really feel the need to lurk around online checking out comments.  I get it in the "outside world".  And tbh, all of the "static" parts of my life are enough of the "same old thing" for me anyway.  I'd rather be out tinkering and doing and watching, not sitting on forums (notice, not a big poster on Reddit).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlus, don't we all like a challenge?  Where is the challenge in all of us and our similarities? SO much more fun to spark debate with "the others".  \n\n&#x200B;
3	Probably because ENTPs are "rare" but not rare enough to be special? Plus, as another comment said INFJ and INTJ seem like the "I want to be like that" type but why would any normal human being want to be like us lol
2	Because ENTPs are weird and already maxed out their sub count so for this subreddit, they've just mentally bookmarked to check it several times a day
2	Because we are the superior personality and it's hard to come by people as smart as us. 
2	Extroverted = less likely to be posting on internet at any given time (more likely to be interacting with real world)\n\nPerceiving = Not as likely to stay and discuss a topic for any decent amount of time.\n\nYou'll note that sensors are massively behind because they get very little stimulation from discussing ideas with people. My absolute best friend IRL is an ESFP, can't imagine him ever wanting to talk about anything with strangers on the internet.
1	>ISTJ, ENTP, ENFP, ISFP, INFP\n\nftfy
1	Low focus and bored to continues same thing. 
0	Mostly because Entps come to places like this quickly examine it and take whatever theyre looking for and move on, on to their next curiosity streak or intellectual pursuit without giving much seconds thougs about this.\n\nThats why a lot of users here have a lot of activity then leave reddit all together, vs intps who get acounts with over 10k messages in a short spawn of time like 2 years, Entps ar way more disperse to do something like that.
34	Best/worst boss for an ENTP?	What MBTI types have you found to make the best/worst bosses for an ENTP?\n\nSo far for me: \n\nWorst: ESTJ, control-freak and micromanager, could not envision other solutions besides the ones she dictated, very much into hierarchy\n\nBest: ENFJ, supportive and open-minded, willing to consider other ideas and very trusting, able to keep me on track with my work. Also one of the kindest people I have ever met, she was my manager for only 3 months (I was a summer intern), and the day I left she baked me a cake!
16	ENTP here and I don't mind ESTJs; they are very predictable.\n\nThey can be quite good at motivating the ENTP to do things; and normally appreciate the ENTPs amazing intuition (even if they can't admit it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find ESFPs a bit frustrating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
12	My last 3 bosses have been ISxJ and they have been awful for an ENxP. They're micromanagers. They're rule crazy. Speculation freaks them out. Change freaks them out. They are immune to feedback because they already know everything. Their goal is to see each hamster on its wheel, endlessly. They value rote bullshit infinitely above ingenuity. \n\n\nLuckily, our time together doesn't last. I'm a product owner and I build new things in spite of the ISxJ. I will say, they're good people with plenty of integrity though. 
8	My boss has a lot of ESTJ qualities, the guy an absolute cunt \n\nI spend half my time arguing with him over the phone
4	Pretty much agree with ESTJ/ENFJ.\n\nESTJ would definitely be the worst. I didn't even have to think about that.\n\nENFJ would be great because we'd likely to get along, but they'd still keep me on task and would be really encouraging. I don't think I've ever had an ENFJ boss, though.\n\nMy favorite bosses I've actually had/have are INFP, ESTP, and INFJ. My least was an ENFP. I love ENFPs as friends, but as a boss, he was so sensitive over every little damn thing and I think I hurt his feelings lmao. Didn't even bother to fire me, because I think he was too scared of confrontation. He just stopped scheduling me after awhile and I took the hint.
3	Best: None\n\nWorst: Any
3	My manager is an ESFP and it’s pretty much everything I dislike. Extremely petty, power trips (will be contrarian just to swing his dick, even if it means supporting a dumb idea), delicate ego, loves authority, not that clever. Pretty much everything I’d categorise as weak and small.\n\nHis boss, is an ENFJ and he is basically the perfect leader. And not just for me, the entire department of 10 or so people feel that way
4	ESFJ.\nHands down.
2	ENFJ was the best boss I ever had as well. Worked for her for 2 years, and she’s continued to mentor me in the 2 years since I left. Remarkable human, I aspire to be just like her when I “grow up”. \n\nThe worst whose type I know was INFJ. I’m not sure that the type is accurate, but that is what she claimed. \n\nCynical, bitter, untrusting, controlling. She was funny and quirky and encouraging too, but those other things really masked the enjoyable parts. 
2	I think I'm the only one here who likes an INFP boss, but that may because they're easier to control ;)\n\nAgreed that ENFJs are just awesome overall, although I've never actually had an ENFJ boss.
1	(For context I’m a software dev at Automated Data Processing)\n\nI like both my bosses. My immediate boss, the project manager for the team I am working with, is ENTJ. Great programmer, and is great at delegating tasks to each of us based on his understanding of how we think. Always prepared for meetings and scrums too.\n\nOur team’s HR rep (ISFJ) is technically our boss as well, and she is great at checking up on us and making sure our basic needs as employees are met. Tbh kinda hard to hold a conversation with her beyond surface level, but she does her job well.\n\nOverall, I really do think it depends less on mbti typing as a direct factor and more on the overall mental health of the person and how well their personality and qualifications fit the role they are supposed to fill as your leader.
1	<3 ENFJ's\n\na great example of a developed enfj is Joseph Lee from [This Jungian Life](http://www.thisjungianlife.com/)
1	Dont know about worst, but the best person Ive had in charge of me (kinda as acting manger) was an ESTP. He's very chill and I vibe with him well. Also he just uses gen Z type language all the time and? Have you ever had the guy in charge say Yeet before?????? I have, and it was most excellent. Every time we're about to do our tasks he says Lets Get This Bread and its horribly funny. He's always just like DUDE YOURE SO AWESOME IM PROUD OF YOU and yeah, best guy to have in charge ever. He's actually super practical and logical, and great at prioritizing despite how silly he seems. He's just lots of fun and he's pretty positive. One moment he's excellent with customers and giving sound direction, and the next he's joking about getting a sugar mommy or driving the forklift way too fast, it keeps things interesting.
1	I don't know... but I'm on a team now with ALL sensors and the ESTJ is the LEAST infuriating. We see eye-to-eye on the need for strategy, efficiency, decisions based on logic and not momentary whims, and have a low threshold for tasks that are meaningless and don't add to any plan. She likes to shoot down ideas a lot, though, and can be very here-and-now focused. \n\nMy boss is an Introvert - and that's where my certainty ends. I thought she was an ISTJ, but she is so indecisive and so inefficient, evasive, and passive-aggressive I'm not sure what she is. Anyway, whatever it is she's not my idea work partner. She has a strong vision/point of view when she's speaking, but then she'll do something that contradicts her previous statements completely. The effect is I don't know what she wants, and I'm pretty sure she doesn't know what she wants... She can be quite strict, though, and obsessed with appearances. So... whatever she is not a great boss for me. \n\nI absolutely can't stand working with ESFPs. They're super paranoid and into how things look. They have no idea how to brainstorm. No idea how to apply logic or problem solve. I had an ESFP colleague who bedazzled EVERYTHING. We'd ask her to make an agenda for a meeting, and it would come back COVERED in clip art of flowers. WTF? Her wall at work was covered in these horrible inspirational quotes with dramatic photos of sunsets. She was constantly texting me photos of herself (we're both straight women, so don't get any ideas, lads!). But not only that, every ESFP I've worked with has been weirdly convinced that people are way more focused on them than they actually are. Like, they think people are overly concerned with how they dress, etc. And I get uncomfortable around those types of people because, from my experience, those who think everyone is super invested in them in a judgmental way are often themselves judgmental, and I find ESFPs tend to be a little gossipy. \n\nBy far, my favorite two bosses were an ESTP and an ENFP. My INTJ colleague and I also got along splendidly.\n\nAnyway, these are my thoughts. Never work on a team of all sensors, guys! It's rough.  
1	Got along really well with the ESTJ boss contrary to what others have said. Also had the pleasure of working with ENTP boss and ENFJ bosses.\n\nI think it would be much more annoying to have an ESTP manager.
1	As long as it's not the toxic ENFJ that sees you as competition.\n\nDon't mind ESTJs, you just have to have some humility so they don't feel the need to give you some. \n\nCan we all move on to the Big 5 now? 
1	ISTJ boss drives me up the wall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nENFJs are great.  I also have decent rapport with INTJs.
5	I before E?	I usually test as an INTP but I started reading into ENTP and I relate a lot. I would say as an adult, I'm pretty introverted and experience social awkwardness but maybe its just being too self conscious or anxiety//depression or not caring about things that I don't find logical? I was def more extroverted as a child but I can hang in conversation usually and am pretty quick witted when I don't care about or feel like I'm being judged. \n\nI dunno. I've had wine and am feelin some type of way about life. 
11	Except after c. (Go occupy your mind with something other than yourself.)
3	Being extroverted or introverted has to do with stimuly, introverts ar ok in low stimuly ambients like 1 on 1 conversations, sitting on a coffe shop with friends, playing vidya with a close group of friends, extroverts need more stimuly than that.\n\nIntroverts can be quite social towards a small group of close friends, and even be outgoing and speak n public(introvert artist for example) introverts dont necesarily need to be alone in solitude in their rooms to be introverts.\n\nThe usual explanations like this one:\n\n Would you rather be around people that you like for an extended period of time and then spend some time alone or would you rather be alone for an extended period of time and then go visit people that you like? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nar bullshit.For too many reasons to list here.\n\n[http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130717-what-makes-someone-an-extrovert](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130717-what-makes-someone-an-extrovert)\n\n#  Eysenck's theory was that extroverts have just a slightly lower basic rate of arousal. The effect is that they need to work a little harder to get themselves up to the level others find normal and pleasant without doing anything. Hence the need for company, seeking out novel experiences and risks. Conversely, highly introverted individuals find themselves overstimulated by things others might find merely pleasantly exciting or engaging. Hence they seek out quiet conversations about important topics, solitary pursuits and predictable environments. \n\n# \n\nThis low level of arousal about everything is the key factor of our Ne scapism and also of our boredoom.\n\nThis doesnt mean necesarily that we will be emotionally needy extroverts as Esfjs ar, were not extroverts because were afraid of being alone, were bored of things most Intps enjoy freely.And most people will never understand how we can be so bored of everything is an existencial boredoom,a dread that introverts simply cant understand theres nothing pleasant about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost people misstype because they get on a test 54% introversion or extroversion and they think it means theyre on an ambiverted spectrum but reality is that the test is just 54% sure of that dichotomy.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Would you rather be around people that you like for an extended period of time and then spend some time alone or would you rather be alone for an extended period of time and then go visit people that you like? \n\nThat’s generally the line between being an introvert and an extrovert and it eliminates the issue of social awkwardness. \n\nFor example Sure going to parties is cool but not liking parties doesn’t mean you aren’t an extrovert just like enjoying parties doesn’t mean you are an introvert.\n\n\n\n\n
6	The Art of Tossing Word Salad: A Look into the Blandness of a FiTe Argument	
3	I think he’s fine. Just like everything else, pick out the shit that makes sense and toss what doesn’t. 
5	How do I cite this?
3	In this educational site, Mr. Jordan Peterson teaches us how to string together a series of large, unseasoned words in order to make it seem like you know a lot - when in actuality you know very little on the subject you're speaking of.\n\nAs this applies to FiTe: Fi doesn't perform consistency checks well so there's a lot of faulty reasoning that gets supported by Te. So, in order to really seal in an argument (*no matter how nonsensical*) sometimes FiTe tries to knock you down with a large vocabulary that mostly boils down to a salad without the lettuce. 
28	People have better reaction times around robots - especially "mean" ones	
11	So next time you need to concentrate on something just program your robo bff to "mean" :)
6	This will come in handy for all those robots I meet in my day-to-day life
5	Well I come off as a robot and definitely am mean. Does that count?
1	Can someone summarize what the article says because I'm too lazy to read it all? Mainly, what experiments did they use to assess that, and what are some examples of mean robots that they considered.
5	What type are your parents and how do you think it shaped you?	I have an ESFJ father and ISFJ mother and I think it helped develop my Fe and Si somewhat. Also I think having two super “J” parents makes me more structured when I’m on my own. I’m curious how everyone’s parents have shaped them and what they think of you... mine think I’m a nutcase lol
3	I’ve got an ESFP dad and an ISFJ mom. Dad was always really encouraging to try new things and find what I like to do, however, he wasn’t around much as he was in the military. Didn’t have the healthiest relationship with my mom tbh; she has a tendency to be kind of cold (Si-Ti loop I believe) and never told me “why” I had to do things, just that she said so and I don’t need a reason. Needless to say I’m pretty open with my dad now but my mom I just try and love from afar.\n\nOverall I’d say my Ne kind of over-compensated for my mom’s severe lacking of it and heavily-accentuated Si. I don’t do schedules or routine for the most part now because I grew up in a highly restrictive and regimented home (mom made the rules, and there was a rule for everything). Idk, I wish I was more organized sometimes but then again my memory associates organization and schedules with my very strict childhood, and I get along just fine without them. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3	Mom is ESFJ, Dad is INTP, sister is ENFJ, and I'm ENTP. My mom was the 'enforcer' in the household and helped me develop good habits and routines that otherwise would not have come naturally. I was close with my mom, but my sister and her definitely 'click' better.My dad and I were much closer, especially when compared to my sister - the two of them have never really understood one another and it caused a lot of tension between them while we were growing up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I was young, I remember having a million questions for my dad, and he always loved answering them - or working with me on how to answer them if he didn't. He helped instill a sense of curiosity and desire for understanding that has been incredibly useful for me so far in life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that I'm older (mid 20s) the dynamic in our family has shifted a lot, and I've taken on a bit of a mediators role between my sister and dad. The last 5 or so years they were really distant and I know my sister held a lot for resentment for our dad because she felt like he never 'liked' her as much as he did me. When I learned about Myers Briggs a couple years back I used the typing to help my sister understand why her and my dad had such a difficult time connecting, and it's pretty awesome to see them become closer after so long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mom was always an incredible organizer/leader, and I think one of the things she loves about my dad the most after 35 years of marriage is that she still doesn't totally understand him. When it came to bridging the gap between him and my sister though, it made things difficult. Thankfully she endowed me with some of her leadership ability so I could help improve a situation in our family where I was uniquely qualified. It's weird to say this, but it's one of my proudest accomplishments and I'm incredibly thankful to have had awesomely different types of parents.
2	My dad is an INTJ and my mom is an ESFJ. My mom was always trying to find solutions for me and my dad when we would butt heads when I was younger (which was frequent.) Nowadays she does it from time to time, but my dad seems to respect my viewpoint a bit more. He listens to what i say instead of just assuming his way is best and that’s final. It was fairly rough from 13-18 though...calmed down a bit after that, and now (at 25) it’s pretty much chill. My mom and I have just always been chill, no butting or anything.  I think my mom’s lenience unfortunately allowed me to continue in rebellion, which lended to me lacking discipline, and my father’s one way or the highway mentality left a bad taste in my mouth and when I see that shit in positions of authority i tend to call that shit out... 
2	Dad is ENTP, mom is ISTJ.  They are miserable together, always have been.  I drive my mother nuts.  We’re finally getting along better now that I’m in my 30s.  My dad and I also aren’t overly close, though much more so now.  He was busy not hanging out at home with my stick in the mud mom but drinking and talking with friends - hell he still does that most mights.  She was really depressed and didn’t want to deal with it so everyone else had to.  Being rigid was how she coped - just stuck to her routine, lived vicariously through TV, refused to step out of her box and have any fun, hated having my friends over.  I wish I had not resisted my mom’s Si lessons as a kid but I tried to push away everything because I wanted to be nothing like her. Looking back I could have resisted just a little bit less but I was so unhappy living with her.  I felt compelled to live out loud, and that has been both fun and also quite troublesome.  I have shot myself repeatedly in the foot with my decisions to resist learning lessons.  It’s been really hard to get into a routine which is frustrating as an adult with kids and a full time job.  I think my function development has been all over the place and my environment growing up is partly the cause.  Wish I had known about personality types and cognitive functions then.
2	I'm an ENTP female.  Dad is an ISTJ who fancies himself an ENTJ, and mom is an INFJ.  I am mid-thirties, marries to an INTP (it's pertinent info, I promise):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing raised by two Js was both stressful in some ways (I always felt rushed or like I "wasn't with the program") but has benefited me greatly in that I am able to easily step into J functions when needed (like in my marriage - shit's gotta get done!).  I am close with my mom and can appreciate where some situations need me to use feeling (I'm a mom myself now), though i by and large tire of people's feelings and their needs to express them.  
1	I have an ISFP dad and had an INFP mom (died when I was 16).  \n\nI was the odd one out in my family being the only one who was spacey and nuts. Both my parents are/were very sensitive and I had to grow up learning how to tiptoe around people's sensitivities.  This has led me to not be as obnoxious and offensive as I am in my head.  I am very good at keeping peace between people too.  \n\nI am the only one in my family with Ti and Fe as well.  My family is not very good with realizing how they are interacting with other people or coming off to others.  I can't count how many times I have been stunned at how "insensitive" they are to others because they have no clue how other people are interpreting their actions.  It is also hard being a subjective thinker rather than an objective thinker (all my family members have Te).  \n\nHaving an INFP mom was hard because she had a different idolized image of who she wanted me to be in her head and got cold and ignored me when I didn't act like an INFP (who she wanted me to act like).  I have issues with self love and self acceptance because of this.  I also am getting over having to conform to other's expectations of who they think I should be.  After my mom died, I went through a sort of existential crisis because I was finally discovering my true personality and the parts of me I had hidden away and denied in myself.  I acted like an INFP before but it felt horrible.  I had even denied feeling any of my emotions and had to undo 16 years of pushing everything down.  That was hard.  I also had to learn how to "allow" instead of fighting everything that life threw at me.  \n\nI have no idea what my mom would think of me.  The daughter who she loved is not the person who I am.  I do not know if she would accept me if she knew me now or reject me and not love me like she did when she was alive and I didn't act like the person she thought I was.  That is something that I struggle with and it is quite painful to live with.  \n\nMy dad doesn't have an issue with me.  He is much too stuck in his own world to even disapprove of my personality unless it somehow manages to cause an issue for him.  He is pretty accepting of who I am and has never tried to change me.  I know that when he *does* notice me that he loves me.  
4	Jungian stuffs	
7	Which types are most compatible with us?	I’ve seen many different opinions online about our “ideal match” or whatever. And I know it ultimately comes down to personal preference. At the same time I find it interesting to sort of see which types are typically considered compatible and why. For instance, I have had mostly ENFP friends that I get along great with, we get into lots of trouble and have interesting conversations, but I’ve never been interested romantically. I’ve had an INFJ friend but honestly we can tend to butt heads a little bit...she has a very strong inner sense of morality that I find a bit rigid and confining. \n  Honestly, mature ISFP’s are very attractive to me.....and I don’t know why? And they’re not listed as our “ideal match”. INFPs are good too. I have an INTJ mother and I....don’t think I would want one as a partner....jus saying. \n
15	>I’ve seen many different opinions online about our “ideal match” or whatever\n\nThe only opinion on the issue that matters is that "ideal matches" are a bullshit concept.
9	Fun fact: We ENTPs are one of the only types that match up well with other people of the same type.
5	I'm surrounded by about nine INFPs and three ENFPs so for me it is XNFPs.  I know one INFJ and a few INTJs though too.  \n\nRomantically, I have only been interested in INFP though.  My boyfriend is one and we get along really well.  
3	Im dating an INFP and I think thats my preferred type. Dont like INFJs. \n\nESTPs are really sexy to me though. Never ever ever want to date one, but theyre Hot Stuff. \n\nI feel like least Ideal would be any TJ or SF. dont know why INTJ is usually seen as an ideal? 
3	There are so many different ways of defining compatibility.\n\nAs far as friends and acquaintances go, I think I must be drawn to other NTs given how many there are in my social and professional circles.\n\nThat being said, I'm in a relationship with an ISTJ. I like him particularly *for* his ISTJ traits - he has his feet on the ground when my head's in the clouds. It's nice.\n\nI also am not sure I've ever interacted with an xSFP, or even ISFJ, for an extended period. Almost zero idea what those types are like.
2	First, our MBTI and our values are 2 different things, so finding someone of a certain "type" won't pan out if they don't share values with you of if their values are abhorrent to you (or vice versa).\n\nSecond, and this may vary wildly from person to person, as a heterosexual ENTP female, I already feel in the minority.  Most women are feelers, and I simply am....not.  Previous boyfriends have found that disconcerting and/or I have found them emotionally needy.  What I am saying is that the gender stereotypes you are used to may also contribute to your compatibility.  If you are a heterosexual ENTP male, you may not find a feelings-driven woman a turn off.  As a heterosexual ENTP female, I do (find feelings-y-ness a turnoff in my men).\n\nThat being said, I'm with an INTP.  I don't think that I could have made it work with an SF or ST.  I want to connect on a higher level and many of my best girl friends are SF types, which is fine for friendship but annoying for an intimate partner.  i have had success bonding with ENTJ, INTP and INTJ types.  Basically NTs; we jive.
1	ISFP is your “enemy type”. You may be attracted to their good look, intrigued by their boisterousness. \n3rd place: Another ENTP\n2nd place: INFJ (best for communicating!)\n1st place: ISFJ is your dual! 
1	The entp can work with just about any type.\n\nI prefer isfj, infj, enfj in that order.\n\nFor sex, esfp, enfj,isfj istj in that order.
1	Intp are best as a friend and sharing ideas. It feels great to be validated and giving space.
1	I think it might just be me but it seems that ENFJs and INFPs make up my little posse, I think they suck sometimes but they just like me I guess, my most favored friend was a INFJ who had a conveintly placed INTJ freind, but we lost contact out of time I guess
1	I mean, apparently INFJ and INTJ are the most compatible but at the end of the day it's personal preference and thus bullshit to say one type is compatible with the other lol. But many others have said that already, so thats old news. \n\nINTJs... my best friend for over a decade now is an INTJ and we get along great and did so from the very beginning. Most of my romantic partners were INTjs too but I've come to the realization that I probably only work well with them when it's kept platonic. \n\nINFJs I dunno, I keep on talking and overwhelming them lol, met a very few but it never turned into anything close to a friendship really. \n\nPersonally my closest friends are INTJ, ENFP, INFP and ISFJ in that order. So yeah... 
1	Generally most intuitive types, particularly NT. I somehow jive with ESTPS too, they are smarter than they appear, fun, and get me out of my head. They also have TiFe, so conversations are not alien.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLeast compatible in order from greatest to least: ESTJ, ISFP, ESFP, ISFJ, ESFJ, ISTJ.\n\nI also clash with ENFPS and INFPS on occasion. That pesky Fi.
4	How do you feel about the simultaneous rise of AI and highly functional robotics?	Who is taking bets on robotic soldiers within the next 20 years?
6	I LOVE IT.  I’m starting to learn about machine learning and it’s absolutely fascinating.  It is honestly so fucking interesting that a machine can learn to use specific algorithms with training.  I’ve been teaching myself coding and I hope I can turn my raspberry pi into a cleanup robot for my dorm room.

1	we‘re basically slowly preparing our own end. we‘re slowly moving towards a worlds where the gap between rich and poor will be even bigger. rich countries that can afford this technology will be even more advanced, poor countries will be left way more behind. at one point AI will get too smart and out of control, once they know how to produce their own kind and manipulate their softwares themselves it‘s over for us. \n\noh and war wise i bet on drones. there are little flying robots who can identify people. imagine sending 40 of these out and just eliminating soldiers one after another. also you cannot shoot them off, they have some functions that makes them avoid snipers or so idek, some guy introduced it on TED but he never mentioned using these as weapons, once they modify it it‘s over. especially for poor countries\n\nmy opinion on AI and human robotics is fuck everyone who is working on our own end rn\n\nalso i know that they have no choice but to get advanced in that section, as the enemy never sleeps, one has no choice but to keep up with it but still it‘s fuck them and especially FUCK AI

1	I'll take that bet on the no side.  You can even pick you own odds.

1	Optimistic.\n\nThe Skynet type worst case scenarios will probably be further off than the more beneficial side of things and I won’t be around for it. If I am, I die in a badass way.\n\nAs for the optimistic side, a lot of humanity’s problems will be hard to solve for as long as we are billions of people bottlenecked by our innate cognitive biases. It’s hard to override evolution. AI/advanced algorithms can and will do a lot of that shit well. And while I expect it to get really ugly before it gets better, I’m hopeful for automation reaching such a point that UBI is a must and that our outdated work culture is revamped so we can finally have the free time to match our technological increases in productivity. 
1	I'm really currious what will happen when(probably not long after we actualy develop one) - AGI  is smart enough to ask existential questions.
3	What are your favourite news sources?	In such an over-saturated place as the internet, it is often hard to find those who actually produce unbiased or at least factually true articles that can be used for proper education on different subjects.\n\nAs an ENTP I love seeing all the sides and knowing all the arguments as that is what can most efficiently ensure a discussion ending up in my favour.\n\nSo again my question what do you use (in any field or specified topic that is)? \n\n

37	ENTPs are stereotyped as being very sexually adventurous, but is that accurate?	I wonder if the stereotype of ENTPs being sexually adventurous is another one of those mistyped ESTP traits. At least with the ENTPs I know, their views on sexuality are influenced heavily by the society they were raised in. The more conservative their culture, the more conservative they are. I believe this is because ENTPs' values are Fe-Si heavy. In direct contrast, the ESTPs I know are very sexually liberal even if it goes against their culture.\n\nSo while ENTPs CAN have more liberal views on sex, they are more likely to have their values influenced heavily by their culture (at least based on my personal experiences) than ESTPs. Therefore, I think it is inaccurate for us to assert ENTPs are inherently sexually adventurous by nature.\n
36	I used to be willing try almost anything once. Now.. I just laugh at stuff i haven't tried. \n\nThings such as "butt plug fidget spinners" ... I wouldn't be able to stop laughing.

47	i think you may have ENTPs and ESTPs mixed up. every ESTP i've met is heavily influenced by the culture surrounding them, and ENTPs are the opposite... and yes we're kinky. some of us who've developed our feeling functions will be more sensible with certain people in bed, though. it depends on the vibe the other person is giving off.

11	I consider myself conservative in just about every other way but sexually is a different story.
9	I think this question lends itself to being answered by a skewed sample. 
7	I think you aren't talking to true ENTPs if they are super conservative.  I was raised and lived in a very conservative household and I can say I am pretty much down to try whatever at least once, just to see what it's like.  That's the Ne going crazy, thinking about all the possibilities and the want/need to understand it.  Worth noting I don't NEED to explore sexually in order to feel accomplished and that might be more of the ESTP thing, more of a need to explore the experiences vs being curious/open to them.
5	ENTP kinkiness is not influenced by culture, my country's culture is one of the most conservative when it comes to sex and that doesn't come into the picture when I think of sex one bit
8	Jesus, the lot of you all are degenerates!\n\nFor real tho, I’m not a big fan of casual sex. It lacks any meaning and makes me feel disgusted with myself afterward. 
2	Every ENTP I know in real life is sexually pretty adventurous, yes.\n\nSi is inferior so doesn't influence our values in the way you describe.\n\nDon't forget we've got a dominant "Ne". Our "let's see what happens if I do ..." is very strong. I wouldn't say ENTPs are necessarily kinky, but they do like to explore. 
2	I agree with your questioning the sexuality of ENTPs. I don't think it's accurate to label all ENTPs as sexually adventurous. I've heard that we are kinky, but idk if that's true about me. I agree fully with the Fe and Si presence during sex. Si is all about receiving sensations and often in a repetitive and submissive manner. I think that is true about me as well as a want for emotional connection (Fe). But my Ne and Ti makes me at least want to try new things once in a while, integrate them, and make them part of the "rotation". 
2	Any kind of sexual connection that can lead to fun encounters has always sparked my curiosity, especially with another intuitive as the mental game is very strong.  Sex with someone I love is best but I can’t say I don’t look fondly upon some fwb and random events from college. \nI used to be quite impulsive - sometimes to the point I ignored my Ti for the dun Ne-Fe can bring.  Other times my logic kicked in and said that’s not a good idea.  And sometimes Ti has had time to think it through and said yep I am so doing that no questions about.\nI can be into kinky shit but I’d really prefer to just have fun than experiment with extremes.  As for ESTP I am very similar to the ones I’ve met when it comes to sex.  Sex lets me live in the moment, something I often cannot seem to do but want to.
2	Hi, ENTP reporting. I LOVE novelty, and that’s true about sex as well. I often get an idea about something new that I just haaave to try - and then I do, and the first time it’s awesome, the second time it’s okay, and then I never think about it again.\nI’m terrified of catching STDs, so I don’t sleep around that much. I’m almost never single though (ENTP charm, amirite?), so I don’t have to.
2	 Now that I think about it, I wasnt always a freak. When I was younger I was very conservative.\n\nI met a stone cold freak when I was 18, she had zero shame, so after a year with her degeneracy I was Mr. Nasty Mcnasty.\n\nMaybe you can be the freak to get him to grow up.
2	As I tend to say, “I’ll try anything once.” Hope that tells you how, at the very least, I am. Also, I grew up and still currently live in the Bible Belt so I come from a really conservative area. I don’t believe it has shaped me sexually, but I am more likely to not sleep around as I prefer having a significant other. Now, with said SO I’m down for whatever just about, you tell me what’s good, and we gettin there.

3	ENTPs and ESTPs can be both labeled as adventurous, but in the case of ENTPs is more about gaining information than the experience itself. I can imagine that both an ENTP and an ESTP are interested in trying out rafting for example. But the ESTP is more likely to stick to it if he likes it (he is in it for the adventure itself) while the ENTP probably moves onto something else after his curiosity is satisfied. I think it's the same when it comes to sex.\n\nI general, I suspect that in terms of their lifestyle ENTPs are a bit more conservative than ESTPs (especially later their in life) because FeSi pulls them toward the traditional.\n
1	I’d say we’re pretty adventurous. I’ve only really had one person that pushed it too far for me. 
1	I've had sex don't more adventurous things than the majority of people, I'd say.
1	Yea
1	Asking for a friend? 😏
1	Yeah I'm good .
1	i’m asexual lol
1	Absolute disgusting sexual fiend, albeit always safe and cautious.
1	> I wonder if the stereotype of ENTPs being sexually adventurous is another one of those mistyped ESTP traits. \n\nI am ENTP.\n\nI can't help it that I'm awesome.
1	Yep moms, insects, stuffed animals you name it 
1	I’m asexual /s
1	I’ll pretty much try anything at least once and have had quite a few partners. Soooooo, I think it’s accurate for me.
1	As long as it's not rape or pedophilia, I really don't give a shit what other people do.  \n\nI personally am the farthest thing from "sexually liberal" though.  
1	Wanna bang?
1	I can see myself dating quite a few girls, but my definition of dating doesn't involve and fondling, cuddling, or even much kissing. It's just a matter of getting to know them more, which kinda goes with the stereotyped "learning experience" ENTPs like me value.\n\nWhich also reminds me, the "no sex until marriage" notion is extreme, but if I don't have a very deep, emotional connection I have with a girl, I'm not spending the night with her.\n\nAs far as tastes go...all I can say is I follow r/ZettaiRyouiki. Kinky tastes, but not necessarily naked.
1	It all about experimenting the new idea and what if, may be not the actual acts. What is culture? No cows are sacred.  
1	YES
0	As the others hace said u  got this  mixed  Up, Se can be very tradicional, while Ne os extremely open this leads to a lets try It attitude, and trying new things leads to a wider Range of kinks. The onés Who are more vainilla ar the male intps thoug.\nThink this: entj BDSM entp all type of kinks.\n\nThere ar a lot of intp misstypes They confuse the traits of introversión with those of intuition.
0	People's sexualities differ so much... I've met people who can't stop thinking about sex at all, I've met people aren't interested in sex at all. I doubt it has much to do with the MBTI type. Maybe moreso genetics? That being said, even though the MBTI stuff is pseudoscience at this point, there is some basis to it, so maybe? This has been the most pointless post I've ever made.
9	Do you believe in the idea of a self as something intangible that makes each individual who they are outside of their relationships to other things, or is the self merely a composite of past experiences?	Got to talking about ego theory with an estp friend and I was curious what you all thought.\n\n\nIs the ego almost like a soul? Are you a rational autonomous individual that  would continue through space and time maintaining your identity even if you were hypothetically subjected to a brain transplant with someone else? \n\n
5	The self is really an odd thing. Been struggling with this one awhile too. Im inclined to side with David Hume's "you are what you repeatedly do" and similar eastern theories. I think what you really are is a pattern. You are a series of actions composed of smaller actions vibrating constantly. I also think because, as beings, we are fundamentally inseperable from the world around us, our true self is the sum total of all happening, or as I might be inclined to say, the universe. You are all that happens and all that is and the ego is just a sensation of being at the center of it. I also think most of the way we think of ourselves comes from a constant stream of thoughts which struggle to escape from that is constantly trying define and capture things. To put a net over the world. "You" is a story cooked up by a relentless series of thoughts, based in the sensation of isolation inspired by the ego, but outside of this, "you" really are is just happening in a time and a place but not separate from all pther happening. Ya know what i mean?
2	>merely a composite of past experiences?\n\nThe self is the collection of beliefs and preferences that affect your decision-making. Some of it is rooted in your biology, much is rooted in how you made decisions in the past and your subsequent experiences as results of your decisions.\n\n>Is the ego almost like a soul?\n\nDepends, what is a soul?\n\n>Are you a rational autonomous individual that would continue through space and time maintaining your identity even if you were hypothetically subjected to a brain transplant with someone else? \n\nFrom what we know about brain traumas and how they can affect serious fundamental changes in personality, it's certainly clear that our personality isn't some unchanging things that isn't subject to environmental factors.
2	The self is what you do in response to sensory input.
1	I don't think this is proper science, but this is where I am at:\n\n\- body has a frequency.\n\n\- brain has a frequency.\n\n\- we cycle between brain and body.\n\n\- internal/external factors may alter these frequencies e.g. pain, music, thinking, sleeping etc.\n\n\- changes in frequency create new pathways in the brain and hence our personality changes.\n\n\- we vibrate between our personality and our dual; certain factors make us more like our dual than our primary type.\n\n\- the ego is the average of these types (at least to other people).\n\n\- it may be that we can transcend and become our ego, if we can remove the things that are blocked us e.g. the bad memories in our primary type/dual that causes us to become the other.
1	Uncertain whether the self is independent of others or not, since so much of a person’s identity stems from taught principles. \n\nBut I lean towards the self being immaterial, thanks to the Theseus’ ship thought experiment. Assuming matter is all we are, then who am I when all my atoms are replaced with totally different ones every few years?
0	No
26	Why are we here?	I’m sure everyone has asked this question before. We dislike structure, yet I find the idea of a God watching over us to be more comforting. I like to think we are masters of our own fate, yet I also wouldn’t mind having a predetermined destiny. Are we full of dead matter? Or is there an essence of life within us?\n\nAnd love. What is love? Realistically, we will end up loving whoever we are most compatible with, but I also wouldn’t mind having someone who is “the One”. \n\nAnyone have these clashes in thought before? It drives me crazy sometimes because it depresses me as I want to know the questions to everything in Life but are only subjected to our own thoughts.
9	> Why are we here? \n\nWhy not? That's a question a lot of people neglect, imo.\n\n> I like to think we are masters of our own fate, yet I also wouldn’t mind having a predetermined destiny.\n\nThere's a lot of room between these absolutes, even within the framework of religion.
9	> Are we full of dead matter?  \n\nYour skin is mostly dead cells and it's about 16% of body weight on average.  Clearly skin is "on the outside" though.  \n\nPoop is approximately 75% water (in a healthy gut).  Of what remains: it's 25-50% bacteria, and much of that is dead.  Another 10-20% is probably dead blood/etc cells, or their components.  Then of course you've got mostly digested food, etc.  So let's just say it's 25% dead.  \n\nAs to whether or not poop has an essence of life: it makes for an excellent fertilizer!  Generally speaking our metabolic processes can only extract so much energy, whereas other processes can do quite a bit more.  In fact a lot of the gas produced is from bacteria eating what your body couldn't.  \n\nSo I'm going to answer the question of   \n\n> is there an essence of life within us?  \n\nIn the affirmative.  \n\n> We dislike structure,  \n\nDo we?  Personally I like some structure(s).  Structure can be extremely useful and helpful.  I dislike arbitrary/inefficient structure.  I don't like things getting in the way of what I think should happen.  I think this is a rather human thing.  Disliking structure as a general amorphous idea seems like negative idealism to me.  \n\n> I find the idea of a God watching over us to be more comforting  \n\nDoes this god look away when you masturbate?  If not then what is he/she doing?  Is it creepy if Zuul rubs one out with you or not?  Does it matter how hot Zuul is?  \n\nFurther: what if you don't believe in Zuul, but he/she is still up there doin its thing?  Then it's certainly creepy right?  Like you don't even know he/she is there watching you spank, doing Zuul knows what... Doesn't seem very comforting to me.  \n\n\n
8	>yet I find the idea of a God watching over us to be more comforting.\n\nMore comforting than what? That there's no god watching us and everyone is responsible for their own actions (as opposed to God's will)?\n\n>Are we full of dead matter? Or is there an essence of life within us?\n\nWhat is that even supposed to mean? It makes zero sense. \n\n>Realistically, we will end up loving whoever we are most compatible with, \n\nThat's not realistic at all. If it were true you wouldn't see victims of abuse being in love with their abusers. \n\n>I also wouldn’t mind having someone who is “the One”.\n\n"the one" also doesn't make sense. It's a lie Hollywood told young children to make good dramas. \n\n>It drives me crazy sometimes because it depresses me as I want to know the questions to everything in Life but are only subjected to our own thoughts.\n\nYou're basically driving yourself to depression by focusing on meaningless questions. \n\nAll your post is the equivalent to "what language does my table speak?" Or "how big is Purple's penis?" Or "what morals do clouds have?"\n\nYou're wasting your energy chasing meaningless questions. These questions of life, the soul, love, etc are all dolled up, artificial questions invented by religion to sell you something (faith in God).\n\nIf you want to know the answers to meaningful questions, get a degree in physics. Scientific inquiry basically answered in infinite more detail in 400 yrs what religion couldn't do for 300,000 years. One of them is clearly more effective in the investigation of reality than the other. \n\n"Why" questions almost always lead down a rabbit hole to fundamental unanswerable things. "How" questions on the other hand are highly quantifiable, and it's this transition from why to how that gave scientific investigation so much strength and accuracy. \n\nLet's rephrase your questions. How are we here? Well that's quantifiable via studying how the solar system was born, how life was born on this planet via abiogenesis, and how life evolved over time. This is all tractable to the Big Bang, which we have several theories about the how it spawned. But nothing on why, because it doesn't make sense to ask. \n\nIt is this investigation via "how" that also absolutely slams religion. "God watches over us." Well, *how* does God watch over us? This is where the devout believers throw their hands up in confusion and claim you just have to *believe*. In other words, they can't answer crap. They only offer hollow drivel that disintegrates the moment you investigate it. \n\nThat's why religious believers are constantly have to be assured their doubts are god "testing" them. Doubt weakens faith. Because doubt requires skeptical, critical thought. and religious tenets absolutely and categorically do not hold up to such scrutinies. \n\nThe reason I'm harping on this is because your questions, as you tacitly admit, are steeped in religious ideology. It doesn't make sense to ask why we're here. It doesn't make sense to invoke "the one". I doesn't make sense to inquire about souls. It doesn't make sense to talk about "destiny". \n\nUnless... However, someone is trying to sell you on faith. You see, if religion posed quantifiably answerable questions, people would find the answers and walk away. But keep the questions vague and unanswerable (what color does the table speak?) and people will have to bend to your religious authority for the answers, which is "God".

2	I'm gonna be brief because I'm too lazy to write a full break down of my philosophies for each of these points. I can't choose whether I want to believe in God or not. I don't think it makes sense for there to be one. I acknowledge that there isn't a way to determine if there is a God or not but I think the likelihood of it is small. If there is one, I don't think it's anything we can comprehend or plays a role in a manner that's depicted in religious text. I believe we're made of matter and there is no meaning other than meaning we give ourselves. Unfortunately, meaning is derived from our own belief/values. These values are created via our environment and genetic dispositions. In other words, we can try to develop more sophisticated values and better meanings for ourselves, but ultimately our values don't really amount to anything either. I would say there's no real point to living unless you're just curious to see how things play out. Suicide is a respectable course of action.
2	Well when people get personal I get out. This has been a lovely discussion up to this point. I wish you a happy Thursday!
1	At this point, I'm convinced that Love is the point of existence. The only problem is that love has been distorted in this reality to keep people in a lower state of mind. I'm not trying to reincarnate as a fucking loveless human being. I'm going to ascend through Love and all that it has to offer. Godhood is within reach. \n\n> Realistically, we will end up loving whoever we are most compatible with, but I also wouldn’t mind having someone who is “the One”.\n\nIf you want to find the One, just make someone the One. It's really that simple. You are the writer and narrator of your story, and you can and will find that person if you are open to it. \n\n
1	Just to suffer.\n\nobviously 
1	This isn't an open question; there is a definite answer... the universe is fundamentally non-deterministic for all observers within the universe. The universe is not predetermined in any sense of that word which would matter to anyone inside of the universe.
1	They don't call an ENTP The Searcher for no reason.\n\nI recently solved my own existential crisis; I learnt about the cognitive functions and realised that whilst I could easily understand abstract concepts and further develop these with my own thoughts; I had no external system for doing this in a compound way.\n\nI would urgently advise you to start trying to answer these kind of questions systematically. \n\nMost people can only juggle 5-9 things at once and the ENTPs irrational bottom-up approach (with additional focus on quality) will generate far too many lines of enquiry.
1	"It’s one of life’s great mysteries isn't it? Why are we here? I mean, are we the product of some cosmic coincidence, or is there really a God watching everything? You know, with a plan for us and stuff. I don’t know, man, but it keeps me up at night." -Grif
1	You have understood that there are paradoxes to reality.
1	The thing is, if we are in a simulation for some other ones/things to calculate something for some specific purpose(s). That is what i call evil. \n\nThe idea of the possibility of being in a simulation drives me super mad because we think have “free wills” but it isnt free at all.\n\nAll other things dark matter, love, anything is just datas even physics. \n\nWhat makes me believe that we r in a simulation the most is physics rules.\n\nIf “time” exists its because we r in a simulation. We can only go back in a previous state of a data in a software. So if someday if we travel in time, be sure that this is a simulation.\n\nSo what i can do is, only observe, search more , develop only to escape from this simulation. Or trust the creator, it should be watching us individually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
1	It good to habe the idea of being watched but deep down we know it is bull$%&#@.  So we don't know and learn to be ok with what we don't know. 
-2	1) We are here to know, love, and serve God in this world and be happy with Him in the next.  We have souls AND bodies that are deeply connected.  Death is terribly uncomfortable because it temporarily destroys this connection (death is unnatural - damn "apple incident" ruined everything).\n\n2) God is watching over us AND we have a choice.  That's why prayer is so powerful because God is watching over us knowing what we are doing.  In order to preserve our free will, though, he often chooses to not step in until requested.  It's a bit hard for most people to grasp, but being outside of time God doesn't really "see the future" because that would make him part of time.  His brain is way more complicated than ours, and a bit above our small understanding.\n\n3) Love is a choice as well as an emotion.  More advanced languages have multiple words for the different types of love, but English is kinda crappy for discussion of love.  Love is a choice that you make to want/work for the betterment of another person.  Love in another use can be an emotion.  These two definitions are deeply connected most of the time, but true love may not always have fluffy emotions.  One time my parents (still very much in love after 30+ years), and one time I heard mom yell at dad during an argument, "Of course I always love you!  I just don't LIKE you right now!"  It was somewhat hilarious.  \n\n4) I do not believe in soulmates.  If I did believe in soulmates I'd probably be hugely depressed thanks to the number of abortions worldwide.  What if my soulmate was created and then killed before ever taking a breath?!  So depressing...
7	Do ENTPs tend to play games or are they very straightforward when it comes to romantic pursuits?	This ENTP was acting like he was really into me, but as soon as I started displaying interest he backed off. I'm not sure if he was only in it for the thrill of the chase or if he is playing games with me now. He gives me weird backhanded compliments which make it sound like he's negging...\n\nFor context, we've been friends for five years and I'm an INFJ.
29	We can go from extremely convoluted games to very straight forward in the span of a short conversation.\n\nHighly dependent on boredom and mood.\n\nBut everyone is different. There is no absolute answer.
10	If you’re been best friends for 5 years he prob doesn’t think you’re into him. Teasing is a surefire way to tell ENTPs are into you. If it were me I’d appreciate you being as blunt as possible because I can get pretty oblivious sometimes. 
8	I’m so blunt it hurts...like literally sometimes it stunts the mood a bit. 
7	Serious commitment can be scary for us, and dating someone who you've been friends with for that long sounds like a long and serious commitment.
3	I was always either straightforward or very , very obvious(quirky goofball)depending on how I thought the person would react.
3	Do I think you're also in to me? Games.\n\nDo I have no idea if you're in to me? Straight up
1	Both depending on what will get us success
1	100% straight forward. But your friend doesn't sound entp. If entp you already know. 
1	The more direct the better. No wishy washy bullshit. 
11	How To Find Your Purpose: And Transform from Wantrepreneur to Entrepreneur?	&#x200B;\n\n# Intro\n\nI am 22 y.o, soon to be graduating college with a finance degree. The reason I write this post. Is because I am confused about what my purpose is in life. While simultaneously, trying to figure out how to start my entrepreneurial journey? I know in the long run I would want to be a real estate investor/venture capitalist. But I know I need capital before I can pursue these endeavors.\n\nI’ve read tons of self-improvement books taken multiple personality test, and have completed guided meditations to try to figure this out. And have taken massive action on interest I thought would give me enlightenment. But regardless I still feel like I don’t know myself. My interest change rather quickly. Causing me to feel like I am perpetually spinning in a hamster wheel.\n\n*Because of this I feel extremely lost and don’t know how to embark on my life path.*\n\n# What I Do Know\n\nI do know that ultimately I am passionate about entrepreneurship and financial independence. It is all I read about and all I feed my mind. I know there is more to life than just joining the rat race. And I can't envision working in a cubicle building someone else's dream.\n\n*However, I can’t seem to identify a passion/purpose in regards to what business to start?*\n\n*Or more importantly, even where to start?*\n\nI feel like I lack the life experience necessary to be financially compensated for positively impacting the lives of others… Maybe this is just a limiting belief?\n\nMoreover to couple this feeling for a lack of purpose in life. I am also dealing with a lack of clarity on how to start my entrepreneurial journey.\n\nIn the past, I’ve done:\n\n* Sales (door to door pest control, life/health/disability insurance agent)\n* President of a fraternity\n* Interned for the U.S Forrest Service & a Digital Marketing Agency\n* And have recently started doing freelance copywriting work.\n\nHowever, I would consider these entrepreneurial activities. Not legitimate business endeavors.\n\n# How Did You Find Your Passion Or Start Your Entrenerial Journey?\n\nMoreover, I would welcome advice for anyone who has felt like this, and how they have overcome this stage in their lives. Should I work for someone else until I figure this out,  or just start something and hope passion is developed along the way? Any career advice would also be appreciated.\n\nP.S\n\nAbout me  ---\n\nENTP, Life Path 1, Enneagram Type 1w9.
5	If you are still living at home, Have very little responsibility and a lot of time.\n\nStart a business. Worst case scenario, it fails, You find a job and you try again.\n\nHow to find the right business. Think of existing businesses, Find a niche or latch onto an existing market and carve out your market share.\n\nPick what you are good at or what you enjoy. As an ENTP I am sure you are aware that if you choose something you do not enjoy your boredom will kick in.\n\nYou are 22, Consulting businesses is not going to be the best thing to start with. You need to find something age appropriate.\n\nYou could even find work in a field you want to start a business in. Get some experience and then branch out ahead of the pack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example, A food truck or van, If you can find a food you can make easily, costs very little to produce and you can sell cheap for a decent markup then you are already working for yourself. Startup costs may vary and scalability is limited.\n\nKeep in mind although extremely saturated markets are harder to branch into, they are saturated for a reason. Because there is significant demand.\n\nI have a friend who is essentially a caviar reseller as well as another who runs a local sandwich bar in an industrial area. The guy who owns the sandwich bar makes about 5 times more than the caviar dealer but also works a lot more than the caviar reseller. So pick your path.\n\nI myself have not broken out of the rat race but I intend to. I had too many responsibilities to be able to do it at a young age.\n\nI have given this a lot of thought and as an ENTP these are probably the most important aspects to consider for you/\n\n1. Bordome\n2. Automation\n3. Startup costs\n4. Scaleability\n5. Picking something age or skill appropriate.\n6. Getting experience in the industry of choice.\n\nIf you fail to start a business 5 times then you have a better chance of success.\n\nYou could say failure increases your bad luck protection.\n\nThats just my opinion. Im sure you will find better ones.
3	My advice for you is to seek mentorship from successful entrepreneurs. This is NOT easy, as most successful entrepreneurs tend to be way too busy to mentor some 22-year old kid.\n\nBased on everything you've said here, I'd encourage you to apply for an entry-level position at an emerging startup, probably in the financial services sector. FinTech is huge still, so if you can snag a position at a reasonably legit-looking FinTech startup, preferably led by someone whose career you would like to emulate, you might gain some valuable experience. Don't work for yourself right away - you don't have the credentials/experience/capital yet.\n\nAnother piece of advice is to attend conferences. Most of them are bullshit, but they can also be valuable for new grads looking for networking and mentorship. Conferences also tend to offer discounted rates for students (or new grads), plus you get to see where all the hype's at. 
3	A couple questions, if I may?\nI’ve never heard of Life Path, and upon googling it I’m seeing some overlap for obvious reasons. How do you reason between such a system and the Enneagram?\nAlso, are you a 3w4? And do you perhaps know your instincts? Just curious\n\nAnd in regards to your question I would say, if you aren’t already familiar with it, this is lack of Fi(ENTP blind spot). And ENTPs are notorious for using more Ti accuracy in its place. Ti is responsible for your reasons while Fi the values. Fi is the phenomenon that occurs when Ti types(I use the word ‘phenomenon’ because we don’t consciously use it) can’t find a reason to do or not do something, and yet the body hesitates; it’s the human side of us. Instead of following the Fi passions you’ve supplied a ton of reasons in your post about why you do what you do, a bunch of logical reasons given certain circumstances- and as you surmised there’s no evidence of you apart from the rest of world in your words. And I don’t mean to speak the obvious for any other reason than to establish what I will say next.\n\nFor starters, the idea that it’s okay to have values without reason, it’s okay to be fallacious with one’s words and values, and it’s okay to just be human- get on board with that.(other people will do it regardless of your actions so might as well accept it) And from there you learn to balance the two Introverted Judgment Functions after having accepted that values without reason is okay and it is just a part of life regardless of how many times an ENTP will correct people, point out the inaccuracies of people’s values, or point out all of the hypocrisies of whatever government whatever. Essentially, it’s the part that says “I do it because that’s just how I feel.” You and other ENTPs can’t not worry about who you are so you either get over it or you don’t get over it. I don’t say that to be harsh since you’re just asking for suggestions, but from my experience that’s usually what it comes down to. And what really helps with that is forgiving the self up until said point for not having done it even though you’ve been giving your all up until now.\n\nSO QUESTION:\nWhat would be the thing you do on the days where you didn’t want to do anything but you’d still do it? Among all of your books which one would you pick up for a read even though work, or the economy, or whatever whatever would give ample reason to do otherwise; believing instead that it’s more efficient to pursue these other pursuits due to innumerable number of reasons? Would you pick up the same books? What would be the thing you’d let yourself do after allowing yourself to have an off day? If the answer is something along the lines of “sit in front of tv or video games, I mean it is an off day,” than your work days are a lie; you will not achieve your passions. Y’know how some people will work innumerable hours doing what they love, like a teacher who spends tons of off time planning for their classes, even though there’s a lot of reason(Ti) to not do it?—-> in contrast to those teachers who get burnt out with all of the work(teachers are overworked, but anyways), and end up quitting after a year or two or whatever? Know that saying “to teach you have to love it.” Yeah. It’s that. It’s “if all my responsibilities(Te- won’t go into it) faded away, if I could just let my trying to better myself(Ti) fade away and just be human, what would I do?”\nAnd upon figuring out what those things are- KEEP TRACK OF IT. Write it down. ENTPs are notorious for forgetting as that would be Si. \nAnd I’m not saying it’s easy to find Fi in careers these days, one has to be practical, but you’re young and capable so time is yours until the nukes come. \n\nHopefully this helps, probably didn’t make much sense, and maybe I exaggerated or got something wrong. Apologies if so, this is definitely just meant to be an accompaniment to the idea of “perhaps consider...”
2	If you're not exactly sure what kind of business you want to start, there's absolutely nothing wrong with getting a job to start out. It sounds like you have some work experience, but you probably still have a lot to learn about your strengths, weaknesses, and interests. You can gain a lot of self-knowledge while working at your first job out of college, and what you learn about yourself can help you to start the right business for you, and start it successfully.\n\nYou already have experience in sales and marketing, which is great. The more work experience you can get in various areas of business, the better, so that when you are an entrepreneur and have to wear all those hats, you're not starting from scratch. See if you can get a feel for hiring, management, accounting, finance, etc. It may not be possible to get a job that exposes you to all these areas, but working for a small or startup company may allow you to get a glimpse into more aspects of how a business works. Working for a startup also gives you the benefit of observing and learning from the mistakes of others who are in the position you hope to be in one day.
11	Stuck ENTP and feeling unfulfilled	I found myself stuck in a loop recently.\n\nBasically what I'm m experiencing is a frequent mood change. So I isolate myself, think about how I'm going to improve my life, find enjoyment and improve my social skills. I do heavy research for days on end being comfortable with my thoughts and after that I try to apply it into the real world. At this point I forgot mostly 93% of what I researched and I am back to square one but I go out anyways hoping that this time will be better. I meet people with a goal in mind, what I want from that person. Well it just seems that after I start talking to them my mind just goes blank and I completely forget what I want to say and can't move past small talk. It is insufferable but somehow I always pull through being more exhausted than after a night of jail cell discussion with an ISFJ. I come up with the perfect thing that I should of said after the conversation ended and find myself reflecting over it. And now we're back to square one. If there's a solution to this I would gladly appreciate it. I also noticed that in a conversation I can't structure my thoughts as much as I'd like to and I seem way more stupid than if I text, where I can be the most witty and charming individual in a 20 mile radius.     \n
7	If I had to guess, you need to develop your inferior Si. That'll contribute significantly to your memory and personal stability, while increasing your control of what memories you'd like to think about.\n\nIt's just another way of using your brain:\n- Visualize a past experience, actively remember it through images. This is Si.\n- Start doing one small habit everyday. Doesn't matter what you choose.\n\nIf you think of this as a means of self improvement, it's easier for your dominant Ne to let go a bit. It's going to be really hard to keep it up, but you just have to keep working at it. It'll solve your problems, give you new skills, and allow you to be the master of your strengths, rather than at the mercy of them.
5	This is why talk therapy is so important for making personal changes. When you verbalize what you think and feel, you also internalize. It forces you to organize your thoughts in a more permanent, resolved way.  Therapists are what you go to to stay healthy, not a sign of weakness. \n\nJournaling is the next best thing but talking is always better. 
2	How old are you? Do you have mutual friends?
7	Why is Thomas Edison frequently mistyped as an ENTP when he is very clearly an ESTP?	I believe Edison was an ESTP for the following reasons:\n\n- he was more entrepreneurial than scientific (classic Se-Ti)\n- he is famous for stealing ideas from others. ESTPs have a very competitive nature and they're willing to bend the rules to get to the top.\n- Edison didn't care about finding the truth (as Ne users tend to do). He cared more about running a successful business than intellectual pursuits. Again, very Se-Ti.\n- this quote by him:\n\n"I can always hire a mathematician, but they can't hire me."\n\nShows his interest in business outweighed his love for acquiring knowledge + developing theories. \n
9	The inventor/visionary tagline gets slapped onto the ENTP subtype a little too often resulting in inventor = must be ENTP. 
3	People people type like this:  Davinci was an ENTP and Edison invented things just like Ironman, and RDJ is an ENTP so ....
2	He may even be an ESTJ.  But he is definitely not an ENTP.  
2	U ar learning the difference between Someone selling an idea, And the people Who have ideas.\n\nAnd u dont know any entp or estp either to make the claims ur making.\n\nEntp ar not scientists like intps, science is very process oriented is ti dom Kingdom
1	"more entrepreneural than scientific means Se-Ti"\n\nuhh no that's not how it works. Some people are equally both (like me), others shift to a side. I guess ESTPs are less scientific sometimes, but that doesn't automatically mean ESTP
8	Criticize my idea	Hello,\n\nI am always disenchanted by seeing how unsuitable schools are. \n\nI think that schools do not deserve the credit they currently have, and I believe that combining e-learning with schools would be a good idea to improve the future generation's curriculum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\- Solution:\n\nHere's what I believe might be a worthwhile idea that will save government's money while providing better education:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\#**Middle schools/HS :**\n\nNew curriculum. (using Khan academy or a similar e-learning website)\n\nFirst few days : Presentation of Khan Academy's way of working. Kids would try to watch some videos on each field available (just like regular classes).\n\nThey then get "points" then can use. Everyone gets something like 1000 points. If they can complete a course and pass the related exam, they can use the amount of points that corresponds to it.  (For kids, The exam would be a multi choice question assessment so as to automate it)\n\nEvery kid that finishes his 1000 points (aka every exam) will be considered to have validated his year. (Ofc that would correspond to the current curiculum's level).\n\nKids that have finished the year do not have to go back to school for an entire month if they dont want to. After that month, they will have to go back to school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that : They can start the next year's curriculum instead of stopping. This way, a kid could theoretically finish middle school and high school in a single year if he's able to get the knowledge related to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe kids would still get to socialize and there would be "pauses" to eat that must be done in group.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis would incentivise kids to work harder as it would mean getting a month free all while teaching them something of the same level. It would also mean that the kid can adapt his curriculum to what he wants and what is suitable to his intellect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for what I'd do with Teachers:\n\nThe teachers' job would be to answer any kid's question if they have one. Teachers wont have any other purpose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOfc this means that the number of teachers currently employed by the government would drop significantly. Thankfully, my country requires a masters' degree to become a middle school teacher so they shouldnt have any issue finding another job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThose that will stay would have to be passionate about their jobs. As for how to evaluate their passion about it, I suppose that "asking the kid if he's understood the explanation", gathering data about it, about how quickly the teacher gave the explanation, should be more than enough.\n\nAlgorithms can automate that.\n\n**#High schools specifics**\n\nI'd add on the e-learning website, a structure that explains the kid which jobs are related to the things he likes studying most and suggest things that he will need for that work/job.\n\nSomething like some videos/pictures explaining which job cathegories exist and a hyperlink leading to a paper on this specific job that would say : Its salary, its growth prospects, the fields related to it, what that worker does, and why he does it.\n\nI think it's as hard to build as Khan Academy (maybe even harder) but I think it's faisible .\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#Colleges**\n\nIn Colleges, the same principle would be applied. One difference would be : Exams.\n\nAs Exams get more complicated in colleges, and skills must be harshly confirmed, we'd have to keep some professors, the role of which will be to correct assessments that are not multiple choice questions.\n\nThe teachers that want to do the same job would have to open private school and work in them. Whether they are great teachers would be validated by the customers they have.\n\n&#x200B;
23	Nothing can replace a good teacher. Good teachers teach their material in different ways to ensure that the students who learn better with different approaches are able to get the information in a way that suits them. Lectures should never be just lectures. The interactiveness that a teacher can bring to a classroom is valuable. Not everyone learns well through the khan academy way of teaching. Also, watching a screen all day is not good for you. \n\nYour idea makes learning a completely individual endeavor. Some people may like this, but this is not preparing children for the collaborative nature of adulthood and the workplace. School is not only about learning facts and figures; it is just as important for children to develop social skills and learn how to work with others. Reducing education to staring at a screen all day would be doing a disservice to our youth. Group projects and the like are valuable to teach children about how to work as a team. Yeah, one student may do all the work, but that’s how life is sometimes. \n\nIntegrating technology into the classroom can be valuable, but replacing teaching with videos would be a bad move. 
7	> Kids that have finished the year do not have to go back to school for an entire month if they dont want to. After that month, they will have to go back to school. \n\nThat sounds rather lazy, IMO. For me, I'd instead give the students who are ahead roles as tutors of the class, thereby adding a little more socializing to your school idea. It can also serve as a good way to review the material again so that they don't forget the material  after that month is up.\n\nREALLY like your e-learning idea where the website suggests career options. College Board does have something similar, called Big Future ([https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/)), but they don't have any links with test scores or grades, data which this website needs to have to work properly.\n\n> As Exams get more complicated in colleges, and skills must be harshly confirmed, we'd have to keep some professors, the role of which will be to correct assessments that are not multiple choice questions. \n\nProfessors aren't simply teachers in college. In some universities, they also coordinate research projects, which can be tied with the career-searching website discussed earlier. They also often serve as club advisors, which is something I would NOT throw away from the schooling system.\n\n> The teachers that want to do the same job would have to open private school and work in them. Whether they are great teachers would be validated by the customers they have. \n\nQuite interesting how you want entrepreneurial teachers here. And indeed, entrepreneurs ALWAYS wants to listen in on how they can do things better.
5	"Throw kids in front of a screen and expect them to teach themselves and make critical life decisions well"
2	Ideally, this would be the way to go and I have played with the idea myself... however... consider the number of teachers - most of them could be laid off. Now consider how many people are friends with or family of a teacher - most people. Do you really think people would go for this?\n\n\nTheoretically though, it's fun to discuss.
2	So the first immediate issue I can think of is the lack of personal interaction with the teacher. \n\nAt the schools I work at, the teacher themselves will record YouTube videos explaining how to do a new math problem or whatever the topic may be. \n\nThe reason why this is excellent is the students are accustomed to seeing their teacher and can ask questions based off what the teacher said at a certain point in the video. Relying on one, authoritative figure keeps students focused. \n\nMaking things impersonal for elementary kids is very not good. Knowledge needs to be passed on in a caring way, with personal interactions.\n\nPlus there’s lots of evidence that screen time directly causes depression in kids. You’ve got to be very careful with it.  
2	I think it's a reasonable idea, the trouble is in the details. \n\n1) Not all students learn well from the Khan Academy format (counterpoint: not all students learn well from the current education format either). Having in-person teachers for our current education system gives us the flexibility to adapt curriculum material to make sure it meets all the students in the class. \n\n2) This would require significant agreement on standards of what to learn. Witness the clusterfuck that is CommonCore. Attempts to centralize and standardize education have been the target (and scapegoat) for many ills of our education system. \n\n3) The Khan-format eliminates one of the essential components of schoolwork which is *interactive* learning. Animals naturally learn with interaction and play with their peers. I don't think some breaks for snacks really accomplishes the same task. Learning to work on projects together with peers, learning to play word/math games together with peers, learning to deal with the frustration that is peers--these are all crucial pieces of the "hidden curriculum" that students learn in our current educational system that prepare them for a world that requires collaboration to solve problems without straightforward multiple-choice solutions. \n\nThe reality is that the majority of our education does not and should not cater to our best, smartest students. Sucks for those who are a part of that group, and certainly we should do what we can for those students too. But the reality is that the vast majority of our national GDP will come from having an educated 80%. Our elections and functioning institutions require us to have an educated general electorate. For the most part the smart ones figure it out for themselves, even if it is not as quickly and as smoothly as they (or we) might like. The bulky middle is less likely to figure it out in a way that is productive for society. \n\nYour idea has many merits that I really like, but you asked for critique. 
1	This sounds like essentially turning education into e-academies but just filling a school like a warehouse.  It doesn’t have any value to someone like me who learns through live debate and interacting with others.  If I was told to just sit and work at a computer all day as a student, I’d go nuts and do exactly none of my work.  I get why this appeals to introverts or gamers (in general), but this to me is simply not education.\n\nSure, we can all mostly teach ourselves concepts via online media.  But that takes away the depths of education, where we learn from each others’ questions and ideas.  Honestly, this feels like some dystopian way of mass education, which doesn’t particularly feel helpful to me.  A kid can know every fact out there, but if they can’t defend those facts through debate or express their ideas in a creative way and open forum, they’re rather useless.  Kids aren’t computers to code.
1	The idea might be worth considering but with the details you have specified I think it would be a disaster, practically speaking.\n\nSo I take it the students are showing up to class, and each has their own computer and has to wear earphones, well good luck having a school with one computer for each kid (who pays?) and a lot of them are going to have tinnitus. You mention they'll be less teachers but how does that work? The teacher should be able to answer any question from any subject? That's not plausible. Also who is making sure the students are actually studying? You seem to imply students can work at their own pace as the goal is to get 1000 points. That's placing way too much faith in their discipline, and also a teacher is going to be highly ineffective at watching over them. 30 students in a class, all watching videos from different courses, well it'll be hard to notice if you just watch cat videos all day. Many classes also can't be learned well online, especially practical subjects. Likewise, not everything can be reasonably assessed with an online exam. So what about the speaking test in French? Multi-choice for everything is laughable. Relying solely on the e-learning format also deprives students of their chance to work with teachers and do group activities and bond with classmates over that stuff because everyone is doing something different. It would be highly demotivating and anxiety-inducing for some.
1	Some stuff like this already exists. Intellischool for example. Kids can have the choice to go with what school works best for them. Montessori schools have good reviews too. 
1	I must admit that this learning method attracts a lot of NTP'S and STP'S which this is why you like this method, but there are many ways to learn and. I don't know where you are from and which learning methods are considered the standard ways, I guess those mustn't have been benefiting you. If I may add to your idea: do not make the same mistake and decide for one or 2 learning methods. Now you are forcing children to do e-learning, while it's not for every student the best study method, and making the same mistake as schools are doing now.
1	> As Exams get more complicated in colleges, and skills must be harshly confirmed, we'd have to keep some professors, the role of which will be to correct assessments that are not multiple choice questions.\n\nheh
213	Ne tells a story	
40	The worst part about the ADHD mind is that this is precisely how it works when we are the ones telling the story.... When it is the other persons turn to speak, we just want them to get to the point. 
26	I don't think this is so much adhd as just Ne haha.  This happens even with adderall.  \n\nEdit:  Ok for the report that this is "unexplained"... \n\n> While openness to multiple perspectives is a signature strength of NPs, it can sometimes hamper their productivity and follow-through. Leaning too heavily on their Ne can seduce them into chasing too many rabbit trails and to lose sight of their original focus. This may be a problem, for instance, for NP writers, whose attraction to tangents and asides can be frustrating for readers seeking a more streamlined discussion.  \n\nI conjecture that this produces the pattern of storytelling
11	What is anything in life without context though.\n\nTo understand a certain view you need to know where its coming from. \n\nIn the future we'll hopefully be able to convey an entire experience just by data transfer\n\nEdit: I also like how the non ADHD version is simply missing the content. Thanks, cool story bro
9	I don’t know, apologizing is clearly an FJ trait. 
3	Yeah I’m not convinced where or if the line exists between ENxP and ADHD. :) So I relate to this on multiple levels.
2	It’s amusing bc my ENFP friend is exactly like this when they are telling a story. I catch it too when they start associating things and branching off. I’m like “oh yeah they’ve gone off the rails”. It’s fun for me actually because every story is so unpredictable. I love it. Most other people’s stories are predictable and linear that I get bored. 
2	I think this is more ADHD than Ne (I know its labeled ADHD, but Im looking at other comments and making my statement based on those) \n\nI have both so- \n\nNe can look like ADHD, but Ne is not debilitating like ADHD. \n\nAlso the apologising at the end is def an ADHD thing, bc if anyone else here has legitamate ADHD and not just high Ne will know that it causes a lot of emotional inbalance, esp in the form of RSD (Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria) so people with ADHD apologise A LOT just for existing. \n\nI think a lot of ENTPs experience high distracrability bc their Ne is always on the move and travels in circles to get the full picture. But ENTPs are typically portrayed as being pretty emotionally stable. People with ADHD can appear to be with practice, but tend to feel things with extreme intensity. \n\nSo the "Im sorry" at the end, and feeling guilty for talking too long, are really the big differences between how Ne tells a story, and how ADHD tells a story.\n\nOtherwise, I feel its a good comparison, however I think its bad to compare a healthy function to have with a disability. Its true, there are ADHD ENTPs, but lets not try to make everyone with Ne question whether or not they have it because they share a few traits with it. ADHD isnt a personality trait, its debilitating.
2	No, that’s just ADD.
1	Yesterday I learned I can’t talk about anything serious while cooking. Either dinner is on the table but nothing is resolved, or I get out my point and everything is on fire
1	Hahahaha yesssss!
1	Just today I was wondering if I had ADHD.... Would explain a lot of things. 
1	Noticing the joint went out from you talking way to long 
1	Yes
23	Why is it so difficult to take INFJs seriously?	For some reason every time an INFJ tries to speak to me, I constantly feel the need to roll my eyes. It’s as though they think they are way, way further along in life/existence than everyone else around them. Every time they ask my opinion, I don’t really see the point in telling them because it just feels like they want hear it for the sake of hearing it and to be nice instead of actually wanting to change their thoughts and learn something new. Why is this? 
18	NiNe clash looks like that. One is expanding the other is contracting.
15	Because they actually do think that? I’ve noticed that INFJ and ENFJ folks take themselves very seriously and are a wee bit lacking in self awareness. The poor wee lambs.
8	FWIW, I don't think most INFJs are quite so insufferable, but I've definitely encountered INFJs of the ilk you're describing. \n\nHonestly, I think INFJ is one of the most insecure types, that also prides itself on being more emotionally "evolved" than most other types. I also find INFJs to be one of the most approval-seeking types. The best way to deal with an INFJ, I find, is to give them a little bit of praise (on something you genuinely think they do well) or affirm one of their intuitions. It sounds like this particular INFJ you're dealing with is pretty annoying, as I find most INFJs are fairly genuine in wanting to hear other people's opinions (although they also definitely want to share their own), as well as generally growth-oriented. Generally, if you treat an INFJ with kindness, but also a certain amount of firmness, you'll get the best response out of them.
5	I have an INFJ mother and I feel you, dude... She left me alone with my abusive dad for most of my childhood and now constantly asks me to validate her decision and feelings and tell her how \~morally superior\~ she is compared to him. If I ever dare to voice an opposing opinion, she goes nuts. lol  \nThe most annoying thing imo is how manipulative INFJs can be, because they think they are the next messiah. Feels like talking to someone who's stuck in a constant loop of victim/messiah complex. 
8	Because any type can be pretentious, self-consuming, arrogant, anything. You can be a certain type and still be a [jerk.](https://jerk.In) In a personality sense, given enough pain and confusion, anyone will cling to their functions. Roll those eyes in a new direction, head towards that direction, and move on with your life unless you're planning on helping them- don't give the impression that you're there for them when you're not.
5	Good question, if I could figure this out, it would certainly make taking myself seriously much easier at least. 
2	Just throwing out a few thoughts with some overlap. Let me know what you think\n\nFirst speculation:\nOver Reliance on Ti. Introverted intuition in itself is not a very open learning function in what it perceives. And when one uses Ti to make judgements, this makes one come across as more closed off and lofty. They need to open up their learning and judging processes up in some way. Otherwise they get stuck in a bubble of Oblivion.\n\n2. Clash between critical and value based judgement.\nIf we take Fe to be value based judgement, then I think the INFJ will be most eager to ask questions and listen to others but may not necessarily factor in what you are saying into whatever conceptual framework that currently have. \n\n3. Lazy and Bad Fe\nIf I ask questions, I am making it about someone else and not myself and that is good humanness. But if you aren't interested in really engaging, don't ask!!!!!
38	Description of the ENTP (found an a defunct website)	\nENTPs at their best are perceptive\nindividuals who follow their own path.\nThey are keenly aware of their\nsurroundings and are able to quickly\nidentify and advantageously reacts to\nnovel stimuli. They jump on opportunities\nto participate actively in the world\nreadily absorbing new experiences and\napproaching each situation with the\nreceptive attitude. They do not miss much\neither and will often notice changes or\ninteresting details before others do.\nThat said they do not tolerate boredom\nor tedium very well and will often\nattempt to find other ways to entertain\nthemselves. Their primary interest lies\nin seeking out all that life has to\noffer and exploring a multitude of\nadventures in search of mindfulness and\nself-expression.\n\nENTPs tend to be people\nthat are imminence oriented and they are\noften able to perceive much more from\nbody language and nonverbal expressions\nthan others likewise they are often able\nto sense and respond to people's\nemotions in the moment even if nothing\nwas ever said or done to express such\nemotions. They tend to be very good at\nseeing people for who they actually are\nrather than how they want to present\nthemselves. \n\nENTPs tend to have a vivid\nawareness of the people that come into\ntheir life they tend not to take people\nfor granted and they often like to\nengage others in conversation to try to\nget to know them and what is most\nimportant to them.\n\nWhen doing so, even when ENTPs are in\npositions of authority they can often\npresent themselves informally and tend\nnot to care too much for a elaborate or\nritualistic social etiquette. They would\nmuch rather have a heart-to-heart\nconversation with someone to find out\nwhat makes them really tick. \n\nENTPs often\nhave a straightforward and optimistic\ndemeanor. This can sometimes make them\nseem capricious or hedonistic in the\neyes of others but in fact they are\ngenerally quite sensitive and idealistic\nat heart they genuinely want people to\nenjoy themselves and will often try to\nsweet-talk lonely and morose individuals\ninto laying aside their morose thoughts\nand actively engaging with the world. Not\nin a grand or sweeping way as the ENFJ\nand INFJ types are sometimes want to do\nbut in an open-ended down-to-earth\nmanner where the ENTPs starts out by\nengaging people where they actually are\nhere and now and then use that as a\nspringboard to see how far they can go.\nThis ability to engage with others and\nto get others to engage in turn makes\nthem quite skilled and passionate\nmotivators. \n\nMost ENTPs love to live vivaciously and will approach their tasks\nand hobbies in a spontaneous and\nenergetic manner where they see life as\nan adventure. They tend to be open minded\nand dislike authority that is seen as\ntoo controlling or Draconian and that\nwould seek to instill measures that\nmight impose constraints on the free\nspirited nature. \n\nENTPs tend to strike\nothers as vibrant and animated even if\nthey don't enjoy being in the spotlight\nthey nevertheless tried to make an\neffort to be felt by others as a fluid\nand approachable presence. They're\ngenerally quick to say what they think\nbelieve or feel. Immediacy and quickness\nof response is often seen as honesty to\nthem and for this reason they can\nsometimes tease or address the pain\npoints of others while nevertheless\nseeming very innocent about it.\n\nENTPs peace seek to elicit emotional\nresponses from others and many make\nnatural entertainers who are able to\nlift the mood of a room or develop an\nundercurrent of excitement through their\npresence often times they find\nthemselves the life of the party without\neven meaning to and many are well\nequipped to be comfortable with the\nattention. \n\nENTPs tend to be interested\nin the arts and many have their own\nunique style and will dress in a way\nthat while loud nevertheless has a sense\nof coordination and personal touch that\nlifts their style beyond being purely an\nattention-grabber or a mark of status. They often put a\ngood deal of passion into their clothing\nor their taste in the arts even if they\nappear completely laid-back about it not\nbeing too snobbish or sports some cutoff\njeans and an old t-shirt if that's where\ntheir mood takes them.\n
20	I think people identify with this description despite it being an ESFP desc is because they have barely any self awareness and they think "oh I relate to this therefore its me". Surely yes at one point in everyones life can relate to this description but the fine line between saying it 'defines who I am and everyday I abide this behaviour' and saying that 'That's me on some days' is very blurred for those with little self awareness. \n\nRemember ENTPs main characteristics is that we are in love with the never-ending possibilities, the what ifs and how things tick, its why we love debating so much. If you identify yourself strongly with this more than the description then obviously you're an ENTP. \n\nThe Barnum effect tends to plague those with little to none self awareness. \n\nOPs a lil shit. u tryna see how easily we can self identify with false desc is it u shonky wanker
17	>	even if they don't enjoy being in the spotlight they nevertheless tried to make an effort to be felt by others as a fluid\n\nI love morphing into an ocean and crashing into people with my waves.

5	This isn't a ENTP description. [https://www.idrlabs.com/esfp-description.php](https://www.idrlabs.com/esfp-description.php) ; this is an ESFP description.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: sigh
2	even if this is an ESFP description. it nevertheless describes good natured and mature ENTPs. maybe not that much out-in-the-moment Se, but with  well developed Fe I think this still fits.

1	Ok, so I feel like this describes me, especially since taking anxiety meds, but a) every sensor I’ve talked to says I’m an ENFP because I’m “weird” and “cringey “ b) every Fi user thinks I’m a heartless asshole and c) based on the function stacks I think NTP fits best.\n\nSO how do I avoid mistyping myself? This description fits. I don’t believe I’m a heavy Se or Fi user though.
11	Feynman's suggestion to "know your place in the world, and evaluate yourself fairly"	
1	I take from this that he suggests one find purpose and meaning in helping others, and in being part of something larger than oneself.  \n\nClearly he was writing a letter to comfort a mentee, but it seems consistent with the humility and warmth he was known for.  \n\n> No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.\n\n> You say you are a nameless man. You are not to your wife and to your child. You will not long remain so to your immediate colleagues if you can answer their simple questions when they come into your office. You are not nameless to me. Do not remain nameless to yourself – it is too sad a way to be. Know your place in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in terms of your naïve ideals of your own youth, nor in terms of what you erroneously imagine your teacher’s ideals are.\n\n> Best of luck and happiness. 
3	ENTPs, I need your creative insights and input for a 'secret' project in development. I want to know what your thoughts are...	Hello! I was discussing an entrepreneurial venture with an ENFP friend who owns his own business and I was curious about his thoughts of something that would be awesome. It is a theme park where people may re-enact popular videogames like Modern Warfare, Fallout, BioShock, Resident Evil, Rocket League, Assassin's Creed, etc... With more content beyond what their games offered, like a DLC but in real life. My friend suggested I ask a few creative types to talk about the idea and experiment what thoughts they have on it. Legal issues and licensing aren't a concern for the time being as all of this is purely conceptual and hypothetical so I may finalize an ideal park without other hassles! 
5	 [a lot of parents scowl at violent video games](https://kotaku.com/5975014/survey-75-of-parents-think-violent-video-games-contribute-to-actual-violence) so its going to be hard to make a business when a large portion of your profits depend on the attendance of families. \n\nif it was a once in a year event it'd probably work. Kinda like comic con where ppl would travel thousands of miles for it but an amusement park that opens once a year? yikes. Maybe make each year a different theme, one year being fallout, the next modern warfare and so on, just so that people won't be bored and kept on edge.
3	Why would they go to you theme park when they can just play the video game? No theme park can match the fun/complexity of a video game if it’s not funded with millions.\nAlso with the rise of VR and AR Technology your customers can have a cheaper, more immersive and more satisfying experience by just staying home. \n\nSorry to burst your bubble but to me it seems like a bad business idea. If you would do it with VR and create immersive games yourselves, that would be a different story..\n
3	Maybe start small with escape the room type shit.  There are some scenarios like that where you are stuck with a zombie.  Perhaps use laser tag kits to host events with these kinds of themes.  It wouldn't require more than a few grand to fund.  
9	It’s that time of year again...ENTPs, what do you look like? Post a pic of yourself!	I’m just curious to see what everyone here looks like. Do it! Do it!

2	New to this	With only finding out that I am an ENTP a few days ago reading the description of an ENTP freaked me out how spot on it was. Lately I have found myself suffering from anxiety attacks. For anyone who is an ENTP you know how easy it is to get lost in thought. I find myself sometimes getting too deep which leads to me think of what society will become in a negative way which is a product of an anxiety attack. Can anyone possibly give me some guidance on how to possibly suppress this so I don't have these moments of shear fear of what the future could become. Along with guidance on that, I also find myself critiquing people to much to the point where I start to lose interest in seeing particular individuals (which leads to burning more bridges than I would like) I am not sure if i'm am the only one who sees how fake people are but is there anyway to suppress these feelings as-well? I thought this would just be a good place to start, I am going to see my therapist as well. Any feedback is welcome! Thanks!
3	To your last part, there's nothing wrong with cutting off people you don't like anymore, and there's nothing wrong with doing it due to opinion differences either. No need to waste time with people you can't stand.\n\nJust don't be a firecracker and burn bridges with people you might need in the future, like a lab partner or something.
3	Understand that everything has flaws. Just because something is bad doesn't mean it's putrid disgusting and something to be feared. Everything in a certain perspective is bad so it's pointless to pick and sort out the naughty and nice. Accept that people are flawed and the world is flawed. Dont let that be the reason you treat someone differently.
1	The past doesnt exist, it only exists as memory and as a launching off point - dwelling on the past will cause depression.\n\nThe future doesnt exist its a function of the only thing that does exist - focusing on the future can cause anxiety\n\nThe present is the only thing that exists.
24	Psychology study finds being a dick makes people upset! Breaking news...	
6	What i never understand is how although the article uses the term incivil, some of the behavior is downright abusive, and for whatever reason many companies even with zero tolerance policies on harassment don't consider an incivil/abusive/toxic employee an issue. 
3	If you have a low testosterone society you will have a society of cowards. I'm not justifying the toxic acts, the harrasment and abuse by high testosterone people, this people just needs to be educated in what is moral and immoral, but, you can't say that testosterone is bad for the society because is essential, if the testosterone gets lowered or deleted, you will create a society full of weak, coward, sleepy people, and that's what occurring right now. \n\n\nConclusion: Don't be an idiot by saying that testosterone has to be deleted because it is essential for a society of males and females.
2	The point of life is not to be free from bad things happening to you, it is to overcome whatever may come your way, and in the meantime make something of it.\n\nLife is not be worth living if you're always happy, in fact I don't even think it is possible to hold positive emotions for so long.\n\nPeople without the capability to deal with negative  emotions need **more** exposure to challenging situations, **not less**. 
4	This is just toxic masculinity at work.  The quicker people learn that gender is a social construct and learned behavior, the quicker this stuff will become a thing of the past.  
1	This is important. \n\nWe didn't now this often enough. 
28	What kind of people do you admire?	I was just thinking about it and came to conclusion that I really admire people who are able to control their emotions, not having them to rule them, but being in control of them. \nAlso, those who work smart, (not necessarily hard)\nWhat about you?
26	I admire people who embrace their weirdness. I believe we all have something 'weird' about us and it's a side of us we don't tend to show to other people unless we're really comfortable with them. I feel like it's such an unnecessarily anxiety and kind of a shame the way the pressure of notions like 'normal', 'proper' and 'cool' inhibit us from just showing our human side to others. I feel like the reason I admire this is probably something more personal than ENTP-related.\n\nI second you on working smart over working hard! It frustrates me when people work unnecessarily hard for something that could've been done just as well another way. Hard work in itself is not intrinsically valuable to me in that sense. \n\nEmotional maturity is a big one for me too! Those who totally succumb to their emotions are people I just can't get along with 😣 I admire those who choose to think and make decisions logically and philosophically rather than in an emotionally-driven manner. Of course, part of emotional maturity is not totally denying emotions, they're still important and need to be acknowledged but it's having perspective and a sense of priority that I think is important.\n\nI also admire people who challenge me/others and themselves. It's so refreshing encountering people like that as opposed to those that are super agreeable, dogmatic, and unquestioning of things.
16	Insanely loyal, not in any way abusive and/or controlling, have a sense of humor, can do morbid discussions.
12	People with some sort of work ethic
10	People who are aware of and honest about their own nature. 
6	Humble people; people who know how complex truth can be, and that sometimes (even if it seems like they got it), they might be wrong, or just misleaded, or something like that. Basically, people who know that the world doesn't revolve around them, and that there are \~other things\~ out there — just waited to be discovered and shared!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEmpathetic people. Sometimes all you need is to listen to what others have to say — the world, in a certain light, is made of it: people sharing their ideas, and their points of view, and their opinions, and idk their feelings. And sometimes, you have to step from your own shoes and look through other perspective to know where you're leading. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonest people. Those who have the maturity to embrace their \~good things\~ without making a fuss about it, and those who are brave enought to accept their mistakes without stagnating. I think it's too damn important to know where you are succeeding and where you are failing; it's a BIG (I'd say it's it cornerstone, but idk) part in the process of changing for better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
4	People who don't give up \n\nPeople who cannot be intimidated or threatened \n\nBasically anyone with warrior mentality 
4	There are many people I admire.  Usually from the bushes.  With binoculars.  Usually blondes.  Also shitposters.
3	Anyone who has commitment and follow-through on their goals, is always willing to be themselves, can be care free yet have a great sense of character, or be strong enough to withstand adversity are all incredibly respectable and admirable traits to me. 
3	I respect any person who has high standards for themselves. Mostly because I have high standards for them too, so they meet my expectations. Which, in a sense, is pretty much "respect". An acknowledgement of met expectations
3	I like how this post doesnt explicitly ask for types but people
2	I admire people who are confident, can think quickly on their feet, have a aense of humor, can get along well with everyone, and who can actually get things done. And those who aren't afraid of showing their emotions, but only let them come through at appropriate times.
2	Those who speak out and take action where others do not. Also, those who are able to learn and grow from hardships. 
2	People who achieve their “impossible goals” fucking turn me on.

2	Intellectual nudists cause when you get caught staring at them it's not the end, you end up having a nice conversation. 
1	All of the above 
1	People that value intelligence and love. 
1	People who know themselves really well but also consider other people’s points of views.
1	People who have deep understanding of, stand up for, and follow through on what is right.
1	I admire people who don't give up. \n\nPeople that are able to keep some sorta order in their life and manage their responsibilities. \n\nPeople that can own up to their mistakes. \n\nAnd yeah, people being in tune with their emotions!
1	Honesty, intellect, and loyalty above all.
1	People that stand up for themselves even when nobody agrees with them. I'm terrible at that. 
6	How do you feel about exercising/being outdoors?	I know ENTPs have inferior Si and "devil" Se, but when I force myself to get out of my head to take care of my everything health once in a while, I find that exercising is actually really enjoyable once I get started. I also don't like getting wet and am quite afraid of getting injured but in the right contexts I've found throwing away all my inhibitions to do something "rugged" really enjoyable. Stuff like rock climbing is extra fun because of the adrenaline rush (and percieved lack of real danger because of the safety equipment). Ne and Ti activities come as easily as breathing to me, but sometimes I think myself down rabbit-holes or I get depressed, and sports/going outdoors to collect new data to think about is a lot more fun than what you'd expect from being inf Si/devil Se.
7	I am not so much into team sports, but I love being outdoors, I love camping, and bush-craft, and being outside. I also hunt and fish quite a bit (technically sports).
4	I think excerise is really good for anyone in general. This other user wrote a long post about Si, i believe, the other day where he highlights the importance of exercise. I think we are too much in our heads to the point were getting up and doing something can be a real hurdle to over come. But once we do it feel good. Getting started on something that appears tireing is really always a struggle.
5	I dread getting started to exercise but once I start I fucking love it, it clears my mind and it makes me feel awesome and enjoy the rugged feeling and it's great to reset my mind. I should be exercising in about an hour, and I don't really want to get started but I know I'll enjoy it.\n\nI also love being outside, it's really therapeuthic. I'm in front of my computer most of the time and going outside makes me get out of my head. I don't like team sports, alone outside activities are my thing. My favorite alone outside activity is longboarding. Longboarding is my theraphy, but I don't get to do it in the winter :c\n
3	I'm feeling thank you. 
2	I like it a lot but I have to be with people to actually be in the moment and observe the world around me in nature. If I’m alone I just do my typical “can’t get out of my head” thing while staring aimlessly at shit.
2	I don't like it! Gotta hit the gym once in a while though.
2	Nature is great. It’s incredibly stimulating for the mind.\n\nThat being said, chill activities outdoors are the best. My girlfriend (ENFP) and I love to hike. I can’t stand team sports cause I’m not really into the physical aggression.
2	I've always been kind of a "tough cookie" and I've always liked to climb/play rough/sword fight etc. as a kid, but those things are frowned upon apparently as you're entering adulthood, so I ceased. I like individual sports, like martial arts or archery, because It's all dependent on ME and my own willpower and strength, PLUS I can fuel my willpower by pretending I'm in Streetfighter, or an elf or a fantasy monk or something. Plus who doesn't want to have black belt bragging rights? HOWEVER, TEAM SPORTS ANNOY ME SO MUCH. IT'S SO STRESSFUL AND POLITICAL AND TEAMMATES MAKE ME FEEL LIKE THIS: (ノ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ノ︵┻┻
1	I hate team sports, but I love being outdoors and exercising. For me, taking long walks clears my head if I’ve been thinking too much. I overthink myself into oblivion and just getting outside and doing something without having to think much about it is very refreshing to me. I often come back from a long walk recharged and ready to actually accomplish something. \n  And I have an interesting relationship with exercise. I love it, I can get a little obsessive about my body and weight gain/weight loss etc. but on the other hand I have zero motivation to get on my treadmill—even though I really love it once I actually start running. Running on the treadmill (which I’ve named Treddy Von Sweaty in case you were wondering) allows me to think uninhibited for at least 30 minutes. I get distracted by other things during the day that don’t allow me to think freely about all the things that tickle my fancy. But when I’m on the treadmill just running and listening to music, my thoughts are free to flow wherever they want. It’s like therapy that I don’t get bored with. \n  So yeah, exercise and the outdoors is like a release for me. Release of all the bogged down thoughts I’ve been dealing with, and a release to think without any distractions. 
1	I don't mind exercise once I get off my ass to actually go do it.  \n\nI love the outdoors.  I hike, camp, fish, and hunt.  I will spend entire days in the woods or wilderness.  I will do childish things like climbing trees and falling out of them as well.  \n\nI also love amusement parks.  I will go on any ride except the ones that drop straight down (I throw up on those).  \n\nAlso, here's a tip: do not invite two INFPs and one INFJ to an amusement park for your birthday.  They will each have their own fears (so you can never all go on a ride other than bumper cars) and they may even throw up on you.  The only way I got the INFPs (both guys) to go on a mild ride is by telling them that I had bigger balls than both of them combined (and I am a female, lol).  
3	Movies - The "Before Sunrise, Sunset, Midnight" trilogy.	Is Ethan Hawk's character "Jesse" an ENTP?\n\nIt's weird to know Characters for nearly 30 years yet only have a total of 6 hours in reality. Before Midnight is Raw and real since they're in their 40s.. Well worth a afternoon.\n\n
2	Loved those movies, but it was a very long time since i saw those, so i cant properly type him.\n\nWe should keep those kind of post incognito, or were going to giveaway our love for romantic comedys and who knows which kind of peopple theat will atract.
1	Huh, never thought about that. Looking back on it, yes, I could see him as an ENTP. 
2	Am I an ENTP?	I have just started getting my toes wet on this MBTI stuff. I find it very interesting but at the same time don't really know what any of this means. I took the 16 personalities test and it said I was an ENTP: 1st not sure what being an ENTP implies, 2nd how can I tell if I a really an ENTP, 3rd Does being an ENTP explain my emotional retardation, 4th Any ENTP pro-tips
4	It’s the journey, not the destination.\n\nThere’s several pages of stuff about entp on 16per.  How much of that resonated with you?
2	> 1st not sure what being an ENTP implies \n\nImplies that you're an intuitive thinker. \n\n> 2nd how can I tell if I a really an ENTP \n\nLearn about cognitive functions and see if it actually works with you. Just be honest with yourself. \n\n> 3rd Does being an ENTP explain my emotional retardation \n\nDepends on the level of your "emotional retardation" really. \n\n> 4th Any ENTP pro-tips \n\nI wish I had some honestly. 
2	It analysed you based on your answer. Take it a couple of time if it is needed, also keep reading. Usually for ENTP it is clearly accurate but I noticed certain personality getting different results. Focus on the question and answer them correctly and honestly. It increases self awearness, helps on validating, normalizing, understanding others too. 
2	Pro tip: try to learn to show the people around you love in the way that they understand it when you can. Or, at the very least, try to explain that you're odd in the way you treat relationships and emotions. This may be more of an issue for women than it is for men, but I have found that purposely trying to show others that I care about them has helped me. I tend to be pretty immature with my approach (think the cards 5 year olds make for their parents), but the people who know me appreciate the effort and know it's uncommon for me.
2	Best way of detirmining MBTI type	I was thinking the other day while peeling potatoes how you could notice what type someone is based on how they peel a potatoe. In other words: how they go about completing a task. This goes well with the idea that a person is defined by their actions. But i dont agree that a person is defined by their actions. I agree that -only the actions- a person take is what will be percieved by others. So what people will percieve is the actions of this person and with that information they make up their mind about what that person is. But this is alright in my mind, that MBTI type is something that only works in the context of atleast two people. Question is can you define a person exclusively according to what they do and not how you percieve them? But you cant know the actions someone take without percieving them. \n\nReason im asking is because i am starting to come under the impression that a person can switch type. I used to think that was stupid, because it would invalidate mbti. But from my experience it seems reasonable. Everything changes, so why not character traits, or mbti type. 
3	It people’s MBTI type could change with your perception of them, it would be a fairly worthless concept I think.   Personality is intrinsic to person and needs to be described that way.  That is why a lot of mbti type descriptions are poor.\n\nEntps are clever, charismatic individuals who.....\n\nWell, what if I don’t find you to be particularly clever or charasmatic?  And what if someone else finds you to be very clever and charasmatic? \n\nBut you’re just you in both cases.\n\nI think you can predict mbti type from behavior, but, you have to realize that just about *any* behavior can arise from *any* function stack.  Entps and intjs have completely different functions, yet both have the same gamut of human emotions and behaviors.  So it takes careful examination and an analysis to sort that out and one should always be mindful of type statistics.   7 out of 10 people are Sensors.   And most Ns have average intelligence.  \n\n
2	Many ways of changing - using more of your unused cognitive functions. Changing your persona. Challenges and setbacks. Neuroplasticity. Diseases and madness ...\n\nBest way to determine MBTI type? Meet a lot of people and note down their behaviours. It should be obvious after a while.
14	Mentorship	Hello!\n\nI'm a young professional ENTP looking for an ENTP mentor for some career advice and to point me in the right direction. It's been difficult so far - started off in PR, but found it unfulfilling and unchallenging. I worked very hard and demanded more but was often left feeling bored and unstimulated, even with around 8+ accounts. I'm a very hard worker, love being challenged and am seeking the right challenge to dive into and run with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm mostly interested in consulting (still discovering what kind), finance, venture capitalism or anything of the sort that lets me figure out complex puzzles, wear different hats, work long hours and dedicate myself to the cause. I'm open to any and all suggestions or advice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n&#x200B;
27	Why not find a mentor who has traits that the ENTP is poor at. Pairing with another ENTP is just an echo chamber 
6	Consulting can be very rewarding for driven ENTPs! I’d be open to sharing some mentoring advice over LinkedIn messaging. I’ve been in consulting most of my career and run my own company now. While I get what another commenter meant about finding a type with other strengths, I overcame a lot of the ENTP weaknesses before I learned I am ENTP. I actually tested as ENTJ for a few years before I worked with a professional typer and learned about the cognitive functions. I’m definitely ENTP. 🙃\n\nAre you on LinkedIn?
4	Hey, feel free to post this in the dedicated mentorship thread! https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/a5yupz/monthly_mentoring_thread_december_13_2018/
2	I know one in Aus
1	I am an engineer and an entp. I don't think I am a good complimentary match as a mentor. But if you run out of options, feel free to hit me up.
1	Borderdom is part of Entp, it is not only the type of career but also the work environment and the company magment style matters. What about stock brokers, they reported high satisfaction. 
1	I'm a software engineer and enjoy (and despise) the complexity of figuring it problems on developing apps. \n\nIt  matches a vision -> end goal satisfaction that I enjoy very much. However, being not 100% always dedicated to details or being super disciplined has sometimes led to feeling burdened (esp. when working in a large corporation). \n\nI'm currently working in a startup as the sole engineer so it's awesome and daunting to have the challenge of figuring everything out, weighing pros and cons and ultimately making things work with the information I have to the best of my ability and foresight. \n\nI did freelance for a year+ and personal projects and that was also satisfying.\n\nBefore this I worked in a startup and an ad agency in analytics and data analysis.\n\nHappy to chat.
1	Have you considered not being yuppie scum? 
0	Have you ever stood as an entp, editing a Wikipedia password or something similar? does it make sense for Ne?	What is the disadvantage of this idea? will other people and their judgments destroy a new slogan before searching for a connection with other people in the world? Is wikipedia really a network of ideas (NE) or censura (judning)? where do we live?
3	What
4	Do you think that MBTI types should be done for each country ?	I think that all the types have a different version in each country. For example, the way of being of an ENTPs in the United States is different than those from France, therefore  there  should be sub-types for each type of personality. Each sub-type will have  specific characteristics from the country of origin, making the percentage of each personality type in the population to vary between different countries. What do you think ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: speaking spanish makes my head hurt.
5	I think F is the function most sensitive to culture.   Obviously what Fe finds acceptable for a Muslim in Afghanistan is different or even contrary than from a liberal atheist in England.\n\nBut the principle of action of Fe is the same in both cases.  That’s why it’s important not to make descriptions for the functions or the types that rely too heavily on particular behaviors that might have more to do with specifics traits non-intrinsic to personality such as cultural norms, intelligence, or social status.\n\nA more general example would be describing ENTPs as clever or INFJs as insightful.   Most ENTPs and INFJs have average intelligence and that limits the extent of their cleverness and insightfulness. Moreover smart ESFPs, etc. can be just as clever and insightful.\n\nAs far as there being different percentages of types in each country, I think it’s likely roughly the same.  The sheer amount of mistypes would hide any effects of genetics or cultural influences.\n\nI think in heavy Fe cultures like Japan the social pressure to conform just makes you adapt to the social rules.  It doesn’t limit the number of Fi types, it just limits how they can express themselves.  
5	Types are just a label for someones cognitive functions. The 16 types are all possible combinations of those functions.\n\nHas nothing to do with culture \n\n
1	What leads you to believe that cognitive functioning changes between boarders? 
1	Your Myers-briggs type is nature, not nurture. Your culture, or how you were raised do not affect what type you were born with, though it can influence other aspects of your personality that may cause you to *think* you are a different type because that function was developed more so than it would have otherwise because of the people around you, like if you were raised in a family where your parents showed a lot of affection and taught you to be kind and gentle as a high priority, and you had traits like that usually associated with feelers, that doesn't mean you *are* a feeler, your just reflecting what you were taught as a child

14	What am I?	Hi, this will be my first post in this subreddit.\nI discovered MBTI a few years and have been fascinated by it since ever, labeling people sounds fun so I tried to test myself.\nIt came out as ENFP and some things made sense but it just never felt quite right.\nLater on I tried again the various tests, this time I think I answered more honestly instead of replying based on my expectations of myself.\nAnd as you can see now, it resulted in ENTP, but now I'm even more confused than before. I can relate to most of the things on here.\n\nMy focus is crap, I impulse buy things that I think might be useful only to put them aside after 2-3 uses, I'm daydreaming all day, I hate my monotonous job but can't bring myself to start looking for something else because I'm always procrastinating, I want to improve myself yet I keep reverting back to my old self, I want to learn everything but I lose interest halfway through it, I want to know people but think most of them are stupid and basic conversation are boring, I'm arrogant yet insecure.\n\nWhat is wrong with me. Am I destined to be a slave of my mind? \n
2	Your description could easily be ENTP or ENFP.  Both have dominant Ne and inferior Si, which can result in a scattered nature with many ideas yet few finished projects along with the seeming inability to change that pattern and learn from past mistakes.  The difference is the middle Auxiliary and Tertiary functions.  The ENTP uses Ti and Fe, and the ENFP uses Fi and Te.  I would suggest reading more about the cognitive functions to determine it for you for sure.  Check out this page:   https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/theory . Best I have found yet for a comprehensive database of cognitive function theory.  \nYou could also be a Highly Sensitive Person.  I am ENTP but also highly sensitive so some of my characteristics are more emotional than most ENTPs but cognitively I am an ENTP.  Mental illness or being immature with poor function development can also skew results.
2	You probably have ADHD
1	Yeah... That sounds pretty entp to me. Very similar to me. No real focus. Go with the focus and whatever catches your eye first. Pro tip. Try and work hold off Jon projects till you have planned then out in your head. Then buy materials then start. Else you will hit a snag and be bored af before you even get going on something.

14	2 Articles ENTPs Will Definitely Appreciate	The following articles diverge from the "find your one true passion as early as possible" narrative. \n\nWhy Being a Jack of All Trades Is Preferable\n\nWhy "Early Optimization" In Life Is Not Preferable\n\n[https://fhww.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/19-tim-ferriss-the-top-5-reasons-to-be-a-jack-of-all-trades.pdf](https://fhww.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/19-tim-ferriss-the-top-5-reasons-to-be-a-jack-of-all-trades.pdf)\n\n[https://fhww.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/25-26-27-kevin-kelly.pdf](https://fhww.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/25-26-27-kevin-kelly.pdf)
7	> And to start off, as I often do, with a quote. This is from one of my favorite writers of all-time, Kurt Vonnegut, and it goes as follows: "Here is a lesson in creative writing. First rule, do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show that you've been to college." I have the habit of using dashes in the same way, so I like to read this to remind me not to use that crutch. \n\nOkay, I take issue with this. Semicolons are great. If everyone used semicolons, comma splices wouldn't be such a problem.\n\nEvery time you write, \n\n> I love that brand, I use it all the time.\n\nyou ACTUALLY mean,\n\n> I love that brand; I use it all the time.\n\nSo don't tell me not to use semicolons.  The world wouldn't be so rife with comma splices if semicolons didn't have a well-deserved place in the English language. People are just too scared to use them, so they use commas instead. (Which, of course, is incorrect AND COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.)\n\nGrammar rant over.
3	A lot of ENTPs complain of their "lack of focus." The articles diverge from the "find your one true passion as early as possible" narrative. Worth a read.
3	I really liked the jack of all trades one\n\n"Jack of all trades- master none" should really not deter anyone from continuously learning new things. The amount we can learn is not limited by the size of our brain, but by the amount of time we have in our life. And how much do people just spend jacking - off, holding the line, waiting to progress. \n\nAlso I agree, life is a "full context" sport and that you can derive utility from combining different skills together. 
3	I can see "Tim Ferriss" in the url and already know a lot about that guy from reading his book "The 4 Hour Work Week". I can definitely say why it had an appeal to me with the mindset of an ENTP as it's about maximising your free time while having a business on the side. It made me realise "then I will have enough time to work on my passion projects!". His podcast is pretty good too if you're into business management but honestly I care more about the project itself than the business part.

1	It's a wood engine. Either he's making steam, or using the wood gas directly. Nothing new, although putting it on a bike is unique, because it's stupid dangerous from the fire, which appears to be directly under the crotch. 
3	What would likely happen in a romantic relationship between two ENTPs?	In a relationship where one person is an ENTP, the ENTP often gets bored. What do you think would happen between two ENTPs? Would the exciting, adventurous personalities ignite off of each other? Would they constantly be arguing? Would they really “click” because they both finally feel like someone understands them?
14	I read somewhere that it’s really fun in the beginning, but eventually they kinda just burn each other out.
9	I think it’s a perfect match. I think they’d argue but it wouldn’t get bitter because they’d know not to take each other too seriously/not to take disagreement personally. I think the bluntness would be appreciated too. I’ve never dated an ENTP but I want to:)
8	I've been dating one for over a year. There's a lot of playful banter, for starter - humor plays a large role in our relationship. We are always trying new things, since we both despise routines, and that expands to pretty much every field: dates, sex, etc. We know both of us need some space every once in a while, so there's no need to keep in touch all day nor do we need to be together everyday - we often hang out with friends without our SOs and that's perfectly fine. There's no clinginess, no jealousy, no drama.\n\nI've no idea why people keep insisting an ENTP relationship involves a lot of arguing. I have never had a \nsingle fight with him. We are both pretty chill.\n\nAlso, the sex is great.
8	The house would never be clean.\n\nI have met a few ENTP women. They are quite literally to high maintenance to even warrant trying.\n\nI have a feeling it would be a kind of degenerate relationship.
4	Theorically and stereotypically it would be seriously fucked up relationship, since both would just do talking, but there would be almost no action, their housing would be insanely unclean and messed up, too much promises about future and other things, but 0 effort of doing anything, lots of existential crysis, lots of drugs abuse, fucked up morality. Practically it would really depend on people and how disciplined they would be, but this probably doesn't really matter, since almost nobody here in this sub care about real things, and it's all about sick bants, 0 guilt, and almost next to none responsibility.\n\nWithout sensors and NJs you guys are cucked and fucked in many ways.
3	How many times do we have to go over this?\n\nIf both the individuals in a relationship have well developed characters, then the cognitive preferences do not pose as great a resistance.\n\nHowever, comparatively few individuals develop strong characters, and thus, PRACTICALLY speaking, such relationships involving two of the same kind will multiply the "blindspots."\n\nWhen the pain from the "blindspots" becomes unbearable, the relationship sputters to an end.\n\nApply these principles to any relationship. \n\nThe end. \n\n(But probably not for good) sigh
5	I have met some Entp femaales theyre were mirroring every move i tried, we started mirroring every 'game'' we played. It was intriguing as fuck because those women were incredible perceptive, and i think subconsciously very challenging, like u could tell they wanted something different but that they didnt knew it, and at the same time i didnt knew what they wanted aswell.\n\nSexually they were all extremely sexual, and also on the good very kinky and non traditional,all the other E\_\_P ar way more traditional, enfp women ar traditional on an idealistic sense except for the exceptons but Enfp ar way more idealistic, they idealize relationships and always get disapointed when reality doesnt much their dreams, and as an Entp even if i could match those expectations theres no bigger turn of for me, ill disapoint on porpuse, Entp women were not idealistic on this sense, they accept u as u ar,when i was younger i was more nto warmer woman, now that im older i can see it could work but before not so much.\n\nEntp women ar by far more complex than any other female i have ever met, they have this absurd depth about them that i cant explain here, because it was like each of them had this unique perception about life and about existance, theyre also very caring and protective,they show that they care in different ways, not in a traditional way like more feelsy woman.They care in an absolutely non traditional gender role way, theyre talking to the u unfiltered so they dont conform to the ur the man thing, they actually take matter on their own hands if they perceive something wrong, this was extremely atractive.I found that most women, have this expectations about u, about how u present urself, and it takes a lot for them to care about u, they ar more into u not showing any vulnerability that will make them discard u, entp women kinda seek those vulnerabilitys without giving the feeling they will like u any less for them.\n\nRelationships with Entps for me, were this incredible mix of lust,mindlike challenge,incredible and continuoslly big insights, but also the problem was that we were both like competing to be less invested than the other, my own deffects got augmented, it got exhausting quickly but i also think it was because the more inmature we ar the biggest problems we have and the more we dislike all of that being reflected back at us.\n\nthe truth is Entp females ar the only type of female who have the perception to truly get me, and this is probably the most atractive thing someone else can have, umparalled perception, but there was a lot of drama, and a lot of tension for no reason at all.I could see it working good, but it would take a lot of maturity on both parts, way more than with any other pairing.
3	My second husband was an ENTP, it was amazing at first, we went on absolutely **crazy** adventures, we went hitch-hiking, train hopping, large game hunting, were deeply connected, we had such a passion for each other, we used to talk for hours about the most esoteric things, about taking over the world together, the sex was amazing, experimental, increasingly intense. When he he proposed, we eloped the next week.\n\nThere was 0 stability in our relationship. We were both early/mid 20's, he was a musician and I was finishing my masters degree, money was tight and things became very stressful.\n\nAfter about 2 years things slipped into a GD nightmare, fights about the most minor things would turn into world shattering dramas, both of us started drinking for keeps, and doing drugs. Where we started going on adventures together we got into a situation where neither one of us cared what the other was doing or planning, both of us would be gone for days at a time without texting each-other, eventually the only time we could be together without trying to destroy each other emotionally was if we were fucking, our sex life turned into that of a porno (and not in a good way)... I took a job with MSF oversees, we never spoke to each-other after that, eventually he met someone else and mailed me divorce papers, I mailed him the rings, lawyers handled the rest. I saw him once in a mall about 6 years later I just ducked into a shop to ashamed to look at him. \n\nI have never loved or hated someone so much in my life.
4	I wouldnt know, but I think it would consist of\n\n- Violent arguments infused by pride, ego and insecurity \n- Mutual annoyance\n- Lack of organization\n- Possibly lack of self-development for both (this could also be boosted though, depends what the global focus is on)\n- Neglect of health\n- Possible financial issues\n\nbut also:\n\n- generally excellent communication\n- excellent functioning as one unit\n- lots of fun\n- high intimacy\n- genuine connection \n\nIts generally a superposition of the strengths and weaknesses of the respective people. So if both have their shit together, organization, finance, health and self-development will be less of an issue, however pride and ego might be more of an issue. This applies to more or less all traits.\n\n
2	I think it's better with an ENFP because they still have the fun Ne but at least they are likely to get some shit done and are more functional with their Te. I would not wanna date another version of me. That would be boring.
2	I’m an ENTP and my opposite sex best friend is also an ENTP. There was initial attraction early on, but we never fully acted on it and just ended up being close friends for the past several years. \n\nShe’s a looooot of fun to be around and more affectionate than any other girl I’ve met, but she’d be a nightmare to date. Her relationship with her previous ESTP boyfriend was explosive af and annoying to witness. \n\nWe’re usually on the same wavelength, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen her admit she’s wrong about anything and she’s super aggro and confrontational even about minor things. I’m quite well versed in things like psychology and communication and I meditate regularly to maintain my chill, so I know better than to engage when I see her ego acting up, lol. There’s no winning in those scenarios and right/wrong has nothing to do with it. She can never “agree to disagree”, so I just humor her and let her believe what she wants. I took the bait like three times in the five years I’ve known her and those were probably the most explosive and ego driven arguments I’ve ever had in my life. Wew. \n\nBut 98% of the time we get along and she’s like the female me. If we dated we’d definitely annoy each other and we’d probably also enable each other because we’re both degenerate junkies with ADHD whose lives are a mess. I tend to behave more and get my shit together around other girls or around my ENTJ bro. 
1	Depends on how developed each individual is honestly. \n\nI don't think two stereotypical and kinda unhealthy "lolol, i need my daily dose of argument" ENTPs with little to no regards for responsibility would work out very well. \n\nThough, if both are more developed and are able to ground themselves at times there shouldn't be an issue really. 
10	What are undeveloped ENTPs like?	INFJ here. I’ve heard younger ENTPs were less in-tune with feelings compared to older ones. I’m trying to find one irl, but I’m not sure if that’s a good idea. What are younger ENTPs like?
18	An undeveloped ENTP is like any other undeveloped type: a kid. Think about this type of question and the context you hear it in. Do you hear people asking what undeveloped ISFJs are like? Or undeveloped ESTJs? The answer is no, because the question doesn't make sense. The only reason ENTPs get slapped this this shit is because they're NT types, and it's especially NTs people consider to be "undeveloped". Because they're a) a thinker (and hence, as people see is, lacking emotions) and b) intuitives (which is fantastical and not confined to reality like sensors). \n\nIt's really the confluence of NT that people deem to be undeveloped, but it's not even a development per se. It's just an awkwardness - a personality archetype unbecoming of standard societal functionalities. Society is grounded in reality, so you expect the sensors to interact with it the most. Society is also people oriented, so you expect the feelers to have the logic that's pertinent toward society (since Feeling is people-oriented reasoning). \n\nSo in a sense, the NTs get a double whammy regarding fitting in to standard society, and that's why they're seen as "undeveloped". But really, what this question of development is seeking is "how do I get an NT to conform to societal customs?" Or, in other words "How do I turn an NT into an SF type?" The answer is: you can't. Because then they'd be an SF type.\n\nThere is nothing to develop as far as MBTI goes. If you're an immature shithead, that's beyond the scope of MBTI. If you're a kid, that's beyond the scope of MBTI. MBTI is merely meant to categorize and sort people into 16 personality boxes. It doesn't make sense to talk about development, because what exactly should they be developing *toward*? Using their dominant functions? Well, by the very nature of typing, if they're an ENTP, they necessarily use Ne and Ti as their dominant functions. So how does it make sense to suggest they "develop" what they already adroitly use? \n\nAn adult ENTP may appear very different from a young ENTP because they've entered the world of adulthood. As a kid, you can get away with being forgetful, or sticking your head in games for the day. As an adult, if you're playing Ocarina of Time all day and miss work, you risk getting fired. If you're an adult, and not paying attention to bills, your electricity gets turned off (and now you can't browse the internet). \n\nNeglecting Si (which is natural for an ENTP) has real world consequences as an adult, much more so than a child. But this isn't due to an ENTP being "undeveloped", this is from an ENTP being a perfectly developed ENTP, and needing to acclimate to the adult-world. \n\nIn the same light, using Ti also affects relationship building as an adult far more than being a child. As a child, first of all, your brain is still developing and your grasp of higher order logic is still poor. If your parents tell you to clean your room, and you ask why, you'll be unsatisfied when they tell you "because I said so." You don't yet know why it upsets you, because you can't string together the logic that they're your parents, and asserting they know better than you do at this point in time. Maybe it's meant to teach you a life skill that cleaning is important, but you don't see that. \n\nAs you get older, you begin to notice for yourself when you invite people over that you'll be judged for an unclean room. This doesn't justify your parents' logic that "because they said so" you should clean your room -- instead you've learned for yourself that having an unclean room has consequences. So it becomes "clean room, otherwise people will negatively judge you."\n\nBut this doesn't necessarily have to apply only to TP kids, because FP and FJ and TJ kids are more than capable of not understanding a "because I said so" argument. As they age, however, their understanding of this statement may change. An adult TP would say it still doesn't make sense and derive their own reasoning for why a room should be clean. An FJ however may incorporate this reasoning of "I know better" and perpetuate it (hence why ISFJs play the traditional "motherly" role).\n\n****\n\nIt's not that ENTPs are less "in-tune" with feelings, even as kids. It's that they prefer logical systems stripped from feelings. They may know what they're feeling and why "I'm upset that dad told me to clean my room and didn't explain why". The reason they get the reputation for not being in-tune with their feelings are twofold.\n\nFirstly, they argue back with reasons and questions. Why should I clean my room? "Because xyz". Why is xyz important? "Because abc". Yeah, but why abc? Etc. This gives a difficult kind of temperament to deal with, but it's just Ti. It gives a sense of opposition, and opposition is seen as antagonizing. So this antagonization is interpreted as neglecting the feelings of the arbiter of rules. So the arbiter instead defaults to authority "because I said so."\n\nThis leads to the second reason for why ENTPs are seen as not being in tune with feelings. When the authority cards is inevitably played (because often younger TPs will often lack the capability to see nuance in situations), they'll have an outburst. It's still an oppositional outburst, but it's more so about futility. It's a cry of helplessness. "I shouldn't have to do this, I don't even understand why I'm being told to do it. 'Because I said so' isn't even a good justification. if they can't explain it, is it really meaningful?" It's seen as essentially waving their dick around, and the ENTP may understand they're in a position of non-power. They know if they don't obey this authority, there are consequences. They have to perform their own calculus on whether these consequences are worth testing.\n\nAs the ENTP grows, however, they begin to see the nuance via personal experience. *Especially* so when they begin to date and begin selecting their own friends. Then the nuance begins to show itself, whereby other independent people with their own thoughts may see these unclean rooms. \n\n****\n\nThis unclean room is just a toy-example. Similar examples also apply for the younger ENTPs, and i chose to focus only on the room for consistency sake in the allegorical explanation of the functions. This analysis really applies to many of the ENTP stereotypes, for instance being reticent on relationships and friendships. \n\nHalf the crap you'll hear about "young" or "undeveloped" ENTPs is from mistypes who don't even understand how ENTPs operate. They instead cling to the "chaotic" stereotypes of ENTP or the "random" elements of the ENTP, without understanding where these stereotypes even stem from. So they may take their chaotic FP styles and think they're an ENTP, or their random SP elements and identify as an ENTP. 
22	I was very quiet and withdrawn; believed I was an introvert for most of my life. When I did speak, I said awkward things that seemed to weird people out. I was very spacey and just... out there.\n\nAt home, I was argumentative, but not "uncaring, callous, impulsive, abrasive ... " We're not all mindlessly destructive, although it does take a while to figure out human interactions and learn to not always procrastinate (still hard; procrastinating now).\n\nMy thought has been that I was just in super observation mode (Ne) for yeeears... just watching everyone and everything silently, not wanting to interact yet. I was just "sponging" for such a long time. My Ti kicked in in high school; I started analyzing the data I'd been acquiring. I really, really wanted to have more friends, but Fe was slow as fuck, too. I was in my 20s before I came out of my shell. Si, obviously, has always been weak... and mayyybe I'm kind of harnessing that, but FFS it's still difficult.
8	Why do you *want* an ENTP specifically?  Before you worry about how mature others are, I think you should examine your own desires a bit more carefully — or at least the logic of hunting for a good personality *type* instead of hunting for a good *person*.
4	I’m 17.  I’m very impulsive and I sometimes have trouble getting people to like me because I’m so blunt. I’m the type of friend you go to when you want someone who’s going to be honest with you. I have a big heart and get hurt easily but I pretend it doesn’t bother me because I hate acknowledging my emotions. I get in fights for no reason and I’ve had teachers call me contrary.\n\nThat being said I’m very motivated and will stop at nothing to reach my goals. I’m at the top of my class and I try so hard to be good at things.
5	> I’m trying to find one irl, but I’m not sure if that’s a good idea.\n\nIt's not, they're the worst type tbh. Besides, you don't want to fall for one of /u/Azdahak's traps and end up being his servant. \n\n> What are younger ENTPs like?\n\nWell, I think it's not about *"developing"* ENTPs (as if you could develop cognitive functions), but rather maturity and life experience gained over time. There are *way* too many other factors in need of consideration to illustrate what an ENTP would look like (I assume you mean a teenager to early 20s) such as upbringing, parental guidance, siblings, social environment, etc. Basically, it's very subjective. For example, an ENTP with supportive parents is going to behave differently than an ENTP with hardline authoritarian parents (in both scenarios let's say that the ENTP is a teen). \n\nBut, there are some general characteristics that I would highlight which are relevant to young ENTPs. There are mentions of a general social introversion (greater than when an adult) in this thread and I think a significant reason behind that is the social environment. A typical ENTP would be publicly schooled (side note: I have to draw on my personal experience a bit, which I hate to do, but oh well. Let me know if my assumptions are misguided) so a rigid education system along with well defined social groups brings about a different dynamic. I think ENTPs realize in some way, shape or form that they are different/weird pretty early on based on how their friends/classmates (sensors) socialize in a way that they cannot relate to (spoiler: this isn't exclusive to young ENTPs, obviously). \n\nAnyway, constructing this social environment is important so that if we place a young ENTP into it then it can describe what they may look like. A young ENTP is going to realize that they're essentially social outcasts. They might befriend another introvert or if they're lucky an extrovert adopts them (and if they're *really* lucky they run into another NT/TP). ENTPs are socially introverted compared to other extroverts so this results in a young ENTP who is really socially introverted. *But,* they can and will preoccupy themselves with other things (because school is usually not challenging enough when NeTi allows them to understand and analogize concepts rather quickly). A young ENTP would probably belong to a small group of ~~weirdos~~ friends and be way more engaged into a fantasy book, video game, or y'know..the internet? \n\nI think as systems become less structured such as in high school, postsecondary, and even some workplaces ENTPs become more and more willingly social. The more structured a setting is the more an ENTP will look outside of it (not always in the physical sense) to feed NeTi. But, when a system becomes less and less structured then that engages an ENTP because now they have some autonomy and can follow their interests. An important product of this is that if they're actively engaged in their environment then that instantly makes it easier for them to socialize with others and vice versa. That socialization is monumental because it develops their charisma, wit, critical thinking, empathy, etc. 
3	How young is "younger?" Also, maturity isn't necessarily dependent upon age.
3	I'm 25 and not sure what age range you're looking for but I definitely do NOT think I am a fully developed, healthy person. I'm always irritated by people, very quiet and withdrawn like someone else mentioned. I know INTP isn't my type as I'm more impulsive and using Ne too much. I'm trying to train myself to be more thoughtful about other people's perspectives and feelings. It's ironic because all things regarding freedom of speech, and the injustice of our social system is very important to me, so why must I be a dick towards people I work with. What questions would you like to ask us undeveloped ENTPs in particular?
3	How much younger is "younger ENTPs"? Because if you ask me, I think there's probably quite a few "younger" ENTPs that are also very much in tune with themselves. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut regarding your question, I'm 22 and am pretty sure I have a lot of things to work on. I'm definitely not in tune with my emotions. I don't think I'm actively neglecting them but I just don't know how to act upon them which makes at least romantic relationships really hard. Though, I'm not bad at socialising in general. I know my manners pretty well and I also know when to keep my mouth shut.   \nI also struggle a lot with responsibility, though I'm working on it and I'm making progress. - by that I mean just constantly avoiding the unpleasant moments of adulthood in favour for the fun activities. I'm insanely messy and unorganised. But that whole point is slowly getting better as I'm actively working on it right now.   \nI'm also getting annoyed about really dumb questions to which the answer could be found within 2 mins of using the internet aaaaand I'm loud about it. 
4	Uncaring, callous, impulsive, abrasive, argumentative (senseless, no strategy), defensive against criticism, abstract unconquerable goals, lazy with no work ethic/motivation. Basically the entp doesn’t start to bloom and realize the damage they’ve done until after Si and Fe develop. Most importantly Si. It makes for a responsible adult motivated by other things like a sense of overall well-being in life. Before Si develops, the laziness is intense and work is hard to complete or focus on. Also, the entp uses Si with Ti to evaluate the past and predict the future possibilities. Without Si developed, Ti is overrun by Ne and Ne goes nuts in the Fe environment recklessly. Social mistakes and egg on face situations can be common. But the more mistakes are made, the better all functions work because Si has a base of review before making decisions which decreases impulsivity. It’s goes from socially unflinching to cautious and contemplative real quick. Extraversion swaps and Ti becomes the gateway into developing Si and controlling Ne... eventually this leads to a balanced individual who achieves a sense of overall well being and order in life despite a lack of internal sense for Fi. It’s like spreading out a flame indiscriminately over a wheat field where it then burns in scattered patches vs focusing all of the flame into more focused points. At least that’s how it feels looking back on the transition from child to adult. Fe is always there, but it’s not used to benefit the environment, more so play with it. There’s no thought of benefiting the Fe environment for all, it’s just a free for all land of play that doesn’t always fear the consequences. Every thought and action gets dominated by Ne hero until empathy is valued by one of the functions be it Ti or Fe. (For me it was Ti first but I’ve seen other people say different). Ti creates its own logic to not only fit empathy into each decision, but believe that it’s necessary. 
2	I wish I would discover that I was an ENTP in "early" ages... by the way what is this thing you called feelings? Never heard of it !?!?
2	ill be honest I was aggressive as fuck. I was always fighting everyone now I do friendly debates but in my childhood people would tell me I have a death stare and hate me for fighting over every topic and also I acted like I knew it all. oh and I got into a lot of physical fights too in puberty but yea now im more calm collected introverted and chill to a default
2	I don't know about "underdeveloped", but i had a  really contradictory personality. I would tell random facts to people and start debates and yet I belived myself to be an introvert and had some form of social anxiety and did your typical nerd things. I was also quite empathetic/sensitive and knew how to be nice to others, but I was also clueless in the face of social hierarchy (and so was always nearer to the bottom) and unknowingly hurt others' feelings and acted weird in general. I was also book-smart but lazy, had an eye for the randomest, smallest details but couldn't notice things in my surroundings very well. I had deep, profound insights about how the world worked but didn't notice more ""practical"" things about the world until much later. I needed to do things with others and I had the most fun when I was having new experiences and going out with a bunch of people but I isolated myself in real life and grew bored and sought to make friends online. Dunno
9	Monthly Mentoring Thread - December 13, 2018	**The purpose of this thread is to help /r/ENTP participants to self organize into mentor/mentees, masters/apprentices.**\n\nPost a bio or check out the bios to see if there is someone who is a good fit for you, and send them a PM or reply right in the comments. Mentors, you can edit or delete your comment after you've found what you're looking for.\n\n**In the comments, post a short bio with:**\n\n* Your life story, but not too detailed for your stalkers,\n\n* The stage you are in your life,\n\n* The type mentor you are looking for,\n\n* The type of mentees you feel comfortable mentoring.\n
7	Potentially looking for mentees who are:\n\n* struggling to figure out what they want to do in life AND/OR\n* know what they want but feel stuck in getting there.\n\nI'm terrible at dealing with people with a victim mentality so if you feel everything is the world's  fault (or others' fault or whatever), you're better off with someone else.\n\nBit on my personal background\n\n* F, almost 30\n* Got BSc in Anthropology and Information Science and MSc in Business Process Management & IT (it's a mouthful)\n* Worked in IT for 6 years, 5 of which at a scale up (including leadership position) and 1 year as a consultant at a Big4\n* Quit and began as a freelancer in the fields of personal and professional branding, doing education and translation as side-gigs\n* Currently building an online and offline community around helping idealistic people find their goals in life and get unstuck in the process of getting there. 
3	\- Started university, about to head into 2nd semester. studying Business Management with Accounting & Finance. Was focused as in the first few weeks going to all lectures, typing up notes etc. Then started to miss them which lead to missing around just over a month's worth lectures...not great but know I can recover from that in 2nd semester.\n\n\- 20yo M, I know I can accomplish a lot more. Just trying to get out of this lack of motivation rut. To become that boss a\*\* motherfu\*\*\*\* that I visualise. So I can achieve my goals that I'm imagining such as go travelling, making money to give back to family and all that. \n\n \- Just looking for someone to keep me accountable, relight my drive to be a boss and help me if possible academically but mainly to develop in a personal manner to become the best person possible.
3	Hello,\n\nmale college student nearly 22 years old here,\nalmost finished with degree in Mechanical\nEngineering (pretty much BSed my way through high school and also college so far just to ‘get by’)\n\nI was very driven and intellectually ahead of my class from kindergarten to 5th grade and 9th grade to 11th. Other than that the rest of my life has been unhealthy habits of ignoring or procrastinating on the things I should be doing.\n\nI frequently change my mind on things, including my direction in life. I consider myself to be very gifted at intuition and observation as well as having a very strong imagination.\n\nI struggle with ADHD, anxiety and recently a bit of depression. My overall dream career is to become an inventor and patent my own inventions to sell for a decent living. \n\nI am generally optimistic about life, just at a point where I cannot follow through or stay consistent on the small steps I need to take to make myself truly happy (struggle with instant gratification).\n\nLooking for a mentor to help give insight and advice on how I can hone my intellect and focus it to achieve the great things I KNOW I can, as well as learn more about different aspects of the world.\n
3	Hello I was reading through the mentoring thread a few months ago, and was touched by those reaching out for help. It left a strong impression on me - as if there were clones of past me, future me, female me all in one space speaking to each other.\n\nI first discovered ENTP when they made us take the test in high school. Although the description instantly resonated with myself, their career suggestions made no sense at all. I mean wtf is an inventor? Is that even a job anymore? School just never clicked with me, and although i was popular and outgoing i really felt like i didn't deeply connect and had to make do with the people i was around. Anyways fast forward some years of voracious curiosity, reading philosophy, dropping out of college, building cars and robots "inventing" all sorts of different products, rejecting everything society accepts and piece by piece coming back to it on ENTP terms, there's still a lot for me to learn but there is a lot i have figured out the hard way.\n\nReading some of the stories from previous threads about career confusion in high school or college, being in an environment that is not stimulating, i've been there. Let me save you some time and wrong turns :)\n\nAbout myself:\n\n\- 24M- Designer (have worked on concept cars, self driving cars, and lots of other random stuff)- Studied "analytic" philosophy in undergrad- I play bass, keys, enjoying jamming with others- Noteworthy accomplishment: In college i got on top of the cafeteria table and chugged a bottle of whiskey\n\nWhat I'm happy to help with or chat about:  \n\- finding your career/calling  \n\- frustration with cultural environment  \n\- making meaningful friends\n\n&#x200B;
2	I am in an online coding boot camp and could use some help learning Ruby. I do business to business sales in merchant services. So, I could offer sales advice, as well as dating advice.
2	I’m a happy person.  Middle age and divorced.  Blond....  (I’m used to filling out dating profiles).  I don’t think I need a mentor or a manatee.  I would love to chat with someone who knows all about this type, others and characteristics that we are compatible with.  
2	I’m new here. \n\nI was going to write a post introducing myself, but I hadn’t got around to it yet. I feel like I’m just getting to know myself again after reading the post on this sub. I spent last night laughing at the memes because nothing has so perfectly described me. I felt like I’d just met 18,000 people just like me after so long feeling like an odd ball. I’m a 36 year old female and from what I gather... I’m a bit of a rarity. I’m incredibly smart and good looking (we all knew that, amirite?). Honestly, I’m hit on a lot, but I eventually scare people away (WTF is my problem?!) with my abrasiveness. \n\nI want to learn to embrace my personality. I have a lot of great qualities, but I’d like to improve as a person. \n\nI should add that I’m single and on Tinder. I saw that everyone had these “letters” on their bio which led me to the MBTI test a couple months ago. I only started reading about this a few nights ago and I’m a super noob. I still don’t understand the Ne and Si and feel like I should be watching the sound of music. \n\nEdit: thanks for the downvote asshole.

7	How to overcome confirmation bias when working on a problem. (Become a better troubleshooter)	Hello there! \n\nFirstly I’m going to use the term confirmation bias as I think it’s the closest term to the trap I fall down all so often! \n\nConfirmation Bias is the cognitive weakness that interpret/filter data, memories and language in order to support or strengthen your position, belief or understanding of a given subject. Regardless if you hold the truth or what you are obtaining is true. \n\nSo hopefully when I describe this that I want to improve in myself it will bring that little hindsight on at a much quicker pace! \n\nSo I quite often have to troubleshoot IT issues. Usually related to how our system works/should be working. What I find is that I typically get a fair idea about what I think is going on through relying on the audits, graphs and tests that we have at our disposal. The problem is that more often then I like I find that I get to the position that article A and article B are leading me here then I will work damn hard to prove it. Only to find out that I actually missed the mark completely later. \n\nSo if I am missing the mark so much what can I do to ensure that the breadcrumbs are actually helping me get to the truth and not leading me down a path of wasting time and maybe putting a step against my reputation? Is this something that maybe you have encounters and improved for yourself? 
10	Use "hedging words" while doing your troubleshooting. Instead of saying "I think the problem is A", say "This suggests that the problem is A".\n\nIt's a subtle change, but using language that pulls you out of being the subject of your troubleshooting allows you to separate your ego from the problem you are solving and keep the problem at the center of your process (rather than your image, reputation, whatever).\n
5	Youre just being driven by ego. Rather than intuition.\n\nThis is a very typical IT guy failing.\n\nThe reality is that if you are being led in the wrong direction while troubleshooting its highly likely that you dont fully understand the system you are troubleshooting.\n
66	It's a Wonderful List	Year after year, we always get the repetitive *"My (bf/gf/bff/fwb/bfffsm/mil/fil/milf/dilf) is XXXX what do I get them?"*   \n\nSo I've done my civic duty and compiled a masterlist of holiday gifts that will help woo the affections of whichever acronym best fits your scenario. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[**ENFP**](https://www.amazon.com/FANRENYOU-Joyful-Metal-Furry-Roleplaying/dp/B07J3B5FYH/ref=sr_1_3_s_it?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1544673035&sr=1-3&keywords=furry+tail): For that friend you know will never grow up from the manic pixie friendship is magic phase!

Just Let it Go and let them pretend to be all the Colors of the Wind... while also having the satisfaction of reminding them that doing so would be politically incorrect. \n\n[**ENTP**](https://www.amazon.com/Accoutrements-11657-Bandages-Jesus-Bandages/dp/B00BTGMS0Y/ref=sr_1_117?ie=UTF8&qid=1544673772&sr=8-117&keywords=gag%2Bgifts&th=1): They have no need for secular items as they’ve already transcended godhood.

4	These are supposed to be insulting and snarky but I genuinely want that.\n\nCracks me the hell up whenever people try to make posts like these that mock all of the stereotypes and attempt to roast everyone equally. Somehow, "nerd autist" is always the worst that anyone can come up with for us. Maaaybe with the occasional "virgin" thrown in there.\n\nNot the "insufferably arrogant prick that genuinely hates all people" like INTJ or "normie npc momfriend whose best and probably only talent is baking" like ESFJ.\n\nHey, I can live with that. And this weird green box thing. 
4	unironically my ISTP brother would fucking love that ~~as would my ENFP on-again-off-again girlfriend~~

1	Soo I was just browsing this subreddit and I happened across this post and this is the funniest thing I’ve ever read on this app that’s mbti related. Holy fucking shit. \n\nThanks for giving me 16 evil ideas. 😈 
8	Si-intervals to sustain long-term health in ENTPs	**Preface**    \n\n* I am by no means claiming to be an expert or master practitioner on MBTI. So if you want to understand MBTI on a higher level, the people I look to are /u/The_White_Baron & /u/Azdahak from r/entp - as I still consider myself a noob.     \n* The purpose of this post is to illuminate a potential pitfall for ENTPs, and a suggestion of how to combat it.    \n* It’s some thoughts that I had while trying to work on my own life. So I just wanted to share those thoughts as it might either inspire or help another/other ENTPs, and if just 1 person can get anything out of it. Well, then it was worth making it to me.    \n\n**When we talk about health**, we obviously all share certain needs as human beings. Like basic physiological ones.    \n\nExamples of physiological needs:    \n\n* Sleep  \n* Water  \n* Food  \n* Exercise  \n\nHopefully, we can all agree to no matter what MBTI type you are. Whether you’re black, white, Hispanic, or native American. Then we all have those needs.     \n\nWe can hopefully also agree that people sharing the same MBTI type can be very different and have different needs. They are obviously not carbon copies.    \n\n**But because this is an MBTI subreddit**, and we enjoy applying MBTI to learn about ourselves, others, and the world around us. We can hopefully also agree we could find some overall different needs in the different types on average. For example, an ENTP on average, probably have a good chance of having different needs than it’s cognitively reversed type, the ISFJ. We are stimulated cognitively and energized by different kind of activities. Which creates different, let’s call it “cognitive needs”.   \n\nFor example according to how I understand MBTI theory and based on personal experience, then:  \n\n* Ne + Ti = Gives energy / drains you the least      \n* Fe + Si = Takes energy / drains you the most    \n\nSo on an unconscious level, we’re naturally drawn towards pleasure and pushed away from pain. Which means ENTPs naturally end up spending a large chunk, if not the majority of their time using Ne and Ti. Based on the wording /u/The_White_Baron uses, we could call intuition for “fantasy”. So ENTPs together with other intuitive MBTI types, spend a large chunk of their mental state in “fantasy land”. We’re thinking about Ne-doms, and ENTPs think about “what could be”, rather than “what is”.      \n\nThe more you are in Ne’s fantasy land, the less you are in the real world. The more time you spend exploring ideas/concepts/the abstract/what could be (Ne), the less time you naturally spend being, in reality, doing tedious and predictable routine work (Si).    \n\nYou could make the same argument with Ti>Fe. The more time you spend trying to be accurate and get as close to what you consider the objective logical truth. (Ti) The less time you spend pleasing other people and ignoring logical inconsistencies to keep a harmonious social environment (Fe).  \n\n**You have probably heard of the saying: “Too much of a good thing”.** Which in reality just means doing a lot of things in excess might do you harm. Doing exercise in a balanced moderation might be beneficial, but if you run ultramarathons, and train like a maniac with too little rest. Then it could/would be harmful. You can transfer this logic to the cognitive functions of the ENTP as well. Spending too much time in fantasy land (Ne), will eventually lead to a neglect of reality. Which sooner or later through disease, either physically, which often is connected to the mental health as well, will force you to deal with it.    \n\nSo to be a balanced ENTP in theory, or any other MBTI type spending too much time in the intuitive world (N), neglecting reality (S), could potentially be more prone to these issues cognitively.    \n\nThat’s why even though we like it or not. We need our dose of reality to sustain our health in the long run. We might not need to spend as much time in reality as sensors do. But we at least need to do the bare minimum not to crumble in the long run. If you want to spend the most time using Ne + Ti, you also need to take care of business in reality. So for Ne + Ti’s sake, we need to pay tribute to Si or (S). Otherwise our weakness’ will throw a spanner in the works, so to speak.      \n\n**[This is a model I made to show health, without the necessary Si (S) attention in the life of an ENTP](http://prntscr.com/luirtu)**        \n\nThe idea is that you start out with a surplus of energy. (We need to start somewhere) So let’s imagine you as an ENTP wake up, and you only do what feels good, and natural to you. To me, it could be to turn on the computer and start browsing videos on YouTube with cats falling in funny ways. If I did that for 16 hours a day for a month, then, in the beginning, my energy would raise, and I would be stimulated. But quickly neglecting (S) eating, exercising and what not, would quickly make a massive drop and deteriorate in physical health, which would lead to a decline in my mental health as well. Spending 16 hours a day watching/reading stuff to stimulate Ne, and at the same time eating junk food, and moving minimally. After a month, I could probably not be in fantasy land (N) anymore, the pain of being there would simply be greater than the pleasure of being there. Because my entire body would ache, and my mind would be brain fogged and clouded.    \n\nSo that is why I thought of what I call “Si-intervals”, which as the word says, is doing Si-activities in short intervals, to maintain your health, and that you can be in fantasy land in a healthy, balanced and sustainable way. Si-intervals would be the Ying to (N) which is the yang of the ENTP.      \n\n**[So this is the same model, and approach just with Si-intervals](http://prntscr.com/luix5p)**    \n\nThis is based on a 24-hour timespan. The first thing you do in your day when you have the most energy is that you get the largest Si-chunk out of the way. In reality that could look something like:      \n\n* Wake up  \n* Drink some water  \n* Go to the gym/go for a run/exercise  \n* Eat  \n* Brush teeth  \n* Bath & hygiene    \n\nThat was like the largest, and potentially most time to consume Si-interval. Here I would already have set a nice tone for the rest of the day, and got rid of the most boring/tedious stuff first (Si).    \n\nThen most of you probably have school & a job from there. But imagine you just were at home. Then from here you could with good conscience spend time in fantasy land (N). Because you have done your (Si-homework) so to speak. You have done the minimum to sustain your physical health, which won't throw off your mental health later on.    \n\nBut of course, even after some time in fantasy land, you need to take breaks and do what is necessary again, in reality, to make sure you don’t crash. Like if you spend 50 minutes in front of your PC, it is probably a good idea to take a 10 min break, and in that break do another little Si-interval. You could be moving around, refilling your glass of water, do some laundry. Everyone could do that for 5-10 minutes, right?   \n\n**[The Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)** is what I personally experiment with at the moment, as you can decide how much time to be in fantasy land, before doing a Si-interval. I have been using [this](https://tomato-timer.com/) as a tool for some time now, with positive results.    \n\n**Another “small thing” that has helped me tremendously is to try to sneak some (Ne) into your Si-intervals.** For example, when I clean (Si) I could put on some headphones, and listen to some podcasts/whatever and stimulate (Ne) that way. Instead of just being in reality and dreading how boring cleaning is. I could go to autopilot in the real world (S), to be somewhere else mentally. (N). In that way doing tedious and repetitive stuff might not feel as dull, or drain me as much. A little thing, which to me makes a gigantic difference. I nearly can’t go anywhere without my headphones listening to music/podcasts/whatever.    \n\n**The conclusion is just that we don’t need to spend the majority of our time in the sensing world,** but not giving it any attention whatsoever seems to be an Achilles heel for ENTPs, myself inclusive. It is simply too easy to go on full autopilot, live unconsciously, and end up indulging in too much of a good thing, just to end up broken, and being forced to go back, to do things “the right way”, and find balance. Which is a shame in the end? Because it gives us less time to do what we are good at, which are Ne + Ti.    \n\n**I have by no way mastered this, or “got my shit together”.** But what can I do but keep trying? The alternative is being out of balance and diseased physiologically and mentally. Which obviously is something to avoid if you want to live a pleasurable life.  \n\n**I know life is much more complex, and with many more layers than I laid out here.** But I can't cover everything at the same time, without it taking a half year, and I want to keep it simple as of yet.      \n
5	> Another “small thing” that has helped me tremendously is to try to sneak some (Ne) into your Si-intervals. \n\nI almost always listen to music when doing Si activities: exercising, cooking, cleaning, commuting and even showering. Music is such a big part of my life that I can't understand how there are people that just don't enjoy listening to music. I use it to make the boring moments of life epic.
2	Very relateable and very true!\n\nI think you can Ne-Ti whilst taking care of shit. I daze off quite a bit throughout the day but I get shit done when I have to. Actually Ive noticed *not* listening to music helps me not daze off and get shit done more effectively. I mean its chill to listen to jre whilst cleaning your room, but if you only have to clean your room  and have the time, then it doesnt really matter how long you take. But I guess a lot of people struggle, definietly me, with the fact that on most days I have little time and am to exhausted(lazy) to make time and actually cook or exercise properly. Other people do it. Other people actually manage to get more done and exercise and eat healthy and stay organized. Now I dont expect to be those other people, but I genuinely wish I had those means or knew the trick to rail through life without getting sidetracked. I guess its just steady fight for self-improvement. Punctuality also ties into this.\n\n\nBut i guess we all just like projecting ourselves into different lives, reasoning through the logic of the physics of a process, or wonder about the future.
2	You use the tertiary function to recharge, actually.
1	TL;DR ?
8	I've gotten annoyed with people very easily lately. Which I usually don't...	So, I (22/ENTP/F) noticed recently that I get annoyed with people surprisingly easily. I keep finding myself having to think like 3 times before I open my mouth to make sure that I don't say anything unreasonable. And irony is, I get even more annoyed with myself for having such a short temper.\n\nI have always never really "liked" people (rarely mind the individual however), but this is new. I was just wondering if you guys know if there is something I can do about this.\n\nLike... Almost everything ticks me off, and I have to take a breather, just to not take my anger over the wrong people. Plus, it blurries the lines with what I have a "right" to get annoyed with and actually speak out about. \n\nI hope this makes sense? And that you guys might know about something that may help.\n\nThank you in advance. 
10	I'd sit down and examine what's going on in life.  When I get like that (26/f/entp) it's usually because there's some other stressor that I am ignoring.  I get anxious or stressed about something totally unrelated and it comes out as being a short-fused angry person.  Then I cry, but that may just be me.
4	I've got just the same thing and no idea where it comes from. It's at point where I see that I push people away (those closer to me) , cause I can't be in their presence and risk saying something that once said, will be impossible to take back. When angry I can get very vicious with words. And I don't want to snap at them because there's no logic in it, they didn't do anything particular to me. 
2	Take some time off if you can. I'm also 22, F, ENTP and usually that is what happens if I keep acting against my own needs and don't get time to do what I want. \n\nThere was something wrong with my power in my apartment and it took forever to get an electrician to look over it, so I was at my parents place in order to shower, get warm meals etc. and while I didn't find it very stressful, the same thing happened. I was insanely annoyed and snappy towards everyone for no real reason. \n\nSo yeah, if possible treat yourself and take some time off! \n\nI hope you're feeling better soon!
2	Why would you say something unreasonable? \nThat to me sounds like something causing stress... hence all kinds of feelings.\nTry daily meditation silencing the mind for at least more than 5 minutes .
1	You posted earlier about your ESFJ grandma, right? How is that situation going? Still stressful?
1	I go through this. It comes and goes in hormonally influenced phases. I have a habit of purchasing pregnancy tests and obsessing about when my menstrual cycle is about to occur when I start thinking I'm surrounded by a bunch of brain washed retards. There's always a pretty reasonable cause for the sudden instability. This too shall pass. 
1	Could this possibly have nothing to do with personality and internal/external functions? Look a little deeper.
1	Simple! try to understand their motivations behind their actions/words & that will help
1	I've actually been having a very similar experience to this recently as well. For my entire life I've always had one of the longest fuses out of anyone I knew and I was proud of it! But recently I've been really quick to snap at the smallest of inconveniences and others' stupidity. \nI can always rationalise why I shouldn't lash out and snap, but recently my control over that is pretty weak. 
10	A question for ENTPs with (at least somewhat) stable careers	How did you decide on your current job/career? I'm mostly looking for people who are satisfied in their chosen role and don't want to quit anytime soon. \n\nI assume most of you, like me, have lots of different interests. Did you just give up on the things that weren't your chosen career? Do you still pursue them as hobbies? How did you choose which one would be your main focus?\n\nLots of questions, I know. I'm just tired of feeling like I want to quit my job a month into it, just because there's other stuff I want to do. 
9	I've probably read all career threads on this sub and it looks like that ENTPs in STEM careers seem to be the most satisfied. This shouldn't be surprising as these fields require a good deal of problem-solving. Apart from that I also saw that ENTP consultants were quite happy. Lots of ENTPs recommend to not only focus one thing, you can easily thrive in two or three things at the same time.
7	I started my own business. I think it's a perfect fit for my personality because I can do 20 different jobs if I want to, and there's always the opportunity to learn something new that I can apply to my business. 
5	My second and third occupations had been surviving poverty, and surviving the drug addicted dregs that were my family. (Guns, drugs and lies!  Oh it is seriously better than television best experience ever. Totally detrimental to healthy happy supported success however)\n\nSo when I had to drop out of university because my house filled with carbon monoxide, and my mom killed her self. I fell back on the idea of carpentry.\n\nI had a delivery via Craigslist business. Using carshare full sized vans in a Metro area. Profitable, enlisted my neighbours kid to help. \n\nI had been designing jewellery boxes, and wine gift boxes. Easy to make in house. \n\nWorked in a furniture factory, learned classical chairs and tables.\n\nNow I have my own renovation business. \n\nCabinetry.\n\nRec-rooms.\n\nLaundry rooms.\n\nCustom television entertainment areas\n\nArt and craft stations\n\nMushrooms\n\nGlass displays\n\nRoom separators\n\nSecret safes\n\n(I haven't done a Bar because I can't follow conventions very well... So it seems intimidating)\n\nNow that I'm not pre occupied with survival;\nWe just got a house. Soon to be expanding the horizon with my own shop, aquaponics and off grid power generation. With some luck maybe I could export some of the successes I stumble upon. Can't wait! \nWe move in 3 days.\n
2	I work as a QC Tech for a medical manufacturer and even though the job itself is boring as fuck, I have a *lot* of downtime during testing to surf the Internet and research stuff that is interesting.
1	Opening a doorslam from the outside is it possible or even worth it? Pondering.. any XP? for the lulz	Opening a doorslam from the outside is it possible or even worth it? Pondering.. any XP? for the lulz
7	An INFJ doorslam? You mean that thing that they glorify over on their subreddit? No, it’s not worth it. Don’t give them the satisfaction of trying to open it back up just so they can keep playing “martyr” in their mind. \n\nI don’t get the hoopla behind an INFJ doorslam. It’s literally just something that other types are capable of doing *before* they get screwed over while INFJs only ever seem to do if after they’ve been screwed over. For a type that claims to get and understand people so well, you’d think they would know how avoid people who are going to hurt them.
3	I thought this said doorjam and was like, pfft you could probably push hard enough. 
3	INFJs don't sinbin you, they consign you to eternal damnation. You are forever marked, there is no forgiveness, only temporary tolerance.\n\nIf it's forgiveness that you want, then you'll have to find yourself someone with Fe somewhere else on the stack. 
4	Someone doesn't want to talk to you and you are considering bothering them?  I vote no.  Lol I have unintentionally bothered a few infjs who weren't fans of me.  They can be so intentionally hard to read.  But yeah once a Fe dom/aux has actually expressed that they don't want you around, forget about it.  
2	An INFJ door slam? Nah, it’s generally pretty closed once they close it.
46	Is the saying “Jack of all trades, master of none, but still better than a master of one.”A pure ENTP saying?	I just looked this up and had to laugh! It’s funny I used to say it all the time at work about myself at work not realizing, until now, that it was originally meant to be derogatory. I loved the saying because it fit my personality so well. I also found, when I looked it up, that we are in good company as it was originally used against Shakespeare lol
40	"The Jack of all trades;\n\nthough a master of none;\n\nis oft-times more useful;\n\nthan the Master of one"
35	Jack of all trades, master of none\n\n... unless you're a polymath who's not yet quite done.
21	I think it’s an xxTP thing in general and to a lesser extent also an xxFP thing. Can’t say I know one single TP who would ever be interested in staying on one path for their entire lives or doesn’t get interested in a thousand different subjects.
8	I came up with a good version the other day: "Jack of all trades, master of proving it."
5	Jack of all trades, master of some
4	Master of seeking simple underlying structures that might explain many things -- trying to know the maximum amount of things by learning the minimum number of simplest rules.
2	I'm probably ENFP, but this is absolutely me!
2	Absolutely not a bad thing. \n\nWhen I was younger, I asked my father who he thought would win in a battle to the death- james bond or jack bauer. We had both seen all of 24 and all the bond films (at the time).\n\nHe chose bond. Initially I disagreed, as bond rarely murders in cold blood and bauer did it regularly in a 24 hour period. \n\nHe explained that bauer is excellent at killing and stopping terrorists... by killing them. While he employs stealth a lot, he usually ends up using overwhelming brute force to reach his goals. \n\nBond, however, has 92 tricks up his sleeve. He knows a decent amount about nearly everything. Yes, a lot of his gadgets are hokey and unrealistic, but there are times when he doesn't have them or they fail, and he still wins in the end through improvisation. Sound familiar?\n\nBond uses disguises to walk in and out of places undetected. He can use his many skills and tricks to evade enemies. Bauer uses a fake name and prison record, and usually ends up shooting his way out of situations.\n\nBond wins 90% vs bauer, with the other 10% being when jack waits until james is at home and murders him in his sleep. \n\nI've got friends that are plumbers that can't do electrics, car mechanics that can't fix boats, and general handymen that could handle all of the above with a little reading.
4	I've always thought it was an intj thing myself. People relate that saying to me all the time. And honestly "master of none" seems a little harsh as if those of us that it refers to arent great at what we do. \n\nI'd prefer "we grant you the rank of master, but you are not on this council" to be more accurate. We excel at what we do but may be not the top 1% 
1	A "jack of all trades, master of none" is actually a master of the skill of learning and adapting. 
-1	We are masters at some stuff, we are great at making peoples ideals look stupid. we can tear down someone's walls and show them that there whole reason for living was wrong(don't though even though its fun). But yeah I'd say that quotes kind of applicable to us, we like to try new things and we have a hard time doing menial stuff so we tend to be somewhat knowledgeable one everything and we've tried almost everything we have the opportunity too. 
11	How do you know when you’ve legitamately made an ENTP angry?	How do you know when you’ve really just pissed them off?
56	We get quiet 
21	I think ENTPs are either very vocal about their anger, or cold and quiet.\n\nWhich one it is depends on the issue, whether emotional pain has been caused and or how worthwhile it is vocalizing dissatisfaction. \n\nGoing silent for an ENTP requires rigorous self-control, which kinda showcases the seriousness of the situation. 
15	If they’re visibly pissed off, then they’re mad.  There’s really no “really” here.   Of course that is in person.  If you mean over text, then i find some types are quick to make that assumption about the blunt, forward tones ENTPs can use.
6	One of the beauties of this type is you always know where you stand with them.\n\nAlso, it's not easy to make any xxTP angry. But if you do manage it somehow, they won't make any attempt to hide this.
6	Sometimes *I* don't even know when I'm pissed off.
5	Personally, I am pretty sure that if you get me to the point where I’m being physically violent then you know I’m livid, because that is literally my last resort in any situation- so much so that it has probably only happened once or twice in my life. Apparently I look dead behind the eyes and get quiet when I’m mad, though. Whatever that means.
3	Well, you know. 
4	Crows. They watch you. But they only watch. When anger swells so do the number of Crows nearby. People go missing. Crows watch people. People don't get found. Crows find you. \n\n;_;
3	It's hard to, trust me. 
3	When we stop talking. Generally what makes me the maddest is just blatant hypocrisy or when someone is so illogical and it affects my life. I just sit there saying nothing and since usually I'm a pretty happy guy people get terrified of that face lol. It doesn't happen often but when it does don't say anything to them because they probably want to strangle you.
3	If Entp avoid conversing with you, ignore 
2	Mostly I get quiet and simply withdraw.  When pushed and pushed I'll eventually snap and speak quite harshly.  Three times I have resorted to the threat of physical violence and yelling form anger.  \n\n1) Put him in a headlock in college when he wouldn't return my stuff.  He gave it back.  \n\n2) A drunk man tried to grab me in 7/11.  I didn't say a word, but I was ready to fight and it must have been clear because he backed off and apologized.  \n\n3) I was being harassed at work and I both yelled publicly at him and was ready to fight.  He backed down fast.
2	First they go quiet (Ti revenge plot), then they screw you over.
2	entp treat their relationships like people on a plane o-o. if you pissed them off, you're off the plane
2	I get suddenly quiet, and have a serious or more like, deadly expression which is extremely cold. at this time you might easily just be erased from our lives. and bc im never serious, when I really get serious then you pissed us off. personally, when I get physical im not even that mad, bc if I was that mad I wouldn't even get out of my way to get physical and lose any energy on you.
1	I give them one last chance to realize that I am actually angry by going into standby mode for few minutes (ofc they won't realize it anyway because they would not dare if they knew they get us angry)\n\nYou know the rest. Never-ending debating sessions, teardrops, cryings, screaming, pushing them to confess and accept, manipulations using the feelings etc...\n\nToo bad for me I rarely have this chance of fun :( My environment do not dare to make me angry. Sometimes they tell each other - in a low voice - not to talk back/answer me.
1	the ENTP probably has no idea that they're legitimately angry either. i get pissed or annoyed or frustrated a lot but angry? that shit requires you to stew over an emotion you know for sure you're feeling, and i don't find brooding worthwhile most of the time. i'm also really shit at figuring out what i'm feeling at any point in time, so i couldn't brood to the point of legitimate anger even if i tried
1	Indifference is what ENTPs hate most, and it is how they treat people who piss them off. \n\nSimilarly, NFJs hate feeling guilty, so it's the first thing they will try to make you feel if you piss them off.\n\nMe personally, I just won't care about them one way or the other. Mostly I will analyse them so I can see someone similar coming from a mile off and act preemptively to prevent any misunderstandings. 
1	irritated = visibly pissed off\n\nangry = quiet and completely serious
5	ENTPs, what have been the most annoying traits you've encountered in your past partners?	You can also state the partner's personality type for context although it isn't necessary
17	For me personally, the most annoying personality trait (in a partner) has to be constantly seeking approval for something.  I really value independence, so somebody who is always asking me if I think they've chosen the right major, or outfit, or fucking smoothie... is somebody I'm not going to stick around with for long.  I certainly don't mind conferring; it's just, there are some people who'll never make any decisions themselves unless you hold their hands through it, and that irritates the shit out of me.
32	Lying to make me feel better.
12	Clinginess and dependence\n\n
11	Avoiding conflict
9	Lying.  I fucking hate being lied to even if it's "for my own good."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso clinginess.  Had a boyfriend who used to follow me around, and I finally snapped and yelled at him to go away and stop breathing down my neck all the time.  Drove me crazy.
8	The most annoying thing was the way she always needed everyone to like her, and wanted everyones approvel while not being extroverted.\nShe was always annoyed by the way i dont accept half truths and then kept saying her half truth was the truth. ISFP ex and i am an ENTP
5	Not having any free will. Like everything they do has to be approved by someone 
5	Hahaha, as if my pride allows another person that close to me in my life...(god I’m so lonely.) 
4	ISFP: too positive and happy-go-lucky all the damn time lol... didn't realize until after we broke up that he was ISFP and I am ENTP. \n\nWe speak completely different languages. I would say the sky is blue, and he would come back with something like, "So, you're saying you think blue is better than other colors!" What?? No! The inferences drove me *nuts*, and he *could.not.comprehend* analogies to save his life. That Se/Fi combo really drains the fuck out of me.\n\nWe're friends and business partners now. We actually get along quite well in this platonic arrangement... and I would never consider him as a romantic partner again. I can only take his over-the-top giddiness in small doses haha... like the hyper, talkative nephew you enjoy for one afternoon and then give back to his parents.
3	Besides excessive stubbornness/selfishness?(Any type)\n\nHmm....now the type might be a long shot because it was ages ago and I wasn't even remotely into mbti back then I think she was either INFJ(because she always had this inward stare when she'd think always smiling though, and was pretty extroverted )or maybe ENFJ?(could also be ISFJ or ESFJ went for the N because she gave me that mysticky vibe\*(off:how do you spell this? "mysticky" :)) )\*..i have no idea.\n\nWhat annoyed me to no end was that she'd try and find a common ground between her feminazi friends ideas about "men" and me basically(and I know she enjoyed spending time with me , but then shed talk to her friends and we were back at square one).Basically please everyone without "sugarcoating"anything.\n\n(for lack of a better word to describe it)\n\n*Edit:some typos.*
3	Lack of moral character 
3	Stupidity
2	INFP - lying, being a pushover, idolizes you and then gets disappointed when you are human\n\nENFJ - getting offended by everything I say, invalidating my feelings and telling me that they are wrong, shallow
1	Being overly irrational especially when emotionally compromised. \n\nWhen I’m in a really bad mood, I’m not thinking as clearly either and tend to think more cynically/pessimistically and act selfishly, but I’m at least self-aware of it as it happens and there’s still a logic to the way I’m thinking. Even in an emotional state I can present a linear argument and acknowledge the other person’s position.\n\nBut man, past partners in certain emotional states cannot be reasoned with at all. The mental gymnastics are impressive. You could provide them with concrete proof of something they personally said that they’re currently contradicting and they’ll find some way to rationalize it on the fly with constantly changing excuses and a fluid sense of history. It’s like trying to play chess with someone who refuses to play by the rules and insists on some wacky new rules and probably doesn’t even realize they’re playing by their own wacky rules. The only way to win is to not play. 
1	Fi and Ni.
1	need for validation. I have a friend who has a tendency to need validation from, essentially, everyone. If she’s not invited to a party (it’s hosted by person they don’t even like) she Will complain until she’s invited. Like... i just don’t understand. She needs to be “liked” (and being invited wasn’t even genuine, it was out of obligation to appease my friend).  \nShe now has a reputation amongst my friend group, as being the one who needs to be invited or else we won’t hear the end of it. “nobody likes me” “i’m never invited places” etc\n\nstupidity. obvious.\n\nlying. also obvious. \n\nsecrecy. when people don’t answer questions, or refuse to share bits of info because they think they know better. 
1	Lying and being clingy 
3	Just did my test	Ok so I was really sceptical to this shit, all this personality stuff has always seen shady to me but I did it and goddamn. It knew I was going to be sceptical at it, it knew I would love to have my beliefs disproven, it was like someone was staring down my soul like goddamn, anyways ill now read through all the other profiles so goodbye but trust me I will be back.

4	Parts of me wants to go along with this, other parts of me are annoyed at the author of this article, and the rest of me doesn't care about it. Spent a lot of time trying to, and still trying to, understand cognitive functions and I'd rather not try to understand this biased mistype's rant about personality types guised as some genuinely concerned advocate of modern science
2	Those 4 types are so vague that two of them can apply to the other two.
3	So basically:\n\nSelf-Centered: INFJ\n\nRole Models: ENFJ, ESTJ, ESFJ, ENTJ, ESTP, ENTP, ENFP, and ESFP\n\nReserved: INTJ, INTP, ISFP, ISFJ, ISTJ, and ISTP\n\nAverage: INTJ\n\n\n\n...... :)
2	I think that maps onto this. Looks like ENTPs are unicorns afterall: \n\nReserved: IXXJ  \nSelf-Centered: ESTP  \nRole Models: ENXJ  \nAverage: ESXX
1	Lol, switch out the word "personality" with "color of skin" - hahaha! That's what I think. 
1	I think the real types they found are teenagers, typical adult, and leaders.   \n\nFairly worthless imo.
3	Ni - Fe vs. Ne - Si (x-post: /r/infj)	What would you describe as the key differences between these axes, theoretically and as they manifest in real life?\n\nEDIT: Ni-**Se**, oops!
2	Ni-Fe isn't an axis.  Those are both independent functions.  But Ne and Si are a function pair on the N/S axis.   Where there is Ne, there is always Si.   But Ni can have both Fe and Te paired with it.  So there's not a real apples to apples comparison to be made here.

9	Do you think the test is more accurate when you take it yourself, or when someone else takes it for you?	I was on this sub and say [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/a5cazy/tested_as_entp_and_actually_believe_youre_an_entp/eblibxd) and it got me thinking; sure, other people probably won't understand the "deeper" questions as well as you, but they also might have less bias. \n\nLet's say I took a test for somebody and it was different than what they got. Pretending as if we lived in a bubble and had few other factors, which would you consider more accurate?
15	Depends on how truthful you are to yourself. I'm brutally honest with myself so I always get ENTP (I 100% am ENTP)
8	Literally every time you taking it would be more accurate. No matter how much someone might think they know you. they aren't going to answer the questions like you would. Not even close
5	I'd say a person who knows you really well, like a parent you're close with might be able to do a better job. I Tested the wrong type for years, INFJ. This happened because I answered questions as hypotheticals, how I in my mind I would ideally behave. I then decided to do it properly and answer based on past behavior, not hypotheticals, Got ENTP ever since. 
3	I don’t know what is “the test” you’re specifically referencing, but most of the tests are not very helpful unless you really understand MBTI and the cognitive functions, which most don’t, and most people end up mistyping themselves. I was even mistyped twice by professionals with the “real” MBTI proprietary test in college and grad school. As I learned more, I was still testing as what I wanted to be (my shadow) and not what I was. For instance, I’ve learned that being on time and getting stuff done is important, so I was inclined to answer the “judging” type questions as if that was my natural mind wiring. I’ve also been a high achiever since my teen years, and I had heard that ENTPs are often unmotivated flakes, which isn’t me. So I consistently tested as ENTJ for a few years.\n\nThen I finally got typed by someone who knows what they’re doing and understands the cognitive functions (Personality Hacker), and discovered I’m definitely ENTP. The two types share zero of the top 4 cognitive functions. I am a CEO and operate like an ENTJ a lot but it wears me out. I lead with Ne always and always have. Now I consistently type as ENTP on most of the free tests. One I took recently still typed me as ENTx, not being able to determine J or P. That test is probably crap, because the “ENT” is totally different in J vs. P. Any test or site that explains the 16 types by exposing the 4 letters doesn’t get how it works. That’s not at all how it works. We all think, feel, sense, and intuit. All of us have 2 introverted functions and 2 extroverted. All of us have 2 judging functions and 2 perceiving. What matters is which of the 4 combinations of 4 cognitive functions you have, and in which order you developed and use them normally.\n\nTyping takes time and learning, and it is important to get perspectives from friends and family. People who know us well see what we love and lead with and they see what we have patterns of struggle with, and this is more informative to what our type is than a bunch of binary questions. The good part of finally getting your type correctly identified is knowing what freaks you out and why and what you can work on to develop your blind spots and shadow functions. I had stumbled onto some of these improvement areas years ago without knowing MBTI, which is why I tested all over the map before.
3	I think anyone who is seriously interested in learning about the subject should take the tests a few times simply to “gauge” where they might be, and then from there should read up on cognitive functions.\n\nPersonally, I have never gotten anything aside from ENTP, but I have known many people who get a type that is *clearly* not their type. My ENFP friend got INTJ and now thinks that’s hers...or my ESFJ friend got ESTP. Sometimes people are just really bad at reading themselves.
2	It really depends. There are aspects of ourselves we know better than everyone else and there are some things about us others may recognise that we fail to acknowledge. We also tend to answer the questions in terms of how we see ourselves which may not always align with how we actually are. I think instead of directly asking things like "do you trust your emotions or logic?" they can instead present scenarios that force us to make decisions one way or the other. That would probably make the answers more authentic.

5	"In the First Circle" is included with Kindle Unlimited.  Finished it a few months ago due to Econtalk (which every ENTP should be listening to).  It was thought provoking, powerfully written, and quite funny in some places.    \n\n\n&#x200B;
21	Advice on finding purpose and going for your passion(s).	I made this comment a few days ago and someone suggested I just post it, so here you guys go:\n\nI think ENTPs have a difficult time realizing that the Ne-Ti aspect of their personality is not just something that needs to be owned when talking/debating with people, but also something that needs be owned in every day life.\n\nFor the longest time, I constantly tried to force myself to focus on one “purpose” in life at all times. I would be angry that I couldn’t *love* one single subject like an INTJ or an ISFP could. It frustrated me that I couldn’t just fucking go, go, go and be driven for this project that I believed could “change everything”. But then I realized this: the more I tried to control myself and wished that I could just love, focus, and obsess over one subject, the more I fucking grew to loathe it. ExxPs in general are explorers by nature. Above all else, we need to physically, mentally, and emotionally explore this world (varying in degrees based on the type). You just have to own that. If you don’t own it, it’s going to eat you alive and leave as a shell of your former self.\n\nExample: I went into college determined to make my mark in the film industry. Seriously. I was confident that *I* had the answers. I had done the research, I had worked on films, I knew how to write, blah blah blah. And then suddenly once I got into school I realized that my “ideal” vision for the life I was so sure of wasn’t going to be easy. I had let myself down because in my mind it made “perfect” sense on how I was going to obtain it, but then was smacked in the fact by reality. So...I gradually lost interest. I then began to resent the fuck out of it.\n\nAs time went on, I switched from major to major, thinking that this was *for sure* the career I wanted to have. Computer Science...Psychology...Robotics...etc. Every time I got interested and obsessed with these subjects, it would be like the choirs of heaven were singing in my ear because I “finally” found my calling. Nope. Let down every time because of how much I idealized the fuck of the ideas of these things.\n\nAnd then suddenly it hit me maybe...six months ago or so: If I continue to obsess over the idea, fascination, or “glory” that goes along with whatever the hell I’m going awol over, I’m going to be disappointed every time and burn myself the fuck out. Every time. I realized that I need to just go with the flow of what is realistically available for me and how I think. \n\nAka, do what you are *actually* good at. Something that you *actually* enjoy and not just like because of the “possibilities” of it. For example, I love writing. I have always loved it. It’s not something I idealize to the moon and back, it’s something I *know* I can do. I have won awards, I was always in the top of my classes for it, and I know that if I tried I could do damn well pursuing something along those lines. I don’t “believe this ideally because my Ne has told me it’s all so incredibly possible and it’ll change everything”. I know it because of my experiences with it over the course of my life....\n\nHowever, that’s not enough for me. I can’t *just* be doing that or else I will grow to hate it because staying on one single track is like torture to me. So you know what? I’ll continue to write, I’ll do well, and if it takes me somewhere...cool. I’ll continue working on it since I find it interesting, and because I’m me I’ll likely find success in it...and I’ll do a million other things while I’m doing that. And that is *okay*. \n\nYou’ve got to mix things up. You’ve got to know your strengths. You’ve got to accept that sometimes the mundane, reality of life can get old- but guess what?? We’re ENTPs. We are *experts* at mixing things up. You don’t need to obsess over anything. That’s a tactic that might work for literally anyone expect for ExxPs- especially ENxPs. \n\nThe great thing about ENTPs is that if we just accept this and go with it, I think success sort of just..falls in your lap. Obsessing over one thing will likely leave you stagnated because you probably won’t obsess over actually *doing* it, you’ll just obsess over it while you’re sitting in your bed or on your couch thinking of all the amazing possibilities your obsession with the subject could do. \n\nExample: Ever since I stopped majoring and obsessing over film, I’ve found a lot of success within it. I’ve currently worked on three Hollywood feature films and dozens of commercials. How did this happen if I didn’t obsess over it? I just let my interests in film be something cool and fun that I could do. I made connections, I talked with them, and now I have a pretty good resume for film. It just...happened. And I found that I could enjoy it more if I didn’t think it was supposed to be “LIFES WORK”.\n\nYou are not *made* for obsessing over one thing. You are an explorer. The sooner you realize that, accept it, and just own it, the happier you’ll be. Look, I’m just 21 so many I’m full of shit- but I spend a *lot* of time analyzing myself, others, and the motivations behind why people do what they do. I know why I do things pretty well at this point and I am painfully aware of my flaws- so if you’re anything like me... as a fellow ENTP, be practical about what needs to be done in reality, and just let your creatives/rational self “flow” with out thinking it’s the biggest and most groundbreaking shit to ever hit planet Earth. You will be much happier that way, and I think you’ll find more success.\n\nSo what is my “purpose” in doing all of this? I guess my purpose is to use all of my connections, smarts, big-world thinking, and idea abilities to eventually be able to let opportunities and intellectual stimulation be handed to me on a silver platter, lol. I want to get to the point where people call me up asking me to work on a film. I want to get to the point where people ask me to sing at a live show for them. I want to get to the point where people ask me to write for them (whatever format that may be). I just want to get to the point where people want me for my ideas and ask for my input and I don’t have to be constantly searching it out and “fishing” for people to be interested in what I have got to say. That would be the fucking dream.\n\n\nI also wrote all of this with out being on Adderall...so I mean it, lmao.
5	>Look, I’m just 21 so [maybe] I’m full of shit\n\nNah man.\n\nI'm about to turn 31 in a month. I *wish* I'd figured this out around 20, but I had a lovely dose of ISFJ single-mother upbringing and "you have to go to college and do one thing" and (because boomers) "if you get a degree life is easy" (spoiler, my degree hasn't done shit for me).\n\nYou're spot on. I have a rule now, based on my repeated life observation that "I can do any job, but I hate most of them after 6 months": before expending a lot of time and resources chasing something that sounds good I do the following.\n\n1. Sleep on it for a month. If it still sounds good, go to 2.\n\n2. Do a job shadow. Most career-type fields you can find someplace that will let you do this. Ask **all** the questions you can think of while you're there, but the big thing is to look at the culture. You'll absolutely think you can do the job, you want to know if you can see yourself being the people around you at this shadow. If so, do 3.\n\n3. Find a way to get into that culture for several months. Volunteer if that's an option, work in as closely a related job as possible (specifically interacting with the people you want to be), if all else fails then do research into the topic every day for those several months. Not bored yet? Go to 4.\n\n4. You've given yourself a chance to get over the "this job is new and shiny and I can totally learn all this new stuff and do the new things" high that Ne **will** dump on you at the beginning so that you can give the thing a good, solid look. Now go and actually get the degree/license/certification/whatever that will make them let you do the thing.\n\nIf the thing you think sounds cool has basically no barrier to entry, just do it. Write the song, author the story, etc. But if you're going to sink a lot of years into being allowed to do something, you owe it to yourself to make sure it's worth that time.
4	I can attest to this. The things I do just because I can are the things I find success in and the things I obsess over or focus on I inevitably fail at. \n\nMy current issue is that despite my success (I'm 22 and I run a tax firm. Don't ask me how it happened because I don't know.) I find that I actually don't have any goals. My business is growing, I'm making more money, I'm developing better and better relationships, I'm acquiring more skills, but I don't know why I'm doing any of this.\n\nMy quality of life hasn't really changed much and I just have a lot more work to do because I've become necessary to the people around me in my wild array of activities I invest myself in. I have far surpassed my childhood dream of being an unfettered hedonist, and I feel a bit lost.\n\nIs it silly and obsessive of me to crave some direction? Should I just embrace the chaos?
3	I feel this viscerally. The hard part is making it work within the framework of our current society. :) I’m a little older (24) and at my first full time job. Unfortunately “climbing the corporate ladder” really depends on finding a specialty and running with it. You can choose to be an individual contributor your entire career, but there are considerations to be made for that. I do really admire people who are super knowledgeable in a particular field, and I feel a pull to be an expert at something, but it’s certainly at odds with my natural strengths.\n\nWould love to hear from older people who’ve found a career path that’s fulfilling in this way.
2	There should be no search for a purpose, because it will drive you mad!\n\nIt's just a sense of emotions we feel to "find" something. Enjoy life as it is, which is just a bunch of emotions in which we lack control. Hate your job? Good!!!! Hate it as much as possible, and it will force you to change or look somewhere else! :)\n\nSo, what you are saying is you want to be in a position where people ask and recognize you for being what you say, YOU are. \n\nWell first understand, alot of people don't even know what they want. When you were a child and hungry you would cry. A mother would fill the need by feeling the need to feed you. This is what you wish to feel. But if you are surrounded by children who don't know what they need how will this need be fulfilled? \n\nYou are working on film(i'm rather envious) and I believe what you are looking for, comes with TIME. Are you hungry? Would you like to eat something? What is nearby? Have you heard of this place called, "In-n-Out"? So you proceed to try it, form your opinion-good or bad. Next time you're hungry depending on your opinion you might go to In-n-Out again. But why? What was soo good about it that you felt drawn towards the place?\n\nYou are like a burger! Hungry people will go to you, but you have to give yourself time, and enjoy the interactions. \n\nNow, how can one speed it up? Is this something you really wish? To be fully immensed into a task?(Sounds wonderful)\n\nBut you see....Life itself is already this way. Every second with the people interacting around you in the potential combinations of speech, with outcomes could drive you mad! ITS DRIVING ME MAD RIGHT NOW! Do you remember the names of the people you worked with yesterday? How about 5 mins ago? Why do you not remember? Were you not paying attention? \n\nIf you can't even remember the person's name you said thank you to, how do you expect them to remember your name?. . . . . . .MAKE THEM REMEMBER.\n\nHow do would you go about to do such a thing, fellow e n t p?   ;) 
2	I get what you are saying and I struggle with this too. I dont want to be a slave and Im not a work horse in any way. I wish I was but honestly im also just getting by. I love learning and exploring, but the reality of our society just happens to be a certain way. I relate to the feeling of onsetting madness that come from supressing Ne just to focus on one thing, I just want to make a case for the other side:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, lots of people run away from hard work and struggle, hoping that they can get away with it and still be successful. Wishfully believing that success will fall into their lap, that they are one of the chosen ones, that they can come out on top just purely based on their intellect or creativity or charisma, whatever. But that is wrong, naive or deluded and fairly immature. The majority of people fail, and the large majority of the ones that dont work \*extremely\* hard, to the point where the only thing they are doing is that one thing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow im not saying that its impossible to be successful if you dont focus on one thing, but its practically impossible to be successful without working your cunt off.  Ive seen many people change their majors or drop out to follow their passions, however they dont seem to go anywhere, they just stagnate and grow older. I hate what im doing right now and its messing with my mind, but I \*have\* to get through it if I want to come out on top. It doesnt matter what you do, there is no escape from the suffering that has to be endured in order to prevail in life itself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo many people dont seem to understand this. So many people think they can get away with the easy route. \nLife \*is\* unfair, but imagine how many people would suffer through medicine or engineering or law if there was an easier way to get rich. Sucessful people understand this, because they know that struggling is part of personal growth. A lot of highschool and university in my experience is more about working and sustaining pressure than actual learning. In way thats why grades or out of school activities matter, it shows that you worked hard and have been active despite the challengers that come along with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you drop out of college to start a company and you are not working your ass off day and night, your company will fail. If you decide to study a fun or easy degree you wont be employed after you graduate. How could it be otherwise? (yes yes yes rare and special case a, b ,c) . Lots of people that studied business to "learn how to manage companies" ended up doing boring and under paid office jobs. You are only worth your competence and if the field youre competent in is useless, so are you. If there is lots of people with equal competencies you better hope there is a high demand too. This is simply how the world works and if ENTPs suck at that, well then they either suck it up or are doomed to fail in life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDont quit because things get hard or you start to struggle. If you quit prematurely because you get bored, your progress towards what ever you were working towards gets lost, or at least majorly delayed. \n\nThink about the life you want to have and \*understand\* the amount of suffering necessary to get there. \n\nThink about the amount of people that do physical labour for 40 years to get by. Dont be silly. Cant run away from the suffering, one way or another.
2	Man, this really resonates with me. I think you’re doing pretty good if you realized all this at 21... it’s taken me a lot longer than that. I have a very similar story to you with music instead of film. It took me 5 years of traveling to discover myself. I sometimes lament that I am much older and dont have a career or any major career skills. Every possible job path seems awesome when I’m day dreaming about it, but when I think about the reality of living that same life every day for the rest of my life it freaks me out. I guess I have to accept that this was my path and my path alone.\n\nEverybody operates differently and I have to come to terms with the fact that I needed that time and those experiences to learn who I am. It’s hard not to compare myself to their people, and every day I need to remind myself of that. The difficulty for me is that no matter what path I decide to take, I can literally feel the most optimisticic and positive about it, and literally feel dreadfully and woefully unprepared for it a few hours later. I guess that’s kind of neurotic in a way, but for me, I guess I just have to make a decision and tell myself to stay the route no matter how helpless it feels in those constantly-oscillating moments. This coming from someone who tried 5 different majors, never finished, and is always choosing a new direction to go in, then backing out and trying something else. 
1	Tactical dot so i remember to read that later -> .
1	It’s all about energy flow and learning about how it flows inside you. You mentioned not to give in to that “I can change the world” feeling and how it disappoints you every time, which is a good start because you’re aware of it. You’ll find though that you can’t block it though, as an example at the end of your post you are right back to where you want to be “the person people come to when they need something.” Even though that’s the feeling your bashing. \n\nIt’s more about accepting that this explosion of energy and interest is a normal part of you and learning how to make best use of it!\n\nIn your field of writing it could be of great use to have all sorts of knowledge that was brought about by this influx of energy into a subject, as then you would have enough information to write a good story about it without spending a whole lifetime on just one thing.\n\nIn the end accepting your strengths and learning how to best use them will bring yourself closer to being untroubled by yourself and the dynamic world around us.
2	7w6 ENTPs explained with the 4 sides of the mind	So from what you would expect, most ENTPs would be 7w8 or 8w7 (I am both of those depending on how I feel) But a surprising number are 7w6.\n\nI believe this can be explained with the 4 sides of the mind. The subconscious part of the mind is the opposite of the ego, as such for ENTPs this would be the ISFJ subconscious. 7w6 ENTPs are probably the type that utilize their ISFJ subconscious to be more loyal than the average ENTP.
5	Hello, 7w6 here as well
2	I’m a 5w4 ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
4	>  am both of those depending on how I feel\n\nWhich is exactly why the enneagram is a waste of time.
1	Huh? \n\nI know ENTPs that are threes, fives, sixes, sevens, eights, nines and even a one and a two. \n\nEnneagram is attitudes that are based on fears. 7w6 are not closer to an ISFJ. The ENTP that would most look like a typical ISFJ might be a 1 or a 2. Probably a 2w1. But that’s a highly unusual combo. \n\nMBTI is not a real measure of personality. Cognitive functions don’t actually exist and enneagram is not caused by MBTI. 
1	What the hell are all the w’s and numbers?
0	Rarely loyal here...\nNo.. I refuse to think \nI'm ever an "S" "F"  or "J"\n\nYuck

25	Differnces between Entp and enfp	I have a problem with typing myself, because when I do cognitive function tests I end up with high Ne, second Ti and medium Fe which is the functions of an ENTP. I usually get really low Fi. But I always get "slight preference for feeling". When I do the 16personalities test I get ENFP with around 51-59% feeling. So I was wondering if you could tell me what the biggest differences between ENTP and ENFP are. Thanks :), sorry if this is the wrong subreddit.
13	Ti and Fi explained in simple keywords and phrases. By no means a complete listing, but some things I've observed and conceptualized.\n\n# Internal organization Ti - Consultant\n\nQuestion - **How?**\n\nLogical structure - **How do these items relate to each other?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTask - Conceptualize principles\n\nGuiding principle - Efficiency\n\nTheme - Accuracy\n\nInterests - Theories, models, definitions\n\nFights for - Individual thinking, free speech\n\nEnd Result - **Principles**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnxiety - Confusion, incomplete logical structures\n\nFrustration - Inconsistencies in other people or systems, not being understood by others\n\nLower self-esteem - Being incompetent, \n\nDepression - Disconnect from people, meaninglessness\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Internal harmonization Fi - Facilitator\n\nQuestion - **Why?**\n\nLogical structure - **How does this affect me?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTask - Determine values\n\nGuiding principle - Authenticity\n\nTheme - Depth\n\nInterests - Stories, relationships\n\nFights for - Individuality, fairness for all\n\nEnd result - **Values**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnxiety - Being out of touch with emotions\n\nFrustration - Inauthenticity in others, not being treated fairly\n\nLower self-esteem - Inability to find their path and control their lives\n\nDepression - Disconnect from their goals and themselves, inability to organize their life, lack of purpose\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**LEGEND**  \n>  \n>**Function name Short abbreviation - Role**  \n>  \n>Question - **Fundamental question to ask about the perceptions.**  \n>  \n>Logical structure - **Fundamental mental model of relating the self and other items.**  \n>  \n>Task - What does it do in/detract from the external world?  \n>  \n>Guiding principle - What does it aim for?  \n>  \n>Interest - Inclined towards topics in the realm of...  \n>  \n>Theme - How does it accomplish this?  \n>  \n>Fights for - Strongly supported ideologies  \n>  \n>End result - What is the mental end product?  \n>  \n>Anxiety - What causes mental disturbance  \n>  \n>Frustration - Causes to cringe  \n>  \n>Lower self-esteem - Self-explanatory  \n>  \n>Depression - Same
8	I test with an F every time. I am not an F. I give up on tests. The tests aren’t the best because when it asks me “what I value more” or whatever that isn’t always my trait, among other issues. The dichotomy of T-F on the test doesn’t accurately depict how that affects your functional stack. \n\nIf you read the descriptions and feel like the function stack for ENTP fits you better than just go with that. 
6	The difference between NeTi and NeFi can essentially be boiled down to Fi vs. Ti. \n\nBoth functions are concerned with subjective understanding, but the methodology is different. Fi interprets the world through one's own lens and is concerned with constructing an identity. Ti interprets the world through one's own lens as well, but is concerned with logical consistency. \n\nSo Ti is driven by building a framework that relies on logically *consistent* arguments to go from A-->B-->C-->D. Fi is driven by building an identity that relies on logically *subjective* arguments to go from (for example) B-->D-->A-->C. To an Fi user their interpretation is sound because it makes sense to them, but a Ti user would not relate and would need an explanation for their line of reasoning. \n\nUsually this can be difficult to explain for Fi users leading to some not understanding what they mean (a key sign in noting the difference between NeTi and NeFi). FPs in particular have an inclination to express their identity through a different medium (i.e. creative arts) for this very reason. \n\nedit: also, I do want to state that my use of the ABCD example isn't meant to say that Fi users can't follow mathematical concepts. What I mean by logically consistent arguments is that in topics where opinions are a matter of importance this Fi/Ti clash will most likely be on full display. 
3	Check out this comparison \[[X](http://sociotype.com/tools/type-comparison/ILE-IEE)\] \n\nJust to let you know, Socionics is far more useful for this type of thing. 
3	I was an ENFP in undergrad and for a few years after. I recently took the MBTI again after starting law school and ended up an ENTP. \n\nI half-jokingly consider them my dual personalities. \n\nThe ENFP in me was always leading, always out in front, being the most popular guy in the room. I was a Fraternity President, captain of my high school baseball and basketball teams. I was out in front as a happy, social leader. Less focused on details and more leading by expressing broad visions unburdened by details of functionality.\n\nThe newer, ENTP-focused version of myself is noticeably more focused on the details, and significantly less focused on impressing people/being the life of a party. From a leadership standpoint, I’ve gone from being the loudest, most expressive encourager in the room to being an “architect” type of leader. I speak more with the confidence of having facts and logic on my side, and less impulsively speak without facts/details.\n\nAs an ENFP, I was expressive with my opinions, but reckless with my fact-checking, and would often be caught off-guard by people questioning me.\n\nAs an ENTP, I get excited about an idea in the same way, but I get my facts straight first before speaking up, and I am not afraid to go after people with the facts I’ve gathered when questioned. Frankly, I am more of a dick now to people when the situation warrants, because I am less worried about coming across as a likable person.\n\nHope this tangent helps. I personally liked being an ENFP more than my current ENTP state of mind, but it almost feels like the natural progression of someone who starts out as an ENFP. Lol.
3	Randomnesscontrolled has really good observations. I usually test via Fe and Fi. They are very different.\n\nDo you think about how people are fake? Do you think some people are too people pleasing and not real enough? If so, you are an ENFP. Those are all very strong Fi traits(authenticity).\n\nThat does not mean ENFPS cannot be logical, they often are very analytical and smart. Tested among the most gifted in intelligence in MBTI in this order: INTP, INTJ, INFP, INFJ, ENTP, ENFP, ENTJ, ENFJ. [http://psych.wisc.edu/henriques/papers/Sak.pdf](http://psych.wisc.edu/henriques/papers/Sak.pdf)\n\nI wish INFPS and ENFPS would be more accepting of themselves. Despite being feeling driven, they are highly intelligent, even more so than some NT's sometimes.
2	If you score high on the functions for a certain type versus another, you're the one with the matching functions.\n\nMistypes are common, both because people are typically bad at self-assessment, and also because there's a lot of pressure societally to perform in ways more in line with other types.\n\nFor males, the tests tend to skew to E, S, T, and J, and for females, the tests tend to skew toward E, S, F, and J. The S/N one can vary depending on who you're surrounded by, but the others are more consistent.
4	Ti is much more limited than Fi.  \n\nTi *forces* you to think about things in a certain stereotyped way, quite often leading to one inescapable conclusion.  You may follow different paths between A and B than another Ti type,  but you will always follow a path and be able to describe how you got from A to B.  Moreover both you and another Ti type will agree that the path is a valid way to get from A to B, even if better, shorter paths also exist. \n\nThis is why Ti types are generally unconcerned with the *meaning* of the connection.  They simply see it as *inevitable* because  there is a causal path connecting things.\n\nFi types are more concerned with the relationship between A and B.  They don’t look for a way *how* the paths are connected, but rather focus on the *why* the correlation exists at all.\n\nThey are effectively asking a different question about the same Ne observation that an ENTP would make. \n\nThey are less concerned about the causative validity of the correlation between A and B than they are with interpreting the results of that connection.   \n\nThis is why people talk about Fi as being “value oriented”.  \n\nExample: \n\n“You are made of stardust.”\n\nSo Ti might focus on how that actually happens.  It will want to know how it happened.  It might get confused by the apparent contradiction.  How can I be made of stardust if the sun is shining in the sky?  Does that mean the earth is somehow created from the sun??  They will start to take the statement apart and look for ways it fails those checks of validity.  It wants to understand the mechanism.   So a person might then be prompted to research the answer to those questions.  Eventually they might form a synthesis of NeTi, an opinion about how it works which they then later use as part of their intuition subconsciously.  For instance they might have absorbed the concept of generations of stars...that indeed stars themselves are also made of stardust.  That’s an intuitive insight that can be applied to other concepts....for instance in thinking how a human genetically speaking is constructed from the remains of past species. \n\nA Fi type might be equally fascinated by the statement.  They may or may not find significance in it depending on how their Fi interprets things.   For instance they might realize that this means that *everyone* is made of stardust.  And that therefore we all share a commonality, a similar origin.   This can prompt them to read books about astronomy to get more insights and data. They might go on to realize that everyone ever alive also was made from the same stuff and that in fact we’re all made from the bits and pieces of things which existed in the past as trees and dinosaurs and volcanoes.   They might adopt this insight as a “value” that they apply to other aspects of their life, intuitively.   They have a semi-conscious notion that we’re all connected by our common origin, and so this means that all life is deserving of respect and empathy because to some extent we are all in each other’s shoes. \n\nBoth of those observations are “true”.  But only the first can be agreed upon by all reasonable people.   The second view is tied up in the subjective reasoning of Fi.   Not even two Fi users would necessarily agree with the reasoning.  But they would understand how the other can see it as a true statemnet and have meaning *for them*.\n\nThe drama and tension and confusion between Ti and Fi happens because of they way this “truth” is interpreted.  To the Fi user, what they’re talking about makes perfect sense (remember that Fi is an unconscious function so they are not instantly privy to exactly why they make these connections, only that they find meaning in them).   But they will often have problems articulating it.  They resort to their secondary J function Te to explain, usually by reference to sources and authority, and to supply themselves with some objective validity to their subjective Fi sense that the Fi-meaningful connection they’re making is also supported by rational, objective data.  \n\n\nTo a Ti user this distinction between “how you see something” and “the way something must be” is hard and fast, and the former must *always* bow to the latter.\n\nBut a Fi user makes a weaker distinction.  That is why Fi can be easily confused for Ti.....because sometimes it agrees!\n\nThe way this difference typically manifests in writing and talking, is the Fi type has a focus on *interpretation*.  They talk a lot about how they see things and what the meaning is.  To a Ti type it looks at times to be very unfocused and subjective...even rambling and disconnected as the Fi type struggles to put into words the underlying unconscious and symbolic meaning it senses.\n\nTi types instead try either to explain things, break things apart, or suggests “fixes”.\n\nESFPs are *more similar* to ENTPs because ESFPs “think” with TeNi.  Being Sensors they naturally filter out all the “mystical” stuff you see in ENFPs right up front, and then form NT style ideas.\n\nENFPs are more “out there” because they have the most conceptual function (Ne) paired with the one which forms the most subjective connections (Fi).  This makes them difficult to understand at times, hard to grasp what they’re even talking about.\n\nESFPs in comparison are more focused on the pragmatic, less “bullshitty”, but form NT style insights.  That makes them seem more like ENTPs, especially if they’re males.  \n
1	I test F on 16personalities too, but I feel that test doesnt sufficiently account for the way you think with their questions and more of where your values are. I have set morals and ways I feel I should treat others so that seems to classify as F even though my thought process and overall type aligns with T, I usually test pretty evenly between both but over time the scales tip more towards F as I develop social awareness, but again my perception and thinking habits r relatively the same and more congruent to T not F
8	Tested as ENTP and actually believe you're an ENTP?	So I mean, how many who were typed ENTP turn out to actually be ENTP through some study on cognitive functions? \n\nFor example, I took that stupid 16 personalities test 3-4 times (each time increasing my honesty on disagree-agree scale) and ended up each time as ENTP (even with thoughts of "Yeah, this is definitely going to give me a different result). I took a 200+ question test and had to focus 1000% honesty in my responses because I did *NOT* want to go through that again and got ENTP. Yet again, too two other tests and same result. \n\nFinally I got exhausted from the tests and decided to get into cognitive functions and I can see how Ne - Ti I can get. I watched some ENTP dude try to discuss some topic and he jumped topics the same way I would; shared that video with my ISFx friend and she said she could see me in that video, all the way through.\n\nSo, how many ENTPs weren't mistyped? Do you still have doubts? Cause I do. I'm still unsure, but more confident that I am... If that makes sense?
5	The first few times I took the MBTI I got ENTJ, but that never sat right with me. Turns out, the only reason I was systematic and structured was because the 8-4pm school day was drilled into my routine.  \n\nNow that I’m in college, I can clearly see I’m an ENTP.  I wouldn’t be upset if I were a bit more organized and planning-oriented, though. 
5	I’m an entp but I’ve tested as ENTP, ENFP and INTP. 
3	Oh hell yeah that was me. In fact, I first did this really shitty mbti test which was literally just applying a letter type to you with no indirect questions to prevent you from answering something else. People who were ESFJs would type themselves as ENTP, etc. Yet I somehow understood it and typed myself as an ENTP. Then I did an actual test at 16personalities, and another website, and got ENTP for both. I guess you couldve said there was bias since I could foresee which answers will give you which type, but then after reading about cognitive functions the fact I could do that at all definitely meant I was an Ne dom, and the whole function stack for ENTPs fit perfectly with me.
3	I either test as ENTP or INTP. But I'm also socially rather introverted or maybe just allgeric to stupidity. \n\nTook me a bit to get behind the ENTP typing tbh. 
2	Mistypes are likely on the order of 50% with the tests.   Obe reason is  because sometimes how you see yourself, even if you’re being completely honest about it, is not how you actually really are.   It’s also easier to a Feeler to mistype as a Thinker (because everyone thinks they’re being perfectly rational in their thoughts) and for Sensors to mistype as Intuitives (because everyone sees themselves as having creative ideas.)  since many of the tests use language similar to that “I’m really creative...” it causes mistypes or worse people to believe they’re “hybrids” which is antithetical to the nature of a dichotomy.  
2	I always thought the extroversion/ introversion thing was the easiest to figure out.
2	I used to test as an ENTP all the time when I was in college and partied a lot, but now I think of myself more as an extroverted introvert. A disclaimer would be that I don’t drink like I used to (so i lost touch with my drinking buddies) and also I don’t trust people so much anymore because I was overly trusting in my late teens and early twenties. Either way I’m definitely an xNTP and relate strongly parts of both descriptions found on the 16personalities website. 
1	I don't understand why you people care so much about mistypes. Unless you know for sure it's just another "what if", which means it's a really nice way to lose time and energy obsessing about it. Not to mention the fact that you can also convince yourself that you're another type by overanalyzing everything you do.\n\nWhen I found out I was ENTP I searched info about it and everything just made sense. I found myself saying "yep, that's me" every 10 minutes. And do you know what changed after that? \n\nNothing.\n\nThe only different thing is me browsing /r/entp, which I do not do because I am am ENTP but because I did enjoy it years ago and now, after spending dozens of hours on it over the years, it's part of who I am as a person. \n\nAnd guess what? I might as well be an ENFP, INFP  or even an ESTP (probably not). And it won't matter at all.
1	I don't know really and to be honest I don't really care too much. I've always tested either intp or entp, I find major aspects of my personality in both

4	What type is the worst at taking criticism in your opinion?	Just curious. I feel like we constantly talk about that on the MBTI subreddit.
12	Every type except for xxTPs tbh. 
4	I feel like it's either xNTJ or xSFJ - the former because of the egos and the latter because of the feelings.  Definitely not a universal rule, but it's what I've personally observed.
1	If it's something I did that I'm aware of...or even wonder if I got wrong.. No issue.\nIf I'm blindsided and suddenly realize I failed w/o proper info \nOR if it "subtle criticism" \nAt least internally\n*I tend to freak the fuck out...*
1	depends on the person really

36	ESTP here, just wanted to say your type is my favorite	I love ENTP: because I can go on tangents for them for multiple hours and never get tired of the conversation. \n\nI find you so intellectually stimulating while still pretty good communicators with good social skills, but also not too emotional. Logic is still valued. \n\nI’m an ESTP, and I’ve found that ENTPs and I just vibe really well together. \n\nWhat types do you find you click with? Do you like or dislike ESTPs? \n\nAll around, you guys are just really dope! Love spending time with you
21	I get along easily with all the TPs, and also the NTs.
12	Thanks, ENTP is my favorite type too. \n\nI get along best with ESTP and INTJ. ESTP still has that Ti convergence. TPs can kind of just spot each other in the wild since they all think the same. ESTPs just apply it to more realistic scenarios, so I'm a bit envious. To echo the words of Alexander the Great: If I weren't an ENTP I'd wish to be an ESTP. \n\nINTJs are easy to get along with too because they're really like the "shadow type" of an ENTP. They use the same function stack, simply in an opposite flow if you will. So rather than Ne→Ti It's Ni →Te. They share that same NT axis of cognition. \n\nESFJs and ISFJs I can find some common ground with having the same functions, but its a bit harder. I notice I click best with them when stressed, and for them they click best with me when they're stressed. \n\nINFJs are *okay* I guess. Just gotta keep that Ni in check. When their Ni vision is off its just an absolute roadblock. \n\nRest of the types.. eh. Lol
5	My boss is an ESTP and we get along quite well and are often similar.  I’m a bit more awkward, he’s a bit more bullish.  Both like intelligent conversation and a good time.
3	ESTPs are definitely some of my favorites especially when it comes to doing extroverted/active stuff.
5	Thanks. It’s true, we are the best
2	I tend to get on best with xTPs, followed by NFJs, then NFPs, then xTJs.  When I get on with a TJ it's fantastic, but generally it's like looking into what I consider to be somewhat of a dark mirror:. Per jung all Ts are predisposed to suppress F to and extent but none moreso than TJs.  Also per jung a healthy person is balanced in this regard.  They are aware of these tendencies and seek to balance their subconscious weaker influences through consistent effort.  I have spent many years trying to be more like a balanced F.  \n\nSo most TJs make me uncomfortable like a recovering alcoholic doesn't want to go bar hopping with someone who is stuck in the stage where they have constructed an entire identity around drinking and denial.  \n\nI think part of my issue with TJs is that I was raised by an unhealthy entj, and I know how toxic their delusional "I am spock" bullshit can be.  \n\nNot to mention that they only like having their ideas questioned when they eventually think they "won".  Poke a big enough hole in their bullshit that even they can see it, and they tend to get really pissed off and attack you personally.  \n\nSo you end up handling them with kid gloves, but specifically in the types of interactions I prefer to be the most free.  At least with FPs I can just avoid talking about charged values topics and not really care.  Tjs turn everything intellectual into an intellectual pissing contest.  Pfeh.  \n\n
2	I haven't met enough people who's types I know but you sound super cool 😎 👊
1	Yeah, I'm a big fan of ESTPs, one of my brothers is one and we lived together for 2 years and had many debates, it was so much fun! The types also compliment each other in many ways as well, since ESTPs are usually good at the practical stuff and ENTPs are usually better at the theoretical stuff! :)
1	As an ENTP I find hanging out with ESTPs so relaxing! Not because they're boring, but because I know we're going to entertain each other, and we can discuss topics like which of our friends would make the best assassin without it getting weird.
1	Three of my closest friends are ESTPs, in fact ESTPs seem to be one of the main types I keep around long term. You guys the best
1	Yeah, feeling's shared ! My stepdad is ESTP and even though we're really different n term of opinions and he pisses me off sometimes (he's so stubborn, and will start shit with people just for the sake of it- I know that's something ENTPs are known for too, but he goes way too far with it 'till physical fights), we enjoy a few similar stuff and that's enough for us to get along great and just enjoy that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get along best with -STPs and -NFJs, for some reason. No idea why.
1	One of my best friends is ESTP! Definitely the one I go to for doing crazy shit. \n\nI also get along really well with INTJ and ISTJ. (The first challenges me, the second keeps me alive)
1	EXTPs are my favorite too
1	\nYou know, i think one of my boyfriends was an ESTP. \n\nWe had a great time together and could talk for hours. But he was super materialistic and I just don't care about that stuff. It's pointless. 
1	I like bantering with ESTPs and trolling but I’ve never been close with one.
1	ESTP's drove me crazy as a kid, but I'm finding that they are some of my favorite people as adults. 
1	Am ENTP, my SO is ESTP. I think your type is pretty cool too. 
1	I love you too
5	What costume would sum up an ENTP?	Hey guys!\n\nI'm making a short experimental film for my final year of university where I'm trying to bring the head-space of an ENTP into the exterior world. I can't quite think what the main character, the ENTP, should wear which sums them up without going overboard (as cool as two different coloured Doc Martins would be, maybe toning it down to just different coloured lases, or something.) Something that shows their weirdness and nerdiness without being a stereotype or just too unnatural.\n\nMore info: My character is gender neutral (I'm acting in it, part of the experimental aspect is I'm making this film 100% by myself) so I am a gender-neutral female with super short hair (styled after Robert Downey, Jr.) and it's currently dyed purple (possibly will be red or blue when the time for filming comes around, but hair colour suggestions are welcome, cause I wanna keep my hair funky IRL!) The character does a bit of physical actions, such as climbing trees, parkour, scuffing shoes and clothes when they're clumsy, so keep in mind that I can't exactly wear heels and a miniskirt. It's being filmed in Britain during the coldest time of the year (Jan-Feb) so it will be freezing and raining, so I'm not about to go flaunting myself around the city in a bikini (well, at least not in the middle of winter! XD)\n\nCertain colours don't matter for this project. Usually I use colour to denote character traits (yellow = happy, green = envious, purple = rich, etc) but for this project as long as my character has SOME colour (in contrast to the grey exterior world and the other characters, who are all grey/brown/black/white colours) then it should be good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, if you have any suggestions, that would be great. If you have any links of photos as well, that would also be great (I'm a visual learner, so pics would help me understand your ideas better, but words are fine if not.) Thanks guys!
14	Borat swimwear
4	Oh man I‘ve got something for you. \n\nWatch CRAZY SHIT by daniel koren. It’s like 2 minutes long
4	Well, I actually look respectable since I just got my quarterly haircut. \n\nThen again I’m wearing a hoodie I bought in 2003 with some jeans I bought in 2005 and a T-shirt I got for free at some event in college. So yeah. \n\nI don’t mind playing dress up for formal stuff or going out but day to day I just wear whatever is in the clean pile that I swear I’m going fold or hang up one of these days but I never do. \n\nI do have like 12 different pairs of shoes though. Is that weird for a guy? They are all for specifically different activities. \n\nI can’t really help your costume I guess. Too boring. But it was interesting to think about. 
5	Since ENTPs typically don’t care that much about their appearance, I guess just very bland. With bland I mean, go with your color idea, but just have a plain yellow shirt for example, no brand no nothing. Since ENTPs are more organized in the head, than externally, maybe a bit scruffy, but overall nothing too tacky, unless it’s ironic of course.
5	Labcoat and bunnyslippers
2	Sounds like a cool project! Good luck with it! \nImo: Going a long with what I know if the character, you could go the "somewhat basic" route and do like a flannel (maybe in faded dark blue to go with the purple hair!), a grey tshirt underneath, dark blue or black jeans, and a pair of scuffed up converse? \nIt feels like that fits with the character, and there's a lot you could do with it for personality telling- I.E: Rolling up the flannel sleeves, lacking the converse around the ankle, ripping the jeans etc. \nGood luck again! 😀 \n
2	i used to not really care about what i wore because i grasped the idea of not caring about how my clothes changed other people's perception of me. in the last two/three years or so i started wearing shit only because i liked it. every day got a little more fun if i really liked what i had on. i have a unique (to say the least) collection of graphic t shirts, including one with snoop dogs high school yearbook photo on it, one that just says "TRUST ME" on it, and a wu-tang shirt that looks like the label on a bottle of malt liquor. the list goes on and on lol \n\nedit: i should also mention that I'm friends with a handful of ENTPs and we all dress relatively different but admire each other's sense of style. most entps i know go for something stylish but simultaneously unique. all of my entp friends are girls though and so am i haha 
5	Bad with fundamentals; exceptional with critical thinking	Has anyone who has identified with being an ENTP realize this pattern with their academia? For example, physics- a field in science that uses basic mathematics to explain natural phenomena- is something I struggle with. On the other hand, I find subjects such as calculus or discrete mathematics very complex/interesting so I am very much drawn towards it.\n\nAlso, I think Discrete is extremely interesting because it resembles the way I think.\n\nCan anyone relate?
7	>physics\n\n>basic mathematics\n\nUhhhh
4	Physics is pretty basic.  We mathematicians are always fixing their shit.
3	Chemistry and science in general (with the exception of Biology and Physics) is the one subject where I have no idea what I'm doing. Math, English, History - easy.\n\nScience resides on the intersection of memorization and understanding, which messes with my mind. Was never quite sure how to study for that back in school. 
3	Scored 51% in maths, and 92% in statistics the following semester. Numbers don’t make sense to me unless they have an application.
2	I’m flip flopped.  Good at physics, mediocre at non-conceptual mathematics 
2	Math is like a set of legos. There are rules showing you what shapes and sizes they come in, how they connect, and which connections are forbidden. Physics is looking at all the legos and being asked to build a bridge. \n\nPhysics requires extra tools beyond mathematics, but at the cost of rigor. We don't necessarily care per se about all the *rules* built in to the lego pieces. They're more or less self-evident. If pieces connect, they clearly work. \n\nBut mathematicians will come along and say "well, sure, you combined a 2x1 and a 2x1 both on a 2x2, but why not just put a 2x2 on the 2x2?" What physicists gain in design with mathematics, they lost in rigor so it's not quite as "elegant" a solution. 
2	or you could just be like me and me shit at math! But in humanities, totally. Critical thinking type essays I always score really high on, but honestly sometimes grammatical conventions or annotations / correct citations still trip me up on the daily. 
1	I'm a bit like this as well - back in school, I always tended to do better on the courses that were supposed to be "hard", than the ones people regarded as easy.  Some of it is, of course, due to interest.  Otherwise, it may just be a "way your brain works" kind of thing.  (For example - I was very average at regular chemistry, but killed it in o-chem.  The latter just... made sense to me.)  Everybody is wired a little differently, I guess.
3	PERCEIVER STRUGGLING WITH COLLEGE	I’ve been really struggling lately and it is so frustrating. I am smart and I know that I could easily master the material of any class I’m in and get an A, but I just can’t do anything on time lately and it’s affecting me a lot. Any pointers on planning and time management? My P trait is TAKING OVER MY LIFE.\n\nBackground: \nI’m also narcoleptic, so it’s hard to wake up early/on time, and my weekends are always occupied with a different activity (I march WGI for those of you who know what that is). 
3	Put yourself in an environment that makes you work yourself naturally rather than forcing yourself to work.\n\nCollege Libraries are great places for that as people working on your side creates a "peer pressure" effect that makes you study . It does wonders tbh.\n\nAnd usually those are open on Saturday
2	How are you staying organized?
2	> I am smart and I know that I could easily master the material of any class I’m in and get an A\n\nThis is a really easy trap to fall into wrt work habits.  The challenge of coursework isn't usually, unless you're taking a few exceptionally difficult classes, the coursework itself.  It's everything else.  In other words, it doesn't matter whether or not you're smart.  It doesn't matter whether or not you have the potential.  All the matters is the work you produce.\n\nFor me personally, I really have to put a lot of effort into planning and time management.  I actually found that I usually did better when I was really busy, because it forced me to carve out blocks in my schedule to work on X project or attend Y meeting.  Otherwise, I would just think to myself that I had~two weeks~ to do some dumb assignment, and then I would leave it to the very last minute because I felt like I was "smart enough" to pull it off.  \n\nAnother thing is to get a good study group, or at least good friend who'll keep you on track.  The company you keep is very important.  Sometimes you really do need an immediate external force to push your nose to the grindstone.\n\nRe. the narcolepsy - are you being treated for it?  Because that may be a significant factor.
1	A narcoleptic who struggles with procrastination? Sounds like a prime candidate for adderall tbh
12	How do ENTPs get along with other ENTPs?	As an ENTP with a MBTI peak at the moment I realized that I do not know even a single ENTP in my surroundings (or maybe I just suck at typing). Is it because we annoy each other? All the celebrity ENTPs seem really likable to me - anybody who wants to share some experience? \n(Or just chat? Like Tandem-ENTPs :D ? )
27	In the same social circle they annoy me by taking too much of MY spotlight.
18	I don't think I've knowingly met another ENTP either. Maybe social circles can only handle one of us lol
9	my best friend and one guy from my school was one.\n\nso my best friend and I get along perfectly. she's the friend I feel most comfortable around bc we get each other and even tho we re not all feely around each other and pretty cold at time we both understand it and most of the time we don't even need to talk we know what we are thinking about\n\nthen again the guy in my class\n\nwe were A L W A Y S fighting. always. during classes we would just fight (verbally ofc) and were sent to the principal many times together, who hated us bc we lacked any respect towards him. now we were TOO similar to get along tbh and Idk he kind of had a problem with me I guess I crashed his ego (im female btw)\n\nbut then again even tho we were always fighting and outsiders would think we hate each other, I really had no hard feelings against him and gotta say he was a pretty cool dude. when I saw my class again after 2 years all the other girls ignored me and guess what that entp dude was the only who approached me and asked whats up, but I think its funny how we were always fighting but we both knew that after all, we had nothing really against each other. funny experience tbh and kinda fits the entp stereotype
7	Here's the answer; you dont. \n\nJokes aside, i dont have any friend entp. But i also dont have many enfp friends. Doubling up on high Ne and low Si is draining. 
7	My closest work friend is also ENTP. It's great because if the day is ever dragging, we'll just start an email debate or go off on some weird tangent to pass the time. 
8	Always passive aggressive and have to outshine each other. 
6	my best friend is an ENTP, and we're like BFF soulmates. we never argue... we understand each other freakishly well. i also have 3 other ENTP friends and we all get along really well too :) we're like a force of nature when we're all in the same room \n\nedit: i've also met ENTPs that i've i wanted to stab in the eye, so it really depends on the individual lol
4	I have 3 best friends and we are all entp, and people don't enjoy being around all of us at the same time for long, we love it, but it does get loud, we're all trying to get a hundred ideas out at once lol
4	In one case, I had an ENTP friend who had the opposite opinions of me on every issue so we'd constantly argue back and forth for hours about the most controversial issues while everyone else on the bus would keep telling us to shut up.\n\nIn another case, there was an ENTP in my non-immediate friend circle and he was a complete twat - constantly arguing for the sole purpose of putting other people down while having no redeeming value himself.\n\nIn other case, there was this ENTP girl trying to get with me while at the same time dating one of my friends. She was always uncomfortably close with weirdly penetrating eye contact, trying to ask probing psychological questions and running her hands through my hair. No thanks señorita. 
6	I think we are just bad at typing. I think entps *can* be fairly inconspicuous, especially if they dont have high extroversion, intuition or self-esteem. Think of "lazy philosophers" i bet you'll come across a couple in your social circle. Not saying they are entp, but just because they arent that smart or that funny or that creative or eccentric, doesnt mean they arent entp. They are probably just average folk, expressing their Ne about as much as you do when you have to follow your uninspiring occupations. \n\nThat being said, i defintely know a few enfps whos Ne shows, and ive also met one specific dude that was so entp, i made one joke in a group of people and 2 min later we immediately segregated ourselves from the group. I strongly suspect a couple more people, but they are all high in openness and intelligence and that might be the commonality. \n\nIve also met a few people claiming to be entp and i straight up thought they were obnoxious and too full of themselves and it made me cringe. \n\nKinda like those immature and delude idiots on this sub, that praise being entp over anything else, use it as a scape coat for their failures, exagerate everything, circle jerk all day and have no concept of rational humility, which should be common to all high ti users.
3	Meh bruda. Let us go to Uganda and burn down villages! ;3\n\nLong story short, can't find any ENTP folk. Same basket in another empty village.
3	In moderation.\n\nI have two: one is a coworker and friend. We need to mindfully go easy on the arguing escalation but it's all good fun. Neither one of us would take a ton more of each other in their lives and that's cool. Dish out some quirks, argue weird arguments, call it a day.\n\nThe other is profoundly immature and socially dependent. He's awesome but he doesn't know when to stop or how to read the room. His everyday friends are doormats with nothing much to say and he'll just fill every square inch of the air with words. Kindof a good deal for all involved. I have a great time with him when 2-3 other guys are there with strong enough personalities to give him a run for his money but one on one it's just exhausting, and he's had a hard time keeping friends in general because of it.
3	As real friends, maybe 3 ENTPs. Know more, fun company unless it's the super obnoxious debater type. Some are know-it-alls, some are intellectually arrogant and overly confident in what they don't know. Most are super chill and get along very well with them. Can discuss anything.\n\nThis one friend of mine. Supeeer negative. I don't even know how to respond. Never stops talking, about negatives. Everything to him is an issue to complain about. It is like he only sees problems upon problems upon something to complain about. I am the absolute opposite of ENTPs to this guy, always positive, constructive. Still love to hang out with him, crazy ideas and very knowledgeable (in areas I'm not) and smartening (yes, it's a new word, look it up) company.\n\nI think like ENFPs, ENTPs come in various colors. Some you get along with, some you don't.
2	I’m pretty good at typing and I, also, don’t know any other ENTPs... except my dad. \n\nI’m in a FB group for xNTP females and once asked where they were all from... and they were spread far and wide across the globe. The closet to me is in Pittsburgh; I am in Baltimore. \n\nI’d love to meet another ENTP female. I’m also a little bit afraid of looking in that “mirror” and being horrified by my reflection lol. I think it would be fun if we agreed on most things, and really difficult if we didn’t. Like, I would not have liked me 15 years ago when I was a super “know it all” Christian. Now that I’m atheist, I would find that version of me intolerable sooo... yeah... not convinced I’d like other ENTPs in a broad sense, but I’d still like to meet them.
1	My best friend and a few other casual friends of mine are ENTPs, so I would say I, at least, get along with them. I do occasionally find it exhausting to be around other ENTPs (and ENFPs for that matter) for a long time, especially if we're both feeling our oats.\n\nYou can tell when you've been hanging out with another ENTP when you realize you just spent at least an hour talking about your half-baked business ideas and nobody pointed out that they were half-baked.
1	Most of my good friends are NTs and most of these NTs are ENTPs like me
1	I’ve been best friends with an ENTP for the past 7 years, even before we knew anything about MBTI, and we get along very well. Think and function quite similarly and that always helps when dealing with our more emotional/ illogical friends. It’s just super nice to have someone who GETS you so easily :)
1	I  know one other entp but that's it. Based on many entp subs though, I don't think I want entp friends unless they're mature and have learned to develop Fe.
1	amazing. best people ever
33	Older ENTPs (40s and up), share your wisdom with us.	Are you satisfied? Are you ok nowadays? What are some suggestions you have for the younger crowd? \n\nMostly wondering because I’m drunk and I just watched Bojack Horseman and I felt like it’s what my future holds and now I’m slightly worried.
57	I'm 40 for another month. \n\n* In meetings: Even though I often feel I'm the smartest one in the room, it doesn't mean I need to run the show and zero in on my intuitive conclusion in the most efficient way. Rather, it's worth it to ask questions and frame the conversation around what I see as the core issue. \n\n* In non-romantic relationships: listen and ask active questions. Find a way to ask 'what do you mean by that' without coming off as confrontational. \n\n* Parenting: Tell kids the reasoning behind the rules, let them push back (you'll beat them with a better argument). Don't try to multitask but slow down and give them eye-contact attention. My kids are 9-11-13, and the 11 year old is going to be a problem as the gap in logical arguing is narrowing. I'm so proud of her.\n\n* Productivity: Figure out a way to convince yourself that working extra-hard on an important project now, rather than last minute, will make the difference. Struggling to articulate this. I'm best in 'oh shit' panic mode. So I build up the size and amount of work required for excellence in my mind, so the 'oh shit' comes earlier.    Sorry for articulating this poorly - hope it helps someone.\n\n* BONUS: read a lot. Not audiobooks, not YouTube (both fine, but reading is better). You want as much of your vocabulary to become your active vocabulary as possible. Be the one who can put what you correctly intuit into words that resonate with your audience. The best way I know to get to that point is wide reading of intelligent, high-level English speakers (ie. Grisham novels won't move the meter much in this regard).
30	Well shit, doesn't look like any ENTPs made it past 40 sober enough to answer. 
18	* Spend your energy in your 20s learning and honing a skill that is on demand and will get you paid. Get as friggin good as you think you can be or about thereof. A lot follows from setting your work life straight, early.\n\n* Fe and Si aren't curse words. Journal emotions, set up a routine. You have more to gain from harnessing discipline and self-awareness than from indulging in what you are already good at. **Meditate.**\n\n* Being correct doesn't mean you're right. You can't treat every conversation like an argument/debate. Most times, the greatest 'win' you can get out of a conversation is NOT the upper hand, but rather some insight into the other and/or a way forward where your relationship is framed within boundaries that allow everyone to chime in and feel respected.\n\n* Wait until you're 40 to give advice. I'm not even 35. Sue me.
12	40yr old ENTP here.  This stuff helps me. Take it or leave it. \n\nRespect your obligations. \nFollow through with your commitments.\nHonor your responsibilities. \nAct with integrity. \nJust because you are the smartest person in the room, you don't need to prove it.
29	God I can't even watch Bojack Horseman. Makes me want to kill myself. 
7	\*Sits waiting for a reply from Az\*
5	I am 37, only a few years left for true wisdom. I am not sharing my - not yet complete -  wisdom unless you allow 37s and up...
5	\-Instead of being the smartest person in the room try to be the one with the fewest assumptions.  (This doesn't mean learning a bunch of new junk.  It means letting a lot go by the wayside.)\n\n\-Never blame anybody for anything (including yourself).\n\n\-Keep your mouth shut!  (yes, I know how insightful and hilarious you are.)  \n
8	Why? You won't listen.
3	I'm 57, and still at this age I strive to be better than a was the day before in Mind, Body, and Spirit. \n\nI still dislike "Willful Ignorance", or people that make decisions based  on emotions rather logical facts\n\nI understand that even though I like having "Options" life still requires that once the data has been collected make a decision and stick with it. That is for Relationship, Business, Social, and Careers.\n\nTalk only when receptiive ears are listening and understand the difference between "Circle of Concern" and "Circle of Control"\n\n&#x200B;
5	Not over 40 yet but...  Get the fuck off the internet and read a book, make rl friends, take a class, kiss a girl, play a sport, backpack a country, etc.  This is the land of the lotus eaters.  
1	Read, ( you think you know but you don't), pick or decide  couple of career after careful assesment and consultation and then stick to them,  yes you can do well on most but focus on few to rip the benefit, slowely shift from argumentative to a smart debater, stop being naive and don't experent things on yourself instead use researches, you are not wierd but unique, read about psycholgy. There will be lots of identity crisis and getti g in out of different meaning. Go to counselor if needed, since you think better when you talk. Mostly work hard on loving, accepting ur uniqueness. You are fine and you are unique even wirh lots of awkwardness. Since it will take time to understand your self don't commit in long term relation at early age. Since you are unique make sure marry someone who matches your personality. Good luck.

6	Thoughts keep you up at night	Just wondering how many other ENTPs out there have a hard time falling asleep because you can't turn your brain off. TOO..MANY..IDEAS!!!\n\nThat being said, I've got a pretty good handle on managing this now. But tonight I REALLY want to stay up and read. Kinda sucks cause I know my brain will go haywire if I do so instead I'm going to watch something mindless to begin coming down *sigh*
11	White noise generators help. They're like high efficiency signal jammers for your brain. "Oh so that pirate ship in pirates of the caribb—wirrrrrrrrr—yeah so that ship—wirrrrrr—ah fuck it."
6	> Just wondering how many other ENTPs out there have a hard time falling asleep because you can't turn your brain off.\n\nYep. I listen to podcasts at night. If I have something to focus on, my brain doesn't wander and I can go to sleep.
6	I smoke weed and watch 90's sitcoms I have seen a million times.
3	Yep I always have conversations in my head, think about life, what im going to do tomorrow, if sitting on a mattress on top of the room and riding it down is feasible. 
3	I listen to ambient/classical music. It really helps. It also surpasses the annoying water noise of my problematic toilet siphon.
84	Do you find this accurate too you?	 Disclaimer: this is not written by me. I just wanted to see what you all thought. I found a lot of it hit home.\n\noriginal post ( quora) :[https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-an-ENTP](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-an-ENTP) this is the response from: C.D Angeli\n\nWhat’s it like to be an ENTP?\n\nI always asked this question of myself, as an ENTP. You never could quite get your finger on it. Then, I found this “ENTP Rant”, written anonymously on the interwebs a few years ago. It completely resonated with me and totally nailed the ENTP experience. Hope it helps you all out as well:\n\n"Here's my take with all the dirt. An ENTP looks great from the outside because we make you laugh, we give you true insightful criticism, we know all about your interests, and really "understand" you -we know logically why you feel like you do, even if you don't. We find creative "why didn't I think of that" solutions to not only your life problems but your computer problems too.\n\nWe can charm your grandparents, your parents, and your friends. We can party with the extraverts, and sit in silence with the introverts. We can talk Trek with nerds, and Baudelaire with artsy-fartsies. You probably didn't notice us in high school because we were in our embryonic pseudoINTP/INTJ morph. But you got surprised when you saw us back from college break and though we looked different (aka more desirable). We seem now just oh so dreamy and exciting.\n\nBut all that takes a -lot- of energy. It's a performance we put on tailor made, on the spot, just for you. Eventually we get tired and the mask slips off. That's when you think we're shallow or self-centered, but the truth is, you misunderstood our performance for personal interest. (And maybe we did too -- it's easy to lose yourself as a method actor.) But we're just as cold and analytical ruthless as the other NTs: We don't nitpick you apart like an INTJ, or categorize your usefulness like an ENTJ, or test your mental capacity like an INTP. We understand you by (subconsciously) pushing all your secret buttons…for good or bad.\n\nMaybe you fell in love with us, but now your angry and conflicted because you don't understand why we're suddenly being cold and distant. We've retreated -- because while we're good at faking emotion, and logically understanding why people feel a certain way, we're really terrible at actually handling emotion. We get overpowered by it and annoyed by the illogicalness of it. ( Besides, we've already found a new shiny.) Now you hate us…but here is some consolation. We have a built-in nemesis and he's a real bastard.\n\nWe turn that critical wide-ranging eye on ourselves. You can't see it from the outside, but were utter perfectionists in our heads and we relentlessly measure ourselves against the realistically unachievable. Somehow we can't find the same easy solutions to our problems as to everyone else's, and we become mired in too many possibilities, haunted by how inadequate our own creative efforts seem to us. We at once believe our own hype, and ruthlessly condemn ourselves. We'll mail you our creations (probably something 1/2 finished). We secretly want your praise, like an 8 yo child. We don't accept your [garlands](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/13/0/19/DealFrame/DealFrame.cmp?AR=1&BEFID=96441&CM=&DealName=Garland+Rug+Value+Plush+Solid+Rug,+Brown&FPT=DSP&GR=&HasLink=&IsFtr=0&IsLps=0&IsSmart=0&Issdt=171204223429&MN=&MRS=&MerchantID=300086&ND=&NDP=5&NDS=&NG=2&NMS=&PD=&PN=1&RR=1&SKU=63900361&ST=7&acode=70&aon=%5E1&bm=65&brnId=14305&category=&code=&crawler_id=811181&dealId=-Dnaqcw23bhLUbdXU5lftg%3D%3D&dlprc=95.99&linkin_id=8058742&lnkId=&op=&searchID=p31.6dae3fc1cf8614745f02&url=http://clickserve.dartsearch.net/link/click?lid%3D92700014999069387%26ds_s_kwgid%3D58700001245061795%26ds_s_inventory_feed_id%3D97700000001002320%26ds_e_product_id%3D63900361%26ci_customer_id%3D1001227%26ci_cse_id%3D1004%26ci_feed_id%3D1004921%26ds_e_product_merchant_id%3D6382239%26ds_e_product_country%3DUS%26ds_e_product_language%3Den%26ds_e_product_channel%3Donline%26ds_url_v%3D2%26ds_dest_url%3Dhttps://www.kohls.com/product/prd-2921052/garland-rug-value-plush-solid-rug.jsp%253Fci_mcc%253Dci%2526utm_campaign%253DEC%252520ACCENT%252526AREA%252520RUGS%2526utm_medium%253DCSE%2526utm_source%253Dshopping%2526CID%253Dshopping17%26sdc_id%3D%7Bsdc_id%7D) though (unless you're an expert we respect) -- because we've already judged ourselves against Perfection and came out wanting.\n\nIf you tell us you think it's good, we won't believe you. For what you mistook as bravado and arrogance, is really very wry, very sarcastic self-mortification.\n\nWe can stagnate in our mess of ideas, with no external system of organization to help us move forward. We have brief mad rushes of energy --back, forward, right, left, a random walk of ideas with a net movement of zero. If you're really smart, being an ENTP is a double curse…because your ideas are loftier, your movements more wide-ranging, your internal critic all the more perniciously accurate. You stand on the shoulders of titans, glimpsing something wonderful across the jungle of possibilities, and sketch out a map.\n\nBut then it happens: SJ reality. They turn off your water because you forgot to pay the bill. A check bounces because you didn't know how much money you had in the account. You burn dinner because you're suddenly obsessed with typing out a manifesto on a blog. You tell a friend you'll meet him at 7:00 and show up at 9:00. You forget to call your mother on her birthday. You put off simple annoyances (like depositing a check) for weeks. Your mighty creative intuition gets mostly employed to talk your way out of the stupid jams your procrastination landed you in. People with lesser talents, pass you by and you make excuses: (The internal critic says it's because you’re stupid and lazy).\n\nYou don't get the promotion because while you have a lot of good ideas, you don't follow through. You're unreliable. You have no problems expressing your boredom with your job or critiquing your boss publicly in front of his superiors, not realizing the implications. SJ boss now -really- doesn't like you. You get A's in some college classes and F's in others -- but all your NT professors still think you're intelligent, even the one's giving your F's, because they've fallen for your charms and excuses.\n\nBut people like you -- they think your unique, clever and entertaining, because you are. They give you chances. So you pick yourself up, dust yourself off from your failures, and try again. Maybe you get yourself another brilliant ENTP friend and start Apple Computer. Or write Candide. Or invent Quantum Electrodynamics. Or host the Daily Show. Maybe tomorrow. Or Next week. But what you'll probably do, instead of working on finishing a paper your supposed to be readying for peer review, you'll spend an hour typing out a cathartic blog post that's maybe more about your own insecurities than being an ENTP.\n\nSo is ENTP the best of all the types? Hell yes it is. =)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack to me: I also often find I have to put a "face" on around other people. The only time I don't is when I am by myself or if I find someone that is just like me. People tell get mad at me because I used to try and have conversations with them but now I barely talk to them and they think I just don't like them anymore (usually I just give up because they are boring or I can't be myself around them). anyway, would love to get your guy's thoughts on this.
48	Well written but too personal. \n\nThe person whom wrote this was actually describing what he tought he was as a person, not as a psychological type.\n\n Wich is, from my point of view, more valuable. Anyway, if I relate ? Kinda. If I found this interesting ? Hell yeah.
31	Ab-so-fucking-lutely.\n\nI don't think my closest friends realize how much I value them because I've moved around quite a bit and tend to make friends in new cities easily, but it's with my closest friends when I feel like the mask is *almost* off.
33	This is good intellectual oral sex
20	i relate so much to this that im angry now
15	I dont need a stranger to tell me that i am the perfect form of ultimate human. Tell me something i dont know
9	I often scoff at those "so accurate" posts on here — but not this one. This is the closest I've been to genuinely reading about myself. The faces, the distance, comparing myself to perfection and failing, the charm, OMG the simple annoyances. Fuck yes, so much yes.\n\nI guess my father saw the penchant for laziness and drilled it out of me. That and dire money situations forced me to be reliable and industrious. People will pass me and I'll feel stupid and lazy, sure, but I won't show late and I'll get shit done. Paradoxally, it seems to only make the internal critique worse: if I can be that good AND get it done, why TF am I not on top of the totem pole?\n\nSolid type layout. Sure, it was personal and you give some and take some. But very genuine and as true to me too as one can reasonably expect.
16	Well, sort of. The issue with this post is that I really do not give a shit about all of these dramatic “woe is me” aspects of being an ENTP. It’s almost as if he obsesses over them and has made them part of his identity. 
6	Spot on!
9	Stop scripting me asshole
4	Lol the OP sounds like a fuckin’ sad sack \n\n
3	a lot of this gives me 3w4 energy that i really don’t relate to \n\nthat being said it’s vere interesting to read anyways :)
2	My performance to outsiders is more like antibodies, the first wave of "me" is general crowd pleasing bordering controversial statements, the next wave is a specific attack on what you enjoy and can generate conversation while things may get more "walking the line" it may also retreat to a simple playful and polite convo 
2	Dude... what the fuck! 100% spot on 
2	Not only is this accurate but I was floored when I first read it some months ago, and then I could never find it again. Thank you for bringing it back to my life. If only I had gotten the chance to send this to my\n\n>but now youre angry and conflicted because you don't understand why we're suddenly being cold and distant\n\nperson
3	> But all that takes a -lot- of energy. It's a performance we put on tailor made, on the spot, just for you. Eventually we get tired and the mask slips off. \n\nUhhhhhh no. This is so emo. 
1	I don’t think I’ve ever read or seen anything that has described me as perfectly as this 
1	Pretty true. The closest people in my life are the ones who know me with the 'mask off', which there are only four of them. I have lots of friends but I never "take my mask off" because I know they'll lose interest in me / think I'm too weird to stay friends. \n\nAlso that SJ reality though. I should be studying for my finals (I've got two in two days... whelp) but I'm here procrastinating. 
1	Read that same post the other day and the same response stood out to me. I can so relate. 
1	Truth. 
1	It's a bit too self defeating. For sure relatable, but listening to someone cry about their own personal failures as it relates to their type (which it does... but many of them are ridiculous... meeting a friend at 9:00 instead of 7:00? C'mon.) seems rather "look at how hard my life is."\n\nWe are narcisstic and self-destructive, but we don't try to live our lives as one big melodrama. 
1	Basically yeah
1	"We can stagnate in our mess of ideas, with no external system of organization to help us move forward.

0	Halfway through and didnt read anything i could have not read on a description of an infj, which ive read lots of. Better to be more specific.
9	A day in the life of an ENTP	got up way early. Hated life for 8 hours. At 5 pm, solved a complicated engineering problem, 7pm .\n..had my kids rolling from a story book reading, 9pm convinced my wife I really do love her (I really do, but she's INFP, so, happy but hard work). 11pm. Interpreting Pink Floyd lyrics with a slight buzz. I'll be up all night and at 5 am tomorrow I'll be winning my teenager's approval back with all the research I did into his music last night.
7	Okay, gotta admit. That's one \*bit\* is cute.
6	*We're exhausting....* 😄
1	Why is this accurate, our lives suck 
-4	you must be an entj\n\nI got up 24 hours late and smoked a fat bowl of DMT so I could experience hating life for a metaphysical eternity. Afterward I attempted some homework, but soon realized I had been jerking off instead. This made me hungry so I went out and married the first 6/10 I could find and had her make me some dinner, after which I tricked her into divorcing me by disguising the papers as an MBTI test that you had to sign at the end (she was infp so she fell for it pretty easily). It is now 1am. I am typing this with a procedural text generator I designed to emulate my writing patterns, and tonight I'll marijuana marijuana marijuana marijuana thank you
24	My 2018 Spotify Mix ... Thought other ENTP’s on this sub might like to post theirs. Happy listening, as I pride myself on my amazingly beautiful and intricate music taste, it is pretty lovely, all I am saying 😉

I listened to Vulfpeck and Jacob Collier a LOT this year, but none of their songs pop up. However, I listen to Vampire Weekend one day of the entire year, for the nostalgia, and it's represented in this playlist.

4	5 ENTP stereotypes: How accurate? (Agree or disagree?)	
1	Of course the stereotypes will seem wrong when you're actually an ENFP.
7	ENTPs and finding purpose in life. What's yours?	Okay so however cliché the title may sound, the better explanation is : I want to find something I could obsess with for a longer run. Something to keep me interested, invested, something that would give me energy to get out of bed. I don't believe there's ultimate purpose in life, we live, we die, that's it. But I wanna something that would be important for me at least, just to not be bored and to get excited about something. When you're obsessed with something you have no time for boredom, there's nothing like lack of energy for doing it. So my question is, do you have things like that? If yes then what are they?
17	I think ENTPs have a difficult time realizing that the Ne-Ti aspect of their personality is not just something that needs to be owned when talking/debating with people, but also something that needs be owned in every day life.\n\nFor the longest time, I constantly tried to force myself to focus on one “purpose” in life at all times. I would be angry that I couldn’t *love* one single subject like an INTJ or an ISFP could. It frustrated me that I couldn’t just fucking go, go, go and be driven for this project that I believed could “change everything”. But then I realized this: the more I tried to control myself and wished that I could just love, focus, and obsess over one subject, the more I fucking grew to loathe it. ExxPs in general are explorers by nature. Above all else, we need to physically, mentally, and emotionally explore this world (varying in degrees based on the type). You just have to own that dude. If you don’t own it, it’s going to eat you alive and leave as a shell of your former self.\n\nExample: I went into college determined to make my mark in the film industry. Seriously. I was confident that *I* had the answers. I had done the research, I had worked on films, I knew how to write, blah blah blah. And then suddenly once I got into school I realized that my “ideal” vision for the life I was so sure of wasn’t going to be easy. I had let myself down because in my mind it made “perfect” sense on how I was going to obtain it, but then was smacked in the fact by reality. So...I gradually lost interest. I then began to resent the fuck out of it.\n\nAs time went on, I switched from major to major, thinking that this was *for sure* the career I wanted to have. Computer Science...Psychology...Robotics...etc. Every time I got interested and obsessed with these subjects, it would be like the choirs of heaven were singing in my ear because I “finally” found my calling. Nope. Let down every time because of how much I idealized the fuck of the ideas of these things.\n\nAnd then suddenly it hit me maybe...six months ago or so: If I continue to obsess over the idea, fascination, or “glory” that goes along with whatever the hell I’m going awol over, I’m going to be disappointed every time and burn myself the fuck out. Every time. I realized that I need to just go with the flow of what is realistically available for me and how I think. \n\nAka, do what you are *actually* good at. Something that you *actually* enjoy and not just like because of the “possibilities” of it. For example, I love writing. I have always loved it. It’s not something I idealize to the moon and back, it’s something I *know* I can do. I have won awards, I was always in the top of my classes for it, and I know that if I tried I could do damn well pursuing something along those lines. I don’t “believe this ideally because my Ne has told me it’s all so incredibly possible and it’ll change everything”. I know it because of my experiences with it over the course of my life....\n\nHowever, that’s not enough for me. I can’t *just* be doing that or else I will grow to hate it because staying on one single track is like torture to me. So you know what? I’ll continue to write, I’ll do well, and if it takes me somewhere...cool. I’ll continue working on it since I find it interesting, and because I’m me I’ll likely find success in it...and I’ll do a million other things while I’m doing that. And that is *okay*. \n\nYou’ve got to mix things up. You’ve got to know your strengths. You’ve got to accept that sometimes the mundane, reality of life can get old- but guess what?? We’re ENTPs. We are *experts* at mixing things up. You don’t need to obsess over anything. That’s a tactic that might work for literally anyone expect for ExxPs- especially ENxPs. \n\nThe great thing about ENTPs is that if we just accept this and go with it, I think success sort of just..falls in your lap. Obsessing over one thing will likely leave you stagnated because you probably won’t obsess over actually *doing* it, you’ll just obsess over it while you’re sitting in your bed or on your couch thinking of all the amazing possibilities your obsession with the subject could do. \n\nExample: Ever since I stopped majoring and obsessing over film, I’ve found a lot of success within it. I’ve currently worked on three Hollywood feature films and dozens of commercials. How did this happen if I didn’t obsess over it? I just let my interests in film be something cool and fun that I could do. I made connections, I talked with them, and now I have a pretty good resume for film. It just...happened. And I found that I could enjoy it more if I didn’t think it was supposed to be “LIFES WORK”.\n\nYou are not *made* for obsessing over one thing. You are an explorer. The sooner you realize that, accept it, and just own it, the happier you’ll be. Look, I’m just 21 so many I’m full of shit- but I spend a *lot* of time analyzing myself, others, and the motivations behind why people do what they do. I know why I do things pretty well at this point and I am painfully aware of my flaws- so if you’re anything like me... as a fellow ENTP, be practical about what needs to be done in reality, and just let your creatives/rational self “flow” with out thinking it’s the biggest and most groundbreaking shit to ever hit planet Earth. You will be much happier that way, and I think you’ll find more success.\n\nSo what is my “purpose” in doing all of this? I guess my purpose is to use all of my connections, smarts, big-world thinking, and idea abilities to eventually be able to let opportunities and intellectual stimulation be handed to me on a silver platter, lol. I want to get to the point where people call me up asking me to work on a film. I want to get to the point where people ask me to sing at a live show for them. I want to get to the point where people ask me to write for them (whatever format that may be). I just want to get to the point where people want me for my ideas and ask for my input and I don’t have to be constantly searching it out and “fishing” for people to be interested in what I have got to say. That would be the fucking dream dude.\n\n\nI also wrote all of this with out being on Adderall...so I mean it, lmao.
3	The question is in the answer my friend. The purpose of life is to live. You are looking for your niche, which is something you will find. That is just one destination in your path. \n\nThe point of life is the journey, not it’s destinations. 
5	I don’t know if obsessive and entp belong in the same sentence. Philosophy wise I like existentialism and I’m also am a humanist. In the end, because I’m an old person, I find great value in my career, but mostly my partnership with my spouse and constantly being able to grow and evolve with them and also in observing and watching my kids mature and become their own people. Sorry for the cliche “career” and  “family” answer but for me it’s satisfying with my hobbies sprinkled in. 
4	Been a trader for many years, it's a pretty constant source of entertainment and never gets boring. If for some reason you get bored of a particular instrument (unlikely) there's plenty of other instruments to trade and an endless pool of financial knowledge to absorb. Plus it satisfys the ENTP 'I want it now' attitudes. Do well, you make money, do poorly, you lose money. Immediate feedback. 
2	Next to infinite learning curve: theravadan buddhism. Im gonna be a monk. They encourage learning and keeping the mind calm in tandem so that you can continue learning for as long and as effectively as possible. 
2	You need something that has good depth and creative potential to maintain long term interest as an ENTP.  If you're doing something which you can quickly learn and master and leaves little room for future growth, or where doing the job is actually tedious, then you're just going to burn out fast. \n\nAs to what that is, you'll have to find it yourself.  For me it was mathematics. 
2	I live to discover. To understand. To learn. I want to be the one who figures out what nobody could. What nobody could afford to research. I would like to live a long life of adventure and knowledge. I don't bother myself with questions that make me loose my drive and motivation. It's a waste of my time to consider what life might be, I just decided to focus on learning what I don't yet understand. I'm still moving forward, when I face a problem, I slow down and i figure it out right there and then. \n\nThe last couple of years, I've spent this time self reflecting. I've done what I can to break bad habits, apologize to those who hate my name and existence. I'm almost at my turning point. The point where I start gaining ground instead of losing it. The journey into despair and sorrow was all worth the trip. The things I have learned and developed have shaped my weakness into something that doesn't bother me much anymore. My internal struggles, I have nearly conquered these battles. In due time, I will be moving forward into the future. The missing pieces of my mind have been nearly fixed. I have figured out how to out think my endless loop. I have clawed my way out of the forest that continued to pull me back. \n\nI have found the key is to heal myself, throughout the mind, body, and all other unnamed factors. Now I won't have to put on this hypothetical "mask" anymore. I'll be myself and quite content in that. No more hiding behind a grand facade. \n\nThat's essentially a basic summary of my current state of life. 
1	I love Economic Development, I am trying to start my career currently and looking for routes. But in the long run, I want to help communities, and eventually nations, prosper. 
1	I'm not gonna say it's a purpose, as it's way too early on in life to say but I've found that acting has gripped my intrests - and I'm not bored of it yet.\n\nPerhaps it's because of the broad genre of ways to act, or natrual talent meaning that when I do find myself getting bored and take a break, it's easy to slip back in. \n\nKeep in mind, I am me, and you are you. These comments are stories of other people, but good luck if it helps you
1	Took me some time but I finally found mine after years of getting to know myself — Diplomacy. 
1	You could try a whack of different things, like me, and piece together a passion from the wreckage of a series of failed careers. At about age 40. \n\nWait. No. Do something else.
1	I've been in media production for a couple of decades, only because it's a job that renews itself every few weeks. Every new project is a clean slate, new challenge and require tons of fresh ideas. I think it is either that kind of setup or really deep subjects that can keep us on the hook.\n\nReally though, sticking to something long-term doesn't have any value in itself, if *you* don't see the value in it.

3	I need some honest help guys.	Hello everyone, I'd like to first start with a warning here, what I'm about to write is some emotionally disturbing content to say the least, it's not something shocking or sad (people have it worse I know), but it might make you feel weird. My sheer lack of... "luck" will mean I will never be successful, so what I'm writing here is just for damage control, at least manage to live an average life.\n\nAlso I'm not asking this necessarily from an ENTP's point of view, I cannot absolutely say that I'm one, but my rather crappy situation turned me into one, and now this is the type i mostly test as and feel close to. So I'm asking you guys, you might better understand me.\n\nI'd like to begin with an introduction of myself: I just turned 20 years old, I'm a guy, I live in central-eastern Europe. Studying public administration but that's just to have a college, it's needed in left-wing countries. My life has been kind of sabotaged from the beginning: I was raised by a single mother who was also borderline and overall a toxic person. While she is solidly middle class, the crappy way she managed her money meant that I was very well dressed and fed, but that's about it, otherwise I had limited money to develop myself. Now I am living alone for about 9 months, I claimed a property from a family member, sold it and bought this small studio apartment. (Should I sell this and move abroad?)\n\nMy problems begun with my mother being rather aggressive towards other people. She was fighting my grandmother and that shocked me a lot. My parents divorced when I was 3, and ever since I'm 11 I haven't heard from my father (He wasn't good with me either, but should I still try and get in touch with him again?).\n\nMy childhood was kinda trapped in my mother's OCD routine lifestyle. Ever from the start she tried to control my social interactions but I always seemed to stop her from doing that, up to a point at least because I spent a good amount of time isolated. This wasn't the only problem. Because she was only giving me poor quality processed food (chicken, now known to contain hormones) I developed some hormonal problems, I had a very quick puberty and was fat until about 3 years ago when I went to the gym, now I permanently sped up my metabolism and I'm underweight. Yes, I'm serious, I went from fat to muscular to underweight when all my muscle mass I built was lost in a psychotic episode. Not to also tell that, until 17 years old, I excessively masturbated and further screwed up my hormones. Had no other way, I had limited socialization because of her and no other way of spending energy. Also because I ate lots of bad food I formed appendicitis at 16 and have a huge scar from the surgery. And I also went bald a few months ago, I look rather bad despite shaving my head, I'll need one of those hair replacements.\n\nThe fucked up way my teenage years started, with my screwed puberty and a very toxic parent means, you get it very well, that now I am a very frustrated person. This part needs no further explanation, I wasted my teenage years.\n\nI never had a girlfriend, still don't have one, but at 17 years old I took matters into my own hands and at least I did the damage control: I stole some money and banged escorts. I continued to do this for about 30 times, stealing money and things to go to escorts, this was my way of at least living my life somehow, this was the only thrill I've ever lived! I was never caught stealing, but I do have a criminal record for assault because I was very jealous of a guy a few years ago. You see, my toxic mother made me a toxic person too.\n\nWhat I didn't know at that time, and what I've only recently found out, is that if you have sex with escorts but you are unable of seducing "normal" females, you will develop mental problems. So that's exactly what happened to me.\n\nFortunately I haven't developed fully blown depression. If that would've been the case I would have been dead by now. What I developed instead is a mixture of bipolar, ADHD and a milder schizophrenia (officially diagnosed with mania and recurrent brief psychotic disorder but I threw away my medical papers, I don't want to be labeled as insane, especially in my politically left-bound country, Romania, that's why I might want to move abroad in a right wing country, employers here keep testing my mental strength).\n\nAt first I was dealing with my mental issues by talking to other people and making some friends out of which I still have two now (I'm more introverted now), I was also going to raves, because it's loud music and you can scream your lungs out of your frustration. But I did steer out of control a few times. First I had some lame and hysterical suicide attempts, one by pills, flushed out in less than 15 minutes, other with superficial puncture wounds. Then I turned violent and repulsive, fought two people, with one of them I broke his nose and two ribs, he lost consciousness and police was called, long story short nothing happened after that because I literally was insane, actually it fed my mother's borderline and she dealt with the situation despite me refusing it.\n\nThese last two years not much has happened. I found some stuff out, figured out my problems, accepted my faith, moved out from my mother and tried to get my stuff back together. Also I managed to "partially fix" my mind, with the help of a friend I took some benzos, some anticonvulsants and smoked weed a few times. They completely fixed my repulsive and anxious behaviors but I still cannot function properly. However I completely refuse going to any doctor ever again, because I almost got killed when I had appendix surgery, long story. The good thing I've done was volunteering, I done like 20 total days of volunteer work over 6 months, but in the end I got kicked out of the organization when they found out I was giving people extra event bracelets. I wanted to do good things :)\n\nHere is what I need from you guys. I will list my problems and kindly ask you for some little advice, anything will be of help.\n\n1. I still have weird socialization. I'm popular in one moment, slightly rejective in the next. I "try too hard" to anticipate things I need to do, then I sort of do them anyway. I have a few friends, but to most people I talk to I just spread thoughts and ideas and, like an ENTP, rant a little too while doing this.\n2. I still have remnants of ADHD, but at least I can learn things now so I will be able to finish this college and maybe get some qualifications. However it is still an issue with employment right now. I make enough money to survive and have occasional fun, about a third from other family members and the rest by helping someone with work, now I'm okay but I know that at one point I will have to get employed. So far all my job interviews resulted in rejections, probably because my thinking is "all over the place". Sometimes I am very okay for the first part of the interview, but at the second part "something" happens and I turn all stupid.\n3. I need a girlfriend, (at least one girlfriend because I'll never be successful with women, I know that, I'm a weird guy). I don't go to escorts anymore, and having a gf will help me a lot. How can I manage to seduce? Because, just like with the job interviews, I might be very well in the beginning, I got to kissing once, but then my mind screws up, I overthink things and end up with nothing. And yes, I am underweight, bald and a trainwreck currently so not particularly attractive. I'm tall tho, 6'2, that's my only asset.\n4. I need to manage my other issues, my metabolism to at least gain enough weight and muscle mass, watch out not to lose my shit again (the minor psychosis), manage to keep myself up to a decent social position so that I won't end up on the streets. I want to at least have a child, because would've been a capable and intelligent person, people still complement me saying that I'm clever, but my trauma's turned me into the trainwreck I am now.\n5. Again, should I sell my apartment and get myself the fuck out of this shithole that is Romania? I like nordic countries and those people might accept me slightly better than here. I had some planning done and it's very doable even right now. However I'm afraid that without the proper support and friends I will end up, again, on the streets.\n\nThank you very much. This text was completely written from my thoughts, just the way they popped out, if this was all over the place then I'm sorry.
10	Start by taking ownership of your life.  You seem to have a reason for why everything in you life happened as the result of something bad that happened *to you*.  If you believe that everything is out of your control, you will never be able to get back on track.  \n  \nWhile it may be true that certain things in your life were unfortunate, the past is the past and to move forward you'll need to convince yourself that you are the only person in control and the only one capable of doing that.  There are many methods of accomplishing this.  Have you ever consider counseling?  \n  \nRegardless, chin up.  If you think you're going to succeed, you probably will.  If you think you're going to fail, you probably will.
6	Honestly the best way you can get help is to stop finding all these external reasons your life sucks. You write this is as a very woe is me. You are an adult, focus your energy on things you can control and stop finding reasons it’s someone else’s fault. \n\nStart looking at small things you can improve and fix yourself, independent of others. Once you stabilize yourself, address other issues. 
3	If you come to Sweden you will hate yourself everyday, the culture here is fucked and there is an extreme divide between foreigners and ethnic Swedes. \n\nMy parents are Arabic/South European and I fucking hate older Swedish people. Everyone is extremely introverted and making friends is a hard task. Getting in to good schools here is hell because of the competition. I would say come here if you are prepared to live alone for some time, or I could be wrong perhaps someone might like you and you for an friend group.\nI feel like I can relate to you somehow and coming from a like minded persons perspective on this situation without bias I would say that you are probably overthinking it, just study hard in that apartment start working out, eat good food and always try to step out of your comfort zone, if you see a cute girl somewhere just go up and say hi something like “hello my name is X and I saw you and didn’t want to pass up the opportunity to say hello”. And I’m the beginning you will fuck up and when you get rejected or called a weirdo embrace it, laugh about it to yourself. \n\nEven though you are a train wreck a lot of successful people started out this way.\nDon’t get hair replacement that might duck you up even further. Just stick to a schedule start reading books workout eat healthy and study hard. \n\nSo my main advice: Get a schedule and stick to it, also try to step out of your social comfort zone. A book I would recommend for you is 12 rules for life (TAKE NOTES WHILE YOU READ IT). \nYou are a train wreck yes BUT you can fix it if you stay true to yourself and stop overthinking stuff, let your daily schedule lead the way and follow it blindly. 
2	Just enjoy your life. That's all you can do. Don't get just bent up about negative things.
2	if your clever you don't need to impress some employer. educate yourself on business through books and all and try to start a business and be an entrepreneur. before you have enough money don't leave your country bc at least you got family there that'd pick you up from the streets. build an emotional wall between you and your mother and I know this is going to sound harsh, but try to get rid of the mindset that this is your fate bc of your mother. YOU are in control. no one has the right to make feel like shit. so even if things been going shitty until now, first thing to do is, changing your mindset. seeing that your past doesn't define you and you don't even give a fuck and are indeed capable of living like everyone else. reality is made of what you accept as your reality. if you want a gf, try to eat some more food and work out again, maybe from home bc gym cost money too. don't worry about baldness just wear a cap. find something that brings you joy in life for me music helped A LOT. and to avoid psychosis once in a while go somewhere where no one else is, scream everything thats been on your chest out, maybe let your anger out on some objects, and come back refreshed to reality. don't forget YOU ARE IN CONTROL.
2	Do nice things for others. Expect nothing. Continue. 
2	Seems like it's time to move forward. Remember the past but don't allow it to consume your mind. Take some time to sit down and plan out your future. Figure out how to solve the things you see as a problem one step at a time. Research your problems and learn how to fix them. Start building yourself into a better version of you. \n\nEssentially, it's time to act. Start improving yourself in a single way. Focus on that until your comfortable with the new results.
1	A girlfriend will not fix your problems.  You need to move past the unfortunate experiences of your youth (easier said than done).  Getting in contact with your father is unlikely to help anything, and if he is a toxic person that could totally sabotage your attempts at self-improvement.  Start by getting a good therapist and working on your coping skills, resilience, interpersonal skills, etc..  Nothing will magically improve if you don’t put in the work.  Don’t sell your apartment on a whim, wait until you are financially stable enough to make a move.  After you have everything in your life under control, you won’t need to “seduce” a female to be with you.  Learn to talk and relate to people and go out more once you have everything sorted out in your personal life, and you will meet many new people, hopefully even a girlfriend.  Remember though, a girl will not be your savior, you are the only one who can fix yourself.

Comment below the persons type, a brief description of what they like as an individual, and then everyone else give Christmas gift suggestions based on that info.	Genius? Right? Okay, I’ll go first.

1	I'd I love to get your thoughts on something, and it's not serious	So my cousin showed me a video he thought I’d enjoy, and he was right. As I was watching the video I was like, “He’s an ENTP.” And then I stopped myself from typing him within like 10 seconds as “proper typing takes patience,” I told myself. But then whenever he would comment on videos it would somehow get political and conspiracy-ridden when he was supposedly not meaning to and I was like, “He wants me to type him as an ENTP.”\n\nSooo I was wondering if you all could, if you had the time as this is not important at all, could enlighten me with your thoughts on the matter. Maybe someone here is familiar with more of his videos as he does seem to have a healthy subscriber count.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqgJ4aTsXv4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqgJ4aTsXv4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd honestly, him ranting about stuff, or him having a channel dedicated to giving his unfiltered opinion, wasn’t the thing that really convinced me as anyone can rant about whatever. It was the fact that I kept thinking as I was watching it that he was not being nice, but also that I couldn’t help but laugh because, well… he wasn’t wrong, persay—> which is usually my reaction to most of my interactions with my ENTP friends(they could not care in the slightest about MBTI so why I don’t just send it to them, the best they do is tolerate me bringing it up on occasion because they seem to respect me enough to at least hear me out). I will usually think there are better ways they could accomplish their goals and how they say things, but I also see the merits of their current methods and thoughts, with a side of laughter. I haven’t noticed I have such a reaction to any other type so this could be a first. \n\nSo yeah, was just wondering…. Hope everyone is having a great night, and maybe you’ll just pleasantly enjoy the video too\n\n&#x200B;
4	After two bowls I came across your post and all I can say is:\n1) I agree with you I think he's entp.\n2)  I have subscribed.\n3) I would love to have a beer with him.\n\n thank you
2	I'm not seeing an ENTP because I'm not seeing any Ti or Ne.\n\nI can't really tell his type because he's playing things up pretty exaggerated and he's reading a script.\n\nBut if I had to guess, assuming he's somewhat like that in person, it would be ESFP. 
1	And HOW, Azdahak, does it know what it doesn’t know?.... maybe there’s a function that tells one what it knows and doesn’t know.... maybe it’s Si *glares*\nNononononono. What? Judgment functions are what one does with the perceptions made. “Judge things to be connected or not” pffffft. What exactly do you think the perceptions do? Take my Ni for instance- I instantly sum up that I know what’s going on in any given situation(even though I’m oblivious to my surroundings in Se).... and now having figured what’s going on I decide on how to handle the situation, TiFe. \nOne uses the judgment functions to JUDGE what to do with or how to deal with the perception; in what manner it is to be carried out. \nIt’s more evident in those who have imbalanced perceivers. AND it probably helps to have subjective perception first. I imagine an ever objective extroverted function is hardly sure of itself, and would need to resort to their judgments for clarity as they usually lack clarity in Si. Ne is too objective to ever be an assured subjective introverted perceiver- being sure of those connections.\n\nAnd how would say something like Fe, picking up on emotions of others, feed into chaining the links of NeSi? \nSi is responsible for perceiving where one is in the process of something, the process in the sensory. When an Ne dominants are yapping for long periods of time, and forget what the original topic was, what one was trying to say, tangenting again and again..... Si would be remembering the details up until that moment. It could be as little as 15 seconds ago, 5 seconds ago.... yes, it does instantly transfer into Si. If it’s not Se- right here right now, only the present- than it would be Si by default. \n\nPunk.... don’t generalize by saying something like “smart.” There are PLENTY of careers that one could accomplish doctorate level work without much Ni interference. And what you’re probably seeing is Ti in them and a very quick mind(Se-I will explain if need be). These ESTPs- they speak of the underlying pattern in all things, how it relates to their work—> “I don’t need to do more than necessary today because I trust the future”—> they speak of gists, the impractical, and just ideas for hours on end? Remember, if it’s not physical and directly observable than it falls under intuition. Intuition is not being smart. If any of these ESTPs said “life might actually not be about taking things day by day, the journey... maybe it can be about the destination”<—— that would be utilization of Ni. And I use the word “depth” simply to describe intuition as the non-physical, not “I bet they’re dumb.” If that wasn’t clear perhaps that’s my fault, my apologies. \n\n\nPFFFFFFT. It’s not about knowing them, it’s about how others perceive them. In my eyes they’re the sweetest people ever... but then again I think that of everyone so I’m probably a bad reference. But yeah, it’s about how others perceive them and I’m afraid ENTPs don’t get to decide how other types see them.\n\nWell if you believe socionics and the shadow functions are intrinsically linked than.... dude seriously? Where ya been? So an ENTP has NO sense of their surroundings, Se....... has no sense of effective follow through with Te.... has, literally, no personal values whatsoever, Fi(that’s not Ti-can’t just change Ti’s definition to fit your 4 function model). And yeah, that’s all I really have to say about that, that just seems like hopeful negligence to me. \n\nYou’re right, what are in common..... that’s LCD.\nFirst causes.... WHAT DO YOU THINK LCD is?\nNow think: what happens when one reaches a collection of first causes..... you seek a deeper first cause by looking at how they are interconnected, like you said. Ti isolates the base variables within things and compares it to other things, it seeks LCD..... you said LCD without using the acronym. \n\nAlso, please pardon my sass, I’m at work and have not slept at all in like 21 hours
1	I've always thought Eric was an ENTP as well. Just seems obvious, *right*?
1	thanks for the content, and I'd say he is
1	Damn, why haven't I found this channel before? Subbed.\n\nAnd yeah, he's definitely ENTP.
3	The Antidote to Civilisational Collapse	
1	I love the part where he talks about how the new age of data processing has gotten us stuck in a sort of feedback loop.\n\nWe're entering a stage of computing where algorithms and ML allow corporations and political parties to understand us better than ever. By recognizing patterns in past behavior, they can predict what we also like/want/do. However, because it's all pattern recognition, it's something of a static system:\n\n> It doesn’t have any vision of the future because the way it works is by constantly monitoring what you did yesterday and the day before, and the day before that. And monitoring what I did yesterday and the day before and the day before that and doing the same to billions of other people. And then looking at patterns and then saying: “If you liked that, you’ll like this”.\n\n> They’re constantly playing back to you the ghosts of your own behaviour. We live in a modern ghost story. 
22	Do you stop replying or leave a person on read even if you like a person?	I'm kind of confused with this ENTP, so I want try to to understand so I can be as rational as possible.\n\nWe have been talking for a few months now and he's told me he's liked me a few times. (this is an LDR thing)\n\nHe's busy with uni , and I am too. So we talk sporadically, but he often initiates conversations with me and we'd talk for a few hours then for some reason just stops replying and leaves me on read and then I'd see him playing a game online around the same time (since we're both gamers).\n\nWhen he's about to study, he'd usually tell me beforehand, which I appreciate, because I don't mind if he needs or wants to do something else. For me, a heads up is nice, because then I won't have to overthink why he just suddenly left the conversation.\n\nNot sure how to approach this without coming off as clingy or needy.\n\nSo I'm not sure if he got bored with conversation, got distracted, busy or is losing interest?\n\nAny insight or advice would be helpful.\n\nWe're both in our mid-20s
29	[deleted]
11	All the time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm real bad for it
21	Ok, one advice: stop overthinking.
7	When I leave a conversation  sporadically, usually it is because I found something to do. For ex. I'm eating and speaking to the person I like, I finish eating and I found something better to do than simple texting, that's the moment where I leave the conversation without any bye or see ya later. But depends on the person, if it is a girl that hates being ignored I would tell her that I will go to do another thing and I won't answer her. And if it is a person that we talk sporadically and doesn't cares about being ignored, I would leave the conversation without saying bye or anything. \n\n\n
5	> So we talk sporadically, but he often initiates conversations with me and we'd talk for a few hours then for some reason just stops replying\n\nBy "talk," you mean "text," right?\n\nSometimes it takes a lot of emotional energy for me to reply to someone, so I put it off.\n\nSometimes I just get distracted.\n\nSometimes I feel the conversation has reached its natural end (and thus a formal farewell is unnecessary).\n\nSometimes I'm bored but I don't know how to end the conversation so I just stop replying. (Yeah I know that's not great. Sorry.)\n\nI see texting as a fairly casual thing. You have no idea what the other person is doing while you're texting them. If they stop replying, I just assume they're busy. \n\nThe etiquette surrounding texting is... well, unestablished. It's awkward. People have different standards. \n\nIf this bothers you, you should talk to him about it.
3	So this is my story with a girl i used to like. I liked her a lot. Like a lott. I looked into the future and i didnt see any productive outcome of our interactions so I completely ignored her for some time, then I missed her a lot and talked to her again until all the inconsistency kinda settled down all my emotions and now i just see her as a friend.\n\nYour friend might be acting this way cause he likes you, but doesnt see this going anywhere. So he ignores you then he just impulsively texts again.
3	Quick question, do you actually know him in person? 
3	I was just thinking about it the other day. Recently I do this way too often, and can get people to worry about me because I’m usually obnoxious and won’t stop talking, which I’m trying to change.  For me it’s lack of interest mixed with exhaustion and having no mental energy to interact with other people.
4	You're in a long-distance Discord relationship with your gamer pal?   \nLol.\n\n
2	I usually stop respond when I run out of ideas to talk about, like if I run out of topics or ideas I usually end the conversation.  But I always say like "gotta go" or just a bye at least. Also maybe it's just me but I wouldn't text people for hours if I didn't like them ( at the very least as a friend or someone  I enjoy talking too)  so don't worry too much 
2	I don't understand why people are making things more complicated. It's already complicated where you only text and did not meet in person.  When it comes to ENTP, always ask directly what you want to learn about.\n\nWe cannot know if he got bored with the conversation, got distracted, busy or is losing interest but he can. So ask him and get your answers.  You will come off as clingy, needy anyway by asking...but there is no other way to figure out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are thinking too much for nothing, time to act.\n\nWhat is your type btw? \n\n&#x200B;
2	Honestly what happens to me a lot of times is ill read the message and say let me respond after I finish doing whatever and I lock my phone. Then, after I’m done I’ll have some other notification and open that up. Then several hours will go by and I’ll say hmm I wonder why so and so hasn’t responded only to go to the message thread to realize I forgot to respond in the first place. Lol 
2	lol. ENTPs don't study.\n\nHe wants you to ask these questions you are asking us in your head. You are playing his game.\n\nBeing unable to determine what is motivating him to text or not text you is all part of the fun.\n\nAt least in my opinion anyway.
1	I tend to reply to texts as soon as I'm able to. If I leave someone on read or don't open the message, it's because I don't want to talk to that person.
1	I do it all the time. Usually I just get bored or don't know what to say. \n\nNot every conversation needs to be run in the ground. 
0	Probably just knows what he’s doing with women. Being too responsive by text is a good way to make a woman lose interest. Sounds like he has you feeling anxious and chasing him  which is pretty much the key with a woman. 
2	Does anyone have thoughts that they can't do anything right by anyone's standards or feel like others are against them/not really seeing them as they are in certain moments...Slight rant about my mum because still an angsty teenage girl at heart.	Nah, okay I'm getting old. I'm 21 F. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay, so for example, I feel like recently as I have been better able to articulate myself and assert my beliefs/opinions, my Mum just does not listen to what I have to say. She just keeps repeating her opinion and judging my standpoint, without ACTUALLY responding to what I have been trying to express. She makes no effort to see things from my point of view, maybe that is her emotions getting in the way of things due to the kind of conversations we have been having lately i.e, I just turned 21, so mostly about dating, house rules (not having a guy stay over because Catholic lol) my routine, my mental health. It seems like I can not do anything right by her and that I just keep disappointing her...I feel so exhausted from our interactions and try remain sage but she makes me feel like we aren't even in the same conversation. Is this an INTP/ENTP thing? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr the fact that she disapproves about my dating life, not that is really very existent, but now I'm getting older/less depressed/more social, I am wearing less and going out more kinda thing. This guy I'm maybe going to see/date is 31 and I'm 21. Usually, I wouldn't date someone that old, but we get along really well (lmao hope he isn't secretly married but we will cross that bridge if it actually comes to it/is there to cross) but yeah, she doesn't listen to me why I'm dating him, my thoughts on the current situation with him and what I need in a relationship. It's just like BLOCK block s u p e r block. I just kinda back down and agree to disagree because I don't want to argue with her and I love her too much to get properly pissed off, sigh. 
3	I was with you until:\n\n> This guy I'm maybe going to see/date is 31 and I'm 21. Usually, I wouldn't date someone that old, but we get along really well (lmao hope he isn't secretly married but we will cross that bridge if it actually comes to it/is there to cross)\n\nOk this is an issue. \n\nI understand having parents who won't listen to you. But your mom is right on this.\n\nIf a 31-year-old "gets along really well" with a girl whose brain isn't fully developed*, then he's not mentally mature either. Think about it: why isn't he dating women his own age? Chances are, he's immature, and he clicks with people who are on the same level he is.\n\n*The prefrontal cortex is not fully developed until age 23-25. When I say your brain isn't fully developed, I'm not insulting you. It's just a fact. You may be a legal adult, but your brain hasn't finished building its decision-making hardware. 
3	Honestly, an age gap like that with you, a 21 year old, warrants your mom's concern.\n\nI'm not saying it's always a bad situation, but it is shifty and you're mom's a good mom for caring/noticing that hard.\n\nThis is coming from a person who very much likes older people.\n\n.\n\nAll in all, you do you. She can't stop you from dating him and she'll have to suck it up I guess.
1	If your mums an ENTP I would just move out. When we think we're right (we usually are) then we won't back down. We love to debate so I'm not sure why she isn't responding to your points(might not be an ENTP). Maybe she feels she already won the argument, or that you aren't listening to her arguments.  Also, she might be worried about that age gap. I'm not going to judge you, especially since I don't know the situation well but I could see being very worried/frustrated if I was her. just because of the following reasons. 1. there's a big gap in life experience which can lead to some difference in maturity and just a lot of things. 2. if you ended up having kids he could die a lot quicker than you leaving you with no husband a lot earlier then if you dated someone close to your age.  Now, these things aren't that bad and you seem to be happy. your mums just worried for you is all. Mums usually just want the best for there kids.  But as I said earlier in the post if you can afford it and you really want freedom it might be simpler to just move out.

10	Really? The belt made you fall in line? I couldn't help clapping back even after being hit with it. \n\nGot myself grounded sometimes for 6-12 months at a time for things that were probably only worth a night without dinner in the first round, I just couldn't help arguing. My parents love to reflect "fondly" on the night I ate a chunk out of a bar of soap I was told to wash my mouth out with after swearing too much. Told them it was delicious and that I might just start eating it more often.
2	Nope. I would say it made it worse.

33	How to find meaning and lead a fulfilling life	In another thread /u/ladyspeak was asking for advice on how to battle depression for her ENTP friend. Wrote a quick comment and decided to share it with you all as well. Will add stuff as they come up. Hope you find it helpful. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on finding meaning and living a fulfilling life for ENTPs, or anyone, we're not so different in the end. <3\n\n* If you're thinking about offing yourself, *what have you got to lose?* ***Explore what life has to offer.***\n* C'mon, ***you know you are smart enough to figure out how to live a happy life***. Even if it takes 10 years, so what. Then you have the rest of your life to be happier. Who knows what you can accomplish? Not to say you have to accomplish anything to be happy, just do the things you enjoy.\n* ***Focus on the positives of everything.*** Yes, everything. In time this will develop to become an unbreakable mindset of positivity that will spread to others as well. And trust me there are few things better than helping someone think better. Also, Improving someone's day with a simple smile on the street is just precious.\n* HABIT 1: **Practice gratitude.** Daily. Every morning. Something. Anything that you appreciate in your life.\n* HABIT 2: **Practice meditation**. Daily. Every morning. Take 3 deep breaths. Stop. When this is a habit, add numbers. Seek guides online when needed.\n* **Decide what you want out of life.**\n* *Write it down.*\n* Keep a journal of your goals.\n* **Focus on cultivating your** ***core interests***, be it debating math and physics. Just find something where several themes collide in your mind. We live in an era where *you can build a career out of absolutely anything*. People earn dollars from opening packets in front of a camera. That's crazy. And again, you have nothing to lose.\n* The previous point is key to get you out of the pit. Just do what you love. When you're out of the pit, find the skills you want to use to produce content with your interests. Develop them. Get your content out there. Get feedback. Improve.\n* Connect with people as much as possible. Take contact with people on the street, in the store. Keep up with friends.\n* Gather people in your life that cheer for your goals and dreams.\n* **Find meaning from helping others by doing what you love.** This will improve your life satisfaction thousand-fold.\n* **Love yourself and your own life first.** No one is going to truly love you before you love yourself. If you are depressed and miserable, they are loving you for what they can give you. This can become a good thing, but the starting point is not ideal. Broken people attract broken people. Find solace with yourself and your life. You don't have to be perfect to find your ideal life partner. That's not the point. But... Make it to a point where you have the will to build your own life for yourself. Then you are in a place to attract someone who wants to share this life with you. Then you, possibly, know more about what you want in a significant other. Not absorb someone else to make you feel better. Think about a place where you find love, they make you feel better. Then you actually get better and start to live your life, noticing they don't fit your life anymore. What then?\n* Decide what you want in a mate. Explore. Be yourself. Don't settle. It is not worth it. It can be a rollercoaster, but you will get through it. Work on yourself first.\n* Remember that people aren't perfect. So stop expecting to find a perfect person. Help them grow with you.
3	Self love? Is that even real? \n\n/s
1	When something means everything to you, well, then you've nothing to lose... 
1	I like most of this, except this one: "We live in an era where *you can build a career out of absolutely anything"*\n\nI'd say it's true that *someone* can build a career out of anything, but the chances that it's you are sometimes minimal. Last year there were 864 players in Major League Baseball, but thousands upon thousands of people want to be professional baseball players. Not every gets to have that career. Some just flat out don't have the talent. Others have brutal, career-ending injuries.\n\nI'm all for following your dreams. And sometimes side projects become full-time careers. But for less in-demand jobs it can be hard as hell to get a foothold, and it's not only skill that wins out, there's a hell of a lot of luck involved.\n\nSo, I'd think twice about dropping out of accounting or coding school to try and stream on Twitch, especially if you have student loans to pay. There's smart dreaming and stupid dreaming.\n\nSigned,\n\n\- An ENTP who had his first career field demand crater and floundered for years trying to career pivot without inroads into other industries.
5	How you avoid distractions and follow through with plans	I try to plan things on my phone, but I feel a phone is literally the worst place to be making plans and following through with them. Every time I go to schedule something, or check my calendar, I often end up getting sucked into some other app and way too much time. Part of this is my ADD, but i also think the smart phone is the location of most of my unproductive triggers.\n\nI really need the structure/organization of planning to get the most out of myself, but I haven't quite found a system that works for me.\n\nWhat do you do? Set up your phone a certain way? Use a paper planner? Etc
3	Please don't use a paper planner. Ugh.\n\nPhone requires too many taps to get to the notepad app (8 second process), and is filled with distractions. \n\nI open up Notepad (2.2 second process) on Windows and then just write a to-do list there. If it gets long enough I save it as TODO.txt on my desktop. Unorthodox, yes. I have to say though, it works really well for me.\n\nFor long term goals, I have a 6-page Google Doc.\n\nIf you require something more sophisticated, use Asana. It's online and also has an App. You can mark things as complete and assign tasks to others. 
2	checklists & self set deadlines ...follow them religiously...you do not question them , you do not use rationality(as you may find excuses)..while at work/wherever you need they are your God.\n\nGood Luck.
2	I've found a mix of Google Docs and post it notes works best for me. I keep a google doc with long term to-do points, everything I *must* do and absolutely *cannot* forget about. Post it notes are for the day— I pull 2-3 things off my master to-do list doc and try to do at *least* one of them, if not more. Then the note gets trashed at the end of the day and I make myself a new one the next, but if I accomplish something I get the satisfaction not just of deleting it off the doc, but putting a big fat sharpie line through as well.

15	ENTP shutting off	Hey ENTPs, need your help figuring this one here. I'm an INFP (31F) and was loosely dating an ENTP (35M) for about 4 months. We were not dating exclusively but i thought we had good progress recently.\n\nOur relationship has always been playful and there was endless bantering. What really annoys me was he likes to ask me out at the last min and tends not to make plans. Thus i'm always being slot into his timetable. And even if plans were made, it was usually what he wants to do/eat and I felt like my voice and opinions were not considered.\n\nAnyway, we had a small conflict recently where he told me to pick a place and ended up with so many conditions (one place I picked was too far, the other he didnt like etc etc) that I told him that I was abit annoyed that we were always going to places he wanna go. And I dont wanna passive aggressive him (since that's what I do best and what he dislikes) so I'm letting him know.\n\nHe got upset and flared up unexpectedly. Saying he was trying to find a balance between family time (his dad was hospitalized and he visits him everyday) and me. I said these feelings were build-up and I'm just unsure of what to deal with my frustrations and now i have to deal with his anger.\n\nHe suddenly just shut down completely. Saying things like he's sorry and it's best we remain friends without expectations. Like wtf? I dont think I was being unreasonable. I didnt even flare up and was extremely calm..even tried to joke. \n\nI'm just seeking advices from the ENTPs here - what's wrong with the issue? Was it the way I manage it or what? I would love to get some insights cause I was complete taken off guard here. 
13	he probably. noticed at this point of time he is not emotionally ready for a romantic relationship. bc he has so many problems going on he found himself reacting more emotional than usual to such issues and realized it is based on his conditions rn and it would be best to just let it be instead of messing it up more bc he's in a situation where he cannot measure his behavior and cannot take more time than usual to fix It bc he is too busy
14	ENTP GUY HERE.\nShutting off is what I did when my ex-girlfriend irritated me to no end.  Her relentless INTJness and lack of self-awareness that she was being extremely rude, keep in mind I don’t get offended easily, began to really piss me off.\n  I voiced my opinion to the issue but when nothing changed my brain just kinda tweaks out.  I kinda just stay silent and respond as little as possible until I can recollect myself to put my mask on that I wasn’t upset at all.  It basically happens when I don’t even know what the fuck to do anymore.  All options have been exhausted, you’re really pissing me off, but I care so I don’t want to rip into you.\n  Honestly a loose relationship isn’t even a relationship.  Find someone that wants to be committed to you.  I don’t even know what defines a loose relationship.
9	Not a type thing, it's him
21	ENTP female here so not sure how good my “ENTP guy insight” is (I feel the types present very differently by gender)...\n\nMy impression is that this is more a maturity issue than a type issue. I relate to tending towards spontaneous, last minute plans... but I care about what the person I’m spending time with wants to do, and make an effort to ask and also be flexible by making plans in advance if it’s possible. It’s common courtesy. We can’t hide behind our type as an excuse for rude behavior. Whether you’re “just friends” or dating exclusively doesn’t matter; if you care about another human, you take their wants and opinions into consideration. He either is super immature &/or a narcissist. \n\nYou mentioned he has family stuff that could be stressing him out... so he may very well need to focus solely on that if he can’t act like an adult simultaneously. He sounds quite petulant. We all go through shit... it really shouldn’t affect his ability to value your time & be considerate, regardless of your official status. Being “friends” doesn’t give him license to be rude, either.
3	He is probably really stressed out with the family stuff and may be a bit immature/not mentally healthy either.  Exhibiting some grip Si features: not being open to places to eat only wants to go where he feels comfortable, entertaining the idea of rekindling a past relationship; not being open to other points of view.  Basically looking for comfort and becoming emotional and even mean when he can’t find it, like a toddler needing their blanket.  He’s not in a place to be in a healthy relationship, casual or not. I’ve been there.
3	You have to remember ENTPs have a playful form of Fe, a mobilizing and activating form of Fe.\n\nBut the other type of Feeling, the Fi is their blind spot, they are super vulnerable and sensitive about this form of Feeling and part of them that is subconscious ***not conscious thought*** wish all forms of feeling were the more playful / fun Fe due to the blindspot nature of Fi to an ENTP.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nContrast that with an INFP who has Fi as leading, and Si as mobilizing / activating, and Se as your blindspot and Se can really stress out an INFP for you are vulnerable and sensitive about Se.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo the thing about our POLR, our blindspot we appreciate praise and if you slow a person down and remind them of the need of this function we will see its value again.  But do not put too much emphasis on this value for too long or it will stress out that person, but it is okay to slow them down, remind them it is needed, and praise them when they do a good job with this.  Do not be critical for the person is always super sensitive about the function that has opposite introversion / extroversion energies compared to your Tetriary.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo with me, my type is INTJ.  I really do care about Fe, I just can't optimize towards it like I can do Te and Fi.  I understand the intellectual value of Fe and I can do it somewhat, but having an ENFJ or ESFJ list all the ways I screwed up Fe wise will just cause ***reactance*** in me where I become defensive and will want to argue my side, or I will feel small / shame and want to retreat / introvert.\n\nEveryone has a blindspot and you are describing the ENTP's blindspot.  They forget to use Fi some of the time.  Noticed how the arguement went, you said you are not respecting my choices and he countered by saying he is over extended and is trying to balance your things, with his father things, and he feels stressed by it all for he can't figure out how to win in everything, he has to make a choice and he feels he is given a sophies choice, a no win scenario and you are "judging" him on this no win scenario.\n\n* Yes he over did it, but all types sometimes over do our behavior when we are stressed and someone pokes our blind spot.  Think of it like our gut, our stomach, sometimes we are ticklish there and it is fun, and other times tickling a person there will cause a person to snap and say do not do this.  (This is why you do  not rub the belly of cats, yet dogs love it, the threshold is different for different animals.)
3	It had only been 4 months and wasn’t exclusive so maybe he didn’t feel any compatibility and just wants to move on.\n\nI’m a woman and I’ve done that when I realize the person I’m going out with is not what I want for a romantic relationship so I just ask to remain friends.\n\nAs of him snapping I’m guessing having your dad in the hospital is not easy so he’s probably stressed. \n\nDon’t think it’s an ENTP thing, it’s him and apparently it didn’t work out between you two.
4	You sure you didn’t show any hostility? Did you command him to do something? Did you show that you place your feelings above him and his priorities? It’s one thing to place your own feelings above his, and it’s another to actually show it. Are you sure you didn’t accidentally show casual disregard/non recognition for his problems? I know that this is something NeFi types do often when they are caught up in their own perspective. Anyway, it could be as simple as him not seeing things working out long term, and for reasons that are in no way your fault nor indicate that you did something wrong.
1	I think he just a little surprised by the way he acted. He may not be in a mentally good place. In his mind he might not ready for romance.
1	Since you only asked for an ENTP opinion, I won’t post mine. \n\nLet me know if you would care for my opinion on the matter. 
1	He’s playing you 
1	This has little to do with personality type but I think you need to step away from this guy for a bit. He's clearly stressed and won't respond well to someone pushing their way into his life. To some degree you need to let him know you like him and you care about him but that you're gonna go do your own things for a while and he can reach back out if he wants (if he's not going to be flaky and friendzoning). You have to try to get over him in the time away, work on yourself, take up some fun hobbies, meet cool people, whatever. Cause you need this guy to be more invested than that and maybe he'll come around (these actions will give you the best shot of him coming back) or successful move on. If he really only wants to be friends, make sure you take all the time you need to completely get over him before you step back in, cause it's a disaster otherwise. 
1	Sounds like he's a jerk and you should take this opportunity to get out.
1	I think it is more related to his attachment style. I think he is going through lots of things in his life and he finds you comfortable to be with or considers as escape from his reality. Probably, he has no space to escalate relationship like that, yet he was attracted to you. The conflicting thoughts perhaps made him very rational, and all of sudden he became emotionally dismissive and avoidant. \n\n
0	If it's been four months, and you weren't exclusive (loosely dating), then it was never serious to begin with. The issue is you overcommitted to a relationship that had no direction or future to start with. Find someone who actually wants to commit.
-1	It sounds like he sees the incompatibility in your approaches to the world, and doesn't have the energy or willpower to overcome it, probably because he's too involved in his dad, or maybe because he just doesn't care to.\n\nIn any case, you demanding to have your needs accommodated, in addition to everything else he has to deal with, is extremely rude, at least from my perspective. It sounds like he's feeling the same.\n\nWe have very limited emotional energy, especially for negative things. But I'm a 7, so that part is even worse for me. 😂 \n\nFor context: I'm not really a fan of Fi all that much. I used to hate it. Now I understand it and understand why it's necessary, but it's unavoidable how selfish and self-centered it is...incessantly. I don't know how ENTP/INFP relationships ever last, tbh. I know they do sometimes.
-1	I used to be in a relationship with an ENFP who did this and it was one of the things I hated the most. It's a blazing orange sign that he doesn't care about what you want to do. Others are right, it's probably an underdeveloped or immature ENTP. I am an INTP and with an ENTP and he is very cognizant about both of our interests. He WANTS to know what \*I\* want to do and is happy to be doing it. I am that way towards him (I'm INTP). I don't see how INFP and ENTP could have a good relationship. I don't see how any ENTP could endure a passive-aggressive partner who can't communicate their needs in a straightforward way. It would be best for you to forget this one and find someone who has your interests at heart.  
4	Can we discuss this. I don’t think this is a reasonable excuse at all. I was raised in a catholic household. It didn’t take me years to realize organized religion is bullshit. Your early environment is not an justifiable excuse for myopia.	
30	It is a good excuse. Most people aren't introspective. While you think intuitively about various ideas, most people accept what they've been taught without question and promote order as they see fit. Learning to break bad habits is hard.
12	Growing up to some degree you take on what is taught to you.\n\nHowever later in life, as an adult, this cannot be used as an excuse. If youre old enough to form an independant opinion and youre a piece of shit, well...thats your own fault.\n\nSo if you were homophobic as a kid/teenager, while being exposed only to homophobic parents/church/etc ,,,I guess you still have time to form a different opinion \n\nBut if youre homophobic as an adult you ugly lmao 
9	ehhh i kindve understand why some people would have trouble realizing that they shouldn't believe everything they were taught to believe, even if that wasn't the case for me growing up. i was raised in a conservative catholic household and it didn't take me years to realize, but i get that not everyone is a natural skeptic. i think any form of progression should be celebrated, no matter how you came to whatever realization you've had. not everyone's an entp haha
6	I know this is a crazy concept but you arent a metric for everyone else.
7	Ugh, for every 4 ENTPs that will argue against his reasoning there are 4 who will argue for it. JUST FOR THE SAKE OF IT.
4	I think for an ENTP and other N types it is easier to see through the bullshit early on.  Not as easy for SJ types who do more of what they are told and don’t question things as early.  For instance I have an ISTJ friend who always liked gay people and came from a family of Catholics who also approve of gay people.  But she was taught that as a woman you get married and have babies.  She always followed along, crappy relationship after another, though she displayed some lesbian tendencies.  Finally she met the one, who obviously was a woman.  They are happily married...and go to Catholic church on Sundays.  So weird.  Some people have a harder time than others breaking from tradition (or modifying it) even if it’s clearly wrong as in this case of extreme homophobia
1	I'm bisexual. As a man, I like women, but I really like men. In high school I was an asshole to this kid who wanted to borrow my pencil. He was gay and my abusive father was and still is a homophobe. There are several influences that fuck with us. 
-3	Hopefully I don't get banned for this honest post. This is how I truly feel.\n\nI hate religion. But I also hate homosexuals. It's not that I care what they do or who they do it with. It is also not because of my environment. My hatred for LGBTQI people is not based on religion or any group identity.\n\nI just don't think it is good for society to disregard nature in favour of hedonism and stupidity. I mean look at the Western World at the moment. France is burning, Europe is crumbling, Germans will be a minority in their own country by 2045. The only light in America is Trump of all people. Borders are being broken, Pedophilia is becoming more tolerated, LGBTQI communities are literally groups of degenerates banding together.\n\nWhat happened to family values? What happened to being a man? Being a women? What is all this philosophical shit about Trans people and gender studies? Why should I call you a she when you are a man? Why should I change my language to accomodate you?\n\nI think liberalism has gone way too far. Our acceptance of this garbage is our downfall.\n\nI don't actually care if you are gay or think you are a girl or call yourself by different pronouns. I care about how the Western World is dying because of our love and compassion. Who is killing it? I think the normalisation of this shit is whats killing it.\n\n* It is not advisable that 6 - 14 year old boys to dress in drag and parade around in sexualised attire for grown men wearing dresses.\n* It is not advisable that we normalise homosexual relationships.\n* It is not advisable that we continue to cede our rights and liberties to these people under the guise of inclusion and diversity.\n\nI don't care if you are a disabled, trans, gay, black, muslim but if you go around saying that this is normal and we should celebrate it then we have an issue.\n\nThe West used to be strong and unwavering. Now we are weak and malformed.\n\nThis is why I dont like homosexuals or trans people. What I hate even more are the people that support them.\n\nI totally understand these people are who they are and want what they want. Im fine with it. Just don't fucking normalise it. This inclusivity and diversity propaganda is not working on me and the majority of men. It is however working on children and women quite well.\n\nThis has nothing to do with religion.\n\nIn my case I have seen through the bullshit in the opposite way you have. I have acknowledged that the allies of these people are the problem. Virtue signalling for feel good points will be the Western Worlds downfall.\n\nMore life will be lost due to this and it is because we have become weak.
6	Good retail/entry jobs for entp's? Also how to deal with monotony?	I've worked at places like Target, Tropical Smoothie Cafe, Ross. All of these jobs make me MISERABLE. I hate wasting my time and doing the same thing every day, with no ability to improve myself or the world. Does anyone know any good jobs that will keep me happy while I'm in school? Also, how do I get past the fact that I HAVE to work a LOT to sustain myself until I become successful? \n\nEdit: I'm a smoll 20F addicted to video games, so construction might not be my thing. Also thanks for the replies everyone! 
7	I have worked in a few retail places that were in line with my hobbies. Retail always sucks, but working at a fabric shop, or hardware store is way better than Target. At least you get to exercise your skills when helping customers with their projects.
6	I always worked in construction. It was easy in my teens / twenties  \n\nI made a reasonable career out of it and became a project manager. \n\nThere is a lot of hate these days for manual labor. It is way more fun than retail though, and you won't wreck yourself if you stop doing it before the age of 40.
3	Starbucks. It’s my day job (otherwise I’m a freelance copywriter), and it really helps with my ADHD. \n\nI’m constantly moving, it’s fast paced, I need to kind of think to remember recipes and shortcuts and the best way to finish something. \n\nPlus they hire really just based off of enthusiasm and customer service experience, so you don’t really need to know anything about coffee etc, when you start. \n\nEdit:I don’t know what tropical smoothie cafe is (if that’s the business name) but hopefully it’s not like Starbucks. 
3	Wow, lots of hardware store jobs!  Me too.  I sell hardware, lumber, cabinets, doors, do take offs for plans, go to job sites, etc.  at a family owned hardware store.  Would never want to work corporate retail; I have a lot of flexibility in this environment, and there’s never a dull day.  If I didn’t have to work full time and had capital I would flip houses and probably do all the painting myself. I went to school for interior design but I thought I would die paying my dues as a CAD monkey behind a desk all day so I went retail.  I worked for a countertop and tile installer first but that was really stressful - seeing the job through start to finish and making sure all the paperwork is done right, etc. was just too much.  Then I worked at a wholesale natural stone retailer - that was super fun but after five years it had become the same old shit and I left for the job I have now.  Way more types of items to explore and different things to do.  Find a job with qualities of that last sentence in a field you like and you’ll be happier.
3	Seriously.\nJust trying listening to metric buttloads of music.\nItll block out the noise
3	Become a busser at a really high end restaurant, as nice as you can find. You'll make like $15-20/hr and have some degree of promotion opportunities. Wish I did that when I was 16.
2	I work at a hardware store of sorts and thats pretty cool. You have to learn more in depth things about products, plus I mix paint so? Better than selling groceries or shirts. 
2	The entry-level jobs I've liked the best have been jobs where I:\n\n* Worked alone\n* Could use my own organizational system\n* Wasn't completely sedentary, but didn't have to constantly be on the move\n* Occasionally interacted with customers\n\nMy least favorite ones were in food service. Constantly on my feet, loud environment, etc. No fun.
2	Lifeguarding depending on the facility is pretty solid\n\nSome days you save a drowning kid and get a mad adrenaline rush while feeing great about it. Other days you almost get in a brawl between drunk Chaldeans and your coworkers. Some days the weather is shit and nobody shows up so the staff fucks around. And depending on the coworkers there’s a good chance people like to get hammered after.\n\nYou learn useful shit that’s easy to retain too. I had to do CPR on my father years after my last season guarding and it was like riding a bike. Overall the best “non professional” work experience I’d recommend.
7	Do you often struggle with unfilled ambition?	I have an ENTP friend (31 M) who has gotten to the point where he no longer sees a point in living. His life's biggest ambition is to find his romantic match and to be in love, and though he's dated many women through the years, doesn't think he'll ever find it.\n\nHe's also struggling without an idea of what he wants to do career-wise because he gets bored of everything he tries. The only thing that interests him is debating and learning new things about mathematics and physics - mostly from YouTube.\n\nWe've discussed it many times and he's decided that he doesn't want to live anymore because of these unfulfilled ambitions. Even going so far as to make a plan for when he wants to end his life.\n\nIs this something that is a common struggle among ENTP, and how do you break out of it?
10	Ahhh...your friend needs to get professional help. This isn’t an ENTP thing, that sounds like a mental illness that needs to be treated ASAP.
6	Even if this is a mental illness, I think it is an ENTP specific mental illness. And yes, it should be treated ASAP. I have so much to say on this subject that I don't even know where to begin. Maybe I'll write a post on ENTP specific depression.For quick tips:\n\n* If you're thinking about offing yourself, *what have you got to lose?* ***Explore what life has to offer.***\n* C'mon, ***you know you are smart enough to figure out how to live a happy life***. Even if it takes 10 years, so what. Then you have the rest of your life to be happier. Who knows what you can accomplish? Not to say you have to accomplish anything to be happy, just do the things you enjoy.\n* ***Focus on the positives of everything.*** Yes, everything. In time this will develop to become an unbreakable mindset of positivity that will spread to others as well. And trust me there are few things better than helping someone think better. Also, Improving someone's day with a simple smile on the street is just precious.\n* HABIT 1: **Practice gratitude.** Daily. Every morning. Something. Anything that you appreciate in your life.\n* HABIT 2: **Practice meditation**. Daily. Every morning. Take 3 deep breaths. Stop. When this is a habit, add numbers. Seek guides online when needed.\n* **Decide what you want out of life.**\n* *Write it down.*\n* Keep a journal of your goals.\n* **Focus on cultivating your** ***core interests***, be it debating math and physics. Just find something where several themes collide in your mind. We live in an era where *you can build a career out of absolutely anything*. People earn dollars from opening packets in front of a camera. That's crazy. And again, you have nothing to lose.\n* The previous point is key to get you out of the pit. Just do what you love. When you're out of the pit, find the skills you want to use to produce content with your interests. Develop them. Get your content out there. Get feedback. Improve.\n* Connect with people as much as possible. Take contact with people on the street, in the store. Keep up with friends.\n* **Find meaning from helping others by doing what you love.** This will improve your life satisfaction thousand-fold.\n* **Love yourself and your own life first.** No one is going to truly love you before you love yourself. If you are depressed and miserable, they are loving you for what they can give you. This can become a good thing, but the starting point is not ideal. Broken people attract broken people. Find solace with yourself and your life. You don't have to be perfect to find your ideal life partner. That's not the point. But... Make it to a point where you have the will to build your own life for yourself. Then you are in a place to attract someone who wants to share this life with you. Then you, possibly, know more about what you want in a significant other. Not absorb someone else to make you feel better. Think about a place where you find love, they make you feel better. Then you actually get better and start to live your life, noticing they don't fit your life anymore. What then?\n* Decide what you want in a mate. Explore. Be yourself. Don't settle. It is not worth it. It can be a rollercoaster, but you will get through it. Work on yourself first.\n* Remember that people aren't perfect. So stop expecting to find a perfect person. Help them grow with you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n/u/countrykev\n\n&#x200B;
3	> Even going so far as to make a plan for when he wants to end his life.\n\nIf he's at the stage where he's thinking about concrete ways to kill himself,  that's a serious sign and he's past due for professional help.\n\nPlease help your friend to get professional counseling.\n
3	As others have said: he needs professional help.  That said I have seen some of this special snowflake syndrome strike a few people over the years.  \n\n> because he gets bored of everything he tries  \n\nWelcome to adulthood.  Being genuinely engaged and excited is a luxury not a baseline of acceptability.  I have only ever seen this particular issue in Fi users imo.  I think the reasoning goes something like "I am special.  What I invest in and accomplish should reflect that specialness.  I should experience that special relationship/connection to work emotionally at all times.  That feeling will both affirm my identity as special, and tell me that I have made the 'right choice'."  \n\n> His life's biggest ambition is to find his romantic match and to be in love  \n\nSo his biggest ambition is to feel a certain way?  Yeah super thinker haha.  I mean don't get me wrong: I definitely have feeling/relationship oriented ambitions.  But this just screams idealist Fi.  Also it's really hard to fall in love when you're spending so much time looking at yourself or your ideals.  \n\n> he doesn't want to live anymore because of these unfulfilled ambitions  \n\nAs others have said this is a huge red flag and he needs help.  It's also a hallmark of ego crisis.  "I'm special and unique, and if my life doesn't reflect that then I don't even want to play the game."  Ugh.  Don't pour yourself into trying to fix this guy, unless you're related.  Maybe try to steer him towards adopting worldviews which don't revolve around himself.  Get him into meditation, community service, etc... beyond therapy.  Anything to get his special snowflake head out of his special snowflake ass. 
2	I have that problem too, lol. idk what the solution is, but in the meantime, professional help for that kind of depression is probably the best thing.  \n\n\nidk if I'll ever find someone who is right for me. Maybe just lower standards? The world isn't perfect, period.
2	Definitely mental illness that needs to be addressed.  I’ve been very close to this point.  As an ENTP it’s bad when Ne is nowhere to be found.  Interests become few and possibilities cannot be imagined.   In the Si grip - ruminating on bad memories from the past, seeing only that things are what they are and will never change.  Sounds like he’s been here for some time.  Hope he is willing to get help.
1	I got depression because I felt unfufilled. While it should be treated, it's entp related. We need to feel fulfilled, like we have a purpose, or everything goes downhill
1	This is not an ENTP thing. (the boredom might be)\n\nTell your friend this, \n\n1. Careers are for people who want to earn less money than their bosses. Start a business.\n2. Romance is different for men and women. Women will never love you like you want to be loved. Keep trying, It will be worth it. It will never be what you want it to be though.\n3. Being bored is just being lazy. There are things everyone wants to do. Just do it. \n4. Not everyone is cut out for happiness. But everyone can achieve it.\n5. Don't take antidepressants. The long term use of them make suicide rates go up lol.
1	Yeah, this is depression. Anhedonia. 
2	What’s the nicest thing someone has said/done for you lately?	What’s the last thing someone may have said that made you happy?
6	My kids play basketball in the street in front of our house a lot. A few weeks ago, the kids didn’t get control of the ball fast enough as a car was coming, and the car ran over the ball - popping it. \n\nMy husband and I were mortified, as it sounded like a gun going off and probably really scared the driver. We apologized to him and made the kids apologize too. \n\nLast week that driver came to our door with a brand new outdoor ball for the kids. He said he felt really bad about running it over, and was happy to give them another one. \n\nSo unnecessary, but so kind. I really appreciated his gesture. 
3	I was one of the best men at a wedding for a really good friend and a few weeks later I got a thank you letter from his mom(ESFJ) saying how much she appreciated me being good friends with her son. Inside were two free Cinemark ticket gift cards and then two free large popcorn and a drink vouchers. It was so shockingly nice that I just sat there and stared at it for a few minutes. It just made me feel really appreciated I hardly ever feel like that way.
3	This personality test I took told me I was a genius.\nI'm shitting proverbial bricks

2	This ended up being super long but whatever.... \nThe TLDR is at the bottom.\n\n———————\n\ni was at work (at a food court) and a line was forming. there’s only one register open.\n\nI notice a lady (who had ordered food 5-10mins ago) reappear and do this “slide” where she basically shows up at the opposite side of the counter to be helped first. It’s cutting, plain and simple.\n\nI was making two ice creams for a customer, and the lady makes a comment to me: “i’m gonna also be having one of those!”\n\nAnd i’m like (politely) “okay! The line started over there!” and i gesture towards the queue that was already formed at the only open register.\n\nshe’s like “I was just here! I literally just ordered! Don’t you remember me?!”\n\nAnd i’m like “Ok, yes, I do remember you, but there’s only one register open/there’s a line”\n(Not to mention she was NOT “just there” bc she clearly left and ate and returned several minutes later)\n\nShe was not happy, and kept explaining over and over how she was JUst TherE like noooo bitch you were not. \n\nRegardless, I was POLITE and cheerful the entire time, I was calmly explain how although she previously ordered, if she’s gone for several minutes, she has to get into line, especially since like 4-5 people were waiting. Still she’s bitching, so im like whatever.\nI tell her to come over to the open reg (thus allowing her to cut in front of all the people), and she gives me the money. She’s like 11 cents short (my workplace is very strict about money/everything) so i tell her that. She’s gets all flustered looking for change saying how this is ridiculous and keeps going on about having just been there (i was like holy fuck i get it, stop lying tho) and i’m like “I’m sorry, it’s just really not fair to the other customers who have lined up already”\n\nShe’s fumbling for money and the Actual Next Guy in Line lays a dollar on the counter (having witnessed the whole thing) to fund her purchase.\nShe like “You don’t need to do that!!!”\nand he’s like “No it’s okay, merry xmas! happy hanukkah! happy kwanzaa!! all that! just have a great holiday” (kinda sarcastically i think he just wanted her to go away)\nso i’m like Whew.\n\n But then the lady makes a remark “No it’s okay, she’s just being a snot”\n\nAnd i’m like ????\n\nAnd the guy is like ???? looks at her and goes “That’s not nice????” \n\nLady: looks shocked and mumbles to self \n\nHim: “No, that is really not nice! She was not mean to you, she didn’t call you any names. That’s just not nice of you, especially considering someone just did you a favor!”\n\nMe: Disbelief and ((holy shit is a customer actually defending me????? for once???? oh my god))\n\nlady: annoyed that she was called out on her shit, walks away complaining\n\nThe man proceeded to be super nice even after i tried to give him his food for free, he insisted he pay and was just omg sooo cool.  was getting teary eyed because that’s the first time that has ever happened to me.  he walks away after reassuring me and telling me to not let her get to me, and i assumed he just left the store.\n\nI find out later (when the lady complains about me to a supervisor) when i’m called into the office for a talk, that the Man and the Lady apparently got in an argument at the food court and were fighting over the situation, without my knowledge.\n\n\nIt felt sooooo good for a good customer to have my back, and not only that, but CONTINUE to defend me even when I wasn’t directly involved. Truly a guardian angel that day. \n\n\n\nTLDR: a kind customer defended me when a rude lady tried to make me out to be a bad guy. First time in retail history. 
2	Someone recognized how much I love myself and called me a narcissist for it. That's the highest compliment i can ask for, not that I need it though because i already know how awesome I am 😎😎😎
2	My coworker was venting to me and another worker came up so he stopped talking. She bugged him to tell her what we had been talking about and he wouldnt. He told her "The only reason Im telling [me] is because they get me on such a deep level, that I know any advice they give me is going to be the absolute best for me"\n\nAnd yeah, just having someone who doesnt rely on others ask for my opinion, and then convey to someone else that my advice was solid was....super good feeling? \n\nAnyway he's an estp and he says "you get me, because youre just like me, but not an asshole" \nI asked, "if Im not an asshole what am I?"\nAnd he said, "Dope. Just dope."
1	My dog greeted me at the door and told me I was the most magnificent person alive and that they missed me so much when I had to run back into the house because I forgot something. I had to break their heart and leave again though. 
1	I really want this to happen	I want experiences on human genetics to be accepted by the scientific community and law under supervision. \nThis is in my opinion our next step. We may not be human anymore but life is still life. First we get rid of any genetic ailments or weaknesses and cleanse the general gene pool of all the shit that's been accumulating since we stepped out of harsh natural selection, then we create humans with roles that are built to really really like what they were engineered for. No difference with fulfilment in our current standards. Then other humans that are built for something else idk really. Maybe technological advancement, physics , colonizing the universe ? \nWith a controlled population, resources wouldn't be used expensively for no other reason that other people are around. This would be our best bet in order not to go extinct if it goes well during the first phases of enhancing or getting rid of certain ape like survival urges.
3	free will is sparse even as it is now but doing what you suggest completely eradicates its existence. I think humans should at least be given the opportunity of having choices.\n\nthere's no point of living like that when you can't live
2	The future is not at all that dark. But it might be a bit boring!\n\nI think the hive mind/resource-based society is the inevitable future, since I also think it is only a matter of decades until we have sorted out unlimited energy source. When we have figured out unlimited energy source, humanity no longer need to work to survive anymore, and resources/greed/wars etc, at least as we know them today, won't be an issue anymore. And I even think UBI (universal basic income) will be a thing even long before that.\n\nWe will also be able to dramatically prolong our lives with genetics very soon. So what we really need is tons of cool simulation/VR games/worlds people can spend all their free time in! After that the next step is to be uploaded to the hive-mind. Once we can become whomever we want, our individuality isn't really that important anymore, and there will probably be more pro's than con's to submit ourselves to it. Eternal life and such.
1	Why do you think we'll go extinct going the way we are going, and why do you think those reasons won't apply to these artificially engineered people?
0	I also think eugenics is a moral cause.
6	New research suggests that exposure to childhood adversity is associated with reduced cognitive control and alterations in key brain networks. The findings could help explain the link between childhood adversity and depression.	
2	What's the definition of adversity? A parent dying? Divorce? Pet hamster running away?
14	ENTP = Very social, but akward "nerd"?	I heard this before and it got stuck in my head. I'd say it fits... somehow. \nWhat do you think?
23	Ive been told that I talk alot, and that I just start to lecture things out of the blue, but I guess im just interesting and funny enough to get away with it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople often think of ENTPs are players and sex crazed degenerates. I dont have any sex, and whilst I get along well with women, Im definitely not the hottest guy in town.  Ive never been. Im know im not bad looking, but ive always had that one friend were the girls go "ohh hes so fit", so I know its not me.  Also im too self-conscious to be walking around hitting on women bluntly. I need a longer runway for take offs like that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, I think im not nerdy enough to vibe with the 💯 INTs in my course
4	maybe yea 
4	Awkard a little, even the most social of us can come out quite dorky compared to lets say an Estp or an enfj, yet our awkardness goffyness and laid back attitude can come out as effortlessly charming. \nWere not akward in the sense of fucking up social interactions ill say were very carefull and mindfull of others to be like that.\n\nAlso in a reply to the other coment:\n>  People often think of ENTPs are players and sex crazed degenerates. I dont have any sex, and whilst I get along well with women, Im definitely not the hottest guy in town.\n\n\nThis depends a lot in other factors not just in type, there ar a lot of Estps who barely get lucky, same with the esfps, and other types that ar famous for being hot.\nIf u think the Entp personality is not attractive on the sexual sense to other peopple then u havent met an entp, yes its playfull and sometimes infantile,and some girls will dislike that or will preffer more sharp personalitys like Istps,but we make people laugh, we make people think, were extremely perceptive, theres literally not a single function in our stack that would make us unnactractive.So dont make ur shortcomings a type thing,same with any other thing, if u cant succed on ur job is not for being an entp but some other stuff, if u cant be happy is not because ur an entp but for other reasons.And i know this is Reddit and probably if u make a post about virgin Entps u will get a lot of positive reinforcement but honestly this is just plain illogical and very male centered.
3	Ha ha, yes. At 38 I have the social skills to comport myself in almost any situation. . . I still choose otherwise though.
1	I just found out I'm INTP.\n.... im slightly getting the revelatory bits.\nHowever im 53% extroverted. \nSo I get confused. \nHelp\n
1	It depends in all fairness.\nThe only reason I think I'm an extroverted Intp or w.e js because I have a weakness for showing off\nAnd it's the horrible one that comes with intuition and basically everything i do feels like I'm a fucking protagonist.\nWhat a life.
4	Im just a brain	
1	Interesting guy!  \n\nOn smartphone design: they can be used vertically but it is less comfortable.  The idea of using distractions to avoid being present certainly isn't new, but smartphones are just the latest way to do that.  \n\nGenerally speaking I find his lack of attribution to be a potential signal of his self professed narcissism.  I haven't heard a new idea from him, but he hasn't attributed any of them haha.  Collectives being treated as individuals?  Yeah that idea is well over 100 years old.  WTG man :D  \n\nAlso since this is an MBTI sub: the certainty with which he speaks is a Te flag for me.  He doesn't use any synonym of the word "perhaps".  Everything is a certainty.  His ideas are concrete objects he's simply describing to you.  \n\nAs the interviewer says "everything (in a narcissistic response) is reduced to a stupid ultra simple, totally unnuanced simplification of reality."  This is the unhealthy Te way of thinking Jung bangs on about, page 12 on the short version of psych types in the sidebar.  \n\nAgain this is unhealthy "Te".  This sort of thinking has its many uses, when properly employed, and when healthily at least attempting to be circumspect.  \n\nFurther I suggest it is NiTe/TeNi given his obvious exposure to many theories about what causes personality disorders, but presentation of only those which support his cohesive worldview.  Take trauma for example: certainly there is a lot of evidence to suggest that expectations/cognitive dissonance play a large role in how traumatic an experience is.  However he is completely ignoring things like temperament, social support, existential perspective, etc.  It isn't relevant to his overall worldview, where everything likely fits around a few central themes.  \n\nFurther still those themes have direct relevance to who he is, his life story, his sense of meaning etc.  He has a very certain and clear picture of meaning and how he fits into it, but would likely defend to the death the idea that "this picture is PURELY rational.  Fi isn't influencing it AT ALL"... even though the certainty is unwarranted.  Again Jung writes directly of this.  Of the emotional/meaning focused Fi being suppressed to the point that it acts pervasively on the thinking of Te.   \n\nIf you listen to his explanations as well, everything is what **happened to him**.  While I don't think children are responsible for the actions of their parents, this is something to look for with unhealthy Fi.  Things relating to the self with unhealthy Fi are things which happen to them, without their own agency.  I am this way because of the experiences I went through, as opposed to "these things impacted me in abc ways, and I then (agency) chose/did/thought def which ended up with ghi results.".  \n\nLol "I redefined narcissism as a post traumatic condition".  Dude that's been the thinking for a very long time.  "I am uniquely qualified to know what narcissism is": actually the diagnosis would suggest the opposite, but ok.  Let's just ignore the fact that your supposed treatment for narcissism appears to not be working for you :D   \n\nThis guy is super interesting, but is also a good example of why I can only take most NTJs in limited doses.  But oh they always have the [sweetest smiles](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Shmuel_Ben_David_Vaknin.jpg/220px-Shmuel_Ben_David_Vaknin.jpg)  \n

35	Olympus mourns	It is with somewhat mixed feelings we announce that /u/The_White_Baron will shortly realize his lifelong dream: of opening a yoga studio/kombucha workshop.  While we are certain that many people have often wondered whether or not something edible could result from yoga mats, and that he will thrive in any pursuit, there are some journeys a person has to take alone.  \n\nSo it is with tremendous sadness, we have to tell you that he has stepped down as moderator.  \n\nWe'll always remember you for your ambiguously long hugs with questionable pelvic movements (why can I feel your pelvis in a friendly hug anyways?  Seriously...), and sincerely wish you the best.  \n\nNamaste.

5	CAREER ADVICE -- Picking University Majors	Hello,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a high school student and am thinking about what career I should pursue and what major I should focus on. I strongly identify with the ENTP-A type and cannot see myself being any other - every time I have done a MBTI test I have gotten ENTP. I am thinking about studying at the University of Waterloo because it is quite popular for its mathematics and computer science departments. I know that the thing which will give me the most happiness is philosophy but I believe it is not something which I can turn into a career. Math is my best subject at school and I've spent time playing around with computer science. I know that both math and computer science are interesting to me - for example, this summer I spent about 6 hours every day for a week or so researching neural networks for a school paper. I've also participated in a finance competition in which I had to trade fake stocks in real time - I found this very "fun". Now that I have kind of narrowed my interests (finance, mathematics, computer science - the profitable ones) I am struggling deciding on a major to pursue. I hate the idea of selecting 'a single option' (in terms of what to have as the title not for what it would allow me to apply - I am struggling on deciding which option is best not which one would allow me to be hired in different fields) and am fearful that if I pursue the education required to become a quant (a profession which combines these three, pays well, and I have to take cool exams for - CFA level 1 maybe?), once I've entered the workforce, I will die from boredom due to paperwork and/or repetitiveness. My question to y'all is "Is being a quant mentally OK for an ENTP" and "What other career paths should I consider".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks
6	Well, here's my opinion:\n\nYou really can't go wrong with mathematics because it is a broad degree that can branch off into many diverse careers (you might also want to check out "data science").  But you must definitely learn how to program as well -- I suggest learning Python.  You should create a portfolio of your programs and learn by making projects.  Even if your "projects" start off as something as simple as "Hello World" you should get into the habit of keeping then in some kind of repository.  \n\nAs far as quants are concerned you can ask the guys over in the finance subs, but my understanding is that the new generation of quants are all running dark right now.   When I finished my graduate schooling, people with even a routine knowledge of PDEs methods were getting hired for $300k+, but those days are long over since all the trading algorithms are in place and people are looking to things like ML to get a new edge, which doesn't require nearly the same level of expertise. \n\nTo finish up, if you have a solid practical STEM degree (math, CS, most of the engineerings, chemistry) you're going to have many good job options for the conceivable future.   Other STEM degrees such as biology really require getting a Ph.D. (and one in an area of interest to industry) to get a lucrative job.    \n\nI personally wouldn't get a philosophy degree unless you're definately planning on law or medical school.  \n\nI have a few friends who worked as lawyers for 20+ years and then decided to give it up to do something else. They went back to school and got history PhDs, etc. and started teaching.   But they had that option because they didn't spend 20 years working at Starbucks.  
2	I know this has nothing to do with math or CS, but if you're willing/wanting to get certain doctorates (medicine, law, dentistry), you can study whatever you heart desires in undergrad, even philosophy.\n\nThe main issue with that is the debt, but if you find medicine--and the years it takes--to fit you, that won't matter much at all. For law, you can doom yourself with a retail job quicky. With dentistry the debt is insane, but it will be paid off.\n 
1	Get a degree that will give you a very broad set of career options but work on your off time during school to get internships/network contacts in the sector you actually want to work in
1	You may want to look into cognitive science. There's a good program at UofT for it, not sure about Waterloo. It blends computer science, psychology, philosophy and linguistics. Super cool stuff which would allow you to pursue profitable things like cpsc while also giving you ample opportunity to experience existential crises with philosophy.\n\n\- Source: I am in cogs at UBC in Vancouver.
1	My advice, don't jump straight into college if you're not 100% sure what you want to do yet. I did this, dropped out twice & had millions of majors and wasted  A TON of money and time. It fucked my self esteem pretty hard. I'd recommend taking time to study your interests while working/saving money. Find yourself, and your path will seem a bit clearer. I had to work for two years to be able to afford to even think about going back to college, and in that time I realized two things:\n\n1) theres no way in hell that i'm going to let myself work a minimum-wage job forever... working one full-time taught me that i fucking hated it \n\n2) i can find a practical way to do something that i can actually tolerate for way more money. i've always made art, and then i realized i could do graphic design and i felt stupid for not thinking of it sooner\n\n3) if i can work THIS hard for THIS long at a shitty job that i hate, get promoted in 3 months and pay off my student debt in 2 years- i can definitely do some shit that i actually tolerate for even longer\n\nBefore any of that, I had no clue what the right path for me was. I'm interested in SO many unrelated things. Its the one interest that's stuck with you the longest that will keep you motivated and interested long enough to see it through. Hope this helps! Also, try using an Ikigai diagram. It combines your interests, what you're good at, what the world needs & what you can be paid to do in a way that makes things a bit clearer. Google it :) and good luck!
1	[I made a Venn Diagram for you.](http://prntscr.com/lspheg)  \n\nIf math is really your best subject I really think you should abuse you have that "gift" as much as possible, as math is in extremely high demand. I would wish I was good in math, but I am not. So I don't have the cards that you do, but wish I had, it would make it a whole lot easier for me to pursue a STEM field. Because then I would be put in an advantageous position when it comes to society and the jobmarket.  \n\nWhen it comes to boredom. Then don't worry. Most jobs are boring as fuck, and most people got boring jobs. We live in a SJ society, with jobs made for SJ types. You just have to adapt, and deal with it. There's no perfect education or job, and if there is one, then only 0.01% of people get those jobs, so being decent in math you probably understand that is like playing the lottery, and that would be a stupid move, to put all your eggs in that 0.01% basket.  \n\nFind your fun and adventure in your spare time instead, and if you really want, try to turn your hobbies into a career after you have gotten an education and a job. Then you always have something to fall back on.  
13	What are some movies that left you...drained? Not because they were bad, but because made you feel bad?	Just asking because I find it rare that an ENTP dislikes a film simply because it’s sad like most xxFx types do. What movie changed that for you?
10	I have three off the top of my head:\n\nMelancholia, The Road, and Call Me by Your Name. \n\nThese are *excellent* films, but I don’t have the desire to watch them again. Something about movies with absolutely no hope in the end kind of fucks with me. Because I’m a Ne dom, I see all of these fantastic possibilities for the future- Melancholia and The Road shattered that thought process while I was watching them. (SPOILERS) In Melancholia, the world is destroyed by another world that hits it. Earth isn’t just gone, it’s obliterated. Completely, utterly destroyed. That really fucked with me and made me feel super existentially negative. Everyone’s gone...not a single sign that we ever existed...and it just doesn’t matter. Nothing good was ever made of humanity, it just abruptly ended in a horrific way. \n\nFor The Road (SPOILERS), what fucked with me was the realization that the attempts of survival by the main characters and every human being in the story was fruitless. Maybe they’re not dead now...but the earth is dying and soon humanity and earth will be gone. The movie/book gives off this “glimmer” of hope for the main character in the end, but you realize even if he does somehow manage to survive for while, he and everyone is inevitably fucked...and soon. I had to bleach my brain with Futurama after that one. Great movie tho. I think it’s a very important piece of work because it shows those cringy people who think the apocalyptic world would be like The Walking Dead what would *really* happen. It’s not all monologues and bad-assery. You’re fucked and everything is horrible.\n\nI don’t really get truly sad in movies where individuals die or animals die- but I get sad when the world is hopelessly doomed.\n\nAnd Call Me By Your Name was just super relatable and personally struck me but in a sad way, so...ya. It made me feel like I’d be alone forever, haha.
5	Lol tons of movies and tv shows do this to me. The ones that do it the most are Mr Nobody, Requiem for a Dream, Elfen Lied, and Angel Beats
3	No movie had that effect like [Dominion](http://watchdominion.com/) did.\n\nWas fucking devastated afterwards. Fuck the human race.
7	Love, Simon made me depressed for a couple of days after watching it. Even though I fully understand that film is very cheeky and pretty unrealistic (maybe even naive),  it has touched me. It's also because I happen to be gay as well.
3	Memento, Ozark Season 2 (I know it's not a movie - don't care), Annihilation are a few off top of my head. \n\nI love that feeling to be honest. It's like a catharsis for my fucked up emotion channels.\n\nEdit: Jesus' Son was another one. 
3	Scarface\n\nI really love gangster/crime movies and had seen just about every other one before finally getting around to Scarface. It was fun for the first half, then the second half was just a long, dramatic decline and it it left me feeling very drained
5	It’s not that I dislike the movie, but the phrase “ass to ass” haunts me (among many other things in the film) and I choose not to rewatch that. 
2	Hachiko Waits, just the fact that it was a true story really made it that much more sad for me. I ended up crying for like 15 minutes after watching it. 
2	The Road\n\nSeeking a friend for the end of the world\n\nHitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy\n\nSin City\n\nDagon \n\nSemi drained -\n\nA Serbian film\n\nPunisher 2004
2	Oh my God I had took art Cinema last semester at city college and I watched Enter the Void Jesus Christ it's like you're stuck in a bad Acid trip that never ends. It's a decent movie I think but I would never watch it again.
2	Requiem for a Dream, was going through a few issues with drugs and alcohol at the time myself. It was an intense experience and left me feeing really drained.
2	Requiem for a Dream, American History X, Love (Gaspar Noe), Enter the Void (Gaspar Noe), Irreversible (Noe as well), Berserk (1997)
4	Grave of the Fireflies.... I have it on Blu-Ray not to watch it again.. just as a reminder \n
1	Ugh... a Serbian film got me... I usually am not affected at all by movies but that one... Damn 
1	Shutter Island. I've seen it once and found it great, but then I rewatched it some time later and it gave me the worst intrusive thoughts I've had till now. On of the worst periods of my life, it lasted months. Never watching it again.
1	Schindlers list got me really good. Great movie but I think one time is enough for me.
1	A Quiet Place \n\nPrimer\n\nSeven pounds\n\n50 first dates\n\nThe Vow\n\nThe time travelers wife\n\nThe Butterfly effect\n\n\n\nThere's more, but those are just the ones that come to mind...\n
1	This usually never happens to me, even though I have a very strong emotional reaction to movies (I cry easily, or get easily excited), once the experience is over, I actually like if it leaves me uncomfortable or still feeling something afterward. Makes it all the more interesting to experience.\n\nHowever, we recently watched an extract from the movie 'landscape in the mist' in class and I felt so sick to my stomach that a few other students and I had to take a break to go breathe outside. I don't know if I ever want to watch the actual movie. I'm not talking gorey stuff, more like a very harsh, hopeless moment, filmed in the best way possible to make anyone very uncomfortable. If you've seen the movie, you'll know what I mean, I think.
1	Too many to count.\n\nOh wait I misread the title. It's mostly bad movies that leave me drained.
1	The Water Diviner
1	Up until the very end, Interstellar.\nMost episodes of The Black Mirror drain the hell out of me too.
1	I cant think of many movies right now, is too soon in the morning for me, but the movie that filled me with dread hate and rage was the Hunt, one of the most shattering movis i have ever seen.Something about the way that movie is told gave me lowkey anxiety.
1	[removed]
1	White Boy Rick.  I left the theater in the worst mood.
1	A Star is Born (2018), incredibly sad and a bit intense if you’ve dealt with suicidal thoughts or addiction/substance abuse 
1	"What dreams may come" is a beautiful film but it touches on so many themes that really cut right to my soul, ie; soul mates, multiple family members death at once, losing your passion, suicide.....to name a few. The soundtrack is gorgeous as well but I have to be prepared to cry or deeply think about subjects I avoid.
1	Life is Beautiful was like that for me. The movie is sad but tolerable. But the damn ending...\nRom Com's cringy main character moments make me cringe inside and I have to get up and walk away from hyper awkward moments.
1	Requiem for a dream ,The Fountain (a little)...
1	Many of the recent marvel movies.\nI'm amused by them. They're ok.\nI just think they're a chore for me now.\n\nAnd......other than those which my little brother is obsessed with getting me into.\n\nWell. I dont watch movies that are draining for the most part\n
1	Threads. Realistic 80s portrayal of nuclear war and its aftermath on an English city and the surrounding area. It's easily the most bleak film I've ever watched. I've seen it twice, and each time I experienced heightened anxiety and depression for about two weeks afterwards. I won't be watching it again! 
16	How to handle any situation with Ne	
11	Well maybe... \n\nClosest I've ever come was standing in my front yard nude with a towel covering me with shampoo in my hair pleading for the water department maintenance man to turn my water back on because I had forgotten to pay the bill. \n\nHe stressed that he couldn't do that and I said *yes you can!!!  you choose not to!!!*\n\n" I'll be there in an hour to pay it but I have soap in my hair now please turn the water back on I have a job interview in 90 minutes."\n\n Thankfully he understood that any man willing to stand in his yard in a towel and scream should be taken seriously..and he turned it back on...
3	I'm gay
1	Lol, I'd probably start jerking off scaring them away.
56	ENTP players - or the opposite?	I seen this thread on /entp which discussed 'stereotyped entp traits you DON'T relate to' , and one of the unrelateable traits was fuck boy/player/Casanova. \n\nAs a female who is really attracted to entps, it is discouraging to see them slapped with that  player stereotype, makes me want to disengage rather than invest my time and feelings into a person who is possibly toying with me. On the other hand, I also feel like that player stereotype is quite shallow and not backed up by evidence? I think it's more of a label that is put on the entp because they are so boisterous.\n\nI know it's anecdotal but my experiences don't back up the player stereotype, although I did get that "vibe" from them if that makes sense?\n\nSo here's my observations and biases I guess for entps and what I think they're like in romantic relationships:\n\n- they are oblivious. They don't know when a woman is into them. \n- a woman could confess her feelings to an entp and say she's been pining for him for years and he would be like "I thought you hated me" \n- entps don't pick up the clues that someone is infatuated with them all by themselves. their heads are in the clouds. They appreciate when someone has cut out the guess work \n- entp can unintentionally build sexual tension\n- entp has this playful banter about them, a mixture of mischief and sweetness that can be quite charming but also keep you on your toes \n- the entp can be charismatic, funny and witty yet may still struggle to see how others view him \n- the entp ego can go through two extremes but the entp has a preference for showing off the wide of him that is more egotistical, arrogant, and even narcissistic \n- entps can actually be quite shy romantically and sexually \n- entps are afraid to say a comment and have it come across as creepy instead so they may opt out of doing so completely \n- entps deflect their romantic and sexual feelings \n- dates with entps may seem "ambiguous" because the entp doesn't explicitly state their romantic interest or explicitly state it is a date. instead it may just look like two friends hanging out but with romantic undertones and sexual tension \n- entps are a P type so they might not have longterm relationship goals in mind. even if they have romantic feelings about a woman, they may not explicitly say so and directly tell her he us trying to court her. he may just hang out with her as a person, as a friend and get to know her more \n- entps do not have Se in their function stack so although the entp may talk about sex a lot, it's in a more abstract and disconnected way than the estp \n- the estp might whisper in your ear the lewd things they want to do you to, while you are out in public with them. while the entp is more shy and may just make sexual jokes or stories. \n- the entp may accidently botch budding romances with his jokes and humour. not just dark humour, but displacing his attraction and coping with humour and having difficulty confessing his feelings to his crush. like his crush may mention a friend of hers who is unlucky in love and the entp may jokingly offer his services. \n- entps may not initiate a kiss, or they may have 'hover hand' where their hand may linger above a woman's body and they're afraid to intrude on a boundary\n- entps might prefer the woman to make the first move and might be pleasantly surprised when a woman kisses them first\n- entps also may not confess their romantic attraction first but they are happy to mirror it once the opportunity arrives \n- again entps are P type and don't have concrete plans. they might get lost in their imagination with crushes, but they have difficulty bringing it to fruition and they consider the possibilities with Ne and know that it might be possible that their feelings aren't returned so they may not bother until they see a "green light" \n- the entps relationships are complex and multifaceted. many relationships with the entp start with confrontation/debates/arguing. the entp "grows" on you \n- entps are also quite solitary. they are one of the most introverted extroverts. if they spend all day talking to you, they might like you \n\nidk interested in hearing your thoughts because I find Entps insanely attractive but I don't wanna be hurt you know? So tell me what you think if this list and how accurate my judgement is of them. \n\n
40	I think your list is wonderfully, refreshingly accurate.  
13	Apparently you removed some of the points that were under scrutiny in the comments. Which is good.\n\nI absolutely love your list. It is mostly on point for me. Since you're obviously coming in for advice, I would add a few things from a deeper perspective. At least anecdotal, hope some of it is close to universal.\n\nENTPs are charming in a somewhat childish enlivening enthusiasm way. Most times, they are not the stereotypical players.\n\nENTPs are not terrified of commitment per se, they are terrified of being tied down to something they don't want to be in. Confinement is the death of an ENTP. We also don't like to hurt other people's feelings. Usually we prefer to be frank, but telling someone that we are not into them when someone has already fallen for us, not so delightful. We are also not masters of assessing emotional affection or intimacy in our personal relationship, thus need verification.\n\nLike you said, ENTPs can't read clues. Until we have matured at least. I was about 25 when I started to not be completely oblivious and to be able to read people like I do now. And I've been empathetic my whole life. Don't know what's up with that. Our relationship with Fe is weird.\n\nThese are some of the reasons why courting a potential mate from a close prespective but from a slight emotional distance is needed. This is also why you might get a hint of that nonchalant player vibe from them. We want to explore different aspects of a person to get to know them. Once we lock down the mate we want to be with and get the green light from the other party, we are fiercely committed and loyal. At least this is the case for me.\n\nNow, if an ENTP doesn't think of you as a potential mate, they most likely withdraw and distance themselves. This can happen in a relationship as well. Just need to talk it out and get to the root of the issue. Finding someone to truly commit to can be a rollercoaster for the ENTP. This is one of those moments when I'm grateful for having my GF in my life. <3 :)\n\n*Basic advice for dating and relationship with an ENTP*\nBe yourself, let them be themselves. Engage them in conversation and life. Support their ideas initially before giving feedback. Absolutely never shut down their momentum of excitement when they have a heureka moment. No matter how stupid it is. Yes, we have stupid ideas too. Be open for growth, support their growth and support their life dreams while having your own. Direct them towards common ideas they have, don't let them follow everything theu set their mind to. Find the lifeline if they can't. That's the gist of it.
6	Not a player, but went through a phase of honest non-committal sexual relations in my late teens. \n\nThen I settled down for six years and that seems to be my average for ltrs.
4	> they are oblivious. They don't know when a ~~woman~~ (man) is into them.  \n> a ~~woman~~  (man) could confess ~~her~~ (his) feelings to an entp and say ~~s~~he's been pining for ~~him~~ (her) for years and ~~he~~ (she) would be like "I thought you hated me"  \n> entps don't pick up the clues that someone is infatuated with them all by themselves. their heads are in the clouds. They appreciate when someone has cut out the guess work  \n> entp can unintentionally build sexual tension  \n> entp has this playful banter about them, a mixture of mischief and sweetness that can be quite charming but also keep you on your toes  \n> the entp can be charismatic, funny and witty yet may still struggle to see how others view ~~him~~ (her)\n\nI don't know how you crawled inside me and learned all my secrets but please GET OUT.\n\nSeriously, how the heck did you peg all this?
5	My friends try to get me alone with girls I have fun conversations with. Each time it happens I am so confused they think I'm flirting. \n\nIt appears on the surface we're flirting because we're having a good time, laughing and joking at each other's expense which unfortunately is very similar to flirting.\n\nThe kicker for me is that I'm unable to recreate this fun atmosphere with girls I find attractive. I just have to hope they already like me! \n\nRegarding your list, I think there is a lot of doubt with ENTPs about signs. There's a million ways to interpret a hug and the endless possibilities mean we need more signals than most before saying for certain how someone else feels about us. \n\nI'd say your judgement is pretty accurate though, you seem more aware of ENTP traits than I am 
4	This is actually 100% me
4	tbh I'd like to see such a post about female ENTPs as well, quite interesting
4	ENTP are not players purposefully but they’re still players. Most things are part of the ‘game’ to ENTP
4	How do I fix this:\n\n> entps may not initiate a kiss, or they may have 'hover hand' where their hand may linger above a woman's body and they're afraid to intrude on a boundary \n\nthis:\n\n> entps also may not confess their romantic attraction first but they are happy to mirror it once the opportunity arrives \n\nand this??????\n\n> the entp may accidently botch budding romances with his jokes and humour. not just dark humour, but displacing his attraction and coping with humour and having difficulty confessing his feelings to his crush. like his crush may mention a friend of hers who is unlucky in love and the entp may jokingly offer his services. \n\nIts so weird that Im effortlessly confident in my interactions and then run into these walls. \n\n&#x200B;
4	OMG THAT LAST THING U SAID!!!!!!\nIM SUCH AN INTROVERT I GOT LABELED AN INTP.......\nWith...... 97 percent intuition, that was a bonus prize.\nThing is though.\nYour descriptions are scary in the detail.\nGood Gosh......\nWhatever they are.....they're freaking amazing.\nToo bad I'm an introvert
3	ENTPs are players?
3	52 here...\n\nI've been accused by ex-wife of flirting with other women in stores (At malls / Costco etc) because I'll strike up a conversation with a stranger about a product at the store. Ex would insist the woman thought I was flirting... Not once was I ever trying to flirt... \n\n*Then again I was a philandering\nScoundrel off and on during 30+ years.*\n\nYet not one tryst started because I flirted...\n\nAre we oblivious?  Gawd yes.. \n\nI looked at my HS yearbooks recently..\nThrough much older & wiser eyes\nWhen I read what some of my female friends wrote I evidently had 3 crushes I was oblivious to.. Hell all 3 put their phone numbers in what they wrote..lol..\n\nSometimes I think if then being with that person is not my "idea" from my own interest..  I can't see that they are actually interested.\n\nNow grown women hit on me at church, grocery store and bars, which I rarely go to.. Which is good..now, only if I'm drunk will I flirt...
5	>I know it's anecdotal but my experiences don't back up the player stereotype, although I did get that "vibe" from them if that makes sense?\n\nSounds like you're better at typing than many others. You're right, that stereotype doesn't hold. \n\nI wouldn't say it's 100% accurate, since some things seem more like a human/generic male trait than an ENTP trait. For instance, many comments are "ENTPs can be ..." well, under which circumstances? Because any type can be anything under certain situations -- they're not really predictive statements of "ENTPs are often xyz because abc". \n\nBut all in all, your list is a lot more accurate than most other lists that spring up here, so good job. 
2	I'm entp to the bone and I am still more surprised  how well some of these posts nail me. I am a male 22 and I do almost all of the points in your list the only thing that is different is your point where you say I may not have long term plans with the girl. In my experiences it's been hard not to look to a future with a person I'm with either I should be or not I've definitely had to slow myself down because it's been a problem. I feel the part mentioned about not knowing when someone has feelings for me. I never notice I honestly dint see how people can notice to be honest it's my favorite thing in the world when someone just straight up tells me how the feel it takes all the stress out of the situation. Idk if I'm really answering any questions here but these are my thoughts.
2	I can relate to a lot of this. \n\nENTP’s can come off as oblivious to other people’s advances but we like to pretend that we don’t notice (because there’s a POSSIBILITY that we’re reading too much into your actions and that would be awkward if we initiated off of that assumption) and we wait until it’s 1000% clear what you’re doing. \n\nAnd then still might play it off until we’re confronted about it. \n\nAlso, I can be really sensitive when I have a crush on someone and if they hurt my feelings in any way, the crush starts to fade away and I’m more likely to turn  fuck boy on you and make it seem like I still like you. \n\nAlso, may entertain someone just because I’m bored which is trifling kinda.
1	We can agree to disagree 
125	Being able to do well in high school without having to put in much effort is actually a big disadvantage later in life.	
31	I like how many upvotes this got even though you’d think it’s common sense.
25	I don't buy it.  Where are all of these people who put in a ton of effort in high school now?\n\nHigh school is not hard.  Book smart people don't have to put in much effort to succeed in a typical high school setting.  People who learn how to study hard in their teens are either in an intense prep school environment, or go beyond their required HS curriculum to satisfy their curiosity.  If you're at an average high school and have to study hard to do well, you're probably not smart enough to succeed in a more rigorous/competitive environment.\n\nA better statement would be "most high schools aren't challenging enough to force smart people to develop good study habits."
9	While this is generally true, I *guess*, I don't think it's relevant for ENTPs. More effort? Yeah, sure. That sounds great when you think about it, but we're not SJs that can turn on the switch like that. \n\nWhat I figured out was that surrounding myself with friends in my classes resulted in an actual drive to do my work and not slack off. They keep us accountable because when you're able to talk about/teach others the course material that in itself is motivation for ENTPs. I figured this out before I even knew about MBTI, but I think it's due to our desire to share our line of thinking (NeTi) with others and get their feedback (TiFe).  
8	This exactly and can extend through college. I'm in med school now and have terrible work ethic and only now am subpar despite college being a breeze. In fact it seems like the community college kids often do better and I imagine that's just because they had to work their butts off to get here and continue to do so. 
2	I had to re-learn math my freshmen year of college because of this. Nearly flunked out because of it but I made it dammit.
2	Truth
2	I disagree with this... I skimmed through hs and college and am better for it... You can have discipline in other areas without caring about the bs fake knowledge institutions force...
2	Being intelligent is never a disadvantage
1	Unless you are genius or something like that.
1	Jesus, I coasted through high school. University and now work doing the bare minimum.\n\nI have never applied myself to anything and Degrees will be obsolete once people wake up the the whole accreditation monopoly.
1	Learned this the hard way as well...\n\nThough it was only in subjects I had no interest in...\nEnglish was my least favorite, but I was still getting an A.\n
11	Philosophy Test	Saw someone post their results of this test on Twitter. 70ish questions, went through it in about 5 minutes or so. Screenshot your results. I'll post mine below.\n\nTest:\n\nhttp://dichotomytests.com/test.html?id=0\n\nMy results:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/wGJrWT3

7	How to recover the Ne, "anything is possible", strategic nature as an ENTP acting in shadow (ISFJ-type ?) mode for too long ?	I'm very sure of my type (ENTP), my preferences. But due to various events in the past (won't go into now and not really important) I learned through the 'trauma' of that how to operate in a short sighted, survival, "what it takes to get through this situation" mentality (though all the while it was at odds with what I feel is more my true nature about ideas, possibilities and so on). Thinking and saying things like "well, we have to do it like this because we have 2 days now, but then we have 2 months to resolve in the future".\n\nHaving to make decisions I don't like (but have no choice in circumstances) and then disingenuously dictate them to other people (when I was managing/advising ppl) because this is what we have to do short term to survive. It's the "shadow" ISFJ becoming increasingly aligned with how "other people need me so I have to subdue anything about myself" "these are the RULES that MUST be obeyed" etc - bit of a simplification but it's essentially that.\n\nAt the time I'd lost sense of my own agency or ability to do anything about my situation.\n\nAll that time I sacrificed my own needs and wants for 'others' because of wanting to be perceived as a certain sort of person. Not because I cared or was altruistic...\n\nFor example - I had a (much needed) week booked as Time Off but then another conflicting request came in and I cancelled mine voluntarily because of "ideologies". And the "other person's needs" (that I didn't actually care about myself).\n\nNow in a more mature (ha) place - and a new job with a more open ended remit - I find I'm still reverting to this kind of thing much more often than I'd like although I am no longer in the "events in the past" situation, but it still influences me as it seems.\n\nI feel constantly in conflict between how I've "learned" to be, through experiences like that, and my actual preferences.\n\n**Any ideas on how I can get over it?**\n\nConcrete examples:\n\n* I judge people for being out sick at deadline times because 'obviously their workload will fall to me' and 'didnt they put work first' (but with an idea of putting 'the whole system' first although maybe that is rationalising it).\n* Dwelling on childhood influences of fear and still being influenced by it.\n* Having a very "black and white" attitude towards everything (although I don't really but it seems like a lot of things are quite simple and people make them complicated)\n* e.g. I felt hateful towards a co-worker who was out on holiday/vacation and "inaccessible" by email/IM etc due to being in remote locations, but they didn't hesitate to post on facebook when they had wi-fi so could have actually logged into emails but just didn't want to. Well, I can understand that people don't want to be bugged on vacation!! except - said co-worker insists on being involved in everything and logging in when they're off (genuine ISFJ) etc, - when it suits them. I notice and get angry about the double standard colleague seems to be using here. (seems like "When I'm OFF I'm OFF except if I choose to make myself available!")\n\nI've become this short-termist, survival oriented person and want to get back to what I actually want to be.
4	I think you need a vacation, if not to quit your job altogether. Broaden your scope as much as possible. Force yourself to drink in many different kinds of new information, which you'll only be able to process through Ne. Then simply allow your mind to tell you what it needs :)
2	Walk your own path. It takes courage, which cannot be taught. If you lack courage, you will fail no matter your personality.\n
1	INTJ is our shadow type. I can't remember what the term is for ISFJ in ENTPs since I know ESFP is our superego, but the best way to get your Ne back is to stop caring so much and just go with the flow. It's more fun to adapt than it is to control 😉
1	> All that time I sacrificed my own needs and wants for 'others' because of wanting to be perceived as a certain sort of person. Not because I cared or was altruistic...\n\nLearn to say no.\n\nHere’s an example.   I was on a plane.  I always book the window seat because (for various reasons) I’m very uncomfortable sitting elsewhere.   The stewardess came up to me and asked if I wouldn’t mind swapping seats so the guy next to me could sit by his wife.   It would have entailed me taking an isle seat which I really dislike.    When I was younger, I would have been more of a pushover for that kind of situation even at my own expense.  But I learned to say no to that kind of social pressure when it means that I would have to put myself out.  I think Fe types have a tendency to think that only they can solve the worlds problems.   In this case, they simply asked someone else in the plane of 200 people who were willing to accommodate them and I didn’t have to suffer because his wife couldn’t bear to be apart from him for 4 hours. \n\n\n> I felt hateful towards a co-worker who was out on holiday/vacation and\n\nLearn to give this shit up.  Some people are going to purposefully take advantage of others in life. Other people will do things that seem malicious but are really just innocent.  But your reactions to them are yours.  And if it’s getting to the point where people calling off sick bothers you, then you need to examine just what’s driving that, because all that negative emotion just interferes with your ability to make rational decisions for you own benefit.  \n\nI’m gonna go out on a limb here and say I think a lot of your frustrations come from not feeling like you hae control over your own situation (or that you’re at the mercy of others) , and you’re feeling that Fe urge to want to “punish” people for not towing the line.  
1	Get out into nature, man. Let the experience trigger all sorts of deep questions about the reality of nature and the nature of reality. Get real into how humans as a species fit into the puzzle, and how you as a conscious being fit into it all. But dont try to answer the questions;  just try to ask them well. \n\nIf that doesnt get you out of go-mode, I dont know what would
1	Your biggest problem and I had to stop you at one point.\nUp till the part about the (maturity) is where u lost me.\nDo you think, that older bigger looking tough people who keep telling other people how immature they are,,, are they mature?\nIs that what you wanna be?\nDude. Ur literally so mature you broke the computer.
4	Are mbti personality types genetic?	
10	The short answer is “no”.  A somewhat longer answer is “not really”.
3	People are much more like their parents than they want to admit. It might be difficult to understand or see, when you are young, and they are old, and you come from 2 different decades.   \n\nAlso even being the same type, you can be extremely different in the way you live your life. So that just makes it even more confusing.  \n\nI don't to claim this is the truth, or that I am not open to new views.  \n\nBut the way I have typed people in real life. Then they are always like their parents in a lot ways. Even when they haven't grown up with their parents.  \n\nAlso I notice a tendency that if you're a son you're more like your father personality wise on average than your mom, and vice versa being a woman. But obviously this is also influenced by the sex, and that men often are more T types, where women are more F types.   Which biologically also makes sense. That women don't have to be very rational, as long as they are motherly/protective/loving, where men don't biologically need to be that as much, because they are more "skill and thing" oriented. Taking down a prey, fighting for the tribe and what not.  \n\nThen there's also just the obvious genetics. If both your parents have blue eyes, then you 99% also have a chance of having blue eyes, same color hair, or a combination of physical attributes.  \n\nTherefore I also think the chance of 2xISTJs having an ENTP child is nearly 0%.  \n\nBut of course having a ESFP mother, and ISTP father, getting a son, being an ESTP is not really that far fetched.  \n\n"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree" - I agree with this based on my personal reads, and having an interest in observing, and analyzing people.  \n\nSocial heritage is incredibly difficult to break out of. So having 2 average ISTJs as parents, I also think it is very difficult to be anything else than an average ISTJ yourself in theory, and in reality.  \n\nI always see it like a seed. You're just a product of your fathers sperm, and your mothers egg. Your entire life is memorized in that seed. Like a rose seed will always be a rose seed. When we are created the seed is already predestined with certain physical attributes, and personal attributes, which is a mixture of your parents genes/genetics. Your tendencies is already memorized and encoded in that seed from the very beginning.  \n\nOf course the seed can be affected by it's environment and the "nurture" aspect. But it is still a rose seed. Maybe the seed had perfect conditions or shitty conditions, but it will always be a rose, unless it is a direct mutation into something entirely else.  \n\n"But how come I am ENTP, my father is ISFP, and my mother is ISTJ" - Well, because I wouldn't type any of you guys those types, and you probably mistyped you/them compared to how I would have typed them.  
2	I'm sure others with more technical and theoretical knowledge will be along to give more comprehensive answers, but I'm pretty sure the "letters" aren't inheritable as such (how much do you know about the functions such as Extroverted Thinking?) (\*)\n\nAlthough there is some inherited component but it seems like people either follow, or rebel against, their parents types (but then really what are the other options?!)\n\nI'm an ENTP with (presumed) xSFJ and INTJ parents (genetically) but brought up with the xSFJ single parent.\n\nIn short I don't think they are genetic in the way your father suggests, but there is possibly some inherited nature. No one knows... (Although I believe there was some study where the 'functions' were observable on a brain scan? can anyone give more depth?)\n\nBtw, interesting ENTJ/ISFP pairing for your parents. functional opposites...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(\*) but now on re-reading, my Ne is going crazy at the idea of the correspondence of A, C, G, T to the 'letters'.
1	Idk. My dad is ESTJ, my mom is ISFJ and my 3 sisters are ISFP, ESFP, and INFJ so there's a lot of differences going on here.\n\nEdit: Changed ESTP to ESTJ. Damned autocorrect.
1	Maybe. I sometimes wonder if there was a mix up at the nursery when I was a baby. I'm nothing like my parents. 
1	I'm no scientist by any means so I cant comment on the generic propability of inheriting personality traits.\n\n I can say that my own family has an entp every generation or so oddly enough. So I'm an entp (first born), my dad is an entp (second born), his dad is an entp (first born) and from what I've been told about my great grand father he was also an entp (I think third born). 
1	My mother is an INFJ. My father is, I think... an INTP or an ISTP. No siblings. So... dunno. 
3	How many of you have ENTJ fathers?	My dad is an ENTJ, I know two other ENTP men (never met an ENTP woman) whose fathers are also ENTJ. \n\nI haven't seen too many posts in this community about parents, but someone asked recently if MBTI traits can be genetically inherited. I don't think that's necessarily the case, but I have noticed that despite the fact that we tend to irritate ENTJs, ENTPs and ENTJs are often very complimentary.\n\nWhen I work with my father, he handles planning and scheduling, and I handle monkey wrenches and random problems that mess up his plans and frustrate him.\n\nI'm wondering if this is a common dynamic and if there's a possibility that ENTJs make ENTPs, not through genetics but more through the way they raise their kids.
5	ENTJ mum, in my case. I've seen the same trend, actually, especially in movies. Seems like almost every ENTP kid in a movie has a Te dom parent, usually the father. Psych, Accepted, Iron Man, Fault in our Stars, Juno... There's gotta be others but they aren't coming to my brain.\n\nI can't say my relationship with my mom was as positive as yours was with your dad. She and I fought endlessly growing up, and our type differences divided us intensely - irreconcilably, it seems, as I never got a chance to make amends before she died. I miss her terribly and don't understand why, since all we ever did in life was fight...
4	Beware of confirmation bias here. People are more likely to comment on your post if they have an ENTJ parent. That doesn't mean that ENTPs are more likely to have ENTJ dads.
1	Ys I've got an ENTJ dad aswell
1	My dads an INTP and my mom's an INFJ. However, my language teacher is an ENTJ, and I hate her hypocritcal guts.
1	My dad tested ISTJ. I used to consider him extraverted but it might just be that he has very developed Fe. Before he tested I thought he might also be an ENTP. I know my grandmother was definitely an ISTJ. I never knew my grandfather but everything I know about him was that he was a chemical engineer and loved to fuck around with shit with seemingly no end goal or plan. He sounds textbook ENTP when I hear about him.\n\nMy mother is an ISTP so an ISTJ/ISTP combonation produced an ENTP and an ENTJ (older sister.)
1	Yep the more I see the facade leaving my Alzheimer's ridden father the more I see an ENTJ... Took him decades to keep the social expectations facade up.. Now it's gone and he's just a critical ass...
1	My whole side of the family is a variation of SI/TI/NE/FE and my uncle's family is Se Te Ni Fi
1	ENTJ mother, INTJ father.
1	Yes, Dad is an ENTJ. So I suppose I can imagine how everyone's childhood more or less was like. 
1	I'm an ENTJ and I'm all of your alls father. Call me daddy. 
1	Dad claims he is INTJ but he is so Te-Dom it’s outrageous. Definitely ENTJ. We fight all the time. As an adult I usually end up winning, I run a few laps around him with wit, logic and puns until he is bamboozled a bit.
1	my father is ESFJ and mom INFJ\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've seen quite a few NT people with a INFJ mom somehow lmao I wonder if we all have the same problems with them as well
1	mother's an INTJ, father's an XXXX, but most certainly not ENTJ
1	ESTJ dad, ESFP mom (most likely underdeveloped ESFJ) and ENFJ sister
1	I have no idea.\nHes dead and he died before I could ever really understand.\nLike I never was able to legitimately talk with em.\nLong story
2	Dogs or cats?	Silly question but which do you prefer? Maybe there is some DEEP correlation between type and animal preference /s
8	Eh, both I guess. Dogs can be annoying as fuck and I hate this weird cult-like culture that has risen up around them. They can be cool, but can we stop ignoring that some of them are vicious cunts?\n\nI like cats because they’re not so needy. I don’t think I’ll be ready to own a dog for years and years tbh. I need to settle down before I get one and have a bigger space. I don’t want a dog that is only inside because of the smell. Dogs just stink like 95% of the time unless you are completely and 100% invested in their hygiene. I can’t fucking stand the smell or the poop or the slobber or all of those things that come with owning a creature that is basically just a cuter version of a severely handicapped person. I’m pretty sure when people get defensive about this they are coming from an emotional bias, because I have yet to meet a dog that didn’t stink up the entire house unless the owner was a housewife constantly slaving away to make sure it doesn’t.\n\nSo as of right now: cats.\n\nMaybe in the future when I have a yard and more time: a *single* dog.
4	Cats are just a worse version of a dog.\nA bear is a better version of a dog.\n\n\nDogs all the way.
5	Dogs, for sure. No matter how shitty a day you've had, when you walk in the door and they're like, "HOLY SHIT YOU'RE BACK! I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONE FOREVER!" it just makes my day lol.
5	Cats.  People love dogs because they love every human no matter what, but I like the idea of having to earn your cats love.  It makes them more like humans.
2	[Cats should be illegal. They're a highly destructive animal.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/outdoor-cats-kill-between-14-billion-and-37-billion-birds-a-year-study-says/2013/01/31/2504f744-6bbe-11e2-ada0-5ca5fa7ebe79_story.html?utm_term=.8a6e64983173)
2	Dogs. Honestly, I find cats disgusting.
1	I've always ever owned cats, but I'm a secret dog lover.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo... Both, I think ? They're very different.
1	I say I want dogs, but the truth is that they're too much maintenance and I'd rather have cats for now. Plus, cats are nice pets in general if they get trained well. \n\nMaybe, when I'm a middle aged slowpoke, I'll get a dog.
1	Actually during my marriage my INFJ & I rescued 26 cats in 6 years.. While having 1 to 3 dogs.. I love a dog that can hang with cats and vise versa... 
1	Dogs because I'm allergic to cats and they're dumb to have as a pet too. You can't even fucking pet them. All their fucking hair just falls out and you can't train them either.
1	I prefer cats, dogs require too much training, and I'll probably only upset the dog with my asshole personality. Cats are assholes and don't care. 
1	No there isnt a deep connection. There isnt even such thing as deep connection. Either two things are connected or NOT.
1	Please stop making me choose. I love them both. 
1	They key is to adopt all the animals and become a kind forest spirit away from humanity. Or, maybe I'm tired of people. 
1	I prefer cats.\n\nOther peoples dogs are usually pleasant and fun, but no way in hell I'd ever want to own one. Theyre so much work? And theyre annoying and smelly. \n\nCats do more to take care of themselves and dont breathe grossly in your face  
1	CATS. MAINE COONS specifically
1	Im a plants kinda guy, myself. Less annoying, less maintenance, more useful. They don't stare at me while I poop.\n\nPlants are much better than cats _or_ dogs.
0	Cats
9	Intj F, with Entp M boyfriend. A general question.	Do you find that in a relationship, if you struggle with one thing or another, be it career success, emotional issues, health, etc, it is better if your bf/gf/partner offers specific solutions instead of broad support or criticism?\n\nThis is something I have wondered. As an Intj, I often have to curb my edge. I went through a decent amount of shit in the past, and it is my personal belief that this has helped me be more open and empathetic, especially in my current relationship. However, it still comes more naturally to me to offer advice in general.\n\nI often try to offer specific solutions and resources to my boyfriend when he struggles (after providing emotional support first), and he usually seems to appreciate it the most. Would you personally relate to that? Or do you feel that would be domineering or pedantic? Do you instead prefer to simply find solutions on your own, with a solid voice of support behind you?
9	I prefer support, and some assistance figuring out exactly how I feel / what I want to do. Not general advice, but rather a conversation about said topic. 
6	I like advice if they're just that - an advice. some people assume that when they give you advice that you should at least try them, when I know better what the better solution to my problem would be and might have other reasons why I didn't try out the others advice. I can't stand when the people get mad then when I don't listen so yea it depends on the person.
4	> he usually seems to appreciate it the most\n\nIsn't this the answer to your question? 
4	I don't like support. It really depends on your assertiveness vs your turbulence.\n\nAs someone who is very assertive i don't think I would ever prefer support. I would appreciate the attempt though.\n\nI want ideas, Solutions and I want to debate the best course of action. And then I want you to do it all because I hate work.
4	Yes tell me how to fix it
4	I tend to want to go the solution route when someone comes to me with a problem. What could be better than trying to eliminate what’s making them feel bad? But that’s usually not what people want if they are opening up to you about an issue. It is important to sympathize or empathize and comfort them first. The emotional issue is more pressing than what’s causing it. People aren’t going to want to solve an issue while they are upset. That’s why it’s important to say something like, “I’m so sorry. That must be really tough. I’m here for you.” Just listen and validate their feelings. Then offer solutions if they ask for help unless you really can solve the problem easily. \n\nI think this would really work with anyone. We all want to be comforted when we are upset. When someone feels supported, they will feel more empowered to fix the cause of the issue. \n\nI’ve struggled with treating the emotions first, and still do sometimes. But you’d be amazed how just being sympathetic will really help someone. 
3	This is just me. You could just ask: Is there any way I can help? If the ENTP was close enough, and there are already social mechanisms in place that help you two communicate and put the emotion aside and focus on the problem, chances are it will be very quickly and elegantly solved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe're pretty adept in finding our own solutions. But they might not be the best ones but at least they work. the INTJ / INFJ eyes are something I admire because they get into the details I often gloss over. 
2	I would suggest not doing that.  When I am struggling personally, I feel that \*my\* solution is the only one that matters.  If you try to solve his problems for him by offering him advice, he may resist.  Then you'll feel disrespected because you think he doesn't believe it's the best move, even though it seems obvious to you.  Like "duh, how can he not see that?  How the hell can I be wrong here?".   Let him think it through without help first.  He'll probably want to discuss every option with you as he considers them carefully.  You'll have the opportunity to offer encouragement when it's "his" idea, even if it's what you would have told him in the beginning.    
2	(I didn't read the previous comments so as not to influence my answer!) I'm an ENTP with INTJ partner.\n\nWhat I'm (ENTP) looking for in that situation is firstly recognition of the problem (It may be that I've "framed" it wrongly in the first place), then some ideas, but not just "do this, do that, if this then that....." etc right off the bat. It's a rational process but I'm not just seeking a "procedure" to apply.. It's basically rationally orientated spitballing to bounce ideas off someone who can assess them crtically and isn't afraid to tell me if I'm being stupid.\n\nIt depends how it's delivered (tertiary Fe) as to whether it's perceived as "domineering or pedantic" I suppose. For myself I can tell the difference about half of the time, but it's the source of a lot of conflict!
2	I would prefer an open dialog about the situations and if my SO could lead me down a path i can see as the best i will put the pieces together and then fully understand the advice sneakily given. Jusy saying "you should do this" i will either instantly agree (which is unlikely, if i was sold that easily i would have thought about it) or i will be defensive to an extent (due to not completely understanding and putting up a wall to hide my ignorance)
2	There’s a MbTI guy, C.s. Joseph on YouTube and podcast, who talk a lot about the naturally compatible relationship between an Intj and entp. I think there is a lot of truth to it, I think if you care about this guy, you will likely do what the entp needs. Like intj often listen (Fi) and give real world solutions (Te) and pose question for the Entp (ti) to consider. I think it’s wonderful that you care about helping your entp. Unless you have some issues that go beyond personality type, like being dismissive of people’s issues or pushing solutions on others, Then you’re going to be well received by the ENTP.\n\n\nAlso congrats on finding someone you care about.\n
6	Is there a service where someone can organize my house?	Like a house keeper or maid, but for organizing things. My house is a disaster in regards to organization, and I would happily pay someone else to straighten everything up. However, I don't know what this service would even be called, and I don't know what I should look out for when hiring someone for this.\n\nAny tips? I imagine some of you here have hired someone to do this exact thing for your own homes.
9	>I don't know what this service would even be called, \n\nThis is one of the oldest services in the US. It's called marriage™. I recommend getting married to an ISFJ. \n\n**Warning**: marriage™ may cause distress, sleep deprivation, children, depleted bank accounts, divorce, abuse, and sometimes death.
3	There are professional organizers! I haven’t ever hired one because I’m poor and don’t like people messing with my stuff. I’ve seen a few youtubers hire them for videos. They will probably be easier to find if you live in a major city. 
3	Yes... But the bigger question should be is there a service that will keep it organized continually?\n\n*Just marry a INFJ and give her too much caffeine twice a month...and suffer through the critical comments* \n\nIt's cheaper...
3	I just tap into my oppressed inner ISFJ every now and then. She is *very* good at this stuff.
2	Try this:\n\nhttps://konmari.com/pages/consultants
2	I assume you know what Craigslist is? \n\nJust make a post saying you want a total deep clean and organization. \n\nAnd do try to give some sort of formal interview to make sure they aren’t scammers. Ask for references. And some prostitutes use house cleaning as a front so make sure they don’t say anything about cleaning naked for extra, unless you’re into that. In my experience prostitutes are not good at cleaning but I could be biased here. 
1	I’d love to do that, b... but I’m like thousands  and thousands of miles away 
1	Get an ISTJ partner.\n\nI do no chores. I just tell her how i want it and she happily does it. \n\nPerfect system.
1	This subreddit	Why do we come together as a group? What is the reason? If it is to discuss, then why? For our amusement? To learn?\n\nIf its to amuse ourselves then how can anyone take a moral highground over another? You cannot critizise someone for not amusing you enough. So unless you come here for more than amusement you.should not critizise anyone here. \n\nIf it is to learn... why do you think strangers on the internet you know NOTHING about will provide you with the knowledge you or anyone at all needs to improve your life or improve anything? How do you know that what you learn here is useful? \n\n
10	I come here for the circlejerk.\n\n\nNo, I come here to observe other entps, and sometimes engage. 
5	We gather for the circlejerk. The jerking/flicking is consensual, therefore it is moral. I consider myself a voyeur watching from afar, though I occasionally join the circle when I'm feeling dangerous. 
3	myself im just here to learn and for fun. Not even sure if im a entp. But i thought i was an infj for like years. But i have really bad self awareness. Whatever, main question though: if the reason you engage in an activity is to amuse yourself, what is it that motivates you to critizise that which does not amuse you? Why should anything amuse you? And why is something worthy of critisism for not doing so? 
1	D) All of the above
1	Just curious. I don't usually get the sense that people are here for "amusement". I do see banter, but it seems to be between people who enjoy it. Might there be any particular incident that you have in mind? (That said, I don't read every thread here; maybe we are looking at different things...)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we are interested in the topic of the thread, and are open to incorporating the input of others into our own ideas, then all we need are their stance and their reasons for taking that particular stance -- this can usually be found within the thread. What other information might we need? 
1	> If its to amuse ourselves then how can anyone take a moral highground over another? You cannot critizise someone for not amusing you enough. So unless you come here for more than amusement you.should not critizise anyone here.\n\nI'm a little confused. What kind of criticism are you talking about? Have you seen this behavior on the sub recently?
1	I enjoy getting on here to entertain thoughts and talk with people whose thought process is similar, may argue with some people but the only criticisms come from my argument with immature entps or more mature entps (where i am poss the ignorant one). I mentor an ENTP 8 years my junior and we vibe very well while discussing most things and the only frustrations i ever have with hin is over stupid avoidable shit that i would have done at his age
1	Because I asked
63	You guys all have messy rooms?	My room is super messy! Once in a while I’ll spend an hour or so deep cleaning and putting everything back in order, but it gets messy again within a week. Clothes on the floor, the whole nine yards. I’m wondering, is this due to my relatively low orderliness (trait conscientiousness) as an individual apart from being ENTP, or is low orderliness just generally common among ENTPs? You guys all have messy rooms? Any significant number of you super orderly and organized?
77	yeah. it’s either full sterilization or nothing when it comes to cleaning. clothes on the ground is a staple “decoration.”
18	I’ve usually been a bit of a messy person and fairly relaxed with some mess. But these days I make a point of keeping my room clean. \n\nI think entps and intps are stereotyped as very messy and the struggle is real. But it’s something you can easily train yourself out of. Once you’ve done the big clean up to restart the clock it only takes <5 minutes each night or every second night to keep it that way.\n\nWhen I was 18/19/20 my room was a continuous cycle of big clean, really messy, big clean, really messy. These days I always want to have a room that I can take a girl back to without worrying about how messy it is. Not that happens a lot, but I’d much rather have a room that belongs on r/amateurroomporn than r/neckbeardnests for anyone who does see my room and the inferences they make from that.
15	My house is very clean, EXCEPT for my room. I have to have a space of chaos amidst all of the organization. 
14	If I have a hot date, both my car and room get the big clean. This is the only cycle I know.
26	I really value organization and cleanliness....but yeah my personal spaces are messy too 😞
7	Organized chaos
6	Exactly same for me
6	Ditto dude my room always looks awful even hours after I clean it\n
6	Yup, I get sudden bursts of motivation to clean it every now and then but it gets messy soon after
6	Room is a terrible mess but no where else. I cant stand having a messy kitchen especially. 
3	Pretty much same, I try to keep it sort of orderly, but it's somehow always sort of messy still. I don't know how people always keep theirs really tidy...
3	Nah, I’ve always had a fairly good knack for my things have a place I always put them. I get a bit anxious if I have too much of a mess around me. Am I ultra organized, no, but there is order. As for everything having a place, if my wife moves anything I use from where I put it, even if it’s a daily use thing (ex. my wallet, phone, etc...) I’ll never even think twice about having left it behind until I need it and can’t find it. Can be frustrating, but it is what it is.
3	I like for my room to be a sterile sanctuary with nothing in it. I only go there to sleep. Everything I use in day-to-day life is downstairs; *that's* where it's disorganized.
3	It's either spotless or a mess. Never anhtbjng in between. 
3	I'm minimalist and that's helped a ton with this problem but unfortunately I mess up my room most mornings and clean before I go to sleep and repeat. 
3	I can keep it clean if I try. Minimalism, i.e. owning less, makes it a lot easier.
3	It takes an extraordinary amount of effort to clean my room. Lucky I have an ISTJ wife who finds meaning in cleaning.\n\nAnd if I do clean it then my room would rival a hospital.
2	Yep 10x over. I need some chaos in my room or it doesn’t feel like my home.
2	Messy but clean. My daily use stuff are everywhere but my cupboards are neat and organised. I deep clean after the house has reached its maximum mess entropy, I enjoy the before/after makeover feeling. But I can't be super neat, I have to leave some personal touches here and there, some hair on the freshly mopped floor, a dirty mug on my clean desk. It annoys my extra neat family members, but I prefer my weekly deep clean over their superficial daily dusting.
2	My messy is room.!! \n\nThe places i walk on , got corrupted. \n\nOfc i tidy up my room. Once in a year. It remains stable half a day.\n\nI know every single item’s place in that mess. Never lost an object in my life.\n\nIf I cant find an item in the place I remember, it means someone changed the place without telling me and I start messing everywhere until i find it. \n\nI like to keep banana wastes on the couch\n\nIf there is a cloth on the floor i step on it until my wife tells me the opposite\n\nI bite my nails and throw on the floor, because why not?\n\nI usually gind myself keeping the trash on table even when i am very close to the trash can, it is an habit.\n\nI am so happy in my dirty little chaos because it is my order in harmony.
2	I always used to be extremely messy, piles of clothes on the bed, floor, chair, desk, etc. But once I got a cat and had to clean up her litter and feed her everyday, I got myself into a routine! Now it’s the full opposite! My boyfriend actually gets really annoyed because I like everything to be spotless all the time... 
2	Yes, exactly the same over here. I plant the seed of a messy room when I think "I need to keep these items out because I'll still be using them soon." I have no problem with cleaning but it just doesn't bother me if my room is a little disheveled (a lot of days I don't even notice), which allows the mess to grow.
2	Hello Entps!\n\nMy room is perhaps a 8/10 right now.\n\nBut I have a clear vision of what a perfect room should be like. A 10/10. \n\nI should be better at keeping it a 10/10. 
2	My office, garage (workshop), room, home office and storage areas are all a mess. I strive to be organized and I'm working towards that, but it's usually five steps forward and four steps back. 
1	My room have a 3 meter wide bed(2 matresses joined together), and ill install a projector on it, and im thinking about filling it with artifical grass or something like that(i have more ideas, but if i wrote those ill never do them)i have a turntable, some vynils,all on top of an old commode with a marble top, also some boudair soap and 2 small and ugly bedside tables.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo even if im messy theres not much for it to get as messy, and i try to have it as an art project where the main theme is connection with nature trough sex.
1	I have a workspace. 200x70cm. I have space for mouse/keyboard, and a cup. I clean up every few weeks. Yep, I'm super messy.
1	I have a feeling that most EPs are prone to messiness lol. IPs likely too but from my experience living with INTPs, they are actually relatively neat. Like never egregiously messy. \n\nFor an IJ though, I used to be much more bothered by messiness so I thought my INTP friend was a hot mess. But now that I’ve seen worse, I’m like lol whatever that’s not that bad. 
1	Nope, if everything is dirty , I cannot concentrate.
1	Yes, but I know where everything is. I get really pissed when my wife cleans up and doesn't remember where she put all my stuff, b/c even though it's a mess, I can find what I'm looking for in a second. 
1	[deleted]
1	I cleaned two days ago, I initiated tours and showed people around my couple of square meters for once, its a rare opportunity
1	Rooms get dirty, to try to keep thm clean is insanity
1	Yes.\nMy room is messy but I know where all my stuff is.\nThe stuff just happens to be lying all over my room
1	I have a semi-messy room but my standard might be a little shifted. When I was a kid, my aunt's (on my fathers side) room was the pinnacle of a mess, I remember piles of clothes on the floor and just crap, I think her mom yelled at her about it a lot so they yelled back and forth up the stairs. Speaking of the stairs, that took climbing to get to the top because of how big of an avalanche of clothes there were leading into the laundry room. I guess she would just throw them down the stairs from her room then not actually wash them or do anything with them and they build up over time filling the whole staircase. Before my mom moved out of there, they made her wash their dishes and do their laundry, she said I wouldn't even want to know the kind of lifestyle it was. There was another staircase in the house so it wasn't really in the way but I remember me and my cousin played a game (really messed up thinking about it now) to see who could actually get to the top of the stairs. So nothing I do will come close to being that messy.

9	spiritualism/beyond/connection to the universe/oneness ideas in the entp	as an ENTP, do any of these ideas resonate? essentially, non materialism, explored in Taoist / Buddhist / Gnostic, or shamanistic practices and traditions\n\n\nor, for you, do these exist entirely within the "dunderheaded" non-science crowd, as something to be fixed?\n\nvery curious if any entps have connection to these ideas, in any ways.
4	As an atheist, I have a tendency to reject out of hand anyone that claims they have concrete answers pertaining to the numinous or supernatural, because of obvious reasons.\n\nAs a person who loves science fiction and fantasy, there is a part of me that longs for the discovery of magic, because of obvious reasons. \n\nAs an amateur student of human behavior, I understand the need people have for ways to cope with the unexplainable. Death is terrifying, nonexistence incomparable, and life without meaning is depressing. Individual spirituality has value in that it relieves mental stress, separate from any notions of what is or isn't. \n\nAs a guy who has abstract thoughts, it seems absurd to assume we have discerned every aspect of existence. Our perception is so limited by our senses I would say it is more likely we've barely begun to scratch the surface. If meditation leads a person to consider 'deeper' truths or to an epiphany or personal revelation, huzzah to person. I don't believe in an afterlife in the traditional sense, but I do think of the universe as a type of ecosystem that we are a very small part of, and that when we die we transform states as we return to that ecosystem and therefore don't lack existence, only consciousness, and in that sense, we are all one I suppose. This thought process always leads to considerations of entropy and the inevitable death of the universe. What is the purpose behind the supposed design then, if the eventuality is the end of everything? Is it just some superintelligence's experiment, playing out some massive hunch from a higher dimension? This then leads to thoughts of reality, simulations, and neverending rabbit-holes of bewildering and unproductive speculation. \n\nAs an aside, wouldn't heaven be boring? Without contrasting stimulus, it seems like unending bliss would quickly become monotonous.  
3	> the "dunderheaded" non-science crowd\n\nWho is this crowd, precisely? 
3	No. Nihilism until the end
3	Well, I'm religious. I'm a Christian but I find that a lot of Christians/ religious people are so focused on just opinions and they don't focus on the legitimate reasons there are to believe. And so many people believe things that are so obviously random and useless like terra cards or other rituals. I think there are many legitimate reasons to believe in at least intelligent design ( the idea that earth was created by a creature/ species/god) because of how perfectly balanced the ecosystem and our bodies and the microorganisms that build up everything are. The only real thing that is an outlier on the perfect balance of the world is Humans. And the chances that our world was randomly created is almost 0%. But a simple answer would be: Yes a lot of people are "dunderheaded" but at the same time a lot of people do have reasons and provide compelling arguments  (some of which use science some of which don't) . I read somewhere that ENTP's are very inclined to at least think about our existence and what our purpose is. 
1	I make my own mind frame from what I judge is true or not so partly, probably, but I wouldn't know. I do understand how certain ideas can be useful to people in different situations though. Just because it isn't explained or isn't factual doesn't make it irrelevant to someone's experience. But I somehow feel like it makes it harder to know if its doing good or bad for you and your surroundings
1	Intj. I'm a rare breed of Intj in that I am spiritual, as a Gnostic myself. My Entp boyfriend is a Philosophical Taoist, but he and I both enjoy an amount of esoterica, and we definitely enjoy comparing/contrasting those two worldviews. I feel like Gnosticism and Taoism make some similar conceits, with very different implications. He could call himself more agnostic.
1	I mean sure, in the end we, the chair i'm sat in, the air I breathe, the dog walking outside, the leaves blowing in the wind and just about everything else we can think of is ultimately made of atoms in varying arrangements, there's no defined reason to separate them other than the definition we ourselves make.\n\nThere's no practicality to it, it's just one of those things that are. 
1	"Spirituality" used to resonate very deeply with me when I was a child, but now I'm a staunch atheist who thinks all of that nonsense is bullshit.\n\nI think it's something to be fixed since it denotes a major flaw of logic within someone's head, but I don't go around trying to change people IRL because that's really tone-deaf and cringy.\n\n*They* usually start the discussion with me anyway once they find out I don't believe in any of it.
1	If I can answer as an INTP.\nI feel that the point is in our disconnection 
1	I'm not an Entp.\n\nBut as an Intj, I would like to say that all these things does not really matter that much.\n\nYou will get the more logical and cold answer here instead of the more curious and open answer from an ENTP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I believe is more important is the nature.\n\nNature nature nature. People still to this day, can't connect it to daily life enough.\n\nI'm not a nature-obsessed person, I rarely go outside. But it is all about developing a good awareness of everything. Included this "connection" you mentioned. Probably not the connection you were hoping for.\n\nWhat is important is what is good health: physically and mentality.  But when we talk about the mentality, it is very complex matter and should be treated with care and intellect. Beliefs is mentality and can even harm the most innocent people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI normally do not like these abstract and wide topics as the universe because it doesn't give anything back to you.\n\nIt's all about the gains. How can you construct and have any power over the universe. It has full power over you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I would like to say is that. There are many good values in Taoist/Buddhist/Gnostic. I won't dive into it though.
1	Not interested in integrating something that doesn't come from myself. I have my own creativity, understanding and thoughts that *dictate* me. I find spirituality pretentious. 
3	Help for ENTPf, working with ESFPf on my idea	Hi, I’m an ENTP f 23, and I had an idea for a nonprofit organization that’s really important to me and I think it has great potential. I told my ESFP f 23 friend about it and she said she was excited to help me (mostly because she’s trying to get into an elite business school and has no idea how to show them that she will “change he world”.) She’s since tried to make herself the boss of me to execture ideas she likes, recruit other people to join us without asking me first, dropped out for a year without telling me anything, flirted with my boyfriend and was generally rude in that year when she was “finding her motivation in life” or whatever, and then came back to try and help me. She always lists everything she has done (which is tangential stuff like press buttons on weebly to technically “make” the website, tell her unmotivated friends about it) and won’t listen to me while I’m talking most often. She always says “so...what will you do?” Because she has no foresight into the future or any theoretical or abstract conceptual skills, patience, understanding of the business or legal aspects of things.  That being said, she has a greater circle of social connections and more energy than me, which can help get things going in the early stages - and I think any help to this cause is meaningful because the communities at hand could really use this service. I’d love someone to handle managing pr and marketing end of things because I’m a bit shy with interpersonal relationships and would rather work on creating partnerships with other businesses, communities, and finding way to collect large scal resources. It’s just stressful when she starts crying or thinking I’m mean/calling her stupid when I use my Ti or Ne. It’s like I have to talk to her like a child or she starts saying things like “I don’t understand why you keep connecting random stuff together!” And tries with failure to intimidate me with her emotions lol.  What should I do, ENTP’s? Any advice would be extremely appreciated, I would love to work with her somehow just to get the ball rolling for the cause itself. Thanks in advance!\n\nEdit*: thanks everyone for the advice. :,) I was stubborn and tried to go ahead with things for a while, then realized how awful it was becoming and decided not to proceed with working with my ESFP friend (of course, with these comments in mind ;) ). Feeling tons better about staying true to the original vision thanks to help from an ISTJ and an ISFJ friend who have been very supportive. Thanks again! 
4	I started a nonprofit with my INTJ friend. We're around your age. \n\nIf you're having such significant problems so early on, I don't think this girl is the right partner for you.\n\nMy friend and I have great respect for each other, and we're very good at resolving our conflicts. Even so, there have been very tense moments. Her position is technically above mine, and she has to work very hard not to weaponize her authority. We both make a conscious effort to keep our egos in check.\n\n> she has no foresight into the future or any theoretical or abstract conceptual skills, patience, understanding of the business or legal aspects of things\n\nThose are red flags.\n\nStarting a nonprofit is hard. Running it is harder. You have to make sure you can trust your partner.\n\nAnd if she doesn't even care about your cause, she won't have the drive to keep at it. The kids we serve are the only reason I keep doing what I'm doing.
3	It doesn’t sound like things are likely to get any better. This is incompatibility. It’s your thing, you should be the boss (especially since you’re an ENTP). I know you guys are friends, but you should move on without her. Otherwise, you’re just dooming your entire project from the beginning.\n
3	Never ever ever ever use labels to insult her.\nJust avoid using words like "idiot", or  "stupid,"\nOr anything that even remotely mocks intelligence.\n(I'm just offering insight.... I'm an intp)
2	I have been friends with an ESFP since I was 11 (now 35). While I love her, living with her for a year and a half was hell. Her irrationally almost drove me insane. She was also super irresponsible, borderline bipolar, & just generally impossible to deal with (not to mention a slob). We are like oil & water. \n\nI cannot recommend NOT attempting to work with your ESFP anymore vehemently, her social circle be damned. You can network & find other valuable connections. Nothing good will come of this “partnership” beyond testing your ability work under extreme stress... & possibly your will to live.\n\nEdit: everything you describe sounds EXACTLY like my childhood friend 
10	ENTP interviews Trump	
6	I hate late night comedy shows.\n\nCan't think of a single one i have ever enjoyed.\n\nI feel like most of the world gets their politics from these idiots who chase the best reactions.\n\nThat being said, Bill Maher at least has real opinions. The rest dont.\n\nAll of these shows seem like the most disingenuous garbage on tv.\n\n&#x200B;
