2	Daily INFP random discussion thread - March 09	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
227	I love it when I can make people I care about really smile.	
47	When their sweet smile shows. Followed by a genuine laugh.\n\nAnd the look they make at this moment.\nI could fell in love with everyone at this moment. 
9	Does it count if they laugh at me?
3	Me too! It makes my heart skip a beat!
3	I know what you mean. My mom's told me I'm the only one that can make her laugh. I think it's just a kind thought, because I've definitely seen her laugh at things other people have said. 
2	My goal everyday is to make my husband laugh and I'm really god at it. It's my favourite thing in this life. 
2	I live for that shit
1	When I make the girl I love smile/laugh I just wanna kiss her repeatedly. She's adorable. 
1	there's no greater gift than making someone genuinely smile :) except maybe the appreciation of that smile
1	the biggest mood
1	Hearing the laughter of my friends is my favourite thing in the world.
381	I took this picture during the summer while going for a walk. I hope you all enjoy it.	
20	This fills me with elementary school, pre-cell phone days, nostalgia. Playing manhunt and baseball before it got dark. Then popping in a VHS before bed. I miss it so much.
8	Nice photo!
8	I like it a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can feel the isolation.
5	I thought this was minecraft
4	Man I miss summer walks. This winter took the last piece of soul from my body. I can't wait June to get away from people and watch sunsets in peace 😍
4	My favourite part of a summers day, sunset ❤️
4	Ooohhh so beautiful 😍 
4	Love the colors in the sky. With the brick buildings on either side, it invites people to walk off into the sunset. A happy ending 😊
4	Seems like a place you could sit for quite a while and not expect anyone else to walk by ☺️
2	looks like a shot from a next gen game
2	No hate here, just something I noticed. I find all the pictures posted on this sub very aesthetically pleasing, but all of them also, without fail, make me really anxious. No idea why.
2	The walls looked like a video game at first glance, to me. Thought maybe Arma
2	mind if I ask where this is relatively?  such a good feeling in there :)
29	Descent.	
13	no interest in romantic relationships	early 20s, never been in a relationship, never been interested in one, never liked anyone in a deep emotional connection kind of way and have tried dating apps but never interested enough to continue conversations or meet in real life. my friends are always asking me "why are you still single?" and i don't have a good answer. some have suggested that i just haven't met the right person yet / my standards are too high, but somehow i just feel like it's because i can't really be bothered. if there were a list of priorities in my life, getting into a relationship would be right at the bottom -- although there's also that part of me that's curious about what being in one would be like. i'm also not exactly a huge fan of emotional vulnerability.\n\nany thoughts or anyone have a similar experience? wondering if it has anything to do with being infp.
7	I think aromantic people come in all types. Some people just have other stuff to do. 
5	I envy you. 
3	I totally relate! I'm not quite sure it has something to do with being INFP, but now I'm curious about it
2	I am not in the same situation but I think being single and not looking for love desperately is a good thing. You won't find love when you look for it. Not being interested isn't a bad thing imo because life isn't about love, afterall. Plus, if you find the right one, you'd be interested. If not, then you'd still be uninterested. So I don't see anything bad in this.
2	Forcing yourself into a romantic relationship doesn't sound healthy or enjoyable. I wouldn't say emotional vulnerability is necessary either. MBTI doesn't try to represent sexuality I think. You might enjoy hanging around the /r/aromantic community as well as being apart of us. :)
1	Same! Although I haven't even tried out dating apps or anything and I'm soon 27
1	Being aromantic is completely fine! I think it presents itself in all personality types just like being gay or straight does. Romance doesn’t have to be your first priority, or a priority at all.
1	22F and while I’ve had a few intimate friendships I’m in the same boat. I’m mostly asexual but would like to have a family one day too so I’m hoping there’s someone out there I can be happy with!!!!

19	Felt down, but then...	As an INFP I crave time on my own. To listen to music, be creative, switch off from socializing, spend time with my cat and just to RELAX. \n\nFor the past few weeks I’ve thrown myself into the world of dating. I’ve started a new office based job. I’ve spent more time with my family. And, more time with friends/socializing. \n\nI felt after a couple of awful months and feeling isolated working as a freelancer, that I should change my lifestyle. \n\nThis weekend I was going to go on another date with a guy I enjoy spending time with and it fell through. I felt rejected and disappointed. But then, I stopped to think about things. Realizing that time ALONE is so important to me. I cannot function without investing time into my creative hobbies, doing the things I love and spending time with myself. \n\nSo, after initially feeling crappy and rejected to an extent I stopped. I thought about the weekend ahead of me and how I can enjoy it. \n\nI’ve been spending so much time around other people that I didn’t realize that I need time alone. I’m not being true to myself. Yes, I can’t avoid socializing at work with colleagues or my family. But, I can take a breather and opt out of socializing. In this case, I didn’t opt out but I am happy I’m spending the weekend with myself. \n\nI need to recharge my batteries. I’m learning about myself and have realized I overdo socialization when I don’t need to. I love being introverted. I love having the freedom to do what I want, alone. Without the noise/distraction of other people. And, as an INFP it’s important to not get pulled into a situation that doesn’t fulfill your needs. Remember to take time out for you. Always. 
4	Many Slow claps for this victorious passage.  You have found truth and truth of self in a seemingly healthy way.  This is a momentous occasion that I'd say requires an INFParty.  \n\n😨😱😰\n\n... but i hope that this reply will do in its stead
2	I get this way too. People drain me
71	Picture I took at school a few weeks ago	
2	I love how you've catched the atmosphere. Very dreamy and i can almost smell the rain. Also the way everyone is walking in a different direction yet somehow going towards their goal
17	INFP memes compilation	
2	Ha. I use to be this lol. But in all seriousness make sure to take care of you. 
54	found this cute little bridge on my walk	
2	That is cute
2	Dark souls shit
6	Are your parents disappointed in you?	I feel like mine always are. I know they want the best for me but they still completely fail to understand me. I quit my job because I felt like I would suffocate there and now I spend all my time drawing and writing and going to the library (and watching tv series lol), waiting for spring when I'm going to go study again. I feel like I'm doing something really important, even though I don't get any money from it. It kind of hurts when they tell me I'm "wasting my time" when all these little hobbies means so much to me. They're an ISFJ and ISTP by the way. My mom nags more than my dad does. I think my dad might even be a little proud of me lol. Nevertheless I'm just really bad at being a responsible adult.\n\nHow do your parents feel about your life choices? And what types are they? 
2	I think my mom is ESFP but I have never been good enough for her, she always finds something. My dad doesn't say much he is okay as long as I am being productive responsible adult don't know his type. But it sucks when your parents don't comprehend or support because subconsciously you are always looking for their approval whether it's conscious or not. If they are hindering your path you may have to seek to let go of that or talk to them to come to an understanding. 
1	This. I hate my father for always wanting me to reflect on myself , and to think about my actions and overanalyze stuff. It’s so damn annoying. With EVERYTHING. Everything I do he has some opinion ready what he thinks of it. I don’t know what type he is but god it’s annoying.\n\nI’m like I DON’T CARE WHAT THE BEST  STRATEGY IS TO DO THINGS LET ME BE MYSELF. god my life isn’t improving myself so that I do everything perfect. Let me fucking be.
20	Am I the only INFP that likes partying?	Everyone here keeps saying that they don’t like nightclubs, they don’t drink, they don’t like crowds... Nights out are my favourite thing in the whole wide world. Drinking is fun, and I get to dance all night and I love dancing. I also think mosh pits are really fun. I would have said the exact opposite things when I was 19 but that’s because I hadn’t tried them and just assumed I wouldn’t like them. I feel like I don’t fit in here ha.
18	I think personality changes dramatically due to alcohol. When I drink I become super extroverted and love being out with people. Soon as I start sobering up, I need to be alone.
7	I am an INFP and ai love partying as well. Maybe it correlates with your music preference(?)
7	Straight up, the INFPs that enjoy socializing, aren’t depressed, and like going out are severely underrepresented in this sub. \n\nYou do you brother, I ain’t hitting clubs but I love hanging with my people. 
5	Nothing against drinking or meeting with friends, but nightclubs are just too much and feel fake. I love concerts however and crowdsurfing and all that on rock concerts.
5	I was like that until I was about 35. Then I began to loathe it, but that was really the result of depression. I'm starting to get back out in the world. I love happy hours, but I doubt i'll do the late night partying anymore. That really conflicts with my health and fitness goals.
8	Not trying to doubt you, but are you sure you are an INFP? It's pretty easy for people who are ENFPs to mistype themselves as INFPs because ENFP is probably the most introverted of the extravert types. \n\nI enjoy some of these same things as well, but sensory overload is fairly common with introverts and if you aren't experiencing overload at all, I wonder if you are more extraverted than you thought. 
3	I'm the same way.  I don't go out to nightclubs/concerts as often because I'm in my thirties now, but when I do I'm mostly focused on dancing rather than finding people to talk to.  So I think it makes sense for an INFP, and every INFP is a little different, since it's is a range that you are in, not an exact same level of preference.  
3	I love to party. But, I tend to over do it on the liquor in order to counter react how uncomfortable I feel. The good news is, I'm really friendly and kind when I'm drunk (or so I'm told).
2	I love parting around close friends! In many cases it combines my favorite things: good conversation, music, and food! I can't do it all the time and definitely need time after to recharge, but it mixes things up now and again. 
2	I sometimes like to party with friends, but I get tired so fast I'm often forced to sit alone at a table when others still dance and that becomes such a negative and alienating experience for me that I rarely ever go unless it's just me and one friend, because then they're more likely to keep me company. Sensory overload doesn't hit me if I have someone to focus on, sort of. \n\nNot quite partying, but drinking with friends somewhere we can talk is one of my favorite things to do, though!
2	You are not alone! I enjoy going to parties once in a while when I'm not busy. Though I will say, I only go to parties if I know other people that are going, otherwise it takes a lot of alcohol to make me more social.
2	nah man I live for the sesh 
2	I used to feel very uncomfortable to drink and dance in front of people, and I generally avoided parties. But slowly, I found myself among my kind of crowd and I realized how many types of parties there are. I still don't like certain types of nightclubs but I do enjoy house parties and tecno/rave ones, especially in nature. I got over my fear of dancing in front of people, and nowdays I just let the music move my body. I develop a tactic for drinking: knowing where to stop. I drink just enough to losen up a bit without getting wasted. Same about weed. I think partying is actually great and I am very proud of getting over my fears and enjoying it. 
2	I love the occasional party! I especially love going to concerts/festivals/raves featuring my favorite artists. House, techno, and EDM are generally my favorite but I like almost anything. It is definitely escapism and for a moment I can forget all my problems and just have fun dancing to the music. Also, people tend to be so nice when they are drunk/on some sort of substance!
2	For me, it depends on the situation of the party. If I’m friends with most of the people there, then I’ll go and have a good time. But if I don’t know anyone there, or only know 1 person, I’ll either anxiously stay for half an hour to be nice or just don’t go.
1	fucking love it,  but need like a solid few dayas to recover from every night out lmao
1	I go clubbing so rarely that when I do, I always have fun. But usually I stay with my friends all night. I just have to get a few shots first to be able to loosen up. Often I'll get tired in the middle of dancing and just stop and stare at a spot somewhere, then continue dancing after a while. Probably looks a bit weird lol. Anyone else ever do that? 
1	No I use to party and love to dance I just don't like phony places that are excessively loud, or too much immaturity, I prefer more quirky and intimate spots. 
1	I love clubs and dancing too! I can dance all night, drinks or not!
1	Yes! I love love love partying. 
2	Am I too clingy?? Are any other infps SUPER clingy???	Its only with internet friends for some reason. My friend was playing roblox and so i joined her. Then she played a game that i couldn't find anywhere so i got sAd. Then this one time I was in a voice chat and they were accidentally ignoring me so i sat in the voice chat crying. I feel so selfish.\nI just want to spend time with her. Whenever she's doing something, I want to do it with her.  I'm usually ignored because i have to be quiet. I can't talk because I'll wake my parents up. (we're in different timezones) \nI want to say she's a friend, but it's more like i just follow her around.\nWhen we do talk, its nice.
2	Oh, if you are talking about female friends. then any emotional wants excluding lust makes you needy.
4	Im an infp who does not get along with other infps	For a while i did not know why but now i think i know. Almost all yall sensitive as hell. I mean i am too but i have grown to not show i am and even laugh at myself and force myself not to sweat it. Also alot of infps think they are "deep" and i dont like it when people take things too seriously its kinda boring and seems self absorbed. Anyone else also feel this way?
9	Or maybe you hate us because we remind you of things you hate about you... 🤔 
1	I feel personally attacked right now.... 😂\nAre you sure you're infp? 
1	I agreee, especially the too sensitive part. I always test as infp but the f/t is always near 50-50 though so maybe that’s why?
1	INFPs find all sorts of ways to pride themselves on being unique and different, you simply chose yours by being the "anti-INFP INFP".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople are people, live and let live. Being bothered about others reflects your attitude towards yourself. We see the world not as it is, but as we are.
37	Crying and sex with my INFP boyfriend	We have deep, intimate conversations and if I cry because I am overcome with emotion about something (I am an INFP too), he will cry as well. He will hold and comfort me and then eventually start kissing me all over and then we have some of the best sex I've ever had in my life.\n\nSO! INFP guys I know you get a lot of flack for being sensitive and crying and such but you are hot and ideal boyfriends and lovers in many ways.\n\n
22	As an INFP man, I can honestly say I love deep conversations and intellectual intimacy more than physical intimacy.   If our minds and souls don't connect, then physical intimacy is nothing to me.  \n\nThank you for appreciating that.  It is hard to find people who do.  
8	Thank you.  It's really nice being appreciated. We are pretty damn rare (INFP Males). We're only found in about 1% of the population so well done for finding yours! Yes, the sex can be sensual and intense can't it? It's the empathy I think, we tend to know what people like, instinctively. Plus we can be pretty kinky, which is fun. 
6	How do we female hetero infp ladies find types that let us be emotional too?! I like emotions in my male partners too, but I find it's so hard to find hetero guys that are both strong AND like women with emotions. Is it mainly NFs?!?! They are so rare ahhh. 
4	Ha ha! A red piller would be so confused about this.
3	Not an INFP but I just want to say my INFP partner is just like this and... damn. Total game changer. Definitely ideal partners (at least for me) for sure. I have no idea how I got so lucky. INFP guys -- keep doing what you're doing.
3	Here's a poem I hope we all find something meaningful about	Never willing: Never taken.\nIndefinitely led in squalor and betrayed by opportunity;\nIrony claims her throne and leads a relentless brigade of consequence upon your very being.\nWhat was your premonition of being? \nSolace from the soulless? \nClear water under all the words you heard?\nIt wasn't and won't be.\nFalsetto tears lead me home, or maybe something close to it.\nNoiseless sobs to reverberate in my chest, muffled by the density of thoughts that were stuck in my lungs: there isn't a breath strong enough to pour my heart out. \nIt's not me who sobs or cries, but it's shallow cries of the remnants of yesteryears that straggled upon this vessel of change: begging to be home again. \nOr whatever that was.\nSomewhere out there, there is belonging and conjunct understanding amongst us all.\nSomewhere, possibly, is a feeling of home.
5	so is this a date?	The last couple years I’ve seen this college girl around town.... at the local library, and where I work because many college students worked there too..\n\nShe seemed like an interesting person, so I sent her a request on facebook..\n\nI said where I recognized her from, and asked how she’s been..\n\nShe replied kinda enthusiastically, saying what her major is, asked what i’m up studying, what i’m up to etc..\n\nI replied, then about a week later casually asked if she wanted to get coffee because it’s nice meeting likeminded people..\n\nshe agreed, does this sound like a date?\n\ndo i clearly need to specify if it’s a date or not? i feel like women typically want things defined instead of just going with the flow yeah?
3	This sounds like a date to me. We (as INFP) tend to feel the need to specify whether it's a romantic date or not. The thing is: you never know, because you don't know the person. You do know there's mutual interest in getting to know the other person and perhaps (probably) there is physical attraction.\nI think a first date is more like a prelude to dating. It's more like finding out if you want to date this person. \nGood luck, keep calm! 
133	My most recent painting.	
6	 This is like one of those days you have a headache, you go outside for the first time in two days, you haven't meditated for a while and everything is just blurry and it's oh so cuiet and depressing. Beautiful art. 
3	This is awesome. Very nice sense of color.
1	Is this oils? So shiny.
1	Wow, I feel like I'm in it... please keep painting. This is inspiring - you've captured the feeling of "being", simply "being". And I think that's something of great value.
664	My Life	
96	I fall in love with literally everyone in the world. So now I just waste 5 minutes for each person. I play a movie: “Me and [insert person]” mentally, say goodbye in my head, and try to forget the person.\n\nOkay, I’m joking a bit but it does happen on some days when I’m overly emotional lol.
40	Honestly, I'll take the 5 billion. I'll give 50% to the people I really care about and help them pay off debts, then I'll invest like 35% into something. The remaining 15% I'll just use to move far away from everyone to another country and live in peace, then save whatever is left for after all of my accomadations are met. 
31	Wouldn’t have it any other way
29	I'm offended but also acknowledge how completely accurate this is. 😤
23	Haha, I can just imagine thinkers seeing this and being like, "WTF".   \n\n\nBut i'm like, "yep" nodding at this meme. Ah, I love being an infp, I really do >.> 
50	Hmmmmmmm nah 5 bil please, could do a lot wit that shit. 
16	I feel seen.  The last decade or so of my life has been:  1 year relationship, 2 year relationship, (a month off), 3 year relationship, (a month off), 3 year relationship, (2 months off), 3 year relationship (currently in).  
9	Yup. That's right. 😅
9	At first I was like "What?? No, I wouldn't do that!"\n\nThen I thought about it and it's true. I'm just in denial lol
7	Or just that one person that talks to everyone on a social media app and never converses with anyone in real life and just slowly fades away in the background. \n\nBig oof
6	As much i want love I don’t want my time being wasted, I’ll take that 5 billion and redistribute it to the masses 😌
5	Could I restart life with my previous life experience?
7	I didn’t go on reddit this morning expecting to get dragged. 
10	I'll take the 5 billion. I can find people to fall in love with and waste my life with and also waste my 5 billion dollars on, all on my own.
4	Ain't that the truth xD
4	\*also never getting over them for the rest of my life
10	No. Literally anyone would accept 5 billion dollars. Don't even joke yourself.
3	Sorry but I’m def taking the 5 billion dollar door. :)\n\n
3	5 billion for me. 
6	Room 2, for sure.\n\nRestart life? -> Will end up in a even worse country than i have already been born in.\n\nRoom 3 is just reserved for INFPs\n\nTherefore Room #2. Most logical way + i might actually start enjoying life at this point.
2	Too accurate. Even 5 years is pushing it for me though.
2	As an intp I can relate. 
2	Wow, this is scary accurate.
2	You kidding?  The 5 billion.
2	Ahh the truth hurts! Because of my grand love endeavors, Ive pushed off going to school/finding a career for the past 10yrs or so. Lmao. At least I managed to move to another country and get a husband. But now I must figure out the rest of my life.
2	Hell nah I’d pick door 2 in a heartbeat 
2	This is the exact kinda shit I have a hard time explaining about myself to people when they catch onto what kind of person I am. If we've gone separate ways, I feel like I have to apologize and seek resolve if I ever want to move on. I appreciate our differences and am sorry it couldn't work out, but I really have to stress that I don't want for there to be any unnecessary grudges or hard feelings. Hell, I actually did exactly this earlier in the week.\n\nI think for us INFPs it feels a lot harder to let go of things than it is for others. But, at the same, time I think I go through the stages of "getting over it" rather quickly if I seek to make amends sooner than later.
1	mate, this is so true...can i upvote it a thousand time...
1	ME.
1	Door 2 please 
1	I'm familiar with that door fosho
1	I'd chose door one if I had the knowledge I have know when doing so. Otherwise, yeah, that about right.
1	Funny thing, I can never seem to fall in love with anyone. I might have a light crush or anything, but never fall in love... 
1	I just fell in love with a fellow INFP, what do?
1	I'll take the cash. It does not say the people from door 3 will love me back. Already been tricked into that, no thx
1	Holy shit, came here from r/all. Is this an INFP thing? That explains sooooo much.
1	I literally laughed so loud when I saw this... Why is it true? Hahah
1	I feel so understood.
1	The struggle lol
1	Painful but so true. Having a big heart is a blessing and curse. 
1	r/2infp4meirl
1	Gotta love INFP's. 
1	Option #2:\n\n\- start a business that requires a lot of employees - entire chain of production of vegan products - and buy out the competition and place them as subsidiaries under my company, while keeping the management of those companies intact\n\n\- arrange benefits for the workers, such as insurance, retirement plan, health benefits, etc\n\n\- expand and buy out other production chains while keeping the management, but implementing the aforementioned benefits\n\n\- in time, option #3 will emerge as a result of those benefits provided in the form of happy workers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRather have it that way than some fairy tale with no realistic human approach.
1	For me it's more like go through door number 2 and spend all the money on the people from door number 3
1	Money can't buy love and restarting your life means you have to relive all your past heartbreak. \n\n-INFPs probably

3	Here’s Bear my baby deer dog (he’s like 60\nLbs tho) [link](https://i.imgur.com/gplnoJQ.jpg) \n\nHe’s my soul mate and has been with me so long idk what life is without him, I can hardly sleep without him in the bed with me, it’s like my subconscious needs him there mushed up against my leg to feel safe enough to sleep zzzzzz

1	INFP Magnets for Over-Sharers?	
66	I like Reddit. It’s like Instagram but I don’t have to be social.	
9	Right? I finally got a good discussion going in another sub and after replying to a few, I was like, “I actually... don’t like this attention. I’m out.” Hahah 
6	Instagram is great if you have a relatively put together life and high self esteem/are relatively secure in who you are. If you're someone vulnerable to easily feeling resentment and jealousy like me it can be incredibly toxic. Reddit all the way!
5	Reddit is probably my favorite social media. Easily tailored to my interests (so it's a happy place!), more like the old internet (my mom, your co-workers, & granny from down the road isn't gonna see I like BDSM because I liked a post), and you can get pretty good discussions going that aren't all emojis.
3	but you could be if you wanted? or you could just be the person plotting as they read all the reddit sub reddits .. lol
1	Anonymous social media is the best social media
1	1st coffee date already ruined?	I’m meeting this girl next week for coffee...\n\nOver the past year I’ve recognized her around town, 2 weeks ago she accepted my facebook request so I sent her an email explaining how I knew of her..\n\nShe replied, told me what she’s studying in school...\n\nthen I followed up with asking if she wants to get coffee, that it’s “always nice to meet likeminded people”.\n\nI personally don’t know her well enough to decide if she’s a friend or someone I want to be in a serious relationship with..\n\nDo women usually prefer I don’t label this anything right from the start?... \nor is it better to clearly say if it’s\na date or not?\n\nI honestly don’t know where I stand with her yet...
1	You should wait and see how it goes. If you don’t know yet, that’s okay. It’s better to be honest with yourself about it than fake it and create expectations. 
3	Getting more introverted over the years	The first time I was introduced to MBTI was because of my school. They made me take the test and I got ENFP, didn’t think much of it. After that I took it a year later and I got INFP but like by a few percentages. Then this year I’ve retaken it multiple times and I’m like 82% introverted. I know the test can mistype you so I typed myself and I’m pretty sure I’m an INFP but I’m still conflicted on the intro versus extro. And yes I have seen the ENFP subreddit and I relate more to this one but I still find common ground. My dads an ENFP and we get along great. I just sometimes start to feel bad because I wonder if it’s bad that I’m more introverted now? 
1	Not good at learning languages?	Hello everyone, I'm just wandering if you feel the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I really don't like to learn languages, although INFPs should enjoy it. I love poetry and liturature but I hate grammar, I don't like to learn by heart and it is just so boring for me to learn a foreign language (and even my native - not english - grammar).
314	Wanted to share this nugget of loveliness for you INFPs	
8	It's a drop dead gorgeous view, but I keep having that dreadful feeling that I'm about to drop face-first into the water due to the angle of the shot.\n\nIt's probably just me.
3	purdy
3	Dude thats so cool
3	How beautiful
2	where is this??
2	Thank you :)\n
2	I love this! Makes you want to go where the stones take you.
2	Omg, I needed this.
2	Perfect ❤️
2	Oooh, a path!
2	This is so beautiful! I love being in nature
1	Ha! It is lovely down here. 
1	😍😍😍😍
114	Just think about it	
5	every darn time
5	Depression is how your soul processes regret. Anxiety is how your soul processes fear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn case anyone needed to hear that today.
3	weird... ENFP, why post this in INFP ?\n\nwhy not Post in INTJ too , lets see how it unfolds there
2	Yup, happens to me all the time.
2	i feel too much and then put myself in a bad mood
1	Achtung!
11	Lack compassion but hyper-empathetic???	I think I've hit a tipping point and it feels like it's eating away at my soul. Becoming bitter and resentful. \n\nMy partner is extremely neurotic. Has an anxiety disorder and is susceptible to depressive episodes. There are rational ways in which to go about tolerating it, though as time has passed and after being exposed to it consistently - it's become gradually more overwhelming.\n\nI find that I have to back off completely to feel like 'myself' again. I find myself subconsciously blaming her for how much I feel she's changing me. I feel like a selfish douche for even thinking those thoughts, as though she has control over her disorder.  I'm kinda ceebs going into deeper deets, but has anyone experienced something similar? 
2	I think I've been on both sides of that so yes. 
2	I get this, it’s kind of hypocritical because I have anxiety and I go thru times of depression. Where I just feel like absolute shite n pretty hopeless. But when it comes to other people I like to listen and be there for them but it comes to a point where I’m like “just cheer up” knowing that’s probs the worst kind of thing to think about a depressed person. But when I’m trying to have a good time n I just feel like someone is sulking just for the sake of it. It can grind ma gears, as you will never feel better if you don’t try to have a good time n face your fears. Even tho it can be very difficult and uncontrollable at times. 
2	I think it's totally normal and it sounds like [compassion fatigue](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Compassion_fatigue).
11	Why I'm thankful for MBTI	I have a tendency to ramble on, so I'll try to keep this concise.  \n\nFirst, MBTI has allowed me to begin on what I anticipate to be a lifelong journey of self discovery.  Learning about my cognitive functions has helped me understand my uniqueness and the way I think about things.  \n\nSecond, MBTI has allowed me to better understand other people.  Knowing that other people process information differently has allowed me to not question a person's maturity or motivation when we simply see things differently.   It has given me appreciation for people who previously only ticked me off.  It has given me confidence when others berated me for my feelings (thanks INTJs)\n\nOn a side note, all this makes me love music so much more.  It is equally structured/mathematical and feeling/passion.  Music is the great equalizer.   It allows all types to see things in it that appeal to them.  Music is truly beautiful.  \n\nThat is all.  Please discuss.  
1	100% with you on that. It does help explain why people do what they do, and it's helped me tremendously. 
9	Why do my friends fall in love with me	It doesn't matter if the friend is male or female, they always end up falling in love with me. Of course, I love them already, that is a given, because I love everybody. But then I'm put in an impossible position, and I end up losing that friend. \n\nFor instance last night. I'm on the couch with my best friend f/infj (I'm f/infp), we were chilling watching Netflix after an awesome day adventuring. I felt a wave of intense energy that I couldn't understand, being directed at me. My heart starts beating like the clappers, and I turn around and my friend is just full on staring at me with this look. All of a sudden she leans in and starts kissing me. I wasn't expecting it, but from experience I should have. I pushed her away and was still trying to deal with this crazy energy that made me feel high and ill at the same time. \n\nShe folded into herself and said that wasn't the reaction she expected. Then the energy she had sent out came back to her and she had to leave the room bc she felt ill.\n\nWe discussed the situation - I'm already in a committed relationship with m/enfj, which she knew. She said she doesn't want our friendship to end, and she will just keep her impulses suppressed but she can't change how she feels about me. \n\nI was sitting there thinking about my other real close friends and wondered if deep down they feel that way but just haven't acted on it. I thought about each one individually and or recent interactions and times spent with them and my phone started pinging out of the blue with texts coming in. \n\nIt was late and I had to drive home anyway so I left. When I got home I checked my phone and all 3 of my friends had texted me (I'm infp, I don't have many) and I was totally weirded out. Each one had said something about us as friends. "I'm thinking about you" "I miss you" "were we supposed to get together today" messages. What the hell, universe? What's going on? I really don't know what to do with this. 
7	I don't know if people love me, never seen someone show romantic interest to me \n
5	Did you post a particularly fine picture that day that got all of your orbiters thirsting?\n\nHaha, just kidding. That is weird, though. As an INTP, I don't know how to make head-or-tails of that.
3	Same... I can't have friends, they end up secretly or not so secretly being into me! But as karma, I am thwarted from the ones I want >.< 
3	It could be the emotional energy we put out as you mentioned in your post.  \n\nThat in itself is lacking for so many people they just ... crave it.\n\nI am in a weird situation myself wherr my wifes somewhat ex bestfriend may have wanted to emotionally cheat with me.  \n\nSo now Im Cringe alert on max and anti-social thrusters on full-back about it.  I feel for you friend, good luck.
3	I feel you. Although I am full of self-doubt, this happens to me all the time. I once had a talk with one of them and asked him why he fell for me and why my friends in general fall in love with me. He simply said "Because they feel relaxed around you. They know you will not judge them." I have this group of friends and I have been in bed with each and every one of them (I know it sounds strange, but we are all very open minded and it is actually very nice.) There is a number of people still in love with me after years. There are also periods when I attract almost everybody I meet (this is not falling in love though, it is just crazy sexy periods :P ). It's so weird for me, cause I generally dont think high of myself, but it seems people see something in me that I don't.
2	OP are you willing to share what your going to do moving forward about your friend?  
2	This happens ALL the time with me. I've lost friend after friend for this and it's becoming really exhausting. I've lost 3 friends in 2019 to this alone. The crazy shit is most of them knew beforehand that I wasn't interested but tried anyways + made things really uncomfortable. I know this sounds really harsh. I know people can't control their emotions and who they love but all of my opportunities for having healthy friendships are failing because of the "I don't like you in that way - just as a friend" conversation thus ruining the entire emotional dynamic. 
2	Yeah, this happens with many of my male friends, which is why I don’t have any who I am really close to. Like someone else commented, I think it has a lot to do with that people feel very comfortable around me 
3	Can an INFP be FWB???	I'm a pretty textbook INFP, though I have gotten INFJ on a test before. \n\nI was recently propositioned by a former lover to be "friends with benefits". We have amazing chemistry, and when we were "together" before for about 3 months, there was a very confusing cycle of getting really emotionally close and then him freaking out and backing off quite a bit. I spent a lot of time overthinking this not-even-a-relationship. \n\nWhat I really want is a soul-deep connection with someone who shares my values and can be more stable than that. (That's where my MBTI type comes in.) I don't want to be in a relationship with him again, I know for sure. I am on a couple of dating sites, and I intend to continue to look for what I want. \n\nWe tested the waters, as I was somewhat convinced that our chemistry had a lot to do with our emotional connection, but...we don't have that now, and let's just say it went REALLY WELL. \n\nThis is unchartered territory for me, and I'm wondering how long I'll last before I decide it's too much of a stretch for my moral compass. How many interactions can we have where I refrain from asking deep, probing questions and ruin the whole thing anyway? 😂 That being said, I'm sort of proud of the small number of sexual partners I've had in my life, so that makes this FWB situation more attractive to me.\n\nWhat do y'all think? Would you be able to do it?
3	Mhhh dunno. IME someone ends up catching feelings in this sort of arrangement. And personally I would not do it with an ex but if you feel like you can do it then go ahead haha.
3	I've done it successfully.  It worked for me because I genuinely wasn't interested in a real relationship with the person and knew I never would be, and I also knew that I was moving so there was an end date to it.  But I feel like I'm very unique as a woman and as an INFP in that (before right now, I'm currently in a committed long term relationship with someone I live with lol) I have been really happy to exist single and exploring multiple people at a time and not wanting to commit for periods of time too.  So it really just depends, and being true to yourself and how you feel is really important but knowing your boundaries and how your heart will feel in the long run too.  
2	Yes, an info can fwb but in my opinion it depends more on your attachment style than personality. For example, I'm avoidant attachment with a lingering childhood attachment disorder - where too much emotional intimacy repels me, safe relationships = sabotage.  Fwb is a comfortable way to dabble in sexuality and intimacy without pushing me out of my comfort level. It's a way to practice intimacy. It's not easy. No type of relationship is easy , however. Individuals with healthy secure attachments might not be good candidates for fwb relationships.
1	Yes, it's 100% possible but it is usually a surprise like a one night stand that ends up being a really good sexual companion. It can't start off as friends or wanting to be in a relationship and then grow into FWB. That is a disaster waiting to happen. \n\nI am in an emotional drought so FWB is fine with me at this point in time. No commitments. No hurt feelings. This is coming from an INFP girl, shocking I know. \n\nIt depends on where you are emotionally and the other party. As long as you're willing to communicate fully, it should be fine. 
3	Suspected INFP WITH A CRUSH	I would love your advice. \n\nRecently, I've been stuck in a situation where I think my crush both likes me and is an INFP. I've been exposed to quite alot of INFPs and I understand the specific vibe they give off, so I'm convinced my crush is an INFP. \n\nMoving on to thier behaviour: \n\n1) Awkward silences- Used to be quite chatty and then suddenly became quite awkward in convo. Don't know if its because they genuinely are not intrested in talking to me or .... Convo with them seem more awkward than usual. \n\n2) Staring- began catching my INFP staring at me at odd times. Usually, when I was alone, the staring would be more pronounced. While, this has slightly decreased recently, it is still a thing that I notice they do. I may also be imagining this but the infp looks at me in a certain type of way, that  feels intense. But i may be projecting.\n\n3) Mirroring - INFP mirrors my behaviour quite alot.  Infp copies the way I greet, if I make an facial reactions, will imitate that and so on. \n\n4) Greets me quite alot but does no attempt to make conversation and go out of thier way to be my friend.  \n\n
5	Maybey Throw hints... talk about a made up "friend" you know that has a crush on someone.  And ask if he can help you with the details or give you insight about it.  His replies will be very telling. \n\nThis way you can at least get a better understanding of how he sees the topic of crushing to give you more clarity without it being directly about him and you can maintain the status quo.
3	It's possible he lilkes you. Did he tries to helpyou more than others ? Did he compliments you when he can ? 
3	Kinda relates to this,I tried to remain normal and refrained from getting a crush on someone but damn ,got helpless against her charm and began to show that behavior😢
3	Maybe you could...\n\n*~~Drumroll!~~*\n\nJust ask, he's your crush, right? Quickest way to get an answer to your question is to just ask him out when the two of you share a private moment together. You'll know quite quickly if he likes you back or not, I can guarentee that.
27	Imagine having someone to really connect with	
23	Avoid keeping that connection in your imagination. Connect with the actual person before you,  not the fantasy version in your head. \n\nIt might not be what you wish, but it's real.\n\n
9	The benefits of a great imagination 
4	If people don’t want to connect with you, is it a connect-shun?
2	Funny joke
2	Do other INFP's never find people they really and truly connect with? I personally have usually had at least one person at a time who I truly connected to, and all my close relationships tend to be very intense. Right now I don't really have this due to moving recently and then getting really sick after moving, and it makes me very sad and alone not to. And I do usually feel misunderstood and alone on some level.
2	I am a 25 year old female and I have been with 35 people (mostly men but also some women). I have connected with few of them in different levels. But there was one, that made me feel like I was in touch with another dimension. I can't even put in words how I felt when I was with him. If he touched me anywhere, I would feel a huge wave of warmth and energy flowing through me. Sex was like being in touch with the universe's deepest mysteries. I closed my eyes and I would forget where I was. Those were hours of absolute calmness and gratitude. I felt complete. We were together for a short period and then it didn't work out. I am still searching for a connection like that, but it seems it happens one in a million and I probably should feel lucky I have experienced it.
3	Intimacy is terrifying so I'll pass on that for now
1	Oh. Connect as in share your deepest thoughts with and them reciprocate with a conversation that flows? Yeah, dreamy. 
1	it will happen when u allow yourself to ground your imagination in reality! allow people to be imperfect and connect through your admiration of how they overcome their flaws, how they relate to you. your imaginary person u wish to connect with is out there, you just have to meet them halfway!!!! good luck !!! :)) 
0	Ha! I only connect with people not-interested in me (romantically)
9	For my fellow dreamers	You must not come to the dark conclusion that everything in the world is hard, false, and wicked. The forest likes you. In its company you will find health and good spirits again, and entertain more lofty and beautiful thoughts.
3	INFP's believe the world is dark and wicked? I went through this phase when I was younger, but now I love just about everyone in the world.
1	Which forest are you referring to? Definitely not any wild forest in Canada. They hate us with a passion. Humans are a scourge to them, chopping down vast swathes of forest to clean tar sands for oil, polluting the groundwater they drink with the tailings. \nBut can we do anything to stop it? No. So we love and live and look for beauty and share knowledge and spread peace. 
2	I don't know how to 'just stop'. (Any and all advice welcome!)	Completely new to this, so I'm sorry if there have been lots of posts about this before! But whatever I'm doing I just can't seem to stop: thinking, feeling, doing, thinking of doing and thinking and feeling and how I feel about everything in all that I do. \n\nI recently entered my therapy masters and whilst I'm enjoying it immensely, it consumes a lot of my emotional energy. I also work in the care sector for teenagers and also mentally ill adults, so this contributes. But I couldn't see myself enjoying any other line of work authentically. My partner also has mental health problems and I a history of depression in my teens, and I am trying to be there and sensitive to them as much as possible. But it all becomes too much sometimes and then I am told I am not doing enough to support their emotional needs. \n\nI've been told that I'm an empath and I do believe that, but I am finding all of these emotional demands upon me very difficult to manage and any alone time I manage to grasp I almost don't know what to do with myself. And I then feel selfish for any time spent on myself. \n\nThere is no time to stop, and even when there is, there are things in the household that need to be done, or problems in the family to sort out. And if I don't help with these I am lazy or being self-centred. \n\nAre there any infps out there with similar issues? Or any people that could give any insight over what I can do in this situation? \n\n
1	Meditate. Its boring but the aim of Meditation is to find peace between Emotions. At the start you are not used to it and dont value it. \nIf you get used to it, it is like entering a room in the clouds, without any sounds. Just Silence.
1	I’m not sure if this is an INFx thing, but I’m sure this is common among a few other types as well.\n\nSelf-care is pretty important to help you de-stress, unwind and recharge. You’re taking on a lot. It would seem like a lot of people are unloading their emotional baggage on to you, but how do you unload all of that? Are you able to talk to your partner about it? Or a trusted friend? Do you have a therapist? Would you ever consider it? \n\nLike another commentator mentioned, meditation might help you to just observe your emotions, but not let them overwhelm you. If this seems a bit woo-woo, I would just give it a shot for 10 days and see how you feel. Try the free trial of the Headspace app!\n\nIn terms of feeling over extended, I feel like that’s something a lot of healthcare professionals and mothers would relate to. I know I have.  It’s even more important to care for yourself, and to learn not to feel guilty about it. Sometimes you have to take care of yourself to better be able to take care of other people. \n\nWhen you’re on an airplane, there’s a reason you’re told to put the oxygen mask on yourself before anyone else.\n\nIt’s important to recognize when/ if things are getting overwhelming and do something, before things spiral into depression or anxiety. When things get to be a bit much, I learned to deal with it by: exercising (20 minutes of cardio clears my head), getting enough sleep, taking a long, hot shower, having some skincare/ soothing ritual, doing something to take my mind off things like seeing a movie or catching up with friends, going to the bookstore, the museum, a trip somewhere else, cooking myself a nice meal, enjoying a luxurious coffee, and listening to music. \n\nHope some of that was helpful!\n
1	Are you guys always sure about what you’re feeling? Or is that more an INFJ thing?	
4	I cant speak for all INFP's, but for me yes. I'm always quite sure about what the emotions I'm having are. I know quite well I'm experiencing happiness, sadness, or anger when I feel it (and man do I feel it). Now knowing WHY I feel these emotions and what causes them is a different matter. It's often hard to rationalize something as irrational as emotions, especially if the emotion seems misplaced or inappropriate for what you should be feeling. That I struggle with. 
1	For the record, most of us INFJ's almost never know what we're feeling until it runs us over like a freight train 👍 
1	I pay attention to my feelings but I don’t always know what they are. If you asked me to describe my current state of feeling I’d struggle to come up with a word. It’s like... I know that it’s there until I look directly at it, and then it’s gone. Unless it was a strong emotion, and then I know what it is. But if it’s just everyday, nothing much is happening right now, then no.\n\nI also have no idea what my opinions are half the time and end up with conflicting ones.
14	Anyone else with ADHD here?	I feel like a lot of the qualities described as being typical of INFPs are also symptoms of ADHD, which leads me to wonder how many others there are of our MB type that also have ADHD like myself.
3	I have ADD. Not really treated though.
3	yeah inattentive type. its also scientifically proven that INFPs have a higher prevalence of ADHD. not surprising haha.
1	Yep. Inattentive type.
1	I have ADHD, as well but I think the attention deficient part is more prominent due to the thinking part of the personality
1	Yep, I’ve got ADD. I’m sure a lot of us have it.
1	Yep. 
1	ADD here too
1	Yep, ADHD, along with a lot of the rest of my family
4	This Was Taken By My Old Elemantry School, I Thought You Guys Might Like It... ツ	
1	So there was this mattress beside the school? Hmmmm not suspicious at all.
13	is this frowned upon?	is it frowned upon to be 30 and still living in the town you grew up in,\nstill living under your parents?\n\nam i seen as less competent?\n\ni work, but it’s nothing substantial at the moment... I’ve just lived an unconventional life.
9	This is more common than you think, there's a lot of 30 year olds out there crippled by their student loans living at home because of slow income growth in their new careers.
3	I'm in the same boat as you my friend
2	frowned upon by who? Other people? \nIt doesn't matter what other people think in your life they're extras \n\n\nHow has your life been unconventional?
2	My honest thoughts are 15-20 years ago yeah, that would be kinda like... what's up with that.  But right now look how shit everything is, you know what I mean?  Our generation got super screwed, so don't feel bad about it.  The only reason I'm living 'on my own' is cause I'm with my partner and he makes a lot more than I do :( I can barely financially survive independently.  Most people our age can't.  We just got fucked over by the system and it wasn't our fault.  I was pushed to go to college and told the debts would be easy to pay off and promised there'd be jobs out there..... but I've been underemployed since graduating and haven't been able to start paying off my loans.  Rent, food, healthcare.... if you can eliminate some of that by living at home why wouldn't you?
1	It's common, but not super healthy IMO. I think it's important for INFPs to strike out on their own.
1	Snap. It’s probably frowned upon by most people but I’m proud thus far I haven’t lived a conventional life. I’ve lived in my country’s capital city twice, lived abroad for a year and a half stint, lived with long-term partners, worked various jobs, acquired a cat and I’m 26. None of these are monumental accomplishments per se and I’ve found myself living with my parents in my hometown which I have hated for so long for four months now. \n\nI was deeply ashamed to be in this situation. But I accepted the situation as part of my life. I’m starting to appreciate the area and know based on my past experiences this is NOT permanent. So, rather than preoccupying your thoughts with what others think, focus on you. Don’t associate negativity with your circumstances and the rest will flow. \n
2	INFPs at Festivals?	I’ve agreed to go to a music festival with 2 friends this summer, but I’m not sure if it’s for me. Have any of you ever gone to one? Please share your experiences! \n\nI’m exited to see different bands/artists play and to be free for a few days to just wander around and explore. But the idea of being surrounded by a big number of people for 3 days and 3 nights straight makes me feel anxious. I can’t quite picture sleeping in a tent surrounded by people drunk/on drugs for three nights. It seems overwhelming? I quite like to be in those situations, it is exiting but I also like to get away from them and go home lol. \n\n\nFor you Brits, the festival is Y Not, I’d rather go to something like Green Man but it’s way more expensive. Y Not is very indie/alternative rock focused, which is fine, I like a lot of the bands that are playing. But it doesn’t seem to have the chill/more folky vibes of other festivals. \n
2	I've usually found festivals to be a little bit overwhelming, but I think you should be okay if you're with trusted friends. Enjoy :)
3	Emotional rollercoaster or a steady comfort? Which life would you pick?	Do you think most INFP’s would rather live a passionate life full of intoxicating highs and crippling lows or a more steady, predictable life?\n\nThoughts?
4	Infp definitely craves passion and excitement, but not in a Se way. Se is all about direct experience, straightfoward and "feels good". \n\nWhereas what I crave is more creative, otherworldly, unimaginable. Ideas, possibilities, art, new ways to live, new planets, new concepts etc. And Fi needs A LOT of intensity to feel good. Most of us are self destructive, because our Fi is not being stimulated enough.  
3	I for one would much rather highs and lows.  The good times make it all worth it.  I find that I remember the highs long after I forget the lows. \n\nThat being said, I prefer manageable lows.  
2	One hundred percent high highs and low lows. The steady, predictable life would be a low in itself to me, and at least with the other one I get highs as well
2	Fuck. I would choose comfort. My life has been filled with highs and lows but mostly lows. I just want something to anchor myself to. I want some stability. I don't want to constantly feel like the carpet is being pulled from under my feet. 
5	Hating social media and tinder/bumble/etc. makes dating tough for a 30-something, working INFP	I got rid of facebook a year ago and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Got rid of tinder and okcupid too. Got rid of pretty much everything except reddit. I thought it was just socializing, but it negatively effected my life so drastically and I immediately noticed the improvement once it was gone. The dating apps just never went anywhere and felt like homework assignments from hell.\n\nThat being said, I have a problem some of you probably identify with. I hate the "infancy" phase of almost any type of relationship. I hate the build-up to being friends with someone. I hate introducing myself to people in the wild. Flirting is a lot of fun, but I hate the first/second/third date phase of the dating scene, too. Its especially disappointing when its like the last guy I saw, where the first date was incredible and it went downhill fast (he was really clingy and it kinda freaked me out. Like, showing up to my house unannounced after the second date clingy). I also am WAY too tired to go do anything after work, and sometimes even on weekends with how high-stress my job can be. Its gotten to the point that I'm considering proposing 4/10s to my bosses instead of 5/8s to artificially give myself more time to get introvert recharging done.\n\nCan any older INFPs, or heck even younger INFPs, identify with this? Do I sound kinda petty/lazy at all or does what I'm saying make sense?
6	Oh my... I tell you, if we knew the solution, we probably would be here! (JK, we’re INFP, we’d still be here for the chat 😅) \nI have the exact same problem. \nI have no time to date,  I can’t stand the small talk, and I use my weekends to recharge my introvert batteries ready for another week at work. \nThe reality is, you’ve gotta go through those few few months in a relationship to get to the good part. \nFor myself, I’ve been single coming up three years now. The dating I have done hasn’t worked out because either I’ve appeared too disinterested in the other person or I’ve held back because I didn’t want to get hurt. I’ve taken to being up front and saying: look, I hate small talk but I take a long time to get to know properly so if you’re not interested in hanging around to navigate that then l’m not the person for you. \n\n\nI do try to meet people by *gasp* going out with a friend to meet up with others. Generally I don’t want to, but it does get harder to meet people to older you get. \nWhen you figure out how to meet people, let me know 😅
3	I can relate to this so much.  I feel ready to try and find some sort of relationship but really have no clue.  Sorry I can’t help but I would love to follow just to see some of the replies 
3	Ugh I had same issue. 30f. \n\nI would make myself do at least a couple social things I liked. I used the app Meetup, to find like minded people. \n\nI thought I would probably have to meet someone in "the line of duty" , eg: volunteering, non-profit work, etc.\n\nEnded up reconnecting with someone online via a dating site specifically for non-profit religious workers. Lmao what a weird way, but wow hes amazing.\n\nI hated bumble/cmb/hinge because finding someone who was not just horribly boring/unaware/30-something-fuckboys seemed like a joke. A sick joke I tell you.\n\nIf I hadn't met my current bf the way I did, I honestly would have no idea. I would just continue to throw myself into the lifestyle I love and pray to meet someone equally as passionate or interested in it.\n\nBest of luck to you!!! Maybe you'll find him doing the same things you love\n
7	Internal monologues	Ever have those moments where you realize you experience the world differently than others? I had one of those recently, and am interested if any of you have either heard of or can relate to this.\n\nMost people have an internal monologue. A song can be playing inside your head, or a thought is mentally "spoken" via your inner voice (as a side note, "The phenomena of inner experience" is a really interesting paper about how the inner voice differs too!).\n\nAfter talking with a few different people about it, I found out that it's not normal to have multiple inner monologues going on simultaneously. I can, for example, play a song and have a voice talk about the song and have a different voice talk about how I'm talking about the song, so that I have three distinct thoughts being expressed at the same time. This isn't going on all the time-consuming I usually only have one going on. Three and above takes concerted effort. Everyone I've talked to can only do one, while I've gone to the 5th degree (I can't sustain it long, but I have been able to do it a couple times).\n\nHow are your inner experiences?
3	For me I usually have a song going through my head almost all the time and a random unrelated inner monologue that jumps from subject to subject, and I'm also picturing something in mind that is either related to the song or the monologue. I have to picture things in my mind consistently to help me retain information, it's kind of like a never ending movie that would make very little sense to anyone else. 
2	Idk about simultaneously, but a sometimes my internal monologue ends up being a conversation between about 4 voices, 3 different opinions and one asking the questions in the first place. This is usually something I can only do when I'm laying in my bed, or generally by myself. I also notice that occasionally one of them is "louder" than the others and I sometimes end up mouthing or whispering whatever they're "yelling". They do sometimes overlap but usually I'm careful not to, so that its easier for me to understand.
1	I think very visually so typically I will have one monologue that expresses how I feel, asks questions, etc, and anything else that's associated with what I'm thinking about or that happens to be weighing on my conscious will express itself in images and colors and shapes.\n\nFor example as I'm trying to think of how to word this post I am saying the words in my head and I also have a visual of myself sitting in a room alone deep in thought (I guess cause I'm analyzing my thought process), an image of what I imagine OP to look like (cartoon lady with blonde hair), as well as detailed images of fish and my neighbors because I'm also listening to the conversation between my brother and my mom going on right now about my neighbor's aquarium, etc. As I choose my words each one has a color and shape that expresses it's weight and meaning. If I decide I don't like a sentence or I am unsure about it, it will respond visually by rearranging itself in my head or it will stuff itself in a box (like literally the words will be stuffed in a cardboard box and shoved into the corner of my mind's attic) to be held onto while I think of other colors and shapes (words and phrases) that will match better.\n\nBut to simply answer the question I typically only have one monologue in my head at one time. I could easily conjure up an imaginary shouting match between multiple people if I try, but it would be unclear and dream like, with voices speaking but not coherently.

22	20yo male INFP- A talk about life and society	I always feel like I’m constantly ignored. Like people aren’t listening to what I’m saying or that they’re trying not to pay attention to me. Is it because I don’t talk a lot? Am I boring? I always feel like I’m in this mental competition to try to present myself as a “man” so I get more respect, since I was the victim to homophobic and sexist bullying. And of course, for being a shy, quiet, virgin. I even sometimes feel like people are watching me as well.  Like if I don’t belong, or if I’m some sort of odd creature. I’ve always wondered if it is because I am black or because there is something inherent about me or my INFPness, and I want to know if these feelings and experiences are common. \n\nI also am tired of this consumerist/capitalist society. It seems that all people talk about is brands, corporations, money, and capitalist industry sometimes. We treat each other like commodities and only view each other in the lease of a commodity. Everyone’s willing to step on someone else for a couple dollars. Society worships these ultra billionaires and people with money, failing to realize that they’re just wealth hoarders and that they receive no benefit, and for the most part, it’s impossible to be like them.  My mom was watching Million Dollar Listing-LA the other day and all she could do talk about how much money they were making and had, and it was odd to watch. She herself, isn’t entirely doing the best, psychologically wise, either. \n\nI just want people to connect beyond market value, and to be more in touch with their emotions and the nature that surrounds them. Capitalist industry doesn’t care about anyone, we need to stop letting it control our lives. Meditation and connecting with nature and a “force” is important. A people’s revolution is important. Charity and kindness is important. Love is important. \n\nI also am sorry if I sound /r/iamverysmart but I feel like an alien on this world, observing its behavior. People are so bizarre in a way that’s odd and I don’t know. Does anyone else get these feelings? Can we discuss? I’d love to hear other thoughts and opinions. \n\n
8	I can relate an awful lot to what you're saying. I don't like having to act manly, that's not the fun kind of acting. I feel so out of place around stereotypical guys, or like I'm being judged or sized-up as competition and it's so petty.\nAnd I hate the way life is degraded by capitalism. It seems like a lot of people are really just concerned with chasing the next hot thing, the one commodity that's going to make their life better and more convenient even though none of the past ones have - people are just as miserable as before we had kuerigs, smartphones, and 4k tvs.\n\nFind people who don't care about that stuff. They exist... somewhere. People who value real relationships and real life, who don't judge you according to how well you fit one or another stereotype.\n\nIt's not just you, it *is* society. You're not crazy, you're very sane for feeling the way that you do. Us being made feel weak, powerless, and alien is one of the ways the status quo maintains itself. This is especially true with regards to mental health, which is always treated as a personal issue lest we critique the society we inhabit.
3	Sorry I dont have time to read it all. \n\nYou're always going to feel like an outsider. People will never live in your world. I am a 23 year old Male and my only advice to you would be to try an lower your expectations. \n\nIf you are setting the bar super high then others will never live up to that. Try to work on your extraverted feeling, its tough but is helpful if you want others to come to you. 
1	Thank you for sharing your story. I have some advice if you want. If not please ignore the rest.\n\n1) If people ignore your words, it may just mean they are inconsiderate and not that you are uninteresting. If your speaking presentation _is_ something you want to improve though, there are probably materials online you can research to improve it. There is nothing wrong to want to strengthen your weak points.\n\n2) It makes sense to not want to surround yourself around materialistic people. It may be you just need to find your tribe. There are a lot of selfless people out there that are into volunteering, advocacy, bettering the community, nonprofit work, etc. There will of course be greedy people out there, but there are selfless people too. I think it is important to realize that everyone has different values and their values are going to likely differ from yours, but we all have our purpose on this planet, even the money obsesses ones. What is important is we each follow our own path and fulfill our own purpose in this world.
1	I will tell you something, i am too busting my head because of those things but kinda now as im going trough some rough times i understood that you cant show others what you mean, me, you anyone, if they dont want to understand it, if something is deeply rooted in them.  \nSo the best option is for you to be healthy and understand yourself and your needs, yes, you might feel lonely and like an alien at times, but hell..that is life.  \nI have spent 4 months a time without talk with human being, except that talk with cashier - "Thank you, bye."  \nAnd also, people just love ideas of each other now, some kind of image they made in their heads that shows someone that shits gold and can fly probably. So as i think about you now and things you wrote, the fact how much i find myself in them, maybe my good man, this world wasnt made for everyone and it needs people who will change the pattern, who will be aliens and observers
1	As an INFP i agree with these all. Yesterday, i shared a topic(not here) about the feeling stranger to this system. Alienlike feeling. "Even I'm trying to adapt every environment, I do not belong none of all. This feeling is becoming bigger and stronger, every each day. I think, I'm an alien in this cruel world."

21	I just want a INFP best friend who I understand and also understands me	I actually have no friends besides my boyfriend and the friends that I do have are actually just acquaintances who I can’t hold a conversation with for more than 5 minutes. Help\n\nEdit: having no friends is hurting me and it’s making me become shamefully dependent on my boyfriend to the point where I do nothing I wait for him to start doing anything about myself and my life. I feel bad for him and I know it’s an unattractive look but it’s just so hard to make real friends..
5	I think we INFPs are much pickier than the average person when it comes to friendship. Many people, especially the extroverts I know, consider anyone they've known for more than 5 minutes to be a friend. We seem to be satisfied if we can have 1 or 2 real friends, although other people think we're too reclusive.\n\nWhat about your boyfriend? Is he also BFF material? What about other family members? I think some of us forget that we can be friends with the people we love. My husband (INTJ) is my best friend, I'm his best friend, and we've decided that the world will never understand our relationship. I'm also best friends with my mother and father (I grew up an only child), which some people find really bizarre. \n\nI went through long patches where I had no real friends, aside from my parents, and you just can't have certain conversations with your parents. It's tough. Keep looking, and eventually you'll find someone who's been looking just as hard for someone like you.\n\n&#x200B;
5	Just wanted to say, I feel for ya. I've been spoiled. I've been friends with the same guy since kindergarten whose also an INFP. We're 25 now and still live down the street from each other. We hangout, and record music, and write sketches. It's basically awesome. \n\nAlthough, unlike you, I've never been in a long term relationship with anyone. It's just never worked out. I envy you in that regard and understand your search for meaningful friendship/relationship. \n\nMeeting new people is hard. Do you think it's possible you have a good friend, but they simply don't meet your expectation for what a friend should be? \n\nI know in my life, I've had to dial it down a bit when it comes making new friends. For instance, I talk to the same guy everyday at work about all parts of our life. It feels like we're good friends, but some days he's in a bad mood, or has something going on in his personal life and just blows me off, doesn't even look at me, which at first hurt, but then I realized that's life. That's what our friendship is. We're just two guys who work together and shoot the shit sometimes on our breaks. If all we ever do is shoot the shit on our breaks, I'm grateful to have that experience and share life with him in that way. \n\nIt's unrealistic for me to think that we're really good friends who are gonna hangout outside of work and go on adventures. You know what I mean? \n\nDo you have any siblings you're close to? They'd probably be your best bet for instant friendship, but something tells me if you did you wouldn't have made this post. \n\nWhat do you mean by "real friends"? What makes someone a real friend to you? \n\nI think a good place to start would be more honest with the "friends" you currently have. It's amazing what happens when you make yourself vulnerable. Tell them you consider them a good friend. Ask about group dates with them and their SO and your boyfriend. \n\nI don't know man. It's hard and if there was any easy answer you wouldn't have to ask in the first place. 
3	Would it be a wild idea to suggest we make a discord server for us INFPs, get to know one another, chat adventures, and be friends?\n\nDoes one already exist?
3	We live in the age of information. You more than likely don't have friends because you haven't developed the tools yet to overcome typical INFP social issues. All of that can be eliminated. You have to want it. I went from years of depression to riveting with happiness every day I wake up. Starting researching how to overcome these weaknesses. I guarantee you it can be done. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm under the impression that INFPs can be the most charismatic people on this planet. We are gifted caretakers. We can provide warmth like no other. All we have to do is bust down anxiety and develop confidence. I do that daily. Each day it gets better and i'm more than ever hopeful for the future. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe the person you want to be. You can do it.
3	why is everyone telling their p.o.v. lol let's be friends instead hello
2	I feel you. I have my boyfriend, who I live with, and one "best friend", I guess you could say. Weve been friends forever, but I dont feel a deep authentic connection with her because shes very facebook fake. As in, complaining about her other friends and then posting loads of selfies on Facebook with #blessed and #besties. I absolutely hate that, and it makes me wonder if she also talks about me behind my back. Im not friends with any of her other friends. I do have a couple of friends, from elementary school and work who i can go nearly a year without talking to, so they are mostly cool people i just know. Ive disabled my facebook app and dont do any other social media besides reddit and good reads, so its mainly my wonderful bf and my dog. I do talk to my sister occasionally, but shes a mom and too infp hermitty herself. 
2	I have 3 real friends irl who I really like and thats it. I got some casual friends who I can talk to though. But 3 friends is enough for me :)
4	Does something need to be observed to exist?	What counts as an observer?\n\nWhat counts as existing?\n\nAnd before this is brought up please know that the double slit experiment can run autonomously.
2	Hmm. The term "exist" seems a bit foggy, but if it were to be defined, it would be defined within our subjective experience or our little bubble.  And what is called "objective" could be like the consensus between subjective points or bubbles. But, the bedrock could be consciousness as opposed to this objective reality construct that exists outside of us. \n\nI mean, I understand that view, in some sense. Like, when we talk about whether or not something is happening in our experience eg. seeing a red ball, we're imagining it within our consciousness / awareness or whatever you want to call it. But in, like, the absence of such, nothing can be said (but I'm assuming such through being in bubble of consciousness), because there is no sayer at that moment that is aware of said things. And the degrees in-between after some level, we have things like hypnagogia and hallucinatory experiences, which could be like a state of uncertainty / wavering or calibrating of consciousness at some level. And right when consciousness / awareness / whatever is regained at a level  after a lapse in ourselves, it snaps back, giving us what appears to be continuity between the lapses via memory. \n\nAnd if someone were to tinker with our consciousness which some will say originate within the human brain (but the brain is within our consciousness as per mention) or some other similar structure, we, the "tinkered" won't be able to say anything regarding it as that consciousness point has been blotched out, but it's like happening through consciousness of said person doing the tinkering, but the person doing the tinkering, if tinkered too, will end up like the person they previously tinkered which is all within my consciousness at this moment of typing this, and like, whoever reads this will be adding an expanding bubble container of consciousness to contain everything else said in this scenario, and continual expansion following that beyond that point.  \n\nIt seems all interlaced in this consciousness interface, and without it, it does seem like "nothing", but, it's like an undetermined state of sorts. \n\nI used to think that what we observe was independent from us, but it just seems to go down the road of nonduality or something, which leads to a doubt or questioning of the self itself. But if that were the case, like, would there even be a "subjective", as it must be contrasted with something for it to be (in this case the "objective"); which bleeds into this idea of everything being "one" and all is consciousness or something. \n\nI actually want to churn my way through this, for this has been on my mind for quite a while as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	Does anyone actually believe that they'll survive getting hit by a train if they don't look at it?
1	I believe that anything that exists it is because it IS, regardless of whether it is observed or not.  
1	I do.
7	Validation seeking	Went on a trip to [the nearest seashore to my home.. a 300 km trip](https://i.imgur.com/WDj1anx.jpg).. on my own.. just to think clearly and kinda look at the sea and breathe its air.. never took a trip on my own. Also good thing is I forgot my headphones, also tried not to look at facebook, failed a couple of times.. but tried to isolate myself and just think.\n\nI think a good part of my anxiety, self hate & doubt, lack of confidence, chronic procrastination etc. Come from me trying to seek validation constantly.\n\nI cannot think of a time I wasn't seeking validation and trying to get accepted and be loved. As long as I remember, I have always been trying.. I've always been "smart" but never did well at school, not my grades I always had very good grades, but performance throughout the year, I've *always* passed my years by studying literally at the last possible time before exams, always did well, went to engineering college, never been able to make friends or socialize, hated it.. spent 7 years failing in it (I'm foreign, things may seem different to you because of that), now I'm dropping out and going to literature school.\n\nAll these years, I've been trying to prove to my dad that I worth any thing, he is always disappointed :'( here in my country not being college educated is like being a second class citizen, ok I've never wanted engineering, I always showed interest in art, design, animation, but never engineering!\n\nNow I work in an animation company, as an animator, I've always wanted this and thank god, it's happening, but I am struggling to enjoy it.\n\nThe trauma of being constantly talked down to, by your own parents, being in always fighting state, when we are not fighting, they are just trying to be nice to convince me to go to college, btw Ive always tried, but never succeeded to attend and study. This trauma has shaped me into what I'm now, self loathing person with zero confidence.\n\nAlthough I'm pretty good at my job, It've been 8 months since I started and my directors love me and my work and are friends with me and everything is great, I'm learning, I bought my first car, started losing weight, started to go swimming again. But again, I'm still depressed as fuck, I'm not doing half what I can do, I sleep too much, rarely talk to my family, which is also very depressing.\n\nMy parents love me, I *know* that, they always tell me that, their compassion is very clear, their motives are understandable, they've given up already about the college thing and what not. But the damage has happened already.\n\nLast straw that made me feel like there is something that needs to change, this girl at work that I liked, actually I still like her, I can't stop thinking about her, I see her everywhere while walking in the street as if I'm following here. I just asked her out couple of weeks ago, she said no, I thought she gave me enough hints, I trusted my guts but my guts failed me, she was a month away from a break up just before marriage when I asked her out, but I think she said no firmly and clearly and mentioned how I'm a good person and friend, so it's not an impulsive no, and it's not a "I'm not searching for relationships now" no, it's a no to me.. for the first time in my life I started to feel ugly, started to be hyper aware of my humor, my actions and behaviour, feel like I need to be more desirable to ask anyone else..\n\n\nI think she's very smart, I think she saw how insecure and non-confident I am, and she thought this would not be a healthy relationship. Good for her actually.\n\nAny way, I think it's time to stop seeking validation, I'm who I am, with the good and the bad, my parents did what they could for me and that's more than enough I'm grateful, I'm sorry they're disappointed, but I can't do anything about that.. so it is what it is..\n\nSorry for the wall of text, just needed to vent.
1	I feel ya, *hugs* oh how i can relate
23	For those who struggle with life/deppression	Life is a game on time. Just wait til the end. \nDont die before you are dead. Its just a matter of time. I made an interesting experience when i was 18. I went hiking for 2 months and it is possible to live with 3/4 Euros a day, even less because you can ask in churches and monastries for food. You dont need money overall, just ask and you will get, not everytime but often. Maybe just a piece of bread and a bit water but its enough to survive. Only what you need is a sleepingbag a bagback, and maybe a tent against rain. And if you have those things you can, if you cant wear your life anymore just escape. The possibility to do this gives me alot of freedom in life. And if you need some timeout, a monastry is an option.
7	What kind of things do you find yourself pondering from time to time?	The first things that come to my mind are:\n\n1. What would have happened if my parents had never met? Would you still be born the same way you are, just with different parents or would you just not exist? \n\n2. Do we have free will? .. Do we make our choices or do our choices make us?\n\n3. I wonder what would have happened if I never quit playing high school football. I started first string and I knew guys who played second and third string that went on to get full-rides to Div. 3 schools. How my life would have been if I kept playing and went to college right out of high school, instead of waiting till I was 25. \n\n4. What would have happened if I never started drinking? I drank everyday for four years, made some really fucking dumb decisions but I haven't had a drink in over 526 days and I'm so grateful for being able to overcome that obstacle. \n\nIt seems like every two months or so, I'll be at work trying to focus and out of nowhere those thoughts will kinda pop into my head and distract me. It use to frustrate me sometimes, but I just learned that if I think of the words to a song in my head or better yet, actually hum it or sing it out loud. It gives me something kinda fun to think about and doesn't allow my mind to focus on those obtrusive thoughts. I thought of the words to a song, about getting through the day at work. I'll leave you on this note, the song is titled, "Jackshit". \n\nVerse one.\n\nI'm feeling down about this ten hour shift\nBecause my boss is a dick\nand I make jackshit. \n\nBut I'm trying to be positive \nSo I wrote this song\nAnd it goes like this\n\nChorus\n\nIt's alright!!!\nIt's OK!!!\nWe're gonna get through this shift\nAnd have a great day \n\nIt's alright!!!\nIt's OK!!!\nWe're gonna get through this shift\nAnd have a great day\nIt's alright!!!\nIt's OK!!!\nWe're gonna get through this shift\nAnd have a great day\n\nBridge. \n\nBecause even though there's 6 hours left on the clock\nSoooooon yoooouuu'llll beee hoooome.\nWearing nothing but your socks.\n \n\nI hope you read it like I how I intend to say it. If there's a lot of "o's" it just means you say it longer. \n\n
3	Is it fine to dream?\n\nWhy can't I let go?
2	What would have happened if I had done x instead of y\n\nWho my soulmate is/what he’s like\n\nWhether I really am an INFP\n\nWhat happens when we die\n\nWhether my life is real or whether I signed up to be in an experiment that involves me being in a simulation and not knowing about it (see I worked it out, I’m on to you)\n\nWho I am\n\nThe list goes on...
2	\- Future of our species and civilization as well as the future of life in this universe. \n\n\- Whether or not we'll make it via the virtual exodus\n\n\-  Like, how the heck did we arise as a species, and if there will be any other similarly conscious life-form we can compare ourselves to. \n\n\- The nature of "paranormal" stuff if it actually happens in the first place\n\n\- How we're stuck in the human box of thoughts, and whether or not we can actually change that\n\n\- Stuff about the ancient past in general
3	I feel like I don’t know what I’m doing, or if I’m making the right choices.	I’m 23. I have a degree in English. Throughout college I took pre-med classes, did a bunch of different extracurriculars, and changed the idea of what I wanted to do with a “career” so many different times. I worked a few different jobs after graduating from retail to restaurant work. I work in a book store now. Towards the end of last year I decided to take the LSAT, and I’ve sent in applications to law school. A couple schools are even giving me full tuition scholarships. I feel like I have to go. I feel like I have to at least move somewhere. I’ve been in this town for over 5 years. It’s a college town and people come and go. I want to go to a city. And then I think of law school as my excuse to move. But what is wrong with me? I’ve been presented with great opportunity that many others would dream of having, buy why do I feel lost? I love music, I always have. I like writing music. I’ve tried to form and join bands, but it’s never worked. I also like art and drawing, but I’m not very good at it because I stopped doing it in middle school, somewhere around the time my father had basically called it a stupid decision when I tried to sign up for the art elective in 7th grade (I forgive him—besides, I got the drama elective instead that year and that class was a lot of fun and I even received an award at the end of the year for my performance in it). When people comment on my music, and tell me that I have a talent, it makes me happy, but it also makes me sad. I want to do something artistic in my life. But I worry I will not have the time or energy or motivation if I choose another path. I feel lost. Even when I have the free time, I don’t create as much as I used to. Whether it be with writing, with teaching myself how to draw, or with music. There are things I’d like to do, but I feel apathetic. I feel lost. 
2	I’m 19 and I feel the exact same way. Rn I’m a Finance major which I’m good in (4.0 gpa, top of my classes) but it doesn’t feel authentic to me. I was so paralyzed with indecision when I started college I just chose the major my dad told me to get. I don’t have any advice bc I’m still struggling myself, but I just wanted to tell you that you’re not alone. I am completely and utterly lost. I just detach myself to feel better (I know it’s unhealthy) but the second I start thinking about my life I feel dissatisfied, like there’s a hidden cosmic passion I have that I’m not pursuing. I too want to do something artistic and creative but I don’t know what. And even if I did know, my internal conflict between Reason and Passion would keep me paralyzed. It just sucks lol
2	My capoeira instructor told us if we want to achieve our goals we need to work at it. If you want to learn the piano you need to schedule time to practice it. E.g. Mon, Wed, Fri, 6pm-8pm. If your friends want to hang out Wednesday at 6. You have to tell them, "Sorry that is when I practice the piano." You can't decide, I am going to skip practicing today. You have to hold yourself accountable. That is how you get better and achieve your goals.\n\nSo if you want a career that you are creative, you need to plan the time.
2	If it makes you feel any better most people don't know what they are doing either.\n\nI'm in my late 20s and I still feel lost. I feel so behind compared to my peers. And I feel even worse when people younger than me have their shit together and are far more ahead in life than I am. I know I shouldn't compare myself to other people, I don't know what they had to go through to get there. But it still sucks not knowing what to do with my own life. I want to move forward but I always feel like i'm making a mistake. And I know making mistakes is sometimes how we learn, but I still don't want to make them when most of my life is full of regrets.\n\nSo be happy you're not an older guy like me who still doesn't know what they are doing. But just do what's best for you that you feel like you wouldn't regret later on. Sorry if that doesn't help much. 
1	Older person here. All I can say is that you can pursue your arts at the side and that’s ok. Have a day job that can bring you income, and if you think law could be the way, then do it. \n\nLook at Liz Gilbert (author of eat, pray, love). She didn’t immediately quit her day job when her book became famous. I think it took her publishing a couple more books before she quit her day job.  The actress for crazy, rich Asian was satisfied with acting as a side gig and didn’t think that she would be able to quit her day job, but she was content. It’s noble to be able to support yourself. 
3	Guilty	Have you ever lashed out at someone and then immidiately felt really bad about it? \n\nThat just happened with me right now. They did not deserve it at all. I realpy wish I can take back how I reacted, I don't want to really be angry at anyone. 
1	for me, i will explain why i did it/seems like lately i will ask my friends (whom i did not offend) if they prefer zero explain or constant explanations or etc.. (but most are kinda used to my long paragraphs & they claim to like it/appreciate it)\n\nif i do feel sorry, i will say it too. if i am not sorry, i won't say it. lol
30	Started with the first photo and working towards the last. I kept changing my mind on what I wanted to paint on this huge canvas. I’m hoping I won’t change my mind again. I love hiding in my basement and painting for hours, I haven’t gone out in over a month besides school.	
2	I loved the upside down women in the sky the best.Can't decide if I liked the first or second version of it the best. The second. It puts them upside down solidly on the horizon. Tempests in teapots. 
1	Sooo Boootiifullll....🤤🖤
1050	All the time	
80	I've resigned myself to being the second or third choice.
57	This sub keep calling me out 
46	Yes and then I get even more sad so I go out with people again, and the cycle continues. 
30	im not infp, but when you get into that situation, do you also not use social media anymore and like not answer ppl messages?
30	I want to delete all social media and never talk to anyone again at least once a week.
61	I feel so personally attacked rn
21	This is going to sound more narcissistic than intended, but ever since I became my own first choice, my life has been so much better socially. I take alone time when I need it, I happily receive from friends when they feel like giving (time, attention, encouragement), and I reach out to those friends on the rare occasions that I need extra support. \n\nI could write at length about what it took to get there, a personal growth journey spanning years. It’s not easy, but INFPs are awesome and we are worth it. \n\n\n\n
20	*oof*
12	It's only because it's the default of an INFP to distance themselves from other people.\n\nNot only that, but our personality type puts a lot of emphasis on getting along with like-minded people and a need for space. That makes friendships for INFPs a bit harder than other MB types.\n\nI've definitely felt what you're all feeling, but I choose to actively combat the problem whenever I can. Challenging yourself can really help open up your understanding of the world.
12	Yeah, which makes me wonder why I bother with other people. I don't even care to make new friends because I don't feel like doing the same song and dance for what amounts to a pretty shallow friendship. I just don't care about being alone like that.
9	Or people just don’t view you how you’d like, and it causes problems, because even if you are a priority, that’s part of the reason for the problems... 
18	Get a pet.  You will be their number one, always.  Simplistic, I know, but true.  They aren't people.  They are better than people.  You'll always get the truth from your pet.  \n\nI read something recently that went something like;  a pet is part of your world but you are their WHOLE world.  \n\nI understand this isn't possible for everyone but for anyone who has the room in their life for a true friend, make it a furry one.  \n\nLove this sub. 
7	Not till just now.
9	Story of my life. 
14	Yeah, and I'm super jaded about it.  The only time anyone calls is when they need to use me as free therapy.  I pick my battles, but if they're going to treat me like an emotional/psychological whore, they better be compensating me for my time.
7	Yep
6	I especially feel the part about wanting to be alone. I get the urge sometimes to just cut everyone off an make it on my own in this world, without worrying about pleasing anyone else.\n\nUltimately, I never have before, but I definitely would if I felt like I had no true friends. Luckily I have a couple.
7	It feel like that sometimes :/\n\nThen I feel selfish for it because everyone's lives are their own and nobody has to give me anything, even though it's perfectly normal to want to be important to somebody and there's nothing wrong with having feelings.\n\nI dunno, I'll keep giving my best when I can and try to focus on something else for now. Maybe someone else will come along, enjoy my company, and share themselves with me too :)
8	at least i’m my favorite person 🎉😐
7	I hate how accurate this sub is at times
3	damn, literally me right now xD
5	DAE hate the substitution of “u” for “you”? Especially when it is “yourself” and it doesn’t phonetically fit...😡🤷‍♂️ . It’s like nails on a chalkboard to my brain. \n\nNot to take away from the content however.  I agree with your point! ✌🏻
4	There was someone I dated who I was very upfront with about wanting to travel and for the first time, I wasn't scared of commitment. I wanted to travel with him. When I told him this, I knew it would all be over because he wanted to stay in our town and wasn't willing to admit it. He was unbelievably upset and wondered why no one would stick around. Over the next two months, we are off and on together. He pushed away everyone and was bored while I still wanted him. Eventually, I realized I was the only one making plans to be together. He didn't make any effort anymore. When I stopped, he stopped talking to me all together. I figured someone would try if they wanted to be around me. \n\nA week ago, he started traveling on his own. I realized that he did want to travel - he just didn't want to travel with me despite blaming all of our problems on the fact that I wanted to travel. Fuck you for not being honest. \n\nWhen I read this post, I realized that a lot of people love the idea of being with me but not actually being with me. They don't want to deal with the spontaneity as much as they find it "charming". They don't want to deal with my anxiety even though I'm upfront and direct about it. I just want them to care and hug me when I'm feeling at my worst. They don't want to deal with an open-minded, independent woman who won't bow down to a man just because they are one. They want me to have opinions that align directly with theirs with no conflict whatsoever. \n\nI'd 100% rather be alone than try to make things work with anyone in a relationship. I put too much into friendships and never feel like I get anything back. I used to have friends that met that level of support but over the years, things have changed. I've had a really hard time having friends who truly care about what I'm going through anymore. It's not all about me - I just want to have a conversation that's not 100% surrounded around the other person all of the time. \n\nSorry for the long ass rant. Just had to get that off my chest. 
3	my whole damn life
3	FUCK
3	I’ve done my best to become my only first person, and it’s been a lovely decision.
3	It's been a while since I've felt like this. Anytime I have, I just leave. It hasn't been around anyone I'm particularly close to. I'd rather be alone than be made to feel lonely around others. At least then, my solitude is my choice and I won't be lonely. 
3	Nah man. I’ll always have [him](https://i.imgur.com/4Yb17LC.jpg). He always lets me know
3	I remember feeling that way when I had friends..
3	I'm glad I am my favorite person. But I'm also a narcissist, so...
6	Says the person with 12K followers 
2	going through one of these right now. woke up the other day and realized i just didn’t want to talk to anyone for awhile. the worst though is after you’re done doing the whole “distance” thing it’s weird to bring up a conversation. \n\nlike ‘hey, sorry i ignored you for a couple weeks but i’m alive now?!’
2	Every day of my fucking life
2	Sometimes, yes. Absolutely. 
2	I'm my  kids number one.   For others.... it's quite painful when I shut myself off.   I have a friend at work... I know I hurt him often.  He keeps trying to reach me and I am angry and silent most of the time with him.  Don't know how to change. 
2	I can’t relate, but my heart goes out to everyone who feels like this. I have a wonderful best friend and we love each other very dearly :) I rarely go a day without talking to him, we always say that we’re each other’s favourite person and it feels amazing
2	Real shit Right here
2	secretly you are many peoples favourite person, you just might not realise. \n\npeople notice man,, \n\neven if it doesn't feel like they do, they really do, \n\nthey just don't say it.
1	yeah, people are wack.
1	Nah because I know I'm not, for at least a few. 
1	Luckily, I feel like I’m the first choice for my SO. She makes me feel so happy, and I love her so much.\n\nBut I do relate to this when it comes to friends. I’ve had a few people I would consider best friends, but I’m not sure they would consider me as that.
1	INFP but never, can’t relate. Not because i may be someone’s first choice. I just don’t really care. 
1	Yup
1	I'm feeling this on a whole nother level today
1	goddamn just be your own favorite person instead of being a validation-chasing bitch
1	Exactly why I've gone full introvert. I'm my own best friend. No one has my back more than me!
1	Yeah, I feel that a lot
1	Yuppppp
1	Oof. I feel attacked
1	Yup
1	Sometimes 
1	It's accurate and i don't know if its something wrong with me and the cycle always continues 
1	And when they actually want to spend time with you they just use  you as vent tool, or to talk only about them , this happens so often with my enfj friend, we really get along, but more than often I end up feeling unheard, or sometimes I wanna do something different that I like like for example watching movies, but he just dodges it and do something different, the problem is that is partially my fault for not being more assertive , as of right now I have deleted almost all of my social media, and I’m trying to be happy by myself if he wants to spend time with me he should reach me instead of the opposite 
1	No, I don't ever think this. I don't know who taught some of ya'll that being an INFP means being a whiny piece of shit, but you don't have to be that way. \n\nIt doesn't have anything to do with being an INFP.
1	I don't care whether or not I'm everybody's favorite. I don't need that kind of validation. 
0	man... back in the MySpace days when i was on somebody's "Top 8" was one of the greatest feeling in the world... then inevitably being removed was a horrible feeling.  then you realize all social media is a game that was made up and the points don't matter.  so nowadays i just sit back and listen to something like:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChilledCow: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHW1oY26kxQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHW1oY26kxQ)\n\nJetSet Radio Live: [http://jetsetradio.live/](http://jetsetradio.live/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso, for whatever it's worth: thank you for reading this comment and i love you. #HappyComment\n\n&#x200B;
123	It was a beautiful day	
8	I love the...texture.\n\nThe moving stream with the water bouncing off it it's like a peace of fabric thrown on the floor with many wrinkles all over it.\nThe old mossy bricks.battered, warn away by time and people's feet as they walk along it enjoying the scenery\n\nLovely 
6	Just knowing there are others of you that can appreciate and enjoy this kind of day makes mine so much better!
4	Lol that’s the bridge to Terabithia
2	It sure looks like it. :)
19	I’m tired of pretending.	I’ve been numb for so long that I can’t remember; I can’t remember the last time I felt happy, I can’t remember the last time I enjoyed myself doing little tasks. I want this feeling to go. God I just wish it would fucking go away.”\n—  I’m tired of pretending.
8	It's ok to feel this way, you're human.\n\nTry expressing your frustration in some kind of creative medium. It doesn't matter if you suck at it.\n\nWriting, let it all out. No thought or emotion is spared.\n\nPainting, I finger paint when I need to get something out. Mistakes or perfection don't matter to me in this medium. I just get messy until the painting looks right and I feel calm. It's usually abstract and liberating.\n\nOr just dance in the dark to music that reflects your mood. Let it out in exercise.\n\nFinally, talk to someone who you trust without holding back.\n\nI never judge my friends for their darkness, I just accept it as part of being human.
4	Do you mean that you feel trapped in the meaningless of the mundane that goes on as though it was the only thing to be experienced on earth? 
2	using a creative medium as mentioned previously can be a real fucking help. not only does it calm your mind, but it can give you at least a minimal amount of satisfaction and even help when reflecting on what is troubling you, and how to keep moving (slowly but surely step by step) without feeling stagnant. give yourself time to reflect and explore, I'm not sure about your daily routine but overworking yourself when you feel like you do can really put you in a hole, and you can feel like you inevitably just sinking deeper and deeper into it. \n\nkeep your head up, set goals for yourself if you can and when you feel ready (VERY small ones) and weeks ahead you may see a difference, maybe even smile.
2	I don't know how long you've been feeling like this or if you ever have bright spots here and there, but as someone who has gotten themselves out of multiple depressions, I have some simple advice.  It may sound trivial, but try to bundle all the negative thoughts up, stick them in a jar, and label all of it under the umbrella of depression.   When i'm depressed I often get lost down these rabbit holes of despair.  I try to think my way out but it doesn't always work.  Sometimes you can't rationalize it.  That's why I think it's helpful to try and take a step back and be like, "wait a minute, this shit isn't me, this is depression".   
1	Everytimei can be happy someone is here to stop me. Everyone always remind me the moment i was unhappy but no one never remember the one when i was happy.\nPeople saw me sad, not enjoying life but no one takes the time to ask me"hey man, are you ok ? Do you need to talk ? "
1	Sounds like the only pretending your doing is pretending to be unhappy. You're most likely unhappy because you constantly criticize yourself. You constantly doubt yourself. This is a 'reality' you created, and it's not real. Research how to develop self compassion and you will rid yourself of all the negative pretending you do. You're an INFP. You're one of the most wonderful people on this planet. You just haven't realized it yet.
1	Maybe you have to much?\nDont eat or drink for a day. Reduce yourself.\nMaybe you will be happy about water the next day?
5	Feel like I'm full of hate	Hi, INFP friends. I'm a 18 year old Spanish male. Two years ago, I started discovering the darkest parts of myself, due to reading a "Covert Narcissism" article (yeah It might sound crazy).\n\nI've been going to therapy once a week since September, and even though my therapist keeps telling me there's nothing wrong with me (she diagnosed me with an anxiety disorder), I don't really feel like that.\n\nFirst of all, today is Women's Day (at least here in Spain) and I know it's great that women fight for their rights. But I feel like It hurts my pride, and I don't want It. \nThis makes me think that I would be a chauvinist in relationships (I've never been into one).\n\nIn addition, I feel like I hate some people or groups of people for some reason. For example, I have a class mate who seems to be a nice person, but I despise everything he says (in my head).\n\nIf it helps, I can do a little summary of my (short so far) life:\nWhen I was a kid my parents divorced, also I had my best INTP friend with whom I had so much fun, we distanced because I got uncomfortable with his sometimes mean ways.\n\nAt my teenage years I had a really lonely and dark time, I created a Twitter acc and I became sort of a "troll" (not in a hurtful way), it made me treat my school mates w/ some kind of superiority.\n\nThis past years I had a better time, but what I said at the start of the post let me down.\n\nI don't want to be judged for this, I judged myself enough. I just want to understand it.\n\nAnd Hope my explanation doesn't suck.\n\nThanks in advance.
4	I don't know what that problem is called, but it sounds like you could benefit from a daily gratitude practice. Every day i wake up, get ready, and then list 3-10 things that I'm grateful for. It can be anything from someone doing me a favor, to me not having to wake up in the third world, to having the gift of life, to air conditioner.... anything, no matter how large or small.\n\nYou have negative thoughts so much because that's all you apparently think about, and it's just going to get worse. Start thinking about all you're grateful for. When you have an interaction with someone, point out inside your head a few nice things about them. Once you establish habits like this I guarantee your world view will turn around into something pleasant.
4	I think you might benefit from checking out r/menslib \- it's a feminism-friendly place for men (and women) to discuss issues that affect men around the world - psychologically, legally, physically, everything. If you have a fear of being chauvinistic in relationships they are \*absolutely\* the best people on reddit to help you discuss and unpack those thoughts. These are men who have examined and questioned their place in the world and what masculinity means to them. It's really great that you want to ask these questions at all, I sincerely hope you keep doing it and growing. \n\nFor anger- As an infp I personally find it very easy to give into resentment of people who are freer with their standards for themselves than I am with myself. Infps are generally quite principled people, adhering to an inner code with rigid severity, and often forgiving others in ways they won't forgive themselves. \n\nIt's a lot of pressure. So when I see someone acting unabashedly in a way I so strictly deny myself I can't help but feel envious, resentful, disdain...all of it. Because these people show me I often suffer for nothing. That I toil away at some sense of integrity that no one else is keeping score for. \n\nI don't know if that's what's happening for you, but it might be a start to just...look at who specifically triggers this in you and try to pinpoint exactly what bothers you most. Best of luck :)
3	Dude you are a young INFP but that doesnt explain hate.  Its more likely you have some unresolved issues from your past that are starting to manifest in your present.  I dont want to trigger anything for you but i will say I have just gotten through the same thing given a bad day yesterday.\n\nFirst off i am almost twice your age im 32.  And i work in a crowdes workplace.  I left and went home yesterday after nonstop negatove interactions.  Declaring that i hate humanity and just despise people.  But as an INFP that feeling lingered... so to control it i just replaced it with a dufferent stronger feeling.  \n\nHumans use two different brains man.  There is a "secret" second brain i have been told called the emotional brain.  As an infp the Ebrain gives us a special advantage but also a special curse being the burden of anger and sadness.  Its like when food left a bad taste in your mouth.\n\nYou are at an age where the past is catching up to your present feelings and you will begin seeing things through a negative emotional stance unless you find something other than twitter a platform filled with hate and disorder.\n\nAlso relationships are different.  There is less stress in a healthy relationship and our feelings change a bit to match the person we want to spend the most time with.  Whem left alone our dark ebrain can lose control without balance.  But again you may have something deeper affecting you.  Mbti cannot explain everything wrong or right with someone, there is still free will for example.\n\nIDK Maybey its time to find a new you or something.  
2	So we meet again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV74\_Z5vIMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV74_Z5vIMA)\n\n[https://www.depressionalliance.org/vulnerable-narcissism/](https://www.depressionalliance.org/vulnerable-narcissism/)\n\nHmmm, vulnerable (covert) narcissism is a construct I don't see with as much clarity as I would like yet. It is a bit more vague and connected to things like codependency or BPD than the other narcissism in my untrained eyes, but I guess it shares 3 clear characteristics with overt narcissism at the very least. These would be a feeling of superiority, lack of insight and massive ashollery.\n\nDo you feel superior to most people? Doesn't seem like it. Are you an asshole? I cannot tell. Do you lack insight? Maybe, but you certainly seem to be trying very fucking hard. I'll tell you this, though; from what I know, a real pathological narcissist will not be on the lookout for his own failures so that he may grow, he would not be overtly concerned with being a narcissist and about hurting others in the process, and he wouldn't be beating himself to the ground instead of lashing out as a defense like you are now. Are you broken in some ways? Bet my ass you are. Do you have lingering anger or trauma issues from aspects of yourself that are as of yet unresolved? Bet my ass again.\n\nNow let's say you are indeed a narcissist. Sure, could happen... But assuming anything that goes on in your head, ugly or not, would be the result of just being "narcissistic" could be a very problematic oversimplification. A very prevalent theory as to the cause of pathological narcissism is that it is a defensive response to trauma and terrible self-steem, born out of an infancy in which emotional regulation skills weren't teached, empathy was not given or promoted, unreasonable standards were set, and maybe a lot of false praise went on, or so I've heard. I'm not checking sources for that one, so take it with loads of salt. But, anyway, my point is that, even if you are a "narcissist", you're not a bad person and you need as much help as the next guy, maybe more, and a SHITTON of insight.
2	Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out.\n\nNow at this very moment are you full of hate, full of love, full of both, a little of each or devoid of either?\n\nYou are probably just thinking. All the hate, all the love is in the past. What you do right now, at each moment is more important. In fact, it is not more important, but rather, it's the only thing that matters.\n\nThe very fact that you made this post says you recognise some parts of yourself to be improved **and** you are honest and courageous enough to admit it, not to us (even though you made this post) but really to yourself.\n\nSo don't be too hard on yourself. Don't hate or detest yourself or your past. Just be the improved person you want to be.\n
1	Hi, I'd like to hear more about how (and maybe if you have a theory or two about why) you feel hurt about women fighting for their rights. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis topic has interested me for a while now after hearing about feminazis and incels, which led me to wonder why ~~can't we all just hold hands together, form a circle and be friends~~ people are still so angry and insulting each other while debating about gender equality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I was randomly Googling the other day about gender dominance hierarchies in the animal kingdom and [this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/04/13/a-feminist-biologist-discusses-gender-differences-in-the-animal-kingdom/#2f97859519b5) caught my eye, particularly this section: \n\n>Patriarchy (as defined above) doesn’t just hurt women by treating them as property. In fact, the worst victims of patriarchy are the low-status, unmarriageable men who do the most dirty, dangerous jobs in society for peanuts. Unfortunately, we’ve done a terrible job at understanding and communicating this, to the point that most men in this situation are convinced that feminism, not patriarchy, is actually the root of their problems. So long as middle-class feminists ridicule and demonize them while enjoying relatively pampered lives, these men will continue to hate us. And who can blame them?\n\nAnd now I kinda want everyone else to read this and see if it's also an eye-opener for them, or if there are things the writer missed/got wrong (why are there no comments section on posts that need them?) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for hate, I deal with it by taking a big step back and distancing myself from the situation/environment/people. I used to fight very often with my mom and began to feel like I hated just seeing her face, but after moving out and having contact limited to just texts, rare video calls and once-a-year visits, I think that our relationship is so much better now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHate and other negative feelings like fear and disgust and anger for me is a defense mechanism, like a response when our principles and belief of 'how reality or things or even people should work' are being threatened. 
135	How to become the best possible INFP.	Hey, this will be a long read, so I recommend you read this while eating something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see a lot of INFPs here that are very sad / depressed / unmotivated and I wanted to post something that will hopefully help some of you. By all means if you're struggling with mental illness, this isn't really going to do much, so take it with a grain of salt depending on your situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of the people that I find myself looking up to are usually INFPs. They are self-mastered INFPs, to be exact and I want to tell you exactly why. It's going to be very abstract, so you can apply it to whatever you'd like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Introverted Feeling** (Sensitivity --> Durability)\n\nThere is something that can happen when an introvert reaches self-mastery (something similar for extroverts too). Their primary inner function 'flips' outward. Your inner-Fi is so deep and rich, its roots running very far underground. Yet, you probably hide it from others, as it feels extremely sensitive to allow others to see it or go anywhere near it. You are probably afraid of being hurt or manipulated in some way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, true strength comes from forcing these roots outward. People *will* make fun of you and try to make you feel awful for the things you love and value. But when Fi is strong and radiating outward, it's extremely hard to stop. It's why you probably cry at your favorite song or painting. It's not the type of crying of "I resonate / sympathize with this". It's the "Holy fuck this gave me chills" beauty. And believe it or not, you are capable of that. But you have to take all things that are important to you and push them OUT into the world. It means being unafraid about yourself and your opinions. People will quickly find out how they feel about you (which you are subconsciously scared of because you deep down think that you are not worthy of being liked, so when others find out the 'real' you, you think they'll stop liking you), but the people who do end up loving you will love you SO much more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople who radiate Fi are hands-down some of the most inspiring individuals humanity has ever seen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Extraverted Intuition** (Uncertainty --> Ingenuity)\n\nWe live in a very SJ-centered world. A lot of us are taught that traditional methods are the best and most rational means of getting things done, and corporations such as Apple even go as far as to not innovate too much at once, but instead release small superficial improvements to their products to sustain revenue. Ne is capable of far more than just ADHD and shitty memes. When true Ne comes through, it's not really calculated or predicted. It comes from such an original place when combined with Fi and makes what you are doing something the world has not seen before. I see a lot of INFPs that follow trends and are scared to truly experiment, because they don't want their unconventionality to put off other people. I have even seen them make things that are intentionally bad / ironic in order to avoid judgment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll say this much, though. When Ne comes out, people aren't prepared for it. They don't know how to feel about it or what to think of it at first. They'll say "hmm, that's weird" at first. Then, as this thing becomes familiar to them, they warm up to it. That's how all game-changing ingenuity starts out. Mixed reception at first, and then retroactively we look back on those things like "Jesus, this was absolutely groundbreaking for this time / ahead of its time." Again, you are 112% capable of that, but you cannot be scared of consequences. Your Fi will help you with this. Do it for yourself and not the validation of others. Understand that everything we love today was new at some point in time, so why can't you be on that list as well?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you truly embrace all your Ne creativity and quirks (and not just trendy / manufactured quirkiness like most 'relatable' tweets try to be), there is nothing the world could do to prepare for it, and you'll be a truly spontaneous individual.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Introverted Sensing** (Laziness--> Accountability)\n\nSo a lot of people think that Si is just about being comfortable, but it's far more nuanced than that. It's more about stability, responsibility, and accountability. This is where the INFPs reading this might start cringing. Your Fi and Ne are spontaneous and powerful functions, but they do need to be supported by something, or they'll fizzle out. It means taking care of yourself, even if it means not spending a ton of money on drugs / alcohol  which might comfort you. It also means getting *out* of your comfort zone in order to actually put the Fi/Ne to use. One big problem INFPs encounter is that they work in huge bursts of energy and take forever to complete projects. So don't expend all of your energy at once. Force yourself to work in sustained, consistent mini-bursts and I promise at least 33% of your anxiety will disappear. BS-ing for 6 days and scrambling to make it work on the 7th day is going to make you feel like shit 6 days out of the week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot trying to go all Jordan Peterson on you, but try to pick one **small** thing a day to work on. Maybe you'll wipe down the table one day. Maybe sweep another day, or pick up your clothes from the floor the next day. Making the bed ain't such a bad idea either. Within one month, you'll have a pretty spotless environment and you may even feel confident enough to start inviting people over again! Having something to do also gives you a (very) small sense of purpose that you can use to leverage against feelings of meaninglessness and despair. It's not *the* fix, but it helps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen you master Si, you'll be self-sufficient, and this means even *more* freedom to explore your Fi-Ne without people interrupting and giving their unwanted two cents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Extroverted Thinking** (Non-focus --> Effectiveness)\n\nThis big bad demon of a function is scary. As an INFJ, I understand that just as much as you do. However, it's actually not going to be that hard for you. When you encounter external information, you process it a lot using Ne. You think of how objects and concepts relate to other objects and concepts. This is great, but Ne is a very loop-prone function. Meaning, it's easy to get caught in an Ne tangent for the entire day and forget about other tasks and responsibilities. From now on, you can look at objects with a sense of "how does this HELP me or my goals?". If you do this, and are honest about it, you will stop bullshitting very quickly. For example, when you are watching Netflix at 3am with a final at the end of the week, this question is going to give you two options: Stop what you are doing immediately; OR Continue on a downward spiral of self-destruction. It sounds dramatic, but a lot of INFPs destroy themselves little by little with tiny shitty decisions that add up to an entire life of pure regret. Please don't ever think you can't change.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis brings me to my next point; **DO.** I'm not going to tell you to write down a list of goals. That works great when communicating your ideas to others, but I personally don't think it's that necessary. You already have Si and Te down there in your stack. So deep down, YOU KNOW GOOD AND WELL what you should be doing most of the time. It's the voice in your head that you don't want to be true, and that you drown out with excuse after excuse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're an INFP, you are going to attain a large amount of hope from this post (hopefully I've kept your attention up to this point). You'll think "Wow, maybe it *is* possible to change!" Then, you will see a cat meme when scrolling down from this and forget about it. So, I **DARE** you to actually stop and do ANYTHING other than what you are doing right now. Something that you think will help you. Don't think of responsibility / efficiency as a chore. Think of them as building a wall to hang your FiNe portrait on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\--\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, the world needs far more people like you. Me especially. What if that artist had never made that song that inspired you, because they were at home masturbating and looking at youtube videos instead? If not for my favorite INFP musicians / activists / artists, I would have probably killed myself by now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn that note, I bid you adieu. \*bows\*
24	Thank you :) *bows back*
16	Oh funny, I think I literally just made a post complaining about the Fi-part, not feeling like it's okay to be myself and stuff. But this already made a lot of sense and answered many of my questions. Thank you! \n\nI'm going to proceed to read the rest now. :D\n\nEdit, five (?? ? ?) minutes later: ***This is exactly what I have needed my whole entire life***: someone to tell me these exact words. I probably have to read this every morning from now on to remind myself of your words because that cat meme will definitely distract me eventually, probably sooner rather than later. Better yet, let me nail this post on my wall or tattoo it on my hand. \n\nI'll try my best to take your advice to heart, you wonderful magical INFJ guru. Thank you so incredibly much. 💖
10	Thank you! I agree with all your insights
11	Sorry to perpetuate the cliché but I  was thinking of killing myself before reading this lol.\n\nVery helpful and inspiring, thank you :)\n\n
9	Thank you! This was great! I definitely felt inspired by this post and actually got chills. (,: thanks for taking time out of your day to write all of this out. 
8	Um...you are PHENOMENAL. Thank you. If I could have an INFJ write down every insight about my weak spots, and everything they understand about humanity I’d be extremely emotionally wealthy. Thank you thank you xxx *shuns cat meme on way out* *tries to actively apply life lessons*
8	*reads part about self care and spending money on drugs*\n\n*proceeds to exhale smoke from thc pen while questioning life*
7	Thanks you so much!
6	I'm not concerned with being the best possible "INFP" I'm more concerned with being the best possible ME. There's way more to myself than just my MBTI. Just saying.
3	thanks for sharing this <3
3	Thank you! It makes me sad to see people are so unhappy on this sub and I was right with them just a couple weeks ago. It’s the little things that you put off that are always in the back of your mind making you feel like shit because you aren’t dealing with them. I was having some stomach issues that I put off going to the doctor for because I was scared. I finally went and got some medicine to help and I feel so much better in my everyday life Because I have one less thing to worry about. Fellow INFPs it’s all about taking the first leap! 
3	Dude. I cannot upvote this post enough. I’m an INFP and I have been trying to share these exact ideas with others here but you did it so much more methodically and it’s great.\n\nIf you’re an INFP and you’re reading this with a tinge of disbelief or disregard, I can 101% attest to this. Take another read and let it soak in.\n\nReally glad you posted this. This is a great reminder for me and I’m sure will help many others here.
2	That was fantastic, thank you!
2	This is amazing, I resonate with this a lot and feel like im definitely on the right track to being the best possible INFP. I definitely need to implement the introverted feeling portion of your post though for sure... ahh my recent ex is an INFP and i wish he could see this and hope this brings him up out of the hole that hes been staying in (i will never send it to him though of course for obvious reasons)
2	I needed this. Finding out my personality type has given me a lot of insight into my own thinking, but I haven't seen a whole lot on how to actually overcome some of the common downsides. Just a lot of "these will probably be your struggles". Which I'm already aware of! \n\nYes I did cringe where you said I would have to. But you make a lot of valid points... Definitely saving this.
2	You understand the power of Fi so well when channeled properly.
2	Shit, this is some really good, hard hitting insight. I was thinking recently how helpful it would be to have some type of directive like this...I've been stuck in the INFP spiral for some time, so I'm going to mull over what you said and start to DO. I appreciate you.
2	What I miss about this sub is discussions about doing. What went right, why it went and perhaps possibility of how to apply what you've learned. More practical approach to problem solving as opposed to theory - posting. 
2	All of this. I needed to hear all of this right now
2	Thank you <3 
2	I've been in a rut lately and I really needed something like this.  Thanks a lot for believing so much in us when we often can't in ourselves.  I would argue that I have already realized most of these point but, well, I still don't work on them. \n\n\n"If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chaples had been churches and poor men's cottages princes palaces... " - Will Shakes\n\n
2	Oh wow that is great. I love this so much!\n\n\n-Back to cat memes now I guess-
2	I appreciate this post. It does give me some hope. I'm basically a failed INFP in that I have all the traits but I was never disciplined enough to develop creative abilities really. I've had so many ideas for songs that just went nowhere. I want to believe I can change, I also wonder if it's too late for me
2	Thank you. 
2	Thank you, I promise I'll show you my music once I finish procrastinating the production (:
2	This is gold worthy advice :D
2	GOLD!!!

3	Say it slowly in my ear while caressing my cheek, and my whole body will quiver 
10	Does anybody else feel REALLY motivated to understand a person, but not really interested in that person understanding you?	Or is it just me? I want to learn about them, make them laugh, help them out - but I place almost no value in them learning about me. Why is that?
2	I’m like this with general acquaintances and with most friends but for people I really care about and love, I want them to peel back and understand each layer of me on a deep level. \n\nIt’s rare but I believe it’s out there. 
2	Same. I'd love to know everything about other people's minds but I don't ever want to show them mine. If I do for some strange reason, I almost always regret it instantly, disappointed in their underwhelming reactions. I've tried to tell personal things about myself to people before and once someone literally replied with "I'm so glad summer's coming". Haha nope, never doing that again, even though I know not all people are like that. It just feels pointless. I know myself and that is enough for now.

2	Wow, really nice picture! I love raindrops on the Glass, it always gives me goosebumps. I don't know how to describe the feeling, feels like magic maybe. I feel so enchanted. I also like to take photos like this. Light shining through the drops, all those colors... And also the blur. Similar to this for me is the view of a sun (or any Light source) coming through the Frost on a window.
2	There's so much life and movement in this photo.
19	To the person who just deleted their post and username:	I don't know if this is against some kind of rule or not, to reply to a deleted post. Please someone let me know if it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to let the person know that I think most of the things they mentioned can be normal for infp.\n\nI'm not a cuddly cinnamon roll or whatever.  I think most infps have an outer protective layer and don't show the sensitive inside easily.\n\nI used to be really worried about getting too close to people or bothering them. and I do often have an urge to delete an account if I feel like online relationships are getting too close or involved. Because how can they think they know me? They only see what I let them see and there are parts that I will always keep to myself. \n\nI don't usually delete accounts, because I feel like I should take responsibility for my actions. If I did not want this, then I should not have gotten myself into it. I should have thought more before posting. (not judging you, I understand) If I don't want a close online relationship, I simply tell people that I'm not comfortable with a close online friendship or that I do not wish to discuss this topic further. I also was raised religious, and I still am, and because of that, there are things that I will not view in the same way as most of the people that I will come into contact with online. We will have different values in these areas, so this is a large part of myself that I generally don't share. And my beliefs may even be different from other religious people. I don't particularly like people touching me, because it feels like they're in my personal space and it's also annoying, but in my case this is not a sex thing. I like sex. With my husband.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLife experience is a big help for a lot of the issues I had as a young infp. I realized a couple of things, over time.\n\none was that most people don't want to see all of you, they just want you to give them the part of you that they like. It's not wrong to meet their needs. You are showing a true part of you, it's just not all of you. This may not be a very fulfilling relationship for you, but it's not dishonest. They don't want the deeper parts. Some people will want the deeper parts, but these are rare. Hold on to them.\n\nthe other thing is that I remember seeing people when i was younger and thinking they were so put together and so good at conversation and intimidating to me. Then I moved away for 10 years and moved back. When I met them again, we talked and I realized that they were unsure of themselves, they thought they were bothering me with their problems. So now I think that a lot of people are insecure on the inside, they just hide it, because they are afraid for it to show. So then I thought that maybe they are happy when I talk to them. I try to say encouragin things and listen to their problems, because maybe they have no one else they can talk to. they are not judging me or thinking that I'm boring, they are too busy being worried that I will judge them or that I think they are boring. And for the other people who actually do think I'm boring or weird? They're free to leave the conversation whenever they want.
7	(I accidentally posted too soon and deleted my comment to keep writing but the old one's remains are still here (I think?). How ironic that this had to happen.)\n\nHello! Thank you so much for replying to my post even though I in my cowardly way went and deleted it. I'm really taken aback that you took the time to write this. I truly appreciate it! \n\nI didn't delete my username just yet but thought that the post in question was full of pointless whining and simply felt a bit embarrassed about it. I agree that I definitely have to take responsibility and think longer before blurting something, whether it be on the internet or in real life. It's something I have to work on, amongst many other things. \n\nYou're also absolutely right about most human connections being shallow, always. The right people are so hard to find and I feel like it takes years for them to also *feel* right. But they are there, somewhere and all over. And like you said, in order to find those right people I have to stop giving too many shts about how the general population is supposedly judging me and my way of life. In the end it doesn't matter at all. They are all too busy obsessing about themselves looking like imbeciles to think of anyone else.\n\nOnce more, thank you for your sympathy and all the reassuring words. I'll try to loosen up a bit lol. You're awesome 🌷
2	Lol hahah!  This has to be the best and most underrated true human interaction on reddit.  Its got so much INFP goodness in it I couldnt help but comment you guys kick ass, regular folks would not waste time and effort like that to reach back out.  Such a rare breed, and so much true honesty.  I bet you both are the "gem"  of your social circles,  they world NEEDs more if you both,\n\nEven if hiding is the most prefferrable way\n\nCheers🍾🍻🥂🥧🍪
2	Lol. Ok good have extra for your honesty 🍪
1	Yea, you dont like my cookies bro?
14	I've found my people!	I have so much to say, but of course I really don't have the motivation to type all of it. Sorry if this is rambling; I'm just excited to find a group of people that GET IT. I've known  I was an INFP for years but I had no idea there was a whole community and others whose lives have been shaped by it!\n\nI currently am the most unhappy that I've ever been, and reading through these posts, most of them sound like they were pulled right out of my brain.\n\nI work in the medical field in a rehabilitation job with kids with disabilities (go figure lol), and I LOVE the kids but I can't seem to communicate efficiently with adults at work or get any of the accompanying paperwork done. I feel totally inept. \n\nI recently moved to a new city and have NO friends (and can't seem to make any), I eat like shit and don't work out and can't seem to get out of this habit or find any motivation to do ANYTHING that I'm passionate about. OR anything in general.\n\nI feel overwhelmingly lonely but everyone sucks. I can't break old habits. I can clean my room or desk thoroughly and it is a DISASTER 1 day later.\n\nMy dog is in another state currently staying with a friend (he is not allowed at the place I'm renting) and I feel like part of me has been ripped away. I need to find another living situation but I just can't (I am lazy to a fault and interacting with people is torturous). It's totally my fault.\n\nI just feel like every day I sit at home is so wasteful and I'm watching years go by without doing anything I dream of.\n\nThis was super rambling, but very cathartic. This was my first post here so I just have a lot to say and can't organize it well lol.

1	You are definitely not alone! This sounds like me a couple of years ago. I’ve found giving myself small wins helped me get through those days (yay! I got through 1 pile of paper work, get up and go stretch). Focusing on getting a few small things done a day helped it seem less over whelming instead of trying to make everything perfect immediately like I wanted it. Before I knew it all the stuff that had piled up around me and overwhelmed me was taken care of. I tend to completely shut down when the smallest things start to go wrong and before I know it everything around me feels chaotic. Now that I am aware of that problem I make a conscious effort to address it as soon as it happens.
1	Im new too. The support ive found here is so helpful, theres lots of wisdom that goes through. Hope some of it found you!
1	Welcome! I just discovered this sub too and I love it. I also moved to a new city and was so horribly depressed and lonely that my dad flew out to come bring me home. I hope yours has a happier ending than mine but anyways, welcome and I’m excited to see these posts together :)
1	I can also relate to what you're saying, esp. about not having any motivation while everything in life turns into a chaos. But hey, think that at least you have a steady job. That's something. 
1	I relate here as well.  Try meditation.  It can help you seek purpose, path, or lifes current values for you.  All things a growing INFP needs 😆
5	What’s wrong with me? I feel like an alien.	I’m an INFP (44f), successful, two healthy kids, divorced and with a couple good friends. But outside of my kids, I feel so lost. \n\nI’m lonely and don’t know how to connect with people other than my two ENFP friends. I’m just too deep, too this, too that.  Both friends are married and so I try not to bug them much.\n\nI seem to scare men away with my depth and over communication, and many people in general just don’t get me.\n\nIn addition, I can be a doormat. Too kind and understanding, if there is such a thing.\n\nTherapy doesn’t help, other than having someone I pay to converse with me.\n\nAnyone else feel this way?\n\nEdit: thanks for your posts of understanding, sharing and support!
2	I learned to accept and value loneliness. It can be a beautiful feeling if you dig deep enough. Loneliness and pain leads me closer to God.  
2	I feel exactly EXACTLY the same way. I feel like I am complex and it is difficult for people to understand that about me. They get confused and make incorrect assumptions about me, I try to clarify but it’s like it’s too much for them. They only feel more confused and overwhelmed, most of them, with the additional information. \n\nThat quote “I seem to scare men away with my depth and over conversation and many people just don’t seem to get me.” Wow. Just. Wow. Same here. And who the heck wants to have a relationship with someone who doesn’t want to talk about deep shit? I thought that was the whole POINT of intimacy? It baffles me to no end.\n\n\nI have only found two or three friends in my life time that get me and accept me as I am, without having to make me bad or wrong somehow.\nI’ve moved several times and this is extremely frustrating and isolating as my friends are spread out all over the place now.\nOne thing I read recently however is really helping me. I have a theory that INFPs are actually just old souls and this article, which supports that idea, explains almost every single thing about my life. Why I don’t care about money or status, why people always think I’m weird, why I have memories of past lives and why I am gifted with music and art. It’s almost like people think INFPs are stupid, which is really frustrating, because we understand things on such a deep level it’s almost like that they can’t even imagine or conceive of them.\n\n\nIt could be hocus pocus but combined with learning about the INFP Meyers Briggs personality types, I find it tremendously comforting to think that if I can find more of these so called “old souls” like me again where I live, I might have a chance at feeling understood and accepted again, and less like I’m on an alien planet all the time. I feel like it reframed my problems with connecting in a way that I can understand and work with, so I don’t have to feel like a victim as much, or like I’m cursed by God, which is a truly awful and lonely feeling.\n\nI’m curious if others find the ideas under old souls helpful.\nhttp://www.michaelteachings.com/soul_ages.html#old\n\nI also totally agree about the paying people to converse with me thing too. LOL. Again, you have given words to EXACTLY the way I feel.
1	Sometimes, that's why I find Intuitive's to talk to.\n\nI've been kicked out of coffee shops with friends for chatting about philosophical matters long after closing and we'll into midnight. Just pleasantly lost in the depths of good "What if's" and "Why's".
1	Perhaps, I shouldn’t be giving advices as I am working on a lot of personal issues myself this year. However, I recently discovered this book that has been helping me tremendously: “The Untethered Soul” by Michael Singer. There is even an audio version available on YouTube. It has a lot of familiar information in it but I guess I just needed that reminder worded in that particular way as it really resonates with me during this time.  The chapter about letting go was particularly eye-opening. It never occurred to me before that my unhappiness could come from trying to control everything and holding onto past experiences (both good and bad). Anyway, give it a try if you haven’t already.
1	its sad that depth and over communication is too much for some people, but there is a crowd out there that absolutely love it, trust me.\n\nfind people who can receive it and hold great conversations, keep searching cause we are out there, we are all right here in this reddit sub, and real life.
1	\*Hugs.\* I feel exactly that way. I have a husband who is also an INFP, but he's an A & I'm a T. Plus male INFP's tend to be a bit different anyway. A few good friends, but I've really cut back on who I talk to due to the "too kind & understanding" thing, started to frustrate the hell out of me over the last 5 years. Other than being 29, everything else is exactly as you described.\n\nWhen I can keep a positive mind set, I try to remind myself how much I do in fact like who I am, and that I'm complex. That the friends I have and any friends in the future, I'd like to have real connections with, because otherwise what's the point?
2	Daily INFP random discussion thread - March 08	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
3	I realized I posted this in yesterday’s thread but basically I want to change and be more personable and social but I feel too fake doing it and it makes me question who I am. How do I make friends genuinely when I feel fake initiating a relationship with someone?
2	I'm annoyed that when I get happy, apparently I'm too intense for both the cookie cutter ESTJ and ENTJ in my friend group so they always team up to keep my energy and mood down. I can't find a way to deal with it when it inevitably happens again. Am I not allowed to be happy around them? Are dominant personalities like those developed to keep me out of this world? They accuse me of whining and bullshitting all the time with utter coldness but try to warmly invite me as part of the group anyway. I have to fight myself to stay because compromise is part of maintaining the relationship. It's hard, but I'll get through it stronger. I can't help but feel like a victim.
1	kinda just wanna... get off the bus?
3	Are there certain colors you find yourself particularly drawn to?	Colors you find comforting or calming? \nColors that energize you? \n(And on the flip side) Colors that make you uneasy or tend to elicit a negative reaction? 
4	Blue based colours my entire life, but lately I crave orange. \n\nI hate brown and yellow. 
3	I love purple
3	purple all the way! dark shades are the best, but lighter pink shades are also nice :)\nalso black :p
3	recently purple, or deep ocean blue 
3	black or autumn red
2	Chalky indigo to calm me.\n\nInky Sable to think.\n\nNeon Orange to repulse me.
2	I like bright pinks and deep blues 
1	A rich and dark purple and a nice bright vibrant orange 
12	How can INFPs be so loving to others and yet so selfish?	I am so very perplexed by my INFP friend. This girl is one of the sweetest and kindest people I know and yet I am often shocked how inconsiderate to other people's feelings she can be. She is capable of telling someone she loves them so much and then never initiates anything and even sabotages all the effort to spend time together from the other person. I have seen many people get hurt by her like this (including myself, to an extent), meanwhile she seems to ignore that and only talk about how hurt SHE is.\n\n This is a common thing for you guys from what I understand, so could you please enlighten me on what drives you to such behaviour? Don't you think it's actually a bit selfish? Other people have feelings, too.\n\nDisclaimer: I still think you are lovely people, please don't take this as an insult.

7	To me, love is separate from contact. With my best friends, I often don't see them for months, but I would do anything for them. They live 3 hours away, though, or I'd probably see them more.\n\nI do think of them fairly regularly and sometimes I think about calling, but then I'll get distracted and forget and it's too late to call. (they're like this too, because those are the only people who can maintain close friendships with someone like me. They'll apologize for not calling for months and I'll be like, whatever, I'm the same way.)\n\nI don't like when people initiate things and want to do stuff with me all the time. If you do this more than once a month, (twice a month for ENFP friends), I'm going to think you are needy and exhausting and that we need to get some breathing space between us. Maybe not all infps are like this, but I'm extremely introverted and I already have more socializing than I want from my family. If I don't like that, then why would I do that to my friends? If they need more social interaction than I can provide, then they are free to find additional friends that can fill that void for them. I'm not prone to jealousy. If I care about you, then I'm happy to see you happy with others as well as with me. I believe that people are responsible for taking care of their own emotional needs and getting them met. If you have more of a need for socializing than I do, that is your responsibility, not mine. Do something about it. I have a responsibility to take care of my own need for solitude and I shouldn't have to apologize to anyone for taking care of myself.\n\nIt's nice to get together sometimes, and I enjoy the company of a good friend, but I guess I just don't feel that socializing is a need. Like, I enjoy cheesecake, and if it's in my house, I'll probably eat it every day for a week, but I can also go 6 months without it and it won't really bother me. If I feel lonely, I can go for a walk in a place with people in it, like a mall or a park, and feel better without having to actually talk to anyone.\n\nOne thing that you will get from an infp friend, if they really consider you a close friend, is extreme loyalty. That doesn't sound like much, but it is. I don't know if devotion is the right word...\n\nSo yes, we are selfish, because we need to take care of ourselves by spending time alone. And we are not selfish, because we would give so much for our friends, Just not our alone time. If we don't have that, we won't be very fun to be around anyway.\n\nNow I'm thinking I'm probably way more introverted than most infps, so a lot of this may just be me. Wherever I said Infps in this post, I probably should have said I instead. Maybe someone else will have their own viewpoint to add soon.
7	This is where maturity comes in. I have encountered both types and found that the mature ones usually sense other people’s feelings better than those that are immature. \n\nWe love people deeply but we also love being by ourselves maybe almost equally. I cant even remember how many people i have made people distant by not keeping in touch and i feel super guilty about it..\n\nIt all comes by as selfish but our intentions are never to hurt or disappoint people. INFPs are also conflict averts so when some of us realise we have done something to hurt someone, it is often problematic to address those issues with said person unless the person comes up by themselves. 
3	I do initiate things and I normally respond to social proposals if they involve a small group or one-to-one, because I do need this type of interaction. However, I understand an INFP not responding because they simply don't need it or don't want it, and unlike other types we don't feel we need to justify ourselves. It's not laziness as most of us feel drained already from trying to understand the world and trying to somehow fit in somewhere on a daily basis, so social niceties wouldn't be on our top set of priorities. This is my personal view as an INFP.
4	An INFP will carry you in their heart. Always and forever. They do not need to see you as often as you like because to us, it's like you're with us in spirit and you always will be. \n\nSocializing to an INFP (at least to me, I dunno about others) can feel like a constant give give give give give. \n\nYes we enjoy being with our loved ones but if we're not careful, we drain ourselves or burn out. Or get hyperstimulated to the point of shortcircuit.  Because it's not something we need, there's a thin line easily crossed at the point where socializing becomes something we do for others, more than for ourselves. \n\nIt would be the equivalent of asking an extrovert to isolate themselves in a room for 30 days without seeing someone. They'd be pretty bummed and couldn't stand it. Some of the more introverted INFPs feel an inversely similar way about socializing.\n\nI caught myself thinking once "Why are THEY hurt by me not being there? It's not like >I<make a difference to the dynamic anyway"\nAnd it is this kind of thought pattern that justifies us ghosting people. We think they'll have more fun without us anyway. Notice that somebody who thinks that way though, is somebody who doesn't think much of themselves and that's the whole point. By socializing constantly (when we're not feeling up to it) we put our needs below that of others, and we think less and less and less of ourselves. It jeopardizes our self esteem. This is coming from somebody who's been there.\n\nMany more times than I can count, I've forced myself to come to these things and regret it afterwards because I spent the whole night being somebody's sponge. That to me is worse than not showing up in the first place.\n\n We would rather hang with someone when it comes from a genuine want and need and positive vibes and love, rather than when we have to force ourselves. Do you want to spend time with someone who feels like they are forcing themselves?\n\n It's true that one can adopt the attitude of "Even if I don't feel like socializing I can for so and so sake" but that is a trap. Understand that at that moment, you (the party) have a compromised, not 100% version of a friend.\n\nThe better route for a friendship like this is to appreciate the moments when you ARE together so you don't take for granted the moments you aren't.
2	It's something that I always hated about myself. The moment I changed was when my friends brought it up to me and let me know that it does hurt them when I flake. It was hard for me to hear, but I appreciate them for telling me their feelings and now I try to really consider if I can go out or if I need to stay in. I also feel now like I can be more open to them about my concerns if I'm ever feeling that urge to flake. 
1	Obvious disclaimer that I can't speak for all INFPs, especially as I also have Generalized Anxiety Disorder which may amplify these behaviors.\n\n\nI rarely if ever initiate because I'm socially awkward, and initiating feels awkward to me.\n\n\nIf someone does initiate contact through some form of delayed communication (text, email, voicemail) I may not respond to them if I feel like I don't know what to say, or especially if they are extending some sort of invitation and I want to say no but am afraid I'll hurt their feelings if I reject them. (I value my alone time but have extreme difficulty rejecting others when they invite me somewhere.)\n\n\nSimilarly, I may not respond if I'm afraid I've already waited too long since receiving the message because I'm afraid I'll offend them through lack of punctuality.\n\n\nNow, here's where things tend to get messy. If someone calls me out on the above behaviors, I tend to get defensive, because part of me feels like I'm not at fault for being the way I am. This could cause me to feel attacked.\n\n\nYes, this is selfish behavior, but my experience as an INFP was growing up being walked all over like a doormat, saying yes to everything, being as selfless as I could until it reached a boiling point and I decided the only way I could maintain my sanity was to start being selfish sometimes. Sometimes I over-correct and say no too much now, and as a defense mechanism I can be quite the manipulator in my less proud moments.\n\n\nIf you want to foster a good relationship with this person, I would suggest:\n\n1) accept that she may not be an initiator - ever.\n\n2) let her know that when you extend an invitation she's wanted but **not** obligated.\n\n3) understand that if she doesn't want to hang out, it's probably not about you\n\n\nIf you're an INTP (as your username suggests) I think it's important that you take her feelings seriously and don't automatically look at her behavior as over-emotional. I get that a lot from my INTP brother and it makes me feel like he doesn't respect me and thinks I'm just a crybaby who always wants to be the victim when in fact I struggle with my own emotions and actually contain a lot more than I show.
1	Look the other, the non infp. Do you think they care about others ? No, it's them and only them.\n\n"oh look i did something Nice. I'm a gpdo person right" if you aren't like that you aren't.\n"he helped me when i was down, but if he help people he must be fine"\n\nThe worst is during a fight, i find always a way to take a part of the responsabilities. The other never do this.\n\nMy arguments sound selfish, but i try to not be everyday. I do what others want, even wjen i ask something others ignore my choice.\nI don't think we can't call this selfishness.\nYou just think we are robot made to give love, you aren't just ready to fix the machine when she is broken. 
7	(Falling) In Love With Two Women at Once	My first post in this community, and I really need some guidance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI met this amazing girl on the internet (INFP) about a month back. We'd flirted before, but recently ( as I often do :( ) I got attached and have truly fallen for her. She remains distant at some times, but is generally loving, especially over the phone and ft. Ig my inner prospective side comes out and I feel something very different and unique from her vibe wise that makes me imagine a future with her very easily.\n\n* She can come off as very condescending, but also very sweet and always wants to talk\n* Physically, she's my type lol\n* She's interested in meeting in person asap\n* She has some problems with trust due to insecurities concerning her body and feeling loved.\n   * She's an artist like me, and shares my interest in music\n* Her most recent interest ghosted her. According to her, I'm her first boyfriend \n\nThe only thing is, we recently got into a small argument. I confided in my bestfriend (ENFP) (who lives much closer), who I find is easier to talk to and much more loving but lacks that really illusive, attracting vibe that the other has. During that, she confessed her love for me and we ended up in a position in which I nearly cheated -- I couldn't bring myself to do it. \n\n* She knows more about me than anyone else on this earth. She's sweet and extremely considerate\n* I find myself attracted to her, but don't pick up on the same vibe\n* Our senses of humour and level of openness with one another are unmatched\n* We're both very sensual people and thus the sexual tension there is extremely apparent\n\nHowever, she now wants to pursue a relationship. So do I. But I also feel that I love the girl I'm currently with. I feel like breaking up with her would crush her as well. I've known what it's like to get attached and burned, and I'm too empathetic (not in a braggadocios way of course. Just a softy at the end of the day) to comfortably do that to her. They both deserve the world, and idk how I can give it to both of them\n\nPlease help. I'm emotionally overloaded and anxiously shutting down
4	So, I have a thought to add to all the great advice you've been given so far. Now, it's going to sound horrible, but hear me out first.\n\nSomething I do when I can't make a decision is: I flip a coin. Now, what you would do is pick Heads: INFP, Tails: ENFP, then obviously you flip the coin. But this next part is key. When the coin is in the air, you might get a twinge of what you want it to land on, or once it lands you might feel either relief or you might feel like you wish it landed differently, and in that moment is when you pick what you wanted it to be and disregard what it actually landed on.\n\nThis tactic has helped me a ton in my life, and I haven't regretted anything I picked after doing this exercise so far. \n\nI think you should give it a shot. It might not work, but could be worth a try. 
4	If you try to keep both, you will lose both. If you stay true to your gf, you may repair and salvage friendship. If you date your best friend, you will ruin your relationship with your gf and your BFF will become your gf. If you break up you likely will not be able to remain friends or very least won't be best friends anymore 
4	Break off the thing with INFP.\n\nBeing 100% honest here, I don't really like the vibe given off by your INFP friend, just according to you've said. Something's just... off. I've known people before that sound just like her, and uh it wasn't so great. Yeah I know, she's nice, understanding, has insecurities in a way that's oddly cute, *just got rejected by her the guy she liked*. This latter reason would lead me to believe that she's... how do I put this... allowing you to be her rebound guy? Trust me, not a great situation to be in. You both may not even realize that it's the situation you're in, but trust me, that's the situation you are in right now. To top things off, you guys only know each other online. IRL friendships/relationships is a whole different ballgame. Things tend to be exaggerated online and it's easy to get.. overly infatuated?\n\nAlso, physicality is ***NOT*** everything. I know how the falling-for-girls thing is (being a M INFP, I know how easy it is to become infatuated - it's really easy). Attraction in that area is important, yeah, but it's something that fades away - not such a great trait to base a relationship on.\n\nRealistically speaking, you already have a good irl friend in your ENFP friend, and she seems to legitimately be into you (unlike INFP friend, not saying I don't think *she* likes you, she just doesn't seem as authentic, imo)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReasons for ENFP friend:\n\n* You appear to know her *very* well, and she knows you equally well\n* You know her IRL, a big plus\n* It'd be more practical (bc of distance; not that practicality is a substitute for love)\n* You're both very open (this is a huge plus, *nothing* can replace it)\n* She's your *best friend*, and it seems like you've known each other for a while\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut in the end, I think it will ultimately come down to friend loyalty, for you. All I can say is that if I were in your shoes, it'd be ENFP 100%.\n\nYou've got no reason to listen to me, of course, but I feel like it wouldn't be a bad idea to take my advice consider your ENFP.\n\nHope everything works out
1	So just to confirm, you are in a relationship with the INFP right now?
0	To add to this all too, type doesn't mean shit. Don't categorize people. They are who they are. You clearly vibe with both

0	Are ENFPs really this good at spotting INFPs	So I'm at first year at college and met a lot of new and interesting people, but these two girls that I had best time with and I'm now practically best friends with, came out to both being INFPs! Crazy right.\n\nBoth were so chill and away from big groups so I approached them (I think it's the reason why) and we instantly clicked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat you guys think of us weird ENFPs? XD
1	I'd say I'm pretty good at spotting ENFPs (especially female ones). Hands down the best people out there. The only type of people who actually seem truly interested and are able to understand me.\n\n>away from big groups so I approached them\n\nTypical ENFP thing and I love you to death for that trait. I don't seem very inviting to people even though I'd like to get closer to some and my approaches are very dry, awkward and my resting bitch face isn't helping much.\n\n&#x200B;

1	I drew each of these for songs that I wrote, each that expressed a general feeling in my life. I only just now made the connection that they can sorta correspond to these functions (maybe? depending on how you look at it?). I mostly adopt the definitions that [DaveSuperPowers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWWwQlDFnYbX_dgDP8lJ09A) has on his channel, but also I'm just going by my intuition (which I feel changes a lot (which is why I can never conclusively decide on a type for myself)).\n\nSo yeah, this post is more or less just my 2 cents.
6	What fictional character do you identify with?	What fictional character(s) do you think you are most like? Some I can really relate to are:\n\nCharlie Brown\n\nWirt (over the garden wall)\n\nHank from Swiss army man
5	Bojack from Bojack Horseman
5	Luna lovegood
6	Ted Bundy
3	Raven from Teen Titans. Though, less bitter.

15	Does anyone else ever feel like an alien?	I constantly feel like I don't ever really belong with the group of people I hang out with or the places I go, I just constantly feel like an outcast, it's a weird feeling that I'm pretty used to but sometimes it just comes with so much force it knocks me on my ass and I'm not myself for like a week. I don't know if you guys feel this ever but it's really weird and uncomfortable (even for me, and I love weird and uncomfortable stuff). It's really strange to feel loved and unwanted at the same time. Does anyone else ever get this feeling?
6	I've always felt like I was a slightly different species.
3	Yes, pretty much for all of my life so far. Wherever I went, no matter the people around me, I felt like a stranger. And I was very anxious about this. Wherever I went, there was no feeling of belonging etc. I fought this feeling, really Hard, doing things out of my Comfort zone, befriending people I should not even talk to, dangerous things even. It has helped me somewhat, but in the end, I realized I have to just accept myself as I am. This May be different from Your experience, we are all unique beings After all. I have always felt I was different, trying to fit in. I still do, sometimes. But After years and years of suffering, I am learning to accept my differencies.\nWhat helped me really was just to accept myself (it wasnt Easy and took 3 years of therapy). I still feel like an alien sometimes, but now I am OK with that :) Like I said, we are all different and maybe this is not the right path for you... Just my experience. Good luck, my friend :)\nEdit: i dont know Your age, but I am 34
3	more of an observer than a part of this world.
2	Just like any other INFP, Embrace yourself, grow your roots & accept yourself. \n\nYou are (and will be) a huge inspiration to those around you and so many other people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nif you love weird and uncomfortable don't expect everyone to understand you, but find the people who do understand and appreciate you, be yourself to the fullest extent and these people will love you so fucking much. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe yourself, and find the right people in life. there are other aliens out there man, were in this reddit sub, we love ya man.
3	College	What were you guys college majors and/ or college experience? Did you go to a small, liberal arts college or a big state university? Did you ever feel conflicted when choosing your major? Kind of like between an actual career and a thing you’d like to study. That’s what I’m feeling right now. 
3	I went to a medium-size college located in the major city near me. I started with political science then switched to urban development and then emergency management. I felt stuck because I while I was interested in them, I didn't want to necessarily turn them into a career. I then stumbled onto social work and loved it! I went in to graduate school and have been working as a mental health therapist for three years now. It may take a while to figure out what you want to do but you will eventually find it!
2	My 1st major was international relations. I loved learning about other cultures, studying foreign languages, and geography, etc. But I changed it my sophomore year to English Language and Linguistics. I realized freshman year my writing skills were subpar and I wanted to improve my English. I graduated wanting to teach English in Japan through the JET Program, but I was denied. That broke my heart. So I worked in retail for a while, then as a pharm technician. Then at a non profit. And then now I work in healthcare and I am getting my second bachelors but this time in Nursing.
2	Small school in a small town in Wisconsin with lotssss of hiking trails and one of the cutest downtowns I’ve ever seen. Mostly an agriculture school actually; a lot of people go for Agribusiness or pre-vet degrees. I was sure I was going to major in micro genetics and counseling so I could be a genetic counselor but then SURPRISE! I had what some might call an epiphany the summer after my senior year in high school and then bam now I’m studying to be a choir teacher. 
2	I'm majoring in economics rn and it's okayish tho
2	Pursuing a bachelor's in computer science. Interested also in linguistics and psychology 
2	Majored in Computer Science at a big tech school in Boston, but flunked out because of a depressive episode. Now I'm living at home and going to community college to get my associates in CS. \n\nI've known that I want to be a software engineer for about a decade now, so no, I never felt conflicted. \n\nMy college experience was really rough, actually. After the first semester my roommate decided to move in with his friend, so I got a single, which was amazing, but it allowed me to isolate myself like crazy, which was really bad for my mental health and by extension, my grades. 
145	Too real	
11	Are other INFPs sad or something?  I love my life.
3	I laughed a little too hard because I remembered the BPD Anakin memes.
3	Ironic, he could save others from sadness, but not himself
4	We CAN learn this power, it's just a high level spell.
5	Not from an INFP
1	It's absolutely possible to learn this power. 
1	Tell us about it?

2	I won’t tell anyone but where is that magical place of solitude and silence 
2	I wanna pet your dog, please
29	Infp and Procrastination	We have so many dream but zero motivation .\n\nI always study 2 days before a test . I always start something i like but i never end it .\n\nThis state of mind make me stressfull , i have a bad image of myself , i think " why am i like this? Why others know what they do but i'm enable to understand how it's work?" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen i meet  difficulty , i prefer to give up and listen to music or watching stupid videos. 
7	I'm using Reddit to procrastinate right now! :)\n\nIt's like the risk of failure doesn't begin to outweigh the benefits of putting it off until we realize the window of opportunity for completing a task is almost closed. We hate chaos, and yet we perpetuate it.\n\nAs a protective mechanism against procrastination, I started doing things as soon as possible. I either freak out about getting something done RIGHT NOW, or I put it off until the very last minute. There's just no alternative. \n\nThe good news: my fear of professional failure is greater than my love of procrastination. At work, I turn in everything early.  Adulting sucks.
3	I am procrastination.
3	I don't think being an INFP means you're inherently lazier or lack willpower, it might mean you have the predisposition to succumbing to that sort of a mindset, but you always have a choice, regardless of what you scored on a test.
2	Yes, I'm supposed to be cleaning my house for company right now. Guess I better go do that. I just wanted to say that starting 2 days ahead to study for a test is really good for Infp. I almost never studied for tests at all, unless it was the hour right before the test and even then I usually had no idea where my notes had gone.
2	I’m a king of procrastination and it sucks. I just don’t want my mind to think about it and just do it. I’m stubborn aswell. 
1	I can relate so much to this
1	I've been giving this a lot of thought but procastination plays a big part of my day too.\n\nA planner changes things though. Heres something i tried for a semester and i did manage to score a 4.0 that sem.\n\n1) Create a list of tasks sorted by type: school, home and work.\n\n2) Work through the list of tasks by order of prority.\n\n2) Keep writing each task you complete underneath the day you complete it.\n\nIt works cause it feels good to write down a finished task once its done.\n\nIt's just harder to do those tasks on somedays than others.
1	Left to my own devices, I will procrastinate like no other.\n\nThe simple trick I use on myself is to loop other people into the task. Having other people involved creates a certain level of accountability.\n\nMy fear of letting others down always overpowers my procrastinating tendencies.
1	shit I never studied haha... always last possible moment like bus ride to the exam... and I procrastinate a lot, but I can be highly efficient in a shorter period of time..\n\nmeaning in my job I usually do nothing for like 6 hours... then in 2 hours I do more work than some of my colleagues in a full day.\n\nbut yeah it's really easy to fall deep down the procrastination/thinking hole, try to think of the tasks you have to do in the smallest possible way. Like instead of thinking "god I have to learn 300 pages"... always think of it I am going to learn just this 1 page... etc... that helps me a bit
3	How do you guys avoid procrastination and at the same time, be productive?	I woke up this morning and then I had a thought.\n\n"If I can discard my feelings and then just follow what I should do, then I'll be productive and successful."\n\nLike now, instead of lying in bed because I still feel sleepy, if I can follow what I should do like getting up despite of being sleepy and do works, then I'll be productive and succeed?\n\nHow do you guys manage to be productive?\n\nPlease share your tips
2	Lol! Totally know how you feel. I can waste a whole day napping! One thing I like to do is force myself to do at least 1 thing a day. Whether it is 1 errand or 1 goal or 1 household chore, just something. If I did at least 1 thing I don't feel as guilty.
2	I made some melodic tech house	https://soundcloud.com/melonrecord/sets/a-side\n\nJust wanted to see if any other INFP's would like this? It's nothing too polished, but just thought i'd share.\n\nAny other infp's into making music like this?
15	My life	
3	Elaboration required.
1	Agree! I actually wanted to make a thread about this. I have recently had 2 INTJs enter my life (from work), and the three of us are quite close. We have a WhatsApp group and it’s always buzzing. We have great convos and it can get pretty weird, which I love. \n\nBut they both constantly talk about work and over-analyse certain situations and people, they can be quite harsh on colleagues and I feel like it drags me down sometimes. One of them goes into work super early and she always has a negative, critical comment about her team. It’s not the nicest thing to wake up to. Also, that same one responds really bluntly to my messages and often puts down/misinterprets what I say because she’s very literal. \n\nBut anyway, the OP might have uploaded that pic in a positive way!
8	Yesterday was my birthday and i did nothing..	I am both deeply saddened and immensely happy about this...
6	this.\n\nand a little addition about my own experience if i may. the calendar on my phone marks birthdays of my contacts sometimes, and this year i noticed it also marked my birthday with a happy birthday note! every time i saw it it deeply annoyed me. i don't really understand the hype about birthdays, i find them discomforting. i like my birthdays to go unnoticed except for my close family, and i want them to be with me for emotional support i guess :D
1	Well, birthdays are pretty pointless but at the same time you'd kind of like to feel like your existence deserves a celebration at least once a year lol. Even though you most likely haven't done anything productive or worth praising that entire time. 💁‍♀️\n\nEither way, I wish you have a great year and I wish that during that year all your dreams come true haha. 🌸
1	Well big hugs to you and I hope you had a meal you enjoy.

3	hmm, I hope that your venting helped you because I have no idea what to reply.\n\nJust bridging till other people are here who want AND can help you =)
16	Tired of the depressive posts	Anyone else feel like the majority of the posts in this group seem to highlight the negative aspects of INFP? I don't know about you guys, but I want to see more posts that draw attention to the creative spark within us - things that inspire us or make us happy. Together we can make this subreddit a better and brighter place.
7	Agree.  I love my life right now.  INFP does not equal depressed.  If you are depressed or unhappy with your life, do something about it!  It's not an immutable part of your personality.\n\nThat creative spark mentioned in the OP -- that cleverness and out-of-the-box thinking -- is what can and will solve your seemingly complex problems and put you on a better path.  Every problem has a solution.  Always.  You can do anything you put your mind to!  \n\nYou've got one life.  There is an old saying "the best time to plant a tree is 10 years ago.  The second best time to plant a tree is right now."  Now is your time to shine.\n\n
5	I feel. I'm guilty of using this sub to vent but it's also a good place for support. Maybe posting about improvement is good too, even if it doesn't feel as urgent as posting about a problem.\n\nOn a good note, I've been feeling more sure about my decisions lately.
3	There's a lot I could be depressed about, but I no longer let it get to me. My latest venture is trying to develop more charisma. Most people believe it to be an inherent trait; you've either got it or you don't. That's BS. It's a skill. It's made me more hopeful than ever. I think as INFPs, we're naturals for making others feel better, and when it comes to charisma, you're essentially making others feel like they're the only people in the room (if you can keep all the INFP anxiety and self doubt out of your head).\n\nIf anyone is interested, read the Charisma Myth: Mastering the Art of Personal Magnetism, from Olivia Fox Cabane\n\nWhat she details could greatly help numerous INFP weaknesses. It's a game changer for me.
3	I wish we had more discussion/text posts. The memes and pictures are nice but they don't promote a whole lot of interaction nor do they help others understand our type better. 
2	I have been avoiding this group recently specifically for this reason. 
1	No, but if I did, I'd just not read those posts.
7	Infp and friendly face	Is it just me or it's an infp thing ?\nStrangers always ask to be help by me, it's lile if they ignore other people.\nIt happen really often, 1 hour ago i waited the metro and someone ask me to show him where the bus station was.\n\nIt also work with kids. They always look at me, like if i was special. 
3	I think we give off this vibe that people automagically assume we have this higher knowledge or perspective that can help them, its almost like we standout ina crowd because we are unphased in ways the most people are not
3	It depends. INFPs can exhibit some of the strongest cases of RBF. But I guess INFPs have a tendency to look around and to look people in the eyes, also, their general demeanor might be non-threatening and we're rarely in a hurry I guess.
491	When extroverts claim me as their new best friend. You guys got any stories?	
116	I'm always OK with these people. Even if I don't understand why they like me, and even if I don't actually particularly like them, I appreciate being appreciated.
49	My best friend's a total extrovert - he makes friends with EVERYONE and if you're his friend, he expects you to get along with everyone else. That being said though, he's an amazing friend - He doesn't have a friend group - he has a community. He lets you adjust to people at your own speed, tells people to shut up and listen when someone's talking, I could go on and on. I feed off his energy, and it's great. I'm able to socialize forever when I'm with him (and any consequential friends).\n\nHowever... when I had a very bad breakup, he took the greyhound 8 hours to my place and stayed with me til I was ok. IT. WAS. HELL. He's an extrovert, which means he can socialize forever and never need a break. He *needs* that socialization. I... don't. Every 5 minutes, he came looking to chat, even when I asked for some time alone. I got tired of him on day 3, kicked him out after a week.\n\nWe're still best friends. At least I now know I can't live with him alone.
32	I love it so much I made my own version [https://i.imgur.com/IrYuck5.png](https://i.imgur.com/IrYuck5.png)
20	This is pretty much all of my friends.  I don't make friends so much as get adopted.  
17	We just accept our fate and enjoy the ride
11	*shudders*\n\nI have a good story and I have a bad story.\n\nBad story: \nStarted junior year of high school (basically a dual enrollment program on our local college campus) so everyone was new. There was this girl who could talk your head off. We just happened to be sitting outside a classroom and she decided to chat. Not sure how, but she unleashed her entire middle school to high school life experience onto me. How she was betrayed, ridiculed for being “herself”, bullied, everything. I just nodded along, said the occasional sympathetic response. At the end of it, she was appalled that I listened to her, thanked me for listening, and said we should do a “sleepover” and become best friends. Mind you, I have never met this girl before. I didn’t even say anything about myself. The entire interaction just seemed so disingenuous. She was the definition of crazy, and soon enough everyone ended up not liking her. Even the professor, due to her air of superiority... and somehow self-pity. I felt really bad for her.\n\nGood story:\nJunior year of college, first week of classes. An ESTP and ISFP (they’ve been friends for a while) decided to befriend me. We got drinks after class and just started talking about the most randomest things. Very insightful conversation though about why we chose our majors, how we got to where we were, state of society, etc. ESTP and I talked most of the time, but ISFP was engaged as well and gave his two cents here and there. I will never forget this. When paying, ESTP takes my credit card and tells me he can remember long numbers and proceeds to memorize my credit card number. In panic, I grab it from him and tell him he’s extremely weird.\n\nAnd that was the start of our friendship. There’s 8 of us in our friend group now. When I recount this experience to him, he has no recollection at all and just simply laughs saying “yeah that sounds like something I would do”. I think he’s the one in our friend group that keeps us all together. Love him to death.
5	Personally, I cling on to extroverts so they can speak for me when I don't feel like it. It's a counterintuitive relationship however, because they tend to draw more attention. 
5	Lol! Love it!
6	That's our youngest daughter. She's a tween now. Personal space? Nope. Volume control? Not happening. Conversation that doesn't include her? Impossible.  She's an ENFP, heavy on the "E."\n\nWe love her dearly, but we keep praying she learns to understand the subtleties of human interaction that introverts take for granted, like body language that says "You're getting on my nerves now..."
3	My best friend in high school was an extrovert. If I didn't have him I basically would never have gone outside my bedroom.
4	The only reason why I had friends in high school at all was because on an extrovert who decided I would be his friend. \n\nI was one time hanging out with some acquaintances and he approached us to say hi to the girl next to me. We then started talking and he saw me the next day and talked to me again. He then included me whenever he saw me, and did the same with a lot of people. He's still one of my best friends. \n\nSadly his mother passed last December and the whole community of people he has helped and who love him got together to help out. I truly admire how much he enjoys people and being around them. He is also very nurturing and tends to get the best out of people. He's super popular among girls because he is the opposite of a creep and genuinely likes to chat with them. Truly amazing guy, I got lucky he thought the awkward blonde girl was interesting enough to befriend.
3	All my best friends and my partner are extroverts. I don't seem to get on as much with people of similar type, it's bad enough that I'm quiet and it's exhausting when I have to play extrovert to try to make  someone else comfortable. 
3	What is a "Friend" ?
2	Quality meme 👏🏼
2	The introvert is wearing three layers of skin FYI
2	How do I read the creator's name, pain train or paint rain?  \n  \nI have yet to meet an extrovert who would do this to me, but every college class has super talkative people like this.
2	Haha I've always been adopted by extroverts. Sadly some of them were fucking nuts and now I can never detect if someones super friendly or super crazy.
2	Yeah, this one extrovert really won't leave me alone. He keeps rambling at me, wanting cuddles, and sleeping in my bed. 
2	I never even dare to call someone my best friend until they do the same, so I’m just flattered when someone decides I’m theirs
2	Hah, I love extraverts like this!!! 
2	Honestly, I think I never attracted many fellow INFP's in my life. Almost all of my friends are extroverts or at least the most laid-back and cool introvert kind.\n\nAnd to be honest, these "need my 23 hours a day alone", "hang out? Maybe next year", "don't talk to me i'm staring at a wall for 30 minutes introspecting about life" or "omg I must think about those social interactions, have I done something wrong?" INFP's things can be super boring and even childish at some point in life, the more you evolve as a person the more you start to notice that.\n\nIt's like a teen drama that never ends, along with a lack of a healthy way of dealing with problems and the ability to express your trueself to others without being overshadowed by shyness. There are toxic extroverts and also toxic introverts, the problem lies in how your behavior can affect your relationship/interactions with other people and how it hinders your ability to live a happy life.
2	😂😂😂😂 but extroverts are my fave
1	Anyone who has met an Aires will understand this.
1	Its always good. Helps you get out when you normally wouldn't
1	My best friend is a huge extrovert. He helps bring me out of my shell and basically is the only reason i have a social life
1	I actually love extroverts like this- I find that most of my best friends are extremely extroverted- you don't need to say anything when you don't feel like it and they don't get annoyed and they understand you when you get into one of those deep ass conversations and just can't stop talking they'll keep up- also they'll introduce you to their friends, which is something I actually appreciate because eI have a hard time starting conversations. 
1	Me at church, but especially group prayer when everyone socializes and eats free snacks. Now we don't come to group prayer, tis a silly place.
1	My best friend in high school was an extrovert and adopted me, and to this day I cherish her for that. She introduced me to her friends and I flourished. Her family was second family to me. Without her I wouldn’t have been so happy in such a difficult time of life.
13	You guys! I figured out what I want to do as a career! :D (@26 years old)	Yep yep. So happy. I'm actually excited about something.\n\nI never went to college because I didn't know what I wanted. So I've worked various retail/food jobs over the years. \n\nI thought I wanted to step into the culinary field but when reality hits about movey VS time it was no longer something I wanted in the long term.\n\nDid some research and found a passion for the massage field. I love the idea of focusing in the moment and working with my hands. Going to visit my chosen school soon and will be starting in the fall!\n\nIt's also kicking my ass into gear about certain things such as:\n\n- Weight loss and starting to exercise\n\n- Learning to really manage my money and time (I'm maintaining my current job when I start school)\n\n- Learning to not procrastinate\n\nI'm sure there's more. But I just wanted to brag that even though things feel daunting I'm genuinely excited about something!
3	That’s great! 
3	I’m so happy for you!! Go make it a reality and shine!
1	Make sure you keep it on just massaging!
1	I’ve often suspected Spencer Krug from Wolf Parade wrote songs from an INFP perspective. This song Dreamsong by Moonface pretty much solidifies it for me, particularly the lyrics “I'd say most things that we love they happen mostly in our heads”	
1	INFPs following their true calling, how did you make up your mind?	INFPs are supposed to be good at finding their calling. Our introverted feeling (Fi) is the function that governs motivation and conviction. \n\nHowever, it is hard for me to make up my mind when I think of what career to have. I see people doing all kinds of things they love and living their lives. Here I sit with indecision and inaction. \n\nI want to get out of this place. I want to find my calling. I want to step into the world and start living. I want to interact with everyone and experience everything.\n\nBut for that, I need a calling. The medium through which I will realize my destiny. I cannot find it. All kinds of possibilities visit my heart but nothing stays.\n\nSo I ask you, the INFPs who are relentlessly advancing on their chosen paths, how did you find it? What qualities of your calling makes you feel sure that it is the one for you? Are you still tempted by other possibilities? If you aren’t, how did that happen?\n\nIt would help me tremendously if you could share how you ended up on your chosen path. I hate to be hesitant but it feels like my fate! Please tell me it is not.\n\nI hope you are having great days and sweet dreams in your respective corners of the world. Be happy! Stay happy! I send you much love before I fall asleep. 😊
5	It was until my 30s until I found mine.\n\nIf you havent already, I recommend checking out Holland's theory of careers. https://www.truity.com/page/holland-code-riasec-theory-career-choice. His theory is people have different personality types that fit better in certain careers.\n\nE.g. I fall in the social category so I would do well in careers that are centered around helping people.\n\nThe categories are realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional.
2	I don't know how to explain it. I don't think there is a generic way for it to happen. For me, I always wanted to be a stay-at-home mom. Obviously, that wasn't going to be immediate, so I had to do other things for a while, but I'm looking forward to the birth of my first child this year. 
2	My good fortune was to recognize that I wasn’t in control of my life. God moved me through places not all good and got me where he wanted me. It wasn’t til years later that I could understand this. Call it God call it fate call it Ralph. The word is just a name for what really runs things in my life. 
6	Someone at work has a crush on you, how would you react?

3	is this real life?\nis this fantasy? \n
4	Is the deep authentic connection INFPs experience a requirement for a great relationship?	I looked through the thread 'Deep Connection,' but couldn't find an answer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat i'm curious about it is, this deep authentic connection we experience with others at times, is this what is required for a great relationship? It only comes around every couple years for me, and it's usually with an ENFJ/ESFJ. \n\nI really want this connection with someone, and i've always found myself turning down women that I don't establish that with. I honestly don't know if i'm shooting myself in the foot though. IT's a great experience, but it also leaves me unguarded and oblivious to red flags. Any time i've had this with someone i've always been the one broken up with. When this is not present, i'm always the one breaking up with the other usually because I just don't find them interesting enough to stay with.\n\nIs this a requirement for you INFPs? Or is this just something you take advantage of when it happens, but still commit to others when this is not present if you feel like they'll be a good partner?\n\nMaybe I just need to step outside of the infatuation at times to have objective thought..... \n\n&#x200B;
4	For most INFPs it is. Though it's also important not to let your idealism deceive you. Try to regularly distance yourself from the individual and look at relationships objectively. Not only you'll find the other persons red flags but also your own.
4	Hell this could be the INFP main theme	
2	Ever since the video came out I've been entranced by this song. It just speaks volumes to me :)
3	What was it like before you knew you were an INFP compared to after you found out?	How did your perceptions/thoughts/beliefs about yourself change after you took the MBTI? If at all?
6	I used to think i was a weird creature, that no one could have these looks on life or way of thinking and being and i used to think i was the freak.\nBut not in a bad way, i wasn't going to change who i was because you can't.\nMore in a lonely way..\nAfter i found out i couldn't believe these people were thinking and doing the same stuff i was doing, and a lot of them! It's great. I don't think i know another Infp irl but i plan to :)\n\nGuess i feel less like a freak :D
5	I used to think I was cool.  Then I read the description of INFP, the motivations for thinking the way I do-- my creativity, striving for harmony, and my adherence to what I see are the highest ideals in life.\n\nNow I think I'm awesome.
4	Well, when I would struggle in social situations, especially at work, I would feel terrible about myself and wonder why everyone else could socialize with apparent ease and what was wrong with me. I dont have a lot of friends and I felt flawed. The friends that I do have, I never talk to. Thankfully they still love me. I spend a lot of time alone at parks and really enjoy nature and the river and always had a nagging thought in the back of my head that I was alone and nobody really understood me. Then I took the mbti and found this subreddit immediately afterward and its comforting to know yall are here. Work has also improved because I dont stress out so much about any failed interaction because I think to myself, "I'm introverted, of course I have a hard time doing this." Everything is okay.
3	I felt a little bit like an outcast beforehand, mainly because I don't fit very well with other men (masculine traits etc.) But I still didn't show emotion very often, choosing to suppress negative emotions from myself where possible. Now I know there are people similar to me and that's a comfort, even if it is few in number. There was also being able to give real names to things I'd been doing for years (recharge days used to be called lockdown for me) and I became aware of things I'd been doing subconsciously as well, such as using my past experiences to make a decision and trusting my gut on quicker decisions I make, just because information on INFPs talked about it and I thought "oh yeah, I do that a lot"
3	Always questioning to always questioning but more accepting
2	My wife used to imply that there was something wrong with me because I was soft spoken and internalized my emotions. Once I found the MBTI, I was able to explain what an INFP was, she understood me a little bit more, but I still frustrate the shit out of her.
3	Is it common for an infp to have never gotten angry with someone?	For me personally, whenever I’ve been even close to a confrontation with someone, I’m either the one apologizing (even if it’s unwarranted) or the first one to step down from their position.\n\nI just don’t think it’s worth the trouble. Getting upset at someone when it doesn’t really accomplish anything, other than hurt that person or other people around them. \n\nIs this a common trait that INFPs have? Or is it just me?
3	It's very natural, and it's something you'll have to develop your way out of. Mindfulness is key. You naturally want to apologize to make the other person feel better, but this is not always the right move. It will lead to others taking advantage of you. I'm speaking from a lifetime of experience. You have to know when to stand up for yourself. That doesn't mean be a dick, but you do need to have enough respect for yourself so others will respect you as well. \n\nLike i said earlier, mindfulness is key. Constantly observe your emotions. Research the proper way to handle these situations, and be mindful of your emotions and actions when you find yourself in this situation again. 
3	Can relate here. It's like some variation of the reciprocity principle along with a strong attachment to not wanting to rock the boat, at least for me. Not entirely sure if I can do any of that 'standing up" business here, but I was looking into the idea of being like a rock; like, not raising a mountain, but just calmly deflecting any wind that may come my way. \n\nAs for expressions of negative emotion, the "anger" layer is skipped and it just tends to fizzle into sadness, fear, or pity. Idk if this is a step in the right direction, but it seems that anger (well, expressed civilly; not hulk rage), is at least a force that gets you up and ready to take action, and maybe that's what we need to propel us forward in some cases. It just feels like a barrier that needs to be gradually torn down. 
2	That’s a beautiful trait. I need an INFP in my life, I am triggered 110% of the time and keep arguing if the other person doesn’t shut up. As ENTJ this might be common... but I do not like it! I REALLY wanna live in peace, and if someone as humble and tranquil as an INFP is in my life... 😌🥺\nWell I gotta marry one ASAP 
2	Tell me whats on your mind!~	
1	This is awesome! You should start posting in /r/INFPmusic if you haven't already started. I personally love sharing and discovering music. 
1	Will do thanks!
23	From the Myers-Briggs Asshole Index:	"INFPs are not concerned with the material world, anything that matters to them happens inside their head. They are the kid in the back of the class who understands nothing and believes themselves to understand it all, which is why they never ask questions, and always make assumptions. If you correct their assumptions they are likely to not hear you.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, INFPs forgive everyone, perhaps because of the lingering doubt that anything they perceive is truly there. Their animal totem would be the stupid, drooling, cute dog.\n\nSometimes, the actual real world penetrates the foggy glass of their John Lennon-style rose-coloured shades, and they are prone to extreme depression when this happens. Usually, the best way to get them out of this is distracting them with something shiny, or make a doll of the friend they lost they can keep as a substitute. Since you considered doing this creepy thing, I can but assume you’re an ISFJ, so get away from me, get far away.\n\nThey are likely to find meaning in meaningless things, and relationships with INFPs end typically because of imagined slights, or the realization that nothing you’ve said for the last fourteen months have even been processed by their brains. If you leave, it might take them up to three weeks to notice, had you been living together."\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://zombiesintelligently.com/myers-briggs/](https://zombiesintelligently.com/myers-briggs/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
12	Guilty of all of it yes and super flattered that we’re the dogs of the animal world
2	Had the best laugh when I read it for the first time last year. Thanks for the repost. 
1	True...
1	amazing haha :D 
1	Damn 😂
1	Woah I feel offended ahah
1	umm no? Cant relate suprisingly, i see how some of us could be perceived as that but such is not the case for me imo
27	From my grandmother's backyard, always love visiting in the Summer	
2	amazing, looks like a part of some other world :).

8	Tiring people out with your Ne	At times, my mind is like a drought, but on the usual occasion that Ne is triggered, I can surprisingly go on and on about something with increased stamina. I begin to ask "Any other ideas or thoughts?", or tons of "what-if" questions or alternative scenarios, and this accumulates into a big cauldron of mental diarrhea that's churned out to the victim; massive walls of text one after another, usually jumbled and a lot of slop in general that needs to be cleaned up. This results in people not responding at all or looking confused (if interaction is in-person), but it's fine; if someone rambled to me about half-baked, borderline crackpot ideas, I'd need some time to process that as well. But, it feels good to play with Ne; it feels like wielding lightning or having something ignited within me that feels like pure excitement and curiosity. I can only imagine how Ne feels to ENXPs; for it's their livelihood. But, whatever this is; Ne or idea generation, it's certainly a gift, and although it can be distracting and annoying to others, I cherish it, and only wish for it to grow. 
1	I think I do this a lot myself, it's almost as if you zone out and by the time you send the message you're shocked by how much you went on haha. \nDefinitely turns some people away but others can give it right back, I've got a friend that tires me out at times, it's like a tennis rally I'm fired up to begin but really start lagging after a few hours. 
1	INTP here. Same. Most people don't seem to be cut for that, at least not to our level. I basically breath it...\n\nFunny thing, I just answered a post in the INFJ subreddit asking something in the same vein as this, but directed at INFJs. See a pattern?
1	I don't think INFPs are tiring people out at all, but even if, it wouldnt be with Ne. \n\nIf you want to get to know what tiring out people with Ne looks like come have a chat with me ;)
117	unfinished drawing i did. hope you guys like it!	
9	I like it but I find it disturbing, what was your inspitation? 
6	Do INFPs have problems being *”stuck in their head?”*\n\nThat’s the meaning I got from it, personally. I have this issue.
6	Whoa! For a second I thought the hand was holding the head. But then I saw the other arm. 
3	I like this a lot!!
5	It has a lot of emotion to it, I love it!
6	Give it some weapon. No man is completely defenseless.
3	Did you heard about Beksinski? It reminds me his art!
1	thanks for all the sweet comments guys! maybe i'll post more drawings in the future.

2	Daily INFP random discussion thread - March 07	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
3	I'm unsubscribing from this sub, it's a little too stagnant. I'm starting to think it's not a good idea to identify *too* much with your MBTI type, to the point where you use it to explain away your own character flaws. Trying to focus on growth and change for the time being. Take care, my fellow dreamers.
1	I feel like im everyones second and third choice. Id be bitter about it but i know its my fault for not putting myself out there. Still, i wish i were worth someone actually taking interest and making an effort for
1	I want to do things but at the same time I don’t want to do them. I want to change myself and my personality but stepping out of my comfort zone and socializing feels too fake and I don’t feel like myself. How do I shake off this fake feeling 
0	Michael Jackson is innocent and it breaks my heart to see him be treated like this in 2019... <\3
22	Romanticizing everything.	Hey guys. \nI’m just wondering how you all deal with the overwhelming need to romanticize/idealize relationships and friendships?\n\nEven before I knew I was an infp, it’s always been really hard for me to ground myself and my expectations of others. \nI’ve been in a slew of abusive relationships and, up to the very end, I romanticized even the unhealthiest aspects of my lovers and toxic friends. \n\nI am in therapy and that definitely helps, but I’m just trying to gain some perspective from those who might understand a little more. :•) 
5	For me, it was just getting burned so many times. Learned a lot that way, but it's not the most healthy approach when you *realize* you are doing it such as you are. I also think as we get older and mature, we grow out of it some, but I suppose that also has to do with experience. \n\nMaybe try some grounding exercises. If you catch yourself slipping, remind yourself that your going into lala land again. I know, easier said than done.
1	Strangly as a infp i dont think i do romanticize relationships and the such
46	Every day it seems my mind is full of consciousness towards having a better understanding and gaining wisdom towards various matters in life. Like why things/people are the way they are, empathizing, shifting my perspective, etc. Any other INFP's or just me?	
5	Had the same experiences recently myself more profoundly than usual. It's quite invigorating but sometimes tiring haha. Glad to see similar minded people here. :] 
6	Yes I agree, sometimes it can drive me mad over analysing things. Nihilistic thoughts can get me down but I don’t own them. Even if everythin is not for some massive result it doesn’t mean life can’t be enjoyed in so many dif ways. But can’t pretend shit can’t get me down sometimes, gotta push yourself into new experiences that you know you want. Over thinking our own existence is probs one of the most pointless things to do if it just makes you anxious. There’s a point where you kind of just hit a wall with existential thoughts n you just have to try your best to be the best person you can be. Most people don’t even think like us n I find it to be a blessing/curse. I wish I could roll thru life bein a simple guy but I guess that ain’t my/our destiny.
5	It's a natural state for us, a default setting if you will.\n\nWe have a need to know things at the deepest possible level, and understanding the motivations of others, imagining how they feel in certain situations or seeing things from a different POV is just something we do.  We can't really NOT do that.  \n\nI made a comment to my therapist in my last session about how everything is meaningful to me-and I meant EVERYTHING.  I broke this thought down further, clarifying that I see things that are "between the lines" in every day situations and I'm always looking for the meaning of why things happen, the how, the process that brought me to that point.  I've been this way for as long as I can remember.  It's not something I had to develop, it is innate.\n\nIt's why symbolism in literature and in movies, hell even in my dreams, is so easy for me to decipher.  I just see things in daily life that I don't think other people pick up on-so hearing it in people's conversations or even their body language isn't something that is difficult for me to do.  It's my default setting.\n\nIt's really hard to deal with sometimes, too.  If you don't learn how to digest the information your brain (and soul) are receiving  you can become completely overwhelmed by it.  It's a deluge.  Some people say this makes me "empathic" but I don't think that's it at all.  It's just a part of who I am-and it's more about putting myself in the other person's shoes and *imagining what they feel* as opposed to actually feeling what they feel.\n\nI'm usually not too far off the mark, but sometimes my own experiences colour my interpretations.\n\n&#x200B;
3	Totally with you man.  Shifting in and out of perspective is a big one for self development 
2	I find this too- I think it used to frustrate me back in high school when I thought none of my friends were very self-aware or cared enough to learn more about themselves or others. Over time I’ve come to accept this unique trait as an INFP mindset... that said it’s still overwhelming at times 
106	Not mine but still beautiful!	
4	:) 
1	Very much, kinda 80s like aesthetic.
1	Like the wings of a phoenix bird.
69	Little sketch I did at work today!	
6	So you're on top of the world? 👍 Glad that you're doing well! 🤗
2	Real cute, it's actually got a pretty sweet feeling to it. 
2	Ngl I thought that was Jolyne Cujoh for a second 😂\n\n(BTW anyone here like JoJo?)
25	What is it with you INFP’s	INFP ‘s in my life- brother in law, sister in-law and son\n\nI ADORE INFP’s!  Definitely my favourite people in my family. I am an ESFP and I can’t get enough. I find you guys so interesting, charming, funny as hell, and just fun to talk to. Is this a mutual thing, or am I just hoping it is?  Do you like ESFP’s?  Hahaha
19	We are just adorable, can't help it!
9	We're just good at being adorable. Can't explain it, we just are. Dang it, I just noticed someone else said exactly the same thing haha.\n\nI had a great ESFP friend in Oregon! She was a lot of fun and didn't let little things in life keep her from having fun like I do. I miss her. 
3	My mum is an ESFP 
4	*consults my Google sheet of colleagues' MBTI. Yup, ESFPs are in my good list.
3	My best pal for the last 20 years or so is an ESFP.  She’s brilliant, we have a great time together and totally get one another.  It’s a friendship that will last in this lifetime and any others after that.  
3	My cousin and my close friend is an ESFP and we get along soooo well
3	I love ESFPs! My mom is an ESFP. I think INFPs and ESFPs tend to get along well in general.
3	One of my coworkers is an ESFP and he’s like a brother to me. We’ve worked together for years. He’s great at lightening the mood and making things fun, but we can also have more serious conversations too. \n\nWhen I was at work and found out that my dad had died, he sat with me in an empty office until I composed myself enough to talk to anyone else. He’s a sweetheart and I’m so thankful for his friendship! 
3	My SO is an INFJ and he jokes that we INFPs are like Labradors, cute, adorable, loving, kind and fun to be with(hahah!) Just wondering if anyone else feels the same? And we love you ESFPs! 
2	I'm an infp and my boyfriend is esfp lmao the love there is mutual
2	Hey! It's my friend! I'm the sil! That's me! ;) I wanted to ditch my dentist appointment so badly to keep chatting today. Haha. We always need an entire day to catch up. \n\nFun fact: this lady is my favorite person to vacation with. 
2	I wouldn't know bc I know no one's type irl lolxd 
2	I love ESFP's , you remind me to be silly and have uncontrollable fun!!
2	Well, I do try to put on a good show :)
1	I was always described as 'sweet'. My personality is described as either 'cute' or 'weird' (depending on who you ask). \n\nUntil recently I HATED these descriptions but I learned to roll with it.
332	I had a great first date tonight	I just wanted to tell somebody :)
95	I am udderly delighted to hear this. 
33	glad to hear it, hope things turn out well for you!

13	Wooooooo! Here's to many more!\n\nI revealed to my bestie that I had a bit of a thing for here - turns out, she did too! So while we're not really "dating"  in the traditional get to know each other sense, it's still in that early days thing :D

3	Woohooo! 🥳 Happy for you! 
146	Why is it like this??	
8	r/infp is just r/depression with more positive vibes
4	I'd want a solution for this as well. It's like I am not in control of my emotions like others are.
3	I'll be completely fine and then all of a sudden- BAM! I'm completely depressed and apathetic for a week with no explanation and stop doing any of my school work because I can't be bothered.\n\nAnd then I feel compelled to write poetry for some reason.
2	yeah, I cut 3 huge vertical cuts in my arm and then smoked a blunt with my beautiful red red blood still moving, good times, it's like this it what it means to be human lol
2	Need the motivation to finish a 5 page essay due tomorrow morning	I really need to stop procrastinating lmao. 
3	The guilt tomorrow of not doing it. It is a choice you still have so choose it. Write it as fast as you can and then you will have more time to edit. 
2	if not done  now ,your future self might get in trouble, don't think too much,just start!!\n\n(what is the topic of essay)
2	The sooner you finish it, the more sleep you'll be able to get :\^)
8	The Scariest People	Strangers are terrifying, but the scariest people are actually strangers you just met. Like this:\n\nYou're standing in an elevator and someone talks to you (the monster). Fine. Okay. Scary, but you survived. You try to live the rest of your day like normal. But at the end of the day you see the same person walking toward the same elevator you are. So naturally you pretend to be tying your shoe and wait for the next elevator.\n\nMeeting them once is bad enough. But running into them again is way worse. What if they remember you as that awkward potato they met earlier? What if you keep meeting them and they expect you to socialize with them on a regular basis?!\n\nI started thinking about all this when I noticed I was literally running down the hallway at work so I wouldn't be spotted by someone I met in the bathroom earlier. All she did was ask if my day was "wonderful."\n\nCan anyone else relate to this? Or do I need to see a therapist? Or maybe we all need to see therapists?
6	I read it as "What if they remember you as that awkward potato they met earlier? What if you keep meeting them and they expect you to socialize with them like a regular basil?"\n\nAnyway, yeah, that's why I can't go to the same hairdresser more than twice and I'm thinking of quitting chic fil a because the cashier knows how to pronounce my name. I'm definitely going to therapy for this eventually.
2	I just found out that one of my regular customers is my husband's cousin so now i have to have conversations and possibly make plans and hang out with these people. She's really nice but i have social anxiety. I fake it alot bc i work with the public.
2	I meet and talk to strangers very easily.  The second time I may see them, it's nice and pleasant.  Someone I've met before.\n\nThe third time, however, it's avoidance for me.  Like, I don't want to be your friend, but we keep meeting.  *I do not consent to us randomly meeting and unintentionally becoming closer acquaintances!*  **I'm being socially violated by the universe!**
1	Yea, that's how it is for me. There is quite a few people who work in the same building as me who I try to avoid on a daily basis after having one conversation with that person.

19	I'm lazy and I HATE IT	Hey,\n\nCurrently I don't have work and I am not in school because I just dropped out of it until September. This may sound like I have a great time and nothing to worry about, but it's not that simple unfortunately. Everyone keeps pushing me to do stuff, including myself. However it feels like every time I want to do something productive or physical, I have to cross a great wall mentally  before I actually do anything physically. I am just straight up lazy, but I am really having serious troubles with it. Especially since I have people pushing me to do something. It is very different than just doing your maths homework. Any advice?
15	 The most powerful tool for this I have found so far is the 5-second rule:  "If you have  an impulse to act on a goal, you must physically move  within 5 seconds  or your brain will kill the idea." So to get moving, when you have this impulse to work on a goal or do something you know  you need to do, you count down "5-4-3-2-1 Go" and *move* acting on that goal. A woman named Mel Robbins recently wrote a whole book on this and has several [talks online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp7E973zozc&amp;t=838s) about it. 
4	All I can say is don't let it fester, I'm in my 30s now and all it's done in my life is get worse and worse.
4	Theres this phenomenon that occurs when we have nothing to do: we suddenly want to do nothing.\n\nLack of job/things to do creates apathy and lethargy naturally, because there is nothing to look forward to, no goals to accomplish, or projects to create.\n\nStart with small things: making your bed, cleaning up your space, getting up early to exercise or get a good breakfast. stimulate your mind with a book, learn a language, learn to cook your favourite thing, etc.\n\nStart with one little thing to do, and slowly build. \n\nApathy breeds more apathy until you decide to do small things to knock it out of you.\n\nI've been there.\n\nWhat also helped me was CBD oil, because I found that my apathy was also depression. 
3	Hey kid. Hate comes from anger, anger comes from fear of pain, when there is nowhere to run. Fight or flight. If you intend to stay in this society (really think about it) and not under some bridge with some bridge friends (although there's nothing wrong about it) then you will have to find a way to support yourself financially. Simple isn't? Why overcomplicate your life with a word you don't know where it has been. There are people who work 16 hours a day and call themselves lazy because someone out there works even more hours. You should be laughing now. If there are some expectations circling around you that you do not agree with, send them to the north pole, but prepare for the consequences, or don't, let it just fall on you, you're still young and flexible.
2	Same problem but I’m still in school. Just try little things at first, and make them habits. Even though I hate routine you gotta have a little structure.
2	Being an infp, I've noticed that I'm damn dedicated and active for the things I'm passionate about but since im still in high school and im not really passionate about it I procrastinate a lot and I have to break through that "mental wall" you just mentioned to get my stuff done and it's a pain in the ass everytime. While on the other hand, if it's for something that holds my heart and soul I don't even have to think twice before I'm on the run. It sucks man
1	Maybe you haven’t come across any of your niches? I’m convinced every INFP has niches - personal areas of interest that spark motivation. For a lot of INFPs it comes in a form of creativity, or service to others. Come across your niche , and you may find sudden waves of energy. Things you may have not found interesting may suddenly become so, because it brings you closer to your goals. \n\nSpeaking of my own experiences, I was very unmotivated, lazy, tired, and angry in high school. My grades were meh. I was always talented with art. I was accepted in to my dream college - art school, and suddenly I was in an environment that motivated me to learn. 
1	Have you tried watching motivational videos on Youtube? Maybe they will help. There are literally 1000s of them you can find.\n\nAlso, I recommend looking up Cal Newport talk about "Deep Work". I feel like his lectures are very helpful.
1	Set 5 hours, day, , weeks, months, years, 15 years goals.\n\nThen work towards them. Verify with the list from time to time.
3	Is there a correlation between INFPs and INTJs?	I'm an INFP with an INTJ mother, and personally I have found that all of my INFP friends have INTJ parents. I'm curious to see if this is just something other INFPs have also found, as for me I have never met an INFP who doesn't have one INTJ parent
2	Hmm... Maybe more of INFP with IXTJ parent, or, IXFP with IXTJ parent (ISTJs are said to be quite common as well, so given that that is true, that might explain that "pattern"). I think one of my parents is an ISTJ here, and things can go awry quite quickly. It's usually something about tidiness, order or hygiene, or something petty like that (at least to me).
1	I have no INTJ parent
1	I think my dad is an ISTJ 
1	No INTJ parents, but I do have an INTJ brother.
1	No my father is an ISFJ and my mother is ESTJ you can imagine the struggle that I’ve been through 
3	I think we're ALL emotional	
2	r/depression_memes 
16	The INFP boy.	
2	Nice!
9	is it weird for an infp to energetic as a child?	I was a very lively person when I was a kid, but from most stuff I read, infps are really quiet when they are kids.
7	Oh I was craaazy wild as a kid. But also middle child. By 12, I became all cool collected seeming, but an internal emotional nut. Lol! 
3	Quiet, yes, but hit the ground running and have hardly stopped since.
3	I was an energetic child, and I’m still an energetic adult. I don’t think INFPs are always quiet, by nature?\n\nI also used to hide in my closet and read for days. It just depends. 
3	I think I was very lively and adventurous but I just went on all my adventures alone and I didn't need to leave our yard to have them. I was quiet to others but always living in some type of fantasy in my mind.
3	I was very shy around people (adults, especially) that I didn’t know and in large crowds. However, I was very energetic around my friends and family.  My younger siblings often fed off of my energy, and we usually got into trouble because if it.  I’ve definitely mellowed out more as I’ve gotten older, but with the right friends in the right setting I can be very energetic and loud. 
2	I was diagnosed with ADD and Dyslexia as a kid, so I'd say not. 
2	I was very outgoing and energetic as a child. Shy towards adults, but at school i had a lot of friends. Then I hit sixth grade and for some reason i suddenly felt incredibly nervous to even talk anyone i was acquaintances with before, and quickly became much more reserved. I don't know what happened to me, but it happened.
2	As a kid, ye I was pretty wild. After I hit 8th grade tho my life tanked and I went quiet. Haven't changed since
0	I don't see why not. I was quiet as a kid, but maybe it depends on your environment. Are you sure you are not an ENFP?\n\nENFP and INFP can be very similar, especially if you have Fi and Ne savior. What matters is if you spend most of your time in your head reflecting how you feel, or more time in the outside world exploring ideas.
9	Nitch or odd hobbies that you love?	If you all can't tell yet, I absolutely love asking this sub random questions. Its fun to have a look at the responses when I take breaks from work and see what you all had to say. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday, I was wondering if any of you have "nitch" hobbies that aren't very common? For me, its miniatures. I used to like making dollhouses but that's expensive and takes space, so I've moved to designing houses on The Sims. 
8	^^niche
4	Micro fishing. Embroidery. I've had a love for rocks since I was a child and recently got into lapidary work. I made this really cool arrow head and a heart out of this big chunk of what I believe to be agate and quartz that I just FOUND! I like looking for arrowheads in creekbeds(they dry up during our hot summers). Gardening. I have a buttload of houseplants as well. My boyfriend even got me a wet saw for valentines day and is building me a greenhouse. Made me a pond last year. I am my 7 year old nephews pen pal, I dont know if that counts as a niche hobby but nobody I know writes letters anymore. I also dont talk to a whole lot of people so I could be wrong about that lmao.
3	Not odd, but my hobbies definitely fuel me.  I love guitar, photography, video games, philosophy, reading, recording music, growing as a person, studying, prayer/meditation to name a few
2	I have a strange love for toilets. Not plumbing, just toilets. I sometimes even experiment with my own toilet, like overfilling the tank, intentionally clogging the toilet, plugging the siphon jet, etc. On a much more normal note, I also like cars :)
18	I posted a fanart yesterday and someone offered to pay me for it	This makes me feel so proud. It also helps with a mild depression/ low self conscience problems I am currently having.
3	Yeah! congratulations! bask in the sunlight of this glorious event!
3	Congrats!!! Yaaay
2	Ka-ching!  Well done, glad it gave you a boost.
7	Being raised in a Christian environment drives me insane. I fucking hate religion.	
6	I can relate
5	Can't relate.\n\n&#x200B;
3	Probably should be in r/athiesm
3	Religion is much broader than Christianity and Christianity is much broader than any denomination, and a denomination covers much more ground than any given church or pastors opinions. Our exposure to a religion is just so small and provincial. We get antiquated with one small corner of a room and judge the whole city based on the color of the wall paper. \n\nBut definitely doubt, find out, grow as a person. Explore the rest of the room, building, neighborhood and city. Or put it all aside and go enjoy life.  
2	Do you believe in God, or appreciate the example Jesus set, yet think the religion built around those is bunk?  Or not believe/value any of it, content as well as structure?
2	I was raised in a very Christian environment too, but I'm really thankful for that. I know where I'm from, where I'm going, what's the purpose of my life and learned that no matter what, I will always can count on Jesus.  😊\nThis has helped me through very thought times, so I'll be forever grateful. \n
2	Religion in general is so superficial and pointless, not to mention all the corruption and hypocrisy amongst the leaders. I don't blame people for believing because it's mostly just another way to cope, but living by the bible like it's Jesus himself whispering in your ear is a bit... I almost want to say narrow but I know that's not exactly it. \n\nI consider myself quite spiritual and in my opinion religion has very little to do with spirituality since it requires a somewhat open mind. It depends on the individual I guess. Besides, the idea of a beautiful benign God creating such a damn stupid creature as a human being is really depressing to me, having us walk around with delusions and paranoia about whether our goodness will take us to paradise or whether all of it is for nothing. If I am to believe in a creator I'd rather think of him as brilliant yet flawed mad scientist. Maybe he just yeeted and vanished in the air once he realized he'd f*cked it up. Maybe we're offering him and his buddies a nice little show. Maybe his buddies have their own little projects too and they compete about who has done the greatest. \n\nK sorry, I was meant to just say that I agree that religion sucks. I also have most experience about Christianity and that is probably visible.
333	It be like that	
8	Just happened to me right now. It sucks
6	:(
5	This is me today. Why.
5	Big mood :/
5	It's okay and it's normal. Personally I find caffeine and especially sugar drive big mood swings, so I'm careful about drinking soda.\n\nPlus when you allow yourself to sit in those emotions and experience them without judgment, you can gain a deeper understanding of yourself.
7	Infp in engineering?	Hi guys, I was wondering of there are any infps in engineering.\n\n I'm an INFP myself and  currently in engineering major, so. Maybe I could find out that I'm not alone. Seems like engineering is not so hot among infps... is this something we could do? 
5	I'm in computer science . I've been working for 8 years and wouldn't change a thing
2	I used to be a draftsman for a few years and worked with engineers. Not for me. Smart people, sure, but their black and white approach to everything was mentally tiresome (for me).\n\nI am in still in science, but in academia and research. It's not the most INFP career but it is a lot more intuitive than engineering, and the high prevalence of writing is more appealing to me.\n\nNote I am not trying to discourage you from engineering in any way, and I hope you excel at it better than I did, but this career attracts a lot of xSTx types.
1	I’m in physics, looking at possibly going into engineering in grad school. You’re definitely not alone, don’t worry!
1	What sort of engineering?\n\nBachelor in mechanical engineering. \n\n&#x200B;
1	Started in engineering switched to Fine Arts, because a little more intuitive and much more a rebel than my classmates. Grade were excellent had scholarship but engineering science was not intuitive. 
1	Currently in my second year of uni, there's probably career path out there better suited for me but I like it enough and it'll support all of my weird hobbies so I can't complain. You don't have to change the world, if you find it interesting enough then go for it. 
1	My parents wanted me to go for engineering and myself too until I found out that engineering isn't even anywhere near to what I want to see myself doing in the next 10 years
1	I'm in my first year of engineering, and I think that it might be the path for me. Still a lot could change, but you're not alone.
1	First year of uni engineering, for me it is interesting for sure but i dont know if it is the thing i wanna do for the rest of my life, might change
1	First year of computer science. It fits with my interests but I have questioned however it's the right thing for me. In part because I failed the two first math exams, but I also think it might be because I'm afraid of committing (*what if it turns out to be the wrong choice*😫). \n\nI've always been seen as *smart* and never really had to study to get As in high school. But now I'm slowly, and painfully, coming to the realization that uni is different 😅\n\nMy thought with studying computer science is to broaden the possibilities for the future. To get a competence that's attractive, and through it get a freedom to choose what I want to do. I'm thinking about taking some courses in business and perhaps one day run my own company.
15	Those flowers 😍	
1	It's bizzarre that i don't know nothing about this picture but feels similar to home...\n\nIs this Brazil?
831	I saw this on a video a while ago and like to use it as a reminder	
27	So true, most people do not give a hoot about you and are too busy worrying/thinking about themselves. 
36	INTJ here to remind you that it’s 5am and I’m thinking of the embarrassing thing you did the other night. How could you?! ;)
13	Try and think of the last time you did or said something embarrassing, you’ll probably come up with something right away. Try and think of the last time you saw someone else do or say something embarrassing, and it’ll probably take you a while, if you can think of anything at all.
13	Also, it's possible to reduce the impact of these events that only exist in memory to the point that they are like little dream moments that you can laugh at. The trick is to treat your past self like your little sibling that you really love. Every time the memory arises and you cringe just say "It's ok, you're ok. I love you." Imagine giving your past self a big hug and holding them as long as you want.\n\n  \n\n\nIf there's resistance to this exercise because you think past you really was a loser and deserves to feel terrible realize that this resistance is not helping anyone, most of all yourself. Your best self is the one who is happy and content not the one who is propagating the suffering. \n\n  \n\n\nSincerely, an INTP to whom none of this comes naturally but who is enormously better off for the effort.\n\nEdit: it doesn't matter if the event was only a few hours ago. You're still not the person you were.
7	People may not dwell over specific things you did or said, but they definitely color someone’s impression of you in aggregate.
5	Powermove start thinking about other people's mistakes at night.
5	Haha yeah that's not true. All thinking about my screw ups 
4	On my first day of Junior High my cool older sister told me “Nobody cares about what you’re wearing because they’re too busy focused on what everyone else thinks about what *they’re* wearing.”\n\n
4	And that's why we all love KickThePJ ❤️
3	Holy shoot I havent seen a kickthePJ vid since like... 2007
3	link ? 
2	But are they though? 
2	I randomly thought of this exact stammer today during my ap physics class . This is so weird that I am seeing this post on popular right now.
2	Pure gold. When you realize you are not special and basically everyone goes through very similar issues... such a welcome freedom.
2	KickThePJ omg. I miss this guy! I stopped watching YouTubers back in 2014 but I still love his stuff!
4	I love PJ 🥰
1	does this mean that no one in school or class is bothered enough to stare at me eating alone? 
117	"Can you speak a bit louder?" --- how often have people said that to you?	It seems one of my recurring themes. Classes. Meetings. Phone conversations.
43	or " your voice is very loud , speak lower" \n\nI'm never between .
13	All the time. I feel like my voice is on a reasonable volume but apparently, judging by the numerous "What?"s and" Pardon?"s I receive on a daily basis, it's not. It's different with people I know well and I can be pretty loud when I get excited. But generally it feels like some kind of an insult to other people if I speak louder. Idk :D
10	Recurring theme for me too; I get accused of being a mumbler or being called "too quiet" fairly often.
9	I started talking louder and people don't say it to me anymore
7	Yes, it sucks when a random stranger says hello as we pass by eachother and i have to play nice and squeak out a little quiet hello myself. Really its okay, no need for useless small talk. 
3	I used to literally stand on a chair to get attention when I was leading events, because otherwise there was no way to be heard.
2	A bunch of times
2	often.. and sometimes they lean in closer to hear better but it makes me even quieter 😌
2	My mom always tells me "open your mouth when you speak, that's how it works" 😅
2	My extroverted mother never allowed mumbling. :)
2	Anyome have a solution to this?
1	Haha. When I first started as an EMT I would talk too low to the nurse. I think it was because I was nervous. I notice some patients do the same thing. What is ironic is I am somewhat hard of hearing so I ask patients to speak up all the time.
1	Drivethroughs, etc.
1	I think it's one of those things you can develop an awareness for. I remember that used to happen a lot, but through just paying attention to it, it went away :)
1	Too many times to count 
1	YEESS! I get that alot.
1	All the bloody time
1	not really, more often just "what?" cause I tend to mumble or speak too quickly.
1	All the damn time! I can't go a day without hearing it
1	Never\n
1	My wife, every day.
1	Just did yesterday, ordering a drink. I looked so done with the noise the kids were making.
1	Yea... lol i hate it
1	I think I have a soft voice but my job needs me to turn up the volume and change the tone of it all the time, so it's been years since I've been told that. In fact I think I speak pretty loudly now.
1	all the time..\n\nis this a personality thing?
1	I have a problem with mumbling because what I wanna say is so clear but articulating it verbally is a huge bottleneck
1	Nope, it's the other way around for me.
1	Its either "spEaK a biT lOuDer" or "oMg cAlm tF dOwN"\n\nSo yeah there's no in between 
1	Omg i just want to stop talking when they say that. 
13	INFPs in keeping friendships.	Hello \nSo I was wondering if it's common for a infp to not talk to people very often. I'll bring my example here: I have very little friends. My best friend is a person who I talk 2 or 3 times a month at best. So like if I don't see a person every day I do not maintain the relationship. That became something deeply annoying to some people I know (acusing me of "using people" for not talking unless there's really anything important to say). I was wondering if it's common.\nAlso, I feel like I never create a deep bond to anyone? I simply don't care about their background. That sound really harsh.\nThank you all
8	That actually is common for INFPs. INFPs' dominant function is Introverted Feeling (Fi). What this means is INFPs spend the majority of their time in their head thinking about themselves and deciding things based on how _they_ feel, not how others feel.\n\nWhat INFPs have to realize is this can look like selfish behavior to other people. INFPs have to become more aware of how their actions affect other people, and they need to start thinking about others. If someone texts the INFP and the INFP doesn't text them back because the INFP doesn't have anything to say: How does that affect the other person? Why does the INFP think that might make the other person mad or upset? The INFP needs to start using their inferior function: Extraverted Thinking (Te). It may be hard, but it is necessary to live a balanced life. \n\nTe is thinking about others and deciding things based on other people's reasons. If someone asked the INFP to do something the INFP doesn't want to do, maybe the INFP should decide based on the other person's reasons, and not based on the INFP's feelings. It may seem counter to their personality, but it is necessary to maintain friendships. Otherwise the INFP may become lonely without any friends left to walk with.
3	friendship is not spending all your time with someone but  having good memories with this person
3	Hiiii. I have the same problem. In fact I think I just lost my best friend due to this.\nShe sees it as me not caring and that I have no interest because I only call when something happens to me. Which might be true, im not very good at keeping in contact. \nSo now im sad and wondering how I change it.\nIm tired of apologizing for forgetting important things.\nIdk just wish things were different.
2	I have a few friends but I only speak to my two best friends (in a group chat) regularly (at least weekly, if we’re busy). With my other “friends”, I don’t really speak to them unless it’s been a few months and I feel guilty for not being in contact. \n
2	It is quite common according to my experiences in general not INFP specific. Yes, you seem to quite self-absorbed, cold, lack some empathic capabilities, or just don't care.
2	It's weird, in friendships now I feel like I'm not doing enough but my friends say otherwise. A few years ago I felt like I was doing a lot and they said I was distancing myself, lost them shortly after. So idk my brain is weird
8	I'm a horrible friend	I feel like I'm becoming very unfeeling and uncaring towards my friends out of the 3 friends I regularly contact I only consider one of them "family" and only really care about her and would go out of my way to help her out. \n\nThe other 2 people I feel like I could just drop them and totally be fine. I don't find much value in these friendships anymore (it's even mentally draining sometimes) which compels me to cut it off but consciously I'm aware that it's unfair to them because I know they consider me a close friend and care about me. They have done nothing wrong so I don't really have a real reason to stop being friends with them. I find myself maintaining the friendship just because its convenient and conflict avoiding. \n\nThis is a throwaway because I'm aware of how assholish this sounds and one of the people I'm talking about is aware of my main acc. Not looking to be justified or be told that this isn't toxic because I know it is, just wanna get fellow infps opinion of this. 
2	I’m the same way. I only consider my two best friends as friends. I consider my other “friends” as acquaintances really. I’m lucky those other friends don’t make a fuss when I go months without contacting them. I suppose social media makes it a bit easier because you can send a small comment/dm about something they’ve posted without it having to turn into a long conversation/meet up; everyone’s satisfied that way. 
1	Then be the strong person you know inside you that you’re waiting to be told from an outside source that you’re supposed to be and don’t pretend.  Be alone. It’s ok.  Suffer threw whatever uncomfortable pain that causes rather than remain confused and annoyed with others who don’t deserve just because you need some honest time alone to feel how you feel. It’s not bad to not care. It is bad to try to care when you can’t. That just my opinion tho... that’s my lifestyle you don’t have to take it as the only option. But I feel it would be better for all parties to be real and just don’t give your energy out to sources that you don’t NEED WANT OR LEARN from.  It’s ok you’re fine 
63	Most precise INFP description I've ever read	The FiNe’s (INFP's dominant) functions are:\n\n- Fi - introverted Feeling\n\nAlthough it’s referred to as “Feeling”, Fi is not internal emotions, but rather values that come from within. FiNe’s might experience a deep well of emotions, but this is not the root of Fi. It is a decision making-process that is very interested in determining its own moral code and what the FiNe’s gut instinct tells them is right, which is often based on how they would like to be treated themselves. They tend to be very considerate of others, and may take a long time to mull over their own beliefs to make sure they seem right. The values-refining process can take quite a bit of time and requires mental solitude. Fi generally puts authenticity in high esteem and is repulsed by anything that seems fabricated or shallow.\n\n- Ne - extroverted iNtuition\n\nNe is the main way FiNe’s take in information. This means they use their intuition to find patterns, underlying principles, and ideas, and to form connections as they talk, write, or create. Ne flourishes when given new, interesting concepts to consider and consistently seeks out new inspiration from the outside world. For the FiNe, Ne is paired with Fi and “serves” it in the sense that it comes after it in terms of preference. This means that Ne will most often be used to explore values and ideals in all of their facets. Because Ne is extroverted, it primarily works by engaging with outside sources. This may look like having discussions with others who are also open to exploring the possibilities of a topic, or doing a lot of self-expression through writing or an art form. \n\n- Si - introverted Sensing\n\nSi is the FiNe’s third function, and it gives a sense of solidity to their Fi beliefs. Si also makes the Fi-led internal world structured and detailed. When it comes to values that they have had adequate time to develop, they tend to have a solid sense of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’. A lot of their perception in these cases is based on their personal experiences. This is because Si places a high value on real world experiences and its impressions of them. FiNe’s store all the interesting experiences and information they gather in their mind in an organized way for future reference. \n\n- Te - extroverted Thinking\n\nTe is the FiNe’s inferior function. This function may be their achilles heel, and is inherently not as strong as their other functions because their highest priority and focus is on Fi. Te is a very logic-oriented way of problem solving. It is the side of them that naturally looks to find a better solution to a problem, improve the efficiency of a process, or critique and refine what is already in place. FiNe’s generally prefer only to use Te only when necessary, rather than to make all of their decisions. Overuse of an inferior function can be very draining, and may be unhealthy when constantly given priority over other functions.\n\nDominant Function and Core of the Internal World:\n\n- Introverted Feeling\n\nFi-dominant types are very warm and caring to those they are close to, especially because they may subconsciously believe that everyone has an inner world similar to theirs. However, they take a while to open up to people, and aren’t likely to approach someone unless that person strikes their interest in some way. Once they let someone into their world, they are likely to keep that connection open as long as harmony remains between the two. For example, if the other person shows themselves to be inauthentic or living out a strong opposition to a value the FiNe holds, the FiNe will retreat from the relationship. As long as those principles aren’t violated, the FiNe will likely be attached to that person for life, whether or not they see them regularly.\n\nFiNe’s are masters of self-care and typically great at putting healthy boundaries in place. They are very empathetic people, so they see the needs of others and want to care for them. However, healthy FiNe’s know that they cannot effectively care for others unless they first care for themselves. They know their limits and aren’t usually afraid of saying ‘no’ when they aren’t able to do something or fit something into their lives.\n\nFi differs from Fe (extroverted Feeling) because Fe is is focused externally and is constantly asking, “How does the group feel about this?”, whereas Fi is focused internally and is constantly asking, “How do I feel about this?” Once their own needs are met, FiNe’s also tend to hone in on one or two significant relationships. They naturally take care of these people and treat them like family. These people could be a romantic partner, a best friend, etc.\n\nFiNe’s are highly protective of their ‘inner circle’, feeling that those they share the intimate details of their persona with are in some ways part of themselves. They will not hesitate to defend themselves or those they are close to if they are attacked or threatened.\n\nFiNe’s are extremely self-aware and spend a lot of time on self-reflection. They are very concerned with the depth and nuances of their values system and spend a large amount of their mental space clarifying, sifting, and refining their beliefs. This process can be very connected to deep emotions for FiNe’s. They might find themselves laughing or crying at the beauty of a seemingly random object that has meaning to them, while bystanders who notice their reaction might be quite confused at their sudden outburst. For some FiNe’s, their emotions run so deep that there have to have been a lot of feelings building under the surface for quite some time before they will burst forth. They tend to seek out things (movies, books, etc.) that will engage their emotions, because following characters they care about through an emotional journey can be very rewarding.\n\nIt’s worth noting that when we talking about Feeling (Fi or Fe) as a cognitive function, we do not necessarily refer to emotions. Emotional experiences or expressions can be related to Feeling (Fe or Fi), but they are not the root cause of the cognitive Feeling. The root of Fi or Fe boils down to a person’s values, meaning what a person thinks is important based on their own conscience and the reasons they believe it’s important. An FiNe’s moral code is derived from what their conscience or "gut instinct" tells them is right, and they generally treat others the way they want to be treated. This Fi value is not based in emotions, but neither does it need to be 100% logical. It is not overly concerned with the REASON behind treating others fairly… It simply ‘feels’ like the good and right thing to do because they themselves want to be treated fairly. \n\nThe FiNe’s driving instinct is to achieve inner harmony by remaining true to themselves, their own values, and minimizing the influence that external factors (societal expectations, and maybe even the opinions of friends and family) have on their values. They may love discussing or even debating their values with others, as long as they are able to remain true to themselves while doing so. After a lengthy discussion, FiNe’s need time by themselves to evaluate the conversation and consider what the other person said and how they might fit it into their value system.\n\nFiNe’s find their own principles to be trustworthy and valuable, and are inherently skeptical of  others that try to impose on them. If something does not line up with their beliefs, they cannot act in accordance with it. To go against their own values is to cause inner discord, which FiNe’s can’t tolerate for long.\n\nFiNe’s can get lost in their own world of trying to figure out what a stranger, who is sitting 20 feet away from them in a coffee shop, is thinking, how their day is going, what their life must be like, etc. They love people watching, but aren’t typically interesting in getting up close and personal with most people as they feel pressured to react and respond appropriately in real interactions. They may even Imagine a conversation with someone rather than actually speaking to them in real life, as imaginary people don’t have demands or expectations of them.\n\nFiNe’s tend to have an active imagination well into adulthood. Fi-doms are very concerned with The Story of/behind various things. For example, they might see a large, sturdy tree and wonder how long it’s been there, and try to imagine the events it’s been around for, or who else sat in its shade, what wisdom might be attached to or inside of that tree, etc. They automatically look for meaning everywhere - in books, movies, a passing remark from a friend, a special cup they like to use, or even why a certain tree was planted in a certain place.\n\nFiNe’s tend to assign meaning to everything. Because they are so involved with and entangled in the depth and nuance of the meaning of everything, and how the meaning of something relates to everything else, it can become incredibly captivated by the right idea or story. When something sparks their imagination, or taps into an aspect of meaning that carries a lot of weight with an FiNe, they become entranced by the story or idea. The process of a story unfolding can be more meaningful to an FiNe than the sum of the story’s parts. \n\nSecond Function and the Core of the External World:\n\n- Extroverted iNtuition\n\nFiNe’s have a very abstract way of looking at the world. Ne is their second function, and it makes them naturally oriented toward theories, patterns, and new ideas or principles.\n\nFiNe’s have a world of theories that are swirling around at any given time, and it’s important for them to have time alone in order to develop them. Their best ideas will usually come when they have a sense of inner peace and enough inspiration. Many FiNe’s find mindfulness, meditation, or another form of intentional relaxation to be useful for obtaining peace.\n\nFiNe’s can find inspiration in almost anything, because their Fi finds meaning in everything. As far as inspiration goes, learning interestings things, reading interesting books, taking a walk, or having a good conversation are all common stimuli. For the ideas that have had some time to percolate, they need to have places for output. Whether it’s writing, speaking, teaching, building, designing, or something else, it’s important to have a space to string together their ideas in a unique way. This can also help them to refine and perfect the expression of their ideas. While they may feel like they understand something fully in their head, and they often make great teachers, they may not be as adept at explaining things to others without previous practice.\n\nFiNe’s love novelty. They are always looking for a new shiny puzzle to solve or a new thing to learn about. They can get bored with something after reaching a basic level of competence. Even still, FiNe’s often have one or two things that remain as a thread throughout their lives - the things that are most meaningful to them, which they have never found boring. It’s likely they will eventually become an expert in these areas if they don’t lapse for too long in their study or practice of them.\n\nFiNe’s love considering ideas, possibilities, and the future. They are less concerned with “what is” or the current moment. It can be tough for FiNe’s to savour the moment and to celebrate their successes as they naturally look at what they need to do next.\n\n\nThird Function and Supporting Role in the Internal World:\n\n- Introverted Sensing\n\nSi is all about how real world, 5-senses (seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, and smelling) experiences affect FiNe’s. They value their own experiences very highly, and typically have a very good memory or catalogue of details about their experiences that they deem important stored away. FiNe’s tend to very nostalgic and sentimental about things that hold deep meaning for them. Perhaps they like having a certain kind of cake on their birthday every year because their mother made it for them growing up, or they might be very attached to certain objects that mean something to them. \n\nFiNe’s value vastly different 'traditions' or rituals from most people, and demonstrate them in less obvious ways. To put it another way, their traditions are often not very ‘traditional’. At times get into a good daily rhythm that they unconsciously follow. it’s easiest for them to keep going on this rhythm in their day to day life and it helps them feel more balanced. However, when something interrupts their rhythm, they might have trouble picking it up again once the interruption ends. \n\nTheir internal world is pretty ‘set’ and solid-feeling as they enter adulthood. A lot of their basic values have been decided fairly early on, and they fall back on these until new experiences, ideas, or realizations cause them to reevaluate certain values. They may consider themselves to be pretty open-minded. However, when faced with a new principle that they have no experience with, they will need a lot of time to themselves to evaluate their stance on the subject. Once they have had adequate time to consider the matter, even if they don’t have it figured out 100%, they feel better knowing that they have reached some level of understanding within themselves.\n\nSi is a very detail oriented function that makes FiNe’s confident in using solutions that have worked in the past, and they can use this to their advantage when necessary to stay organized in their job, at home, or in any hobby that requires detailed organization and quick-solution problem solving. FiNe’s tend to have a good balance when it comes to choosing between applying a new innovation and a previously successful solution. \n\nLast Function and the Supporting Role of the Internal World:\n\n- Extroverted Thinking\n\nTe is a process that allows FiNe’s to take in information from the real world, make quick decisions on what the most effective solution is, and put that solution into play right away. This is the weakest, achilles’ heel part of the FiNe. Although it would be exhausting and unhealthy for them to rely on this aspect of themselves all the time, they can pull out their troubleshooting skills when necessary to get a job done effectively.\n\nWhile FiNe’s prefer to take their time on decision making, it isn’t always possible or practical. In these situations, it’s useful to have Te so that they can make quick, in-the-moment decisions. Because they are relying on their ‘gut instinct’ Fi internal compass in the background, they can feel comfortable with their decision even if they can’t articulate a solid reason for it at the time. For example, if they have the sense that someone they see walking down the street could be harmful to them in some way, they don’t have time to untangle why they have that feeling. They just know they don’t feel safe next to this person, and the best solution is the cross the street or take a detour in order to avoid them.\n\nIn a lot of cases, Te is the protector function of the FiNe. When one of their values comes under attack, they have no problem using a direct, matter-of-fact Te communication style to defend what they feel is right. When they feel so strongly about a subject that they know they must take action on it, they tap into this part of themselves that is powerful and commanding to take a stand for that what they believe is right. Te can also be the part of FiNe’s that tells them to just pick something (a career, a hobby, an outfit, etc) and stick with it, at least for a short period of time. It’s the smaller part of FiNe’s that pushes them to come to a conclusion and be decisive. If it was purely up to their Fi, they would contemplate how they feel about it forever. \n\nAn FiNe who is forced to act out of this Te problem-solving, critiquing side of their persona for a large portion of their time (for work, or parenting, etc) is likely to become burnt out, and might experience decision fatigue very quickly. They generally do best when they can allow someone else to take over the decision-making in at least part of their life. If they must make all the decisions in their job, and all the parenting decisions, and all the relationship decisions, etc., then when it comes time for simple, self care decisions like deciding what to eat for dinner or what route to take home from work, they are already exhausted and will struggle to know what they want. \n\nFiNe’s best use their Te when there is already a system in place, as it is easiest for them to use the simplest version of Te - critiquing and refining. When something is already in place and needs improvement, it can be easier to analyze it and see the solution. When starting from scratch, FiNe’s might have lots of ideas, but the act of putting systems and and structures of efficiency into place is harder for them.\n\nsource: typeinmind[.]com/fine
19	This is just way fucking long hahaha peace ✌🏻
7	Yes, very accurate. I like when see Fi described as something other than soft and mushy or selfish.\n\nI think I sometimes offend Ti users when I tell them that I think the Fi process is similar to the Ti process, (that makes sense, right? Introverted judging function), only, it's concerned with morality rather than logic. Is this morally right? instead of, Is this logical? Also with figuring out what causes emotions and what are the underlying motivations. Fi is not just a big bucket of goo.
1	I honestly don't agree with the Fi descritpion. I don't think our values and morals are a core part of Fi, rather a byproduct. I think an actual core element is the crave for inner emotional order. In order to reach and keep it that way you need to set borders to act and judge accordingly in the outside world.\n\n&#x200B;
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/u_mzcherryblossom] [INFP Description.](https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MzCherryBlossom/comments/axrki2/infp_description/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
1	Now that someone TRULY understands me to my core, I end up feeling kinda...basic. 
19	Is it possible to be INFP and Stoic?	
24	Stoic: a person who can endure pain or hardship without showing their feelings or complaining. \n\nAbsolutely, we tend to not show our hand that often which causes people to think we are one big mystery, stoicism is just an extension of that. \n\n
5	Yep, I have an INFP friend who barely shows any emotions unless he's close to you or wants to be close to you
2	Yes, I really don't like showing my emotions to people in general, and it makes uncomfortable because I'm afraid of what people will think. If I had a close friend who I could share my feelings with, then I might share my feelings with that person, but there's no one like that in my life right now.
9	How do you keep up idealism when you see awful things	I'm into politics and an infp. Not the greatest combination, at least in my case. I was doing research on politics of East Asia and World War Two. Basically made me fall into this whole huge rabbit hole of the most disgusting war crime atrocities known to man. It was absolutely horrible. The rape of nanjing, the holocaust, et cetera. I ended up seeing a lot of shit I regretted seeing. But somehow I couldn't look away. The fact that people are capable of committing this stuff, lying about it, denying it, disgusts me and cracks my whole worldview that people are essentially good. I still feel that way, but it is very hard to sometimes. Knowing that animals the same species as my parents and best friend are capable of doing this kind of thing. How can I keep up optimism?
7	I think its always important to remember two things when it comes to people.\n\n1. Almost nobody does bad things because they want to be a bad person. They do it because they rationally think its the right thing.\n\n2. All people including yourself have the potential to become monsters within certain circumstances, and its worth thinking hard about that so you can work on avoiding it as best as you can.\n\nI believe what makes a person truly good is to consciously choose to not be a monster despite their overwhelming ability to be one.
2	I had to stop being so involved. It was really hurting my mental health. I hope that someone can give you an answer on how to do so in a healthy way, but I couldn't. I had to just pull myself away and put up blinders. I still know about what is going on and I still care and hurt, but if I let myself dwell then I could spend the entire day just sobbing.
2	If we could only "unsee" the "seen."  I struggle too with optimism and find myself uncomfortably numb to the reality before us.  Whats the point of this clusterfuck?  It makes no sense...
2	[deleted]
2	I found out last night that a friend's friend who was gang raped at her own house and now I am so disturbed I feel like fleeing my country to some safe secluded world.. 
3	This is why I'm an anarchist. I believe people are essentially pretty much good but they are turned into monsters by authority in its various forms. Look up the Milgram Experiment.
1	Balance the bad with good. For every bad person there is a good person. Did you see the movie Hacksaw Ridge? It is based on a true story of Desmond Doss, a WWII army medic who refused to kill. It truly is a remarkable story and it may help you remember there are truly good people in the world too.
1	I think idealism relates more to your own self-comportment. So yes, keep your idealism. Think of how much shittier the world would be if you didn't have intelligent, wise, idealistic people to look up to, rare as they are. You can be one of those people and end up influencing others. \n\nI'm actually struggling with something similar, because while I have a lot of responsibilities, I'm feeling more and more of a need to do something to directly address climate change. And play music and be creative in general. I can't just quit my current job though or stop taking classes. 
1	I gave up believing in the goodness of humans long ago.  However, individuals are not the same as the whole story of all of us.  When we make the conscious choice to be/do good, we pull away from the instinctual and tribal mindsets that often lead down those dark paths.
1	It's all part of duality consciousness of opposites in opposition. You first start by deconstructing that within yourself and then you start to expand that outward. This planet is in a fallen state on purpose. 
29	Never grew out of my teen angst phase :(	I’m reaching my late 20s and it’s just not cute anymore. I’m too old to be a sad tumblr girl cliché. How do I outgrow it
12	I've felt this way before. I think it helps to start thinking of it as being "sensitive" as opposed to teen angst and just trying to react as maturely as possible
6	You just gotta change the aesthetic. Become a wine mom     \nObviously don’t, but you kinda just have to practice patience and self awareness until it’s natural. Or don’t, nobody’s forcing you to change who you are, and maybe there are positive aspects that you could shift your identity to be around
5	I feel this way often. But I've  also seen many older adults act like complete toddlers, so I guess acting like a teen in your late 20s isn't that bad. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n'
5	Stop, please fucking stop....\n\nStop trying to be like everyone else.\n\nYour an individual and your perspective is both needed and valued.\n\nI don't need clones of myself circle jerking each other off ideologically.\n\nSometimes I need that ennui ridden middle aged Tumblr woman to provide me with a perspective I have missed or ignored, because sometimes she is right and I am wrong.\n\nYour more important than you know. Don't throw yourself away, some of us love who you are. 
3	For me? Medication, sun lamp therapy, CBT, counseling, and general self care. Turns out it wasn't teen angst after all.
4	Just read Kafka and Dostoevsky all the time, then you'll have the excuse.
6	Don’t change op
2	It's not a bad thing, so long as it isn't causing legitimate problems in your life. \nIf it IS causing problems (like with relationships, work, school, etc.), then try to find a way to quarantine it, of sorts. Take whatever feeds said angst, and find a new outlet for it. For me, that was writing, but you could do it with almost any form of art.\nIt takes something that might be seen as unpleasant and turns it into something most people can enjoy, or even relate to.
89	After dropping countless hobbies, I finally picked up photography and fell in love! So here’s yet another sunset picture	
4	That's so beautiful 😍
5	Stunning 
3	I hope you can keep it up.\n\nI am trying to stick to only a few hobbies as well.
3	Beautiful
2	Photography is one of those hobbies I've never given up, I was 8 when I got my hands on a camera for the first time. Now that I'm turning 20 I still love it just as much.
1	Are INFP emotionally selfish?	I had a 4 month relationship but broken up with an INFP girl that I met in college. I am an ENTP 3w4. I know that this isn't /r/dating_advice or /r/relationships, but hear me out and I need some perspective from the INFP side. I'm 23, she's 20. I try to keep an open perspective and sorry for the generalisation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the start of the relationship, I sense a great deal of interest from the girl I have met through a mutual friend during my first semester. I had a few tests where i tested grounds on reciprocity and felt her genuine interest in me. I confessed and we started dating as a couple. First two months was awesome. We showed each other a great deal of love and there was a lot of physical touch.\n\nI genuinely treated her well and because I was an INFP before, i do understand what she wants. I had self-esteem issues and depression in the past, I have since taken anti-depressants (prozac) and that changes my personality a whole lot. I became much more robotic, tend to favor logic over emotions. I disagree that mbti cannot be changed, it definitely does especially if your neuro-chemicals in the brain are somewhat 'altered.' I also studied psychology in the past which is where i first started knowing about MBTI and cognitive functions. So other than ENTP, the next personality that i know the most is INFP.\n\nContinuing where I left off, I just find myself way more invested in the relationship than her. Since school started, i have almost been with her close friend and her, and not much on myself or spend much time outside her. I tend to walk her home everyday despite the long walks back to the train. But sometimes when I do, I wished she could have walked me to the train instead especially when her house is nearer to school than my house. When I do ask, she would reject at the start of the relationship. As my personality crave constant mental stimulation from deep topics that I do not get from her or her ISFP friend, it started draining me out. My time, My energy and what I want to do. But i am willing to sacrifice and accommodate because I really do love spending time for her and she does to me, but i feel that she could do a lot more to sacrifice and accommodate to me so that I don't have to do so much of the accommodating. Well, she did say that if I want to spend time with my friends, I should. But I do also realized that she will miss me if I do.\n\nShe also spends a lot more time with her ISFP friend than me. We had an argument once and she admitted that she don't know how to prioritize me over her friends. I do believe that in a relationship, sometimes it matters to put 'boyfriend' over friends first. I'm saying that she should only spend time with me, but rather, at least ask me out or plan something for me? Afterall, during my birthday, she clumsily wrapped pens with foolscap paper and give me as a Christmas present and spend the new year with her ISFP friend, drinking and having a good time while i stayed at home alone. My birthday is also on December but on that day i planned where to go, we split the bill and just chatted at a garden. How i wished that instead of me doing the planning, she would do something out of surprise instead because she wants me to be happy? or rather, like she would just say 'Hey, lets go for a drink. A treat for you?' She did say that if I wanted anything, i could ask her, but isn't it obligation at this point if I ask. Like, "Can you plan something for me because I have been AN AMAZING BOYFRIEND and I deserve it?"\n\nThings have gone terribly bad last month. I had prelims and so does she. For valentines, I self-made chocolates that turned out very nice even though I didn't made them before. I spend a whole deal of effort, because since im a poor college student, i tried to give as best i can give. I wrote her a card and gave it together to her with a spritz of my perfume to remind her (: Because She hadn't celebrated valentines day before, I just decided we should just go out on that day after telling her no because i was feeling feverish (she said okay) but then i changed my mind for her (and she got abit annoyed), we went out for dinner and drinks but i paid for them because she coyingly ask if i'm paying. (even though she said she is the kind of girl, who doesnt want me to waste my parent's money before). And I didn't get anything from her except a 'thank you, i really appreciate it.'\n\nWords means nothing. It is cheap. Especially when she had a quote 'actions expresses priorities.' I called her out a day after that and apparently 'trampled' her values by naming things that she did that is contrary to her 'beliefs.' On the first day of prelims, I had a bad day, I went home thrashed my computer and my hobbies so that I would concentrate better on my studies. I had a breakdown. I ignored her calls and went home straight. I asked if i can meet her? She said can, and to text her when I reach. (She didn't specify her location so i thought home because she said she wanted to go home after prelims but actually said she would wait for me and try to accommodate to me after we had the argument but since I went home, i thought she would too). I took a taxi to her house only to find that she is still at school? At least you could have told me where she is especially when she know that I have a bad day? At this point I was tired, and messaged her to break up. She said she was going to meet her and so, she took the public transport over to find me. I had a bout of crying and vulnerability. I asked her if we should continue because I really want to, but she refused. She said it's taking a toll on her and she didn't find she did anything wrong when we had a argument that she can do more. We broke up.\n\nAt home, I texted her if we can changed things and asked for a second chance. She said "I need a daddy not a son." "I don't give second chances to anyone", even though I gave her another chance when we broke up in 2 weeks where she said she would do better to give. I was devastated. There she can act like a child to me but I can't do the same. I feel like she rejected the vulnerable side of me and said "it is self-care". When I say she didn't sacrifice enough for me, she said 'is my time not sacrificing for you?' But actually, when she is not with her friend, she is with me. There is no cost to her actually. She said that the relationship was stressful as she knows that i'm giving a lot but she is stressed on how she should give back? But nothing tangible has came out.\n\nAnd to add fuel to fire, she enjoyed studying with a guy friend (who dislike me and badmouths me to her in text) and her ISFP friend and would defend that guy and get angry at me for approaching him to ask a question related to my studies. She would also often text multiple guys at frequencies more often than me. To her credit, I'm not a texter anyways but it gets annoying to see her phone buzzing so often when I'm spending time with her.\n\nDo INFPs feel that emotionally-vested in themselves that they forget that others too have emotions? I feel like they like to hide behind the facade of 'im scared of being hurt' as an excuse not to give and be vulnerable even when others do to them. I just find that some have the tendency to one-up others of others plight and put themselves first.  I am a taker but i put in my every effort to give, but she didnt. I find that she likes to be loved but doesn't know how to love.\n\nTl;dr: I feel my ex didn't give enough tangibly. we broke up due to a mismatch of expectations. She prioritise her friends over me. Am i actually expecting too much? Perhaps i'm insecure. I really don't know.\n\nAny thoughts from the side of INFPs?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
9	Dude listen to what you’re asking. You’re asking if an entire personality type are emotionally selfish assholes.\n\nUm, no?\n\nThis sounds like a rant about one individual and it probably sucks what you’re going through, but I don’t know how this subreddit can help except recommend you find someone better. It’s honestly pretty rude of you to come here with your generalizations.\n\nYour red flag was that you were way more invested than she was. It’s sad it ended when you worked so hard, but there’ll be someone who will reward you for your efforts.
3	> She said "I need a daddy not a son."\n\nYou are dealing with immaturity, not an MBTI type.  It sounds like you are both poor at communicating.  That comes with time and practice, so I'd suggest you look at where you made mistakes so that you don't repeat them in future relationships.  Don't waste your time with blame, that does not help you grow.  She'll never find a partner if she seeks daddies or sons.  Unless you want to be in a skewed relationship, it's ok to let this one go.\n\nI get the sense that you see love as conditional - I give this much to you, therefor you owe me the same.  She doesn't owe you squat.  If you give in order to get, you'll always end up disappointed.  If you give in order to know the joy of giving, you'll always be content no matter what comes back to you.  As you observed, her actions showed you how she really feels/felt.  You'll do well to heed that instead of what she says or what you want to have happen.\n\n> I called her out a day after that ... by naming things that she did that is contrary to her 'beliefs.'\n\nYou sank your own ship by doing that.  Even if you are fully justified and see the truth of how it went, that was an unhelpful move.  You cannot reason someone into an emotional decision, and are likely to hurt your cause if they react negatively to being told how to feel.\n\nYour tl;dr is a good summary.  Figure out how you can avoid those pitfalls in your next relationship, you'll be able to look back at this trying time as a good lesson.
2	I think I can relate to her in some ways.\n\nI think I know what she meant by "I want a daddy, not a son". I want to depend on my bf even if it's for smallest matters. That's not because i can't do things on my own. I've been single for almost 5 years, so I depended on myself all the time. I didn't have much friends too, and almost all alone all the time. So, I definitely know how to depend on myself. But, when I got into a relationship, I want to depend on him. I don't want to be depended to be honest. My thoughts were "why would I stay in a relationship if i can't depend on other person?". But, my bf changed my mind and I'm trying to be a person whom my bf can depend on. I still don't like the idea of being depended on but I'm trying my best to be a person who can comfort my bf when he's feeling down.\n\nI think she's like me in that way. I don't know for sure. It's just my assumption.\n\nNext one, it seems like you were expecting a lot from her, but she didn't give you any in return. Maybe, she doesn't like you enough, given the fact that she texts other guys and stay close to another male who's not you.\n\nOr, maybe, she is like me, a person who didn't know or realise that a favour should be returned.\n\nI didn't know that I have to return the feelings or actions that would make another person happy till I met my bf. Believe it or not, I simply didn't know that I have to return the favours. That's why I was misunderstood as a person who didn't understand "give and take", and hated by an older female. I didn't know why she hated me till I become older. I guess I'm pretty dumb. :3\n\nYou said that you wished she could do surprises. Well, if she were like me, then I can understand her. I don't initiate in almost all matters. I'm INFP/T. I found myself quiet in group talks. I don't do initiation in almost everything. I was surprised that my girl friends make self-made stuffs and give their boyfriends as a gift. I didn't even have that kind of idea to be honest. I do give him gifts on his birthday, Gifts which are actually useful to him. Surprises? That idea didn't even pop up in my mind till you mention it now. :3 . I feel sorry for my bf, for having quite a dumb gf. Also, I can't show my feelings, like how I love him so much.\n\nThat was the reason why I broke up with my ex. I didn't show any affection nor said to him that I really liked him, but I liked him so much. After he left me, I was really sad and hurt. I tried to improve myself and tried to show my affections and love to my current bf now. So, if she's like me, then maybe she doesn't know how to show affection?\n\nYou said, "I feel like they like to hide behind the facade of 'im scared of being hurt' as an excuse not to give and be vulnerable even when others do to them." You're saying exactly as my bf did. He also said that to me, that I wasn't doing anything, while he was taking risk for me. I too, was afraid of getting hurt again after my ex. I didn't want to take risk, and stayed behind "I'm scared of getting hurt". But after a lot of fights and arguments with my bf, I decided to take risk for him, and tried to get out of "I'm scared of getting hurt". If she really loves you, then I think she will try to take risk like I did. Though it took lots of efforts for my bf to make me risk like that..\n\nAlso, you're right about "I find that she likes to be loved but doesn't know how to love.", I want to be loved, but I don't know how to love someone. It's difficult for me to show affections and love to someone. But, I tried to improve that part of me and tried to show my feelings. But I still find difficulties in expressing my feelings.\n\nI am not telling you that she's like me or all INFPs are like that. It's just that I find her similar to me(based on your description). So, perhaps if she was like me? That's what I thought.\n\nI think your relationship can continue if she decided to change for you like I did for my bf. If not, then it's better you find someone who can fulfill your wishes.\n\nI wish you all the best.
1	I'm not emotionally selfish, I'm an empathetic altruist. 
1	Why do you think she was infp ?\n
1	Infp are idealist, she probably idealize your rs first but then realize it wasn't what she expect. So she just try to stick to it without really trying. 
1	> But actually, when she is not with her friend, she is with me. There is no cost to her actually.\n\nAlone time is *very* valuable to me.\n\n---\n\nIn any case, forget about the whole MBTI thing, and just look at it as a relationship between two humans. Applying an MBTI lense could cloud things as no one really knows the thought process of another human, and people might be mistyped too.
1	I could possibly lose my virginity to a really attractive girl, but I have zero feelings for her and I’m still hung up on my best friend. What should I do?	I’m a 20 year old guy and I’ve never been in a relationship, or been laid or anything. I’ve made out with 2 girls, one I was too drunk to remember and one I was so scared to go for it she actually had to tell me to just kiss her already. Clearly I’m not some kind of lady’s man lmfao.\n\nRecently though there’s this girl my friends and I hang out with at the weekend that seems pretty interested. She friends with like my friend’s girlfriends so we see each other quite a lot. I’ve known her for a couple of years, and at first she honestly just seemed like some unattainable girl who wouldn’t give me the time of day. She was ridiculously hot. My friend had a thing for her so that made her even more of a no-go in my eyes.\n\nNow though he’s moved on and has a girlfriend, and every time we’re out her and I flirt like hell. On two occasions I’ve been told she wanted to take me home. In the last few days we’ve been snapchatting back and forth and just talking shit. The thing is, while I find her insanely hot, I have no feelings for her at all. I’ve known her for a long time so I know she’s a bit on the crazy side (that sounds like I’m just being a judgemental asshole, but I’ve seen her make massive drama out of the tiniest things). I can’t really see myself being in a relationship with her to be honest.\n\nAnother issue is that I’ve had a massive thing for my best friend for like a couple of years now. I won’t get into that too much, but let’s just say that there’s basically no chance of anything happening between us in the near future. She has a boyfriend, she knows how I feel, and while I think something might be there and I really do have feelings for her, I can’t put my life on hold waiting for her to maybe one day decide she wants me instead. I’m not some ‘Nice Guy’ who thinks if I stay friends with her forever we’re gonna have some kind of happily ever after, she’s my best friend and if that’s all it ever is I’m happy about it.\n\nAnyway, essentially I’m in a kind of ideal situation on paper; there’s a hot girl who at the very least probably wouldn’t mind hooking up with me at some point, and honestly I think that would be a pretty ideal way to lose my V card. She’s experienced, but we know each other well and she knows that I’m a virgin so she’s gonna be understanding about it. I just don’t wanna start talking to her all the time and potentially hooking up with her if I have literally no feelings for her. As much as I’d like to hook up with her, the last thing I want is to play with her emotions and make her feel like shit. To add to that, as much as I feel pathetic for it, I’m still kind of hung up on my best friend. I know I have to move on, and this would probably help a shit ton, but it still just feels kinda wrong to me, and while I want to do it, I’m not sure if hooking up with a girl who I have no feelings for just because she’s attractive is the way to go. Not to mention the fact she really is a bit crazy (for some fucked up reason I find that a little bit hot which will probably bite me in the ass lmfao), and if things get complicated between us I don’t want things in our friend group to get weird. At the same time, it’s not like this is an opportunity that comes up often, and I feel like I’d be an idiot to just pass it by without thinking it through first. So what’s the best option here, should I just go for it, or is it a bad idea?
3	I find that an awful idea unless you both are fine with a casual little hookup-thing. You said you can't see yourself in a relationship with her so let's be real: your motivations to bang her are completely selfish. Losing your virginity, getting over another girl... If she doesn't know your true thoughts and feelings *yet* has her own heart in the game, she will feel used and you will have used her. Think careful. Hope you find what you're looking for though! 💕
3	Does this hot girl know you’re not serious about her, consider her crazy, would not date her, and are just in it for sex?\n\nMake sure to let her know so she’s ok with that or else you’re just being an asshole. But the fact that telling her would make you seem like an asshole doesn’t seem promising.
3	Whatever you do or do not, don't hurt others, if there's no such option, choose the one of least harm.
1	My friend I’ll probably get hated for this but it’s what I think.  I wouldn’t think of sex this way.  Personally I’m a Christian  I think sex is special.  But even I wasn’t as involved earlier in life  and I thought people were too reckless with sex.  Especially as you mentioned she has a tendency to be a little dramatic.  She might have some challenges in life, and by sleeping with her, in my experience, that doesn’t help.  These things affect people often on a much deeper level than they think/are willing to admit.  And women are often affected even more strongly. Think about her.  A lot of males talk about virginity and how many women they have slept with etc. etc. etc. and I can tell you I know of those who severely regret it, for a variety of reasons.   When you meet your future wife you can say “I dont have any kids” and not “I don’t have any kids....that I know about”.....   it’s a real thing.  The best most successful people I know were celibate until they got married, and, honestly, the guys that did all this didn’t do too well...  at least in my circles.  Being a “man” isn’t about that kind of thing,  so much more to life.  Focus on school, get good grades, and your world opens up.  Ten years from now you probably won’t care at all about this, but you will care about your family and career.  Focus on your future and make it a good one.  Never sacrifice the short term for the long term.  I WISH I had more people who told me that when I was 20!
1	Fuck the hot crazy girl. Let her know in the beginning that you just want to hook up, no relationship with her. If she is still down go for it. You might not have a chance like that again to learn as much as you can about sex. It will definitely help you in future relationships. Most guys rarely get a chance like this. It will help boost your confidence that you fucked a hot girl. Sex is just an act. Yes it’s a lot more special with someone you love. But it’s a whole lot better than your hand if you catch my drift. Just do it! Get it over with so you can stop wondering what is like. As for the girl you like she is taken you don’t want to be a home wrecker. Stop waiting on her. You could be waiting for years for all you know. Or you might never get a chance with her. Do what’s best for you have have sex.\n\nSource: I had sex with a friend. We ended up becoming friends with benefits. I learned a lot from her, about sex and being in a relationship. It boosted my confidence. I’m a lot better and more confident having gone through that than if I didn’t.
1	I mean imo if you two are fine with just casual sex go for it.\n\nIf you are the type of person who only wants to have sex with people you actually love, I would honestly say still consider it. It's just a good way to get experience and will probably help you in thing run.\n\nSource: 20 year old virgin so take my idea with a grain of salt.\n\nPs. All I'm saying is it shouldn't be a big deal either way.
1	> As much as I’d like to hook up with her, the last thing I want is to play with her emotions and make her feel like shit.\n\nYour story sounds more like you are the one who would end feeling played, while she feels just fine with whatever goes on.\n\nI say dive in!  Then you will have had sex, which removes some of the mystery or mystique about it, allowing you to approach it in the future without it carrying so much weight in your mind.  If she knows you are inexperienced, yet seems willing to lead the way, that sounds much better than floundering around with a woman who may have greater expectations.  That you feel no emotional draw to her could work in your favor - instead of falling head over heels because you got laid, you will simply get laid and continue on like before.  Next week you two could hang out in the friends group without any hangups.\n\nThat she is a bit nuts is always risky.  However, as long as you keep in mind that you didn't want to get in a relationship with her anyway, you can stay secure.  Just be clear up front about no relationship.
1	Do it! Lose it!
41	Upon finding out that I'm an INFP, I also realized that we are also a FiNe SiTe ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)	Stay beautiful my fellow adventure seekers <3 
4	A what now?\n\n&#x200B;

2	Daily INFP random discussion thread - March 06	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
4	One of my fraternity brothers took me under his wing and started showing me how to lift and work out. I've been feeling great lately, it's a nice change to feel good about my body. 
3	I went stargazing with an INFJ girl last night and it was one of the most refreshing and human interactions I’ve had in awhile :)
1	Back on Reddit after a long time away. Seems a lot has changed. 
1	Mulling it over after one Redditor mentioned lifting.\n\nIf the introvert in you is too strong *no pun intended* an at home time-density routine may be very beneficial to you. The privacy of working out alone on your own time and with discipline will give good results.
1	Went on second date with a pretty amazing INTP over the weekend. My first time ever asking someone out, and I’m pretty happy right now.
3	Career Uncertainty	Hello everyone! Hope you all are doing well! I stumbled into this Reddit forum mostly because I'm in a bit of a rut... I've taken multiple different personality quizzes that have stated that I am infp-t and everything that they've stated has been true about myself... However before I started college I had no real insight into myself or what I should be looking into career-wise... I feel as if I was pressured into information technology... My parents wanted to see me go off to college and I didn't want to let them down so I did just that and I went through it, towards the end of my college career I realized that I don't feel as confident or qualified for an IT job anywhere... I have a real interest in technology as a whole and I've always had that kind of interest, in the possibilities of future technology and the development of technology, but when it comes to working on it and maintenance it feels mundane and genuinely unfulfilling to me... It feels empty...\n\nSo today I'm here to ask, what can I do? I'm in a financial rut where if I go back to school to get into something more my speed then I wouldn't be able to pay for my classes or other things for that matter... And I have the qualifications to get a job in my field but I don't enjoy it...the biggest accomplishment that I could ever make in my job is being able to say that I helped create something big, that I helped others with what I helped create, when I look back after retirement... On a smaller scale it would just be that every day I'm able to work with others to solve a real problem dealing with one individual or many... \n\nMy roommates say that I would make a perfect therapist or someone like that because I enjoy listening to people talk about their problems and try to help them work out ways to fix them, I've had friends gravitate toward me back in high school because of this... Not because I was offering the help or working to advertise it but because my friends naturally tend to open up to me about things... I tend to be nosy but not because I just want to know others business but because I want to be able to express my opinion and hope that whatever I have to say could help them in some way... \n\nSo in all, I was pressured into IT and graduated, I find it a very empty field for me personally... I feel like I should have went into something dealing with writing or social work of some kind... I'm struggling as a recent grad with very little money to even try to get back into college... But I don't necessarily want an IT job because I feel like I'm not good at it... What jobs would an infp excel at? What jobs have you all excelled at? what jobs do you recommend me looking into that I could take up, to at least save up some money, or that wouldn't require me to get another degree? This doesn't have to be counseling related either, I want to hear everything so I can assess my greatest options...\n\nSorry about the convoluted multi paragraph explanation but I am doing this half asleep because I had this idea in my head right before bed and I wanted to at least try to get this out in the open and answered... If I made several writing mistakes then it's due to speech to text... Or my own sleep-deprived state...\n\nNo matter what I hope all of you have a great day! \nBest, \nJosh
2	I feel like im stuck in a similar situation as yours but just rewind a few years back. I'm about to complete my high school and my parents want me to take up engineering, IT or any sort of tech branch for that matter but I just.....i just don't feel it man. And when I tell my parents that, they always rant about how I'm escaping hard work or how I'll regret not taking up IT when I'll have a job with significantly less income yada yada but srsly I've always been so unsure about the tech field it's just not for me. I took up physics, chemistry and math in my high school so that I can get into an engineering college but as you said it feels hella "empty" and I can't even cope up with my high school let alone taking up engineering in uni. \n\n\n\nNow getting back to you, I think INFPs mostly excel in the fields related to art and music as I myself am wayyy deep into making music and hip hop dance form tho . Other career choices may also include\n\nArts and Design\n\nFine Artist\n\nFashion Designer\n\nGraphic Designer\n\nMultimedia Artist or Animator\n\nCommunity and Social Service\n\nMental Health Counselor\n\nSchool or Career Counselor\n\nCommunity Service Manager\n\nSocial Worker\n\nEducation and Library\n\nArchivist or Curator\n\nElementary School Teacher\n\nLibrarian\n\nPreschool Teacher\n\nProfessor or College Instructor\n\nSpecial Education Teacher\n\nHealth Care\n\nAudiologist\n\nChiropractor\n\nNutritionist\n\nGenetic Counselor\n\nMassage Therapist\n\nMidwife\n\nOccupational Therapist\n\nPhysical Therapist\n\nSpeech-Language Pathologist\n\nVeterinarian\n\nVeterinary Technician\n\nBusiness and Management\n\nFundraiser\n\nHuman Resources Specialist\n\nTraining or Development Manager\n\nSciences\n\nAnthropologist or Archaeologist\n\nGeographer\n\nHistorian\n\nPsychologist\n\nSociologist\n\nZoologist or Wildlife Biologist\n\nCommunications\n\nEditor\n\nFilm Editor\n\nInterpreter or Translator\n\nPhotographer\n\nPublic Relations Specialist\n\nWriter\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some of the career choices that INFPs should typically avoid but oh well at the end of the day it depends on your choice \n\n\n\nMilitary Officer\n\nPolice Officer\n\nMaterials Engineer\n\nElectrician\n\nSystems Analyst\n\nSales Manager\n\nFinancial Manager\n\nAuditor\n\nCost Estimator\n\nEngineering Technician\n\nChemist\n\nChemical Engineer\n\nDentist\n\nLicensed Practical Nurse\n\nJudge\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope the answer helped you and hey don't worry you still have time and your life ahead of you and you'll end up being fine. All the best :)\n\n\n\n\nEdit : typo
7	Learning to live again	These past years, instead of living life, I have simply endured it. \n\nI wonder why nobody is within arm's length, yet I keep them at arm's length.\n\nI wanted so much to become a good person. I attained the good but sacrificed the person \n\nToday I was driving home and realized that the worst of my life has yet to even come, which was hilarious and horrific at the same time \n\nI want to change so much but this is the only l know how to live. if you have any advice please give it to me because i'm really at my wits' end
1	Judging from the way you pieced this together, I would probably go ahead and recommend you find yourself. What I mean is to look for a hobby which you LOVE, of course this may take some time, so go ahead and experiment. Definitely look for your calling in life and chase after it no matter what. Everyone's got gifts to offer to the world and you're no different. \n\nI also recommend keeping certain people close, especially when you feel like everything is just crumbling down. \n\nKeep your eyes peeled! Life is a gift.
1	Maybe you need an adventure where you have to work with and lean on other people.\n\nLike river rafting with a group.\n\n
65	I wrote out my favorite Shakespeare monologue in the form of my favorite line from it	
1	 Love it ☺️\n
2	I watch this when I need to recharge	[https://vimeo.com/8405267](https://vimeo.com/8405267)\n\nThe song and aerial shots lend me some serenity.\n\nShout out to those who found out about this song from that morning rooftop scene in Sense8.
3	Music !	What tracks do you guys resonate with the most? I've been listening to some old Kanye West and I just love dissecting some of his messages. \n\nWondering what tracks you guys would like to share?
2	Tom Misch and HONNE are good especially FKJs \nYou guys should definitely try listening to them. It’s jazzy and chill. You gotta love them 
2	Some of my favorites over the years:\n\n\n1979 - Smashing Pumpkins\n\nFade Into You - Mazzy Star\n\nWhere is my Mind? - The Pixies\n\n\nAdam's Song - Blink-182\n\n\nA Certain Romance - Arctic Monkeys\n\n\nShake Me Down - Cage The Elephant\n\nRobbers - The 1975\n\nSomewhere Only We Know - Keane\n\nSomeday - The Strokes
1	Remixes,\nA happyish Nine Inch Nails song, \nhttps://youtu.be/zb-irQdcysk
1	Muse is one of my favorite band . The exogenesis part 3 " redemption" make me cry everytime , soldier's poem or blackout make me feel so weak. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love to listen to regina spektor too , she knows how to speak to my heart.
1	This song is way out of my usual preferences but I really really like it: Something just like this from Coldplay, although it makes me really sad quite often. I also love Human Touch from Bruce Springsteen.\nOn a side note my two longest playlists on Spotify are my favourite songs from the Beatles and a rock/heavy/punk playlist with things ranging from Red Hot Chilly Peppers to Sabaton or Dragonforce.

1	I like U2 I think they make good music and also have the deeper humanitarian side. My favorites are where the streets have no name, One, sometimes you can't make it on your own, beautiful day. I know they are not everyone's cup of tea. \n\nI also like the Eagles a lot because their music is relaxing and makes me feel like I'm traveling in the desert. Oh and the band America for the same reasons.
7	Does anyone kinda hate Jim Halpert? He seems kinda like a condescending douche. I can’t be the only one that feels this. Though, it seems like the show wants you to like him.	
7	If you don’t like Jim, who DO you like?
3	Michael and Holly >>>>>>>>>>>>
1	Slightly unrelated, but thats basically the reason i detest everything about how i met your mother, and most sitcoms in general. They seem incredibly fake to me, its probably the forced laugh track.
8	Fellow INFPs, how are you able to maintain a healthy lifestyle?	Or are you even? I feel I can't follow any plan for more than two weeks at a maximum, whether it's about eating regularly, going to sleep before midnight or exercising. Like I *know* it would do good for me and I have noticed my happiness increases this way but I just can not stay focused long enough for it to become a habit. I'll get bored with the control and routine and just figure it's whatever. Might as well watch YouTube all night, eat breakfast at 2PM and why not also skip a few showers while I'm at it. \n\nI wouldn't feel too bothered otherwise but I think all this laziness is damaging my creativity. I just find it incredibly hard to stay motivated with these kinds of things. Please tell me your success stories or if you don't have any that's okay too. I'm sure a lot of you can relate lol. 
6	This shit is harrrd. I think we kind of abhor routine, on top of being excellent procrastinators, so our ability to enter a slough is unmatched. I've gone through countless times of starting healthier habits only to have it all fold back in on itself when I decide to wander off path.\n\nThe key thing to remember is what you *know*. You *know* it does good for your body/mind to do it. Willpower needs exercise as much as any muscle. Push through, even when you find it boring, repetitive, difficult, outside of your current mood, etc. because the you at the other end will be glad you did.
3	Depends on how bad I want something. I'm pretty great at discipline actually.\n\nI slowly start implementing things. I started to wake up 15 minutes earlier at a time, until I got to a good point.\n\nI just know that if I dont exercise or eat right, my body suffers and I dont need that.\n\nI make sure to eat veggies/take vitamins/go running because the consequences of NOT doing those things far outweighs the little time and effort it takes to do them. \n\nForcing myself to stick to lists and schedules makes me fail every time. \n\nI just need to decide to to it, for myself, by myself, no lists or charts.
3	Your problem might be that you jump into things too quickly and too forcefully. If you are trying to get a car unstuck from the snow, it might make the most sense to step on the gas and gun it to get out, but that will dig your tires further into the snow. The best way to get a car unstuck is to rock it back and forth and build momentum until it is able to drive it's way out. Instead of making a list of difficult things that you want to do everyday, pick something important but small to do every day. Show your subconscious mind that you are able to better yourself through habit. This will snowball into more intense and higher quantity of habits that you build. What I do is implement 1 positive habit or deconstruct 1 negative habit every month. If I need more time, I will give myself more time but that hasn't happened yet.
2	It's hard. I have had some success with an exercise routine in the past. I was doing You are your own gym by mark lauren, which has a phone app with timers and bodyweight exercises. I liked that I didn't need any equipment and I didn't have to go anywhere, and I didn't have to come up with exercises for myself, because the program told me what to do. I just had to make the time for it. Then I just did it whenever I could fit it in during the week. If a missed a week or two, I just started where I'd left off and didn't worry too much about it.\n\nIt helped that my sister was also trying to exercise regularly, so we would ask each other on the phone if we had done our exercise for that week. Even that small accountability helped. Maybe we should start an infp exercise accountability thread? I've been doing exercise again lately, but missed the last couple of weeks because I hurt my leg, but then continued being lazy even after my leg was better. I guess I'd better do it tomorrow.\n\nAs for eating, I don't think skipping meals is a big deal. I personally feel much better when I don't eat breakfast.\n\nWhen it comes to junk food, it's an addiction. If you can manage to replace it with good things and stay away from it for several weeks, you'll probably find that you don't want it anymore and that it doesn't taste good or makes you feel sick when you do have it.\n\nSleep is the hardest one. Especially when you live in a house full of people and night is your only time alone without interruptions. I don't really have any suggestions, other than trying to think of how awful you're going to feel the next day if you stay up all night.
2	I set things up so I'm around people who motivate me, directly and indirectly, to do more. I also make critical things as habitual as possible. \n\nOf course, if I'm in the middle of a project, even the apocalypse won't make me take a break. But for daily things, I rely on habit and socialization. 
2	You can try building habits in layers, so focusing on one thing at a time and building up.\n\nSo I started with the goal of going to the gym 3 times a week, and now that that's on it's way for a couple of months, I'm moving to going to meetups or volunteering once a week. I don't set a strict schedule, because that will fail, but I sent a quantity goal.\n\nWhen push comes to shove, it's just visualizing the ideal of who you want to be and making yourself get there.
1	Lift heavy, do HIIT, do yoga, eat Paleo, incorporate time restricted eating. Being healthy was hard when I was younger, but after seeing how much control we have over our bodies, I can't pass it up even with the monotony. You just have to want it. You need that INFP laser focus to really make it work. Can't just turn that on and off for everything, but it is certainly possible.
17	Thoughts overpower music at times?	I love music and I can get into the rhythm/lyrics really deeply but only if I focus. The moment I lose focus and my mind wanders, my thoughts and daydreams begin to drown out the music from my headphones. Especially if it’s a song that I don’t really recognize. Does anyone else get this?? 
5	Yeah, i get it all the time. When listening to music while working I'll use it as background music, to help me focus. The music gets lost a little but my subconsciousness is more productive.  I have different playlists for working ( mostly instrumentals) and others for really listening and getting lost in the music.  \nI also have playlist that are soundtracks for my thoughts :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the music helps you think and daydream, i guess it's doing it's job. If it sticks, it's a treasure :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	I find that the music drowns me out sometimes, especially if I really like it. I can't concentrate with music on, because I start focusing on the movement.
2	This is a problem? I listen to music in order to enjoy the mind wandering and daydreaming.that goes with it. I often will listen to the lyrics and try to interpret them to my current story idea. This generates all kinds of good ideas. 
1	sometimes it takes me a good amount of repeated listens to even find out what the song’s about 
1	Yes, I can be out for a walk with my headphones on and completely daydream away an album full of songs. 
1	I cannot be the only one that creates stories for different songs.
1	literally all the time. i'll be listening to a song i really like, and then like 2 minutes later, i realize i was paying absolutely no attention to the song, and then i'll start it over because i wanted to hear it lol.
1	This happens to me a ton a have 2 bands I listen to all the time and I will find sometimes I will of listened to a whole song and my mind just skims through the song and it's like background music that whole time.
72	Galaxies in your mind	
2	Wow,cool!
1	When sharing peoples art it's best to give credit 
3	Broke up with gf but feeling kind of sad for her	I broke up with this girl I've been dating for the last few months. She was a great person- kind, fun, and compassionate. We had a lot of similar interests and although we dated for a short amount of time, I had a lot of good memories with her. I really don't have anything negative to say about her, which is totally uncommon for any girl I've dated.\n\nThe main reason I broke up with her is because we had different long-term goals in life, especially in regards to where we wanted to live. I'd been thinking about this for a while but I just couldn't picture the relationship lasting.\n\nI decided to break up with her a few days ago for this reason. She was pretty upset and cried while we talked. She said I was such a good guy and laid back that I should never settle for anyone who wouldn't treat me right.\n\nI'm not regretting this decision because I knew it wouldn't work in the end. I just feel bad for her because I know she genuinely meant what she said. I don't like making people upset and I know this comes back to my personality. It just kind of sucks feeling that I hurt someone. 
3	I feel you man. That drive to please others is great sometimes, but can often lead you to feel trapped in situations when you sacrifice your own desires for others.\n\nI commend and am totally inspired by your ability to put yourself first. I once stayed in an emotionally abusive relationship for almost two years because I was too afraid to hurt her by leaving, and it took police intervention for me to finally leave. Your situation isn’t the same as mine, but I can empathize with how hard it must’ve been to follow through with your decision.\n\nStay strong friend 
2	That's actually a good sign: you are a caring person.\n\nJust beware for your future relationships, that you may be avoiding them, actually walling yourself. No relationship is perfect, and our goals change as life hits. 
2	What movies and podcast episodes remind you there are things to look forward to?	Hello all,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou know that Bic Runga song where she despairs "I feel so uninspired!" -- I haven't understood how void that feeling can be until now. So, I thought I'd turn to this community to ask for help. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think it would help me to read about the movies/podcasts you turn to when you're feeling empty but want to keep up the faith that this too shall pass into a better phase. It doesn't have to be limited to movies and podcasts, I only mentioned them because they're the media I consume the most.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease feel free to be as specific and descriptive as you like with a particular scene or an episode you're fond of. Otherwise, just the title would be fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSincerely,\n\nfatwombat88 
2	Most Wes Anderson films do this for me, My personal favorites are The Royal Tenenbaums, Rushmore, and The Darjeeling Limited. \n\nThe film Bohemian Rhapsody was also very uplifting (for me), maybe in part because I love Freddy Mercury and I love Queen and I found Freddy’s character, the way he was portrayed by Ramy Malek, very relatable. 🤓\n\nThe Moth (podcast) is also uplifting. It’s a platform where people share a significant personal story, usually some sort of hardship and how they overcame it etc. i enjoy the way people do story telling on The Moth and it’s something to do/focus on during a long car ride. It also makes me hopeful that maybe, someday, I’ll be looking at this endless depression from a distance, as maybe I’ll have made it through.
2	Doctor who episode "vincent and the doctor"\nThis final scene in the museum 😭
2	- Elizabethtown: ["So, you failed."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrf263yJwic)\n\n- A Japanese movie, [To Each His Own](https://kissasian.sh/Drama/To-Each-His-Own/Movie?id=36251): The Japanese title translates to "In just a little bit, I'm going to quit my job." After having to watch the protagonist for most of the film getting his soul crushed by a toxic, dead-end job, the scene where he finally resigns is quite cathartic, from the frustration of his abusive boss, his redemption from being falsely accused, and his irrepressible joy at finally being free.
2	Bob's burgers season 5 episode 1, "Work Hard or Die Trying, Girl"\nThey spend most of the episode being shitty to one another, everyone being very self serving, but in the end they put their differences aside and work together, include everyone, and Carly Simon sings the song in the credit. I shed a tear every time I see this episode, like I am so happy for the creators of bobs burgers, it's done very well, the musical numbers are good and it's funny while still portraying a positivemessage, I thi k. And I feel so happy for the people who make that show, it's obviously a lot of teamwork but that episode in particular is done so well, and they got Carly Simon, she did the song in the movie working girl apparently. I imagine everyone is proud of themselves for that episode and I am proud of them too. \n\nI know its goofy, its just a cartoon, but that is one of the best shows in my opinion. Its rarely scripted and they rely heavily on improvisation. Been following h jon Benjamin from home movies to archer and now this. \n\nEdit: Marc Marons podcast are great and a little less goofy. Hes got a TV show on Netflix  as well called "maron"
3	Thoughts on Social Anxiety	
2	young legend
1	Even though I'm definitely advertising my Youtube channel right now, I hope that you get an insightful message out of this. I struggle with social anxiety on a daily basis, but every time I feel anxious I try to remember to be present enjoying the experience of life and my existence in this beautiful world.
6	Afraid to look inside myself now	When I was a teen and young adult I spent a lot of time examining and writing down my thoughts and feelings and working through my issues that way. Organizing myself on the inside, basically. I find that writing is the best way for me to do this.\n\nAfter I got married, my husband thought that my having to write about how I felt meant that I must not be happy in our relationship.  He said a workmate told him that it meant there were problems in the marriage if I was writing instead of talking to him. I explained that it wasn't like that, but every time he'd see me writing he'd get very concerned and ask if I was ok. So I stopped writing.\n\nIt's been 15 years and I have occasionally written my feelings out, about a specific thing that's bothering me, if I feel like I can't cope unless I write about it, but not very often.  I spend a lot of time in Te mode and I feel angry and impatient a lot of the time. I have also spent a lot of time daydreaming when I feel burned out, which is ok, but not if I'm just using it as a distraction to escape reality.\n\nI am happy with my husband. That's not the problem. But it was a mistake to stop journal writing. I know, at this point in our relationship, that he won't be worried to see me writing. He's probably entirely forgotten about what his workmate said.  The problem is that I'm such a mess inside now, and I've been ignoring things that I should have been paying attention to, that I'm afraid to face what I will find if I start exploring in there again. I've likely done a lot of things that I would not have, had I taken time to consider. I'm afraid that I will feel guilty. I am afraid that it will be too hard to put the effort in to change things in my life when I've been just drifting and ignoring things for so long. But the only alternative to facing it is to keep going as I am, and that will only get worse.\n\nDoes this make any sense to any of you? Has anyone else gone through something similar? How did it work out for you? Will it take a long time to feel better if I start writing again?
2	I understand completely.  Without getting into my own baggage, sometimes life is just too complicated for journaling, even though journaling helps to control the chaos.  I used to think I'd have more time to write when the kids were older. Now, I think I'll have more time when they're out of the house. After that, I'll come up with another excuse. Some people don't need a journal to organize their thoughts, but I think most INFPs require it.\n\nTry starting slowly, maybe writing a paragraph per day or writing only on days when you are especially upset. If you don't know where to start, consider using art or poetry instead. When my thoughts are jumbled, I like to write a poem. Poetry is less work for my brain than prose. Give yourself permission to write total gibberish, if that's what you need. Maybe a sketch or a quick painting will fit the bill: they make watercolor pens now that work almost as well as real watercolors. I've found even a quick session a couple of times a week helps to clear my head.\n\nLike you, I need to spend more time journaling. Most days, I'm lucky to find time to read a chapter or two of a good book before bed.
1	> my husband thought that my having to write about how I felt meant that I must not be happy in our relationship. He said a workmate told him that it meant there were problems in the marriage if I was writing instead of talking to him. I explained that it wasn't like that, but every time he'd see me writing he'd get very concerned and ask if I was ok. So I stopped writing.\n\nThis does not compute.\n\nTell him that your reddit mate said if your husband believes his workmate more than you, there is a problem in the marriage.  \n(joking)

1	It has a sort of dreamy quality to it,  I like it!
8	Do you struggle to receive compliments? to give compliments?	I'm an infp male , and i'm not the type of person who is often complimented . I always hide my lack of confidence to others because i judge they have their own problems. I was not a popular before college ( even if i'm still not) , i was not bullied but i was often the aim of laugh by the "mean" ones . So i'm distant when someone tell me i'm hot , or kind or i have any other ability . But it's even worth when it comes to a female friend , i will be even more attached , i will think she is into me (they are never , i've checked) . \n\nI can compliment you if i think it's the right moment or if i really like something you did. But it's often "quiet" compliments  , i will never scream to you "i love your personnality so much " or " i love your style" . I will wait to someone to talk about it to throw a shy " i like it " or " you aren't ugly , i personnally think you are beautiful"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone in the same situation?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
6	My boss today kept telling someone who doesn’t work with us how good of a worker I am. But in the back of my mind I’m like “quite lying I’m not that great”. 
3	I never struggled to give compliments, but I had struggled for years to receive compliments. I thought it was better to give than to receive. Also, I thought it was more polite to downplay people's compliments because that is what I heard was the appropriate thing to do in Asia and to me that made sense and I just did it in the US. What I did not realize was that it upsets people in the US when you downplay a compliment. One day my father told this to me, and he told me that I need to learn to accept a compliment. Later I did some work on self-worth and learned it was okay to accept a compliment. Now, usually I have no problem accepting compliments. That is my story in a nutshell.
2	Being raised to show false confidence over manners. “That Looks really good” “I know!” -me all excited like
1	I didn't realise I was like this until someone who complimented me was like "what is wrong with you? Just accept the compliment". I proceeded to go out of my way to avoid that person after that. Now if anyone compliments me I just respond with a "thank you". At the back of my mind I'm usually thinking 'I don't get why you think that'.

6	Is it a bad thing that I sort of look forward to seeing my counselor because I’m attracted to her?	Few things to say first. I’m 28 and I believe she’s 28 or 29. I started seeing her because I was a heroin/drug addict (still am I guess, clean going on 7 years now.) At first I was seeing an older woman but she left so I switched to this young girl who’s my age... and honestly she’s RIDICULOUSLY good looking, like absolutely stunning... I’ve been seeing her for a few years now. Is it a bad thing that I’m attracted to her? I’ve never done anything to hint at it .. as a matter of fact I try to go out of my way to hide it.. like when she walks in front of me to take me to her office I always look down at my phone instead of at her back/body because I don’t want her to turn around and see me and think I’m checking her out. For the record I’m not fantasizing about her when I’m at home or anything like that.. but  I do look forward to seeing her because I find her so attractive. Is this inappropriate or am I just over thinking it? 
4	If it helps you open up to her and stay off drugs then it’s fine.  As long as you don’t jeopardise her career by trying to date her and it doesn’t impact your recovery from addiction I don’t see an issue.  
6	its not uncommon to be attracted to your therapist, its a known sideaffect (you can google more aobut it). they are aware and trained about it. It happens much more than you'd think, so dont feel wierd or special, especially if she is good looking and about the same age.
3	I don't think so, assuming you act appropriately. I was attracted to my college instructor once. I think it just happens, and it is natural because we are human. I am sure it happens in reverse too. There is also that temptation of "forbidden fruit".
3	Nothing wrong with finding another person attractive even is she is your counselor.
1	Nothing wrong about that. If you want to have something more with her, better to wait that she isn't your counselor anymore; otherwise things might become a bit too complex.
1	no you were fated to meet her and to share your inner life with her even if only in a professional manner, she is part of your story and your recovery.I wish the best for you, that you will heal and conquer the darkness.
1	If you dont want to do her, what's the point if asking if its wrong?
334	Girlfriend broke up with me recently and it really crushed me. This is the first thing i’ve drawn since.	
36	I mean the drawing is awesome... but it kind of scares me if it reflects what you are feeling. \n\nAnyway, hope you the best.
20	Holy shit this is incredible, I love it!  Really sorry about the break up, that really sucks.  Things will get better, but until then, art is a good way to vent the feelings.
13	That’s so dark and really shows your grief and what you are under.\nNoone will take the one who is destined for you - Italian proverb
7	I’m a huge fan of dark art myself, and it seems that people always misinterpret what the true meaning is. I think this looks dope! I truly hope that you are doing okay and find healthy ways to cope :) have an amazing week 
4	Keep drawing away the pain my guy.
4	Damn that's unfortunate and I wish you the best here on out.. But wow can I smell the ink on this one. Kinda crazy how similar if drawing styles we have. It's actually spooky how similar we draw. I don't take pride in my drawings hence why I haven't shared anything. Spooky acts of kindness.
3	Bad ass
3	My heart 
3	I bet it hurts and it’s good your getting all that out. Dont forget the beauty, its a wide world with so many possibilities and amazing things. Dont let this one girl ruin it for you. Stay strong man!
3	this is fucking amazing \n\nhope things get better for you though because those feelings look rough as FUCK
2	Really cool drawing, despite its negative background. I went through the same a few months ago. Things will get better. Just take care of yourself, love yourself and focus on becoming the best you can be.
2	\nWe've all been there. Hang in there and take good care <3 don't be afraid of your emotions and know that it's okay to be sad. Healing takes time 
2	I just went through a break up. I drew something shitty really quickly yesterday to try to get my mind off of things. It’s almost opposite of yours, but I noticed a few similarities between ours that I found interesting and I thought you might too. The circles around the head, the opening in the chest, and lines that kind of explode outward. Mine isn’t nearly as dark as yours appears to be, it’s possible I’m still in shock. It’s only been a few days. I keep going from numb to feeling everything all at once. It’s awful, but I know it just takes time. I hope you take care of yourself and keep creating ! You inspired me to keep at it too. \n[shitty doodle](https://imgur.com/a/TG2wHoz) 
2	also INFP and have drawn something similar when i was in a dark place. it was a female face scratched out in black ink and then i ended up just making swirls and perpetual circles around her head u til she was consumed by them all around
2	Love it
2	Bloody amazing 
2	... this would make a dope ass album cover! great work!
2	Don't let the pain lie to you. There will be more love to come *heart *heart
1	Looks like a insect human hybrid sitting on a throne.
1	Glad you are making it through, breakups are some of the hardest shit in life to get through.
1	Woman is cruel like an ocean, if you won't pay enough attention to it, it will cast you out, but if you survive, you can become a painter.
1	As someone who just recently got off a 7 year relationship, I can completely understand how you're feeling... You won't be alone on this, we're all stuck in an abyss together for now.
1	Just commenting here so I can see this again and again 
1	Nice
1	Wow....i can feel the crushing defeat👌🏾
0	Is that her?
14	Ways that you don't fit the "INFP" mold?	So this subreddit gets a lot of criticism for being over-the-top INFP, and I'll admit that sometimes I agree with that. Not all of the time, just every now and then I'll see a post and feel that way.\n\nThat being said, in what ways do you not fit INFP stereotypes?\n\nFor me personally -\n\nWhile I can romanticize the idea of love a little bit, I don't think I am irrational about love or instantly fall in love with people for the sake of love. If anything, I think I'm too picky about partners and would rather be alone than with someone that doesn't mesh. There's also a stereotype that INFPs are against "casual" relationships. I've never been against the idea, and I've always been able to divide potential-long-term from no-future-here in my mind.\n\nMaybe its leftover from judging myself when I was younger, but I also hate over-the-top-emo-type quotes and behavior. Stuff about "life is pain!", etc. It doesn't happen that often here, but when I see stuff like that its admittedly hard for me to not cringe. Admittedly, I'll even look at some things I've said in the past and do that because they seem too sappy or dramatic. That might be part of why I got rid of facebook and other non-anonymous social media. I don't like being reminded of dumb shit I've said haha.\n\nFinally: I kinda hate it when people get super offended over stuff that, too me, doesn't seem that important or consequential. Maybe that's hypocritical, considering how sensitive I can be. In my head my reaction is like "C'mon, there are bigger problems to deal with", even if I don't say it. Again, I'll catch myself being that way and judge myself too.\n\nI thought of another: While not always in a rational way, I'm quite the risk-taker. In fact, I think taking needless risks has been one of my bigger flaws. I'm just not a risk taker in the "lets go sky-diving" sense. More in the "I've always wanted to live in this city. I should move there in a month to see what happens" kinda way. I very solidly fit the stereotype of not being an adrenaline junkie, though. Yoga and soothing music, please.\n\nOoo, one more: There's a stereotype that INFPs are really into anime. Apart from Miyasaki movies (most of which are masterpieces and deserve to be treated as such) I don't understand most anime and anime culture. Just not for me.\n\nThoughts?
5	I'm quite assertive, so find all the tropes about passivity tiresome.  I used to overthink things that led to the stereotypical indecisiveness, but have unlearned that habit.\n\nThough I used to be more stereotypical in playing the victim in social drama, I've fortunately grown out of that.  It sucks to admit, but yes I was equally responsible for whatever the fight was about.
4	I'm pretty ambitious/driven and a little status obsessed, which I don't judge others on because fundamentally I don't believe people are "better" than others, but I definitely oppress myself with needing to do something with my life. Like if I feel like I'm not achieving enough I get antsy and want more. \n\nAlso I can be very detail oriented and precise/logical (like a lawyer) but it's not my natural state. It's just something I can switch into easily if I have to.
5	Not sure if empathy would be considered stereotypical for INFPs, BUT I work in customer service, and I find it difficult to be empathetic sometimes. Maybe it's because it's my job, so I have to consciously show empathy. It's especially difficult when I'm getting bitched out. I don't feel personally attacked, but my mood is severely affected by customers who decide they're going to make it nearly impossible for me to help them because they're angry and want to give me a hard time to feel a sense of power when they feel defeated by a situation they're venting to me about. 
4	I am actually decently organized, but probably because I have made so many mistakes due to disorganization and laziness that I’ve had to create a lot of methods to help keep everything straight. I otherwise genuinely have 0 interest in having control and dictating things to anyone else, so I’m undoubtedly a P and have no strong reliance on Fe or Te at all.\n\nAlso, I am handy! I’m an engineer so I pretty much have to be. That being said, I was definitely a total idiot about how to fix things until I forced myself to figure it out.
4	I have always felt like I am more oriented by thought than by feeling. Actually, I was a little surprised for getting INFP the last time I did a personality test, because when I was a teenager I used to get INTP or INTJ. Reading about the personality types I do identify more with INFP, but I still think that being oriented by thought is my natural state, but I choose to make decisions based on people's feelings to avoid hurting them, instead of choosing what makes more sense to me. I still don't know if I am a INFP that doesn't fit the INFP mold completely or if I'm a INTP/J that doesn't fit the INTP/J mold completely
5	Everywhere on the internet you read that infp's are this sad being. Me on the other hand I'm happy and satisfied with my life. Also I don't believe that happiness is the ultimate goal but right now I am happy.  What happens later, happens I will just go with lol.\n\nAnd I'm not really artistic in the painting and drawing way. But I like creating music is that art I don't know.  \n\nAnd I am really into doing impulsive things without thinking them through.\n\n
5	I’m pretty desensitised. I’m definitely an empathetic person even if I don’t show it all too much but for some reason I’m not as affected by seeing physical violence as quite a few INFPs (and I guess people in general) are. It’s weird. I cried at the “one day I’ll be 50” speech in Good Will Hunting but I can almost detach if I see a violent video or something like that. I also have a morbid fascination with the darker side of humanity and true crime stories. Other than that I’m a pretty jovial person and fit the ‘romantic dreamer’ stereotype pretty well. I blame diving face-first into the crevices of the internet one too many times. 
3	Definitely not a cuddly teddy bear. Not openly emotional in general. Dont know where that stereotype came from.\n\nNot a romantic. The idea makes me sick a little. Stuff like "you complete me" it's just ugh. People should have their own self validation, not seek it in relationships.\n\nRich inner world. This one, I still don't get. I used to daydream a lot as a kid, but that was to escape reality because I dealt with crippling anxiety. Nowadays I try to stay present as much as possible. Imagination is great, but it has to have follow through in the real world.\n\nThat's about it for me.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n
3	Not really into the "love" stuff; never have been and likely never will be. Too sticky, and just, well, too rooted in some sense, which I've not liked for as long as I can remember. Never dreamed about "falling in love" or any of that gunk either. Imagining myself dying alone, or being alone for the rest of my life doesn't bother me all that much, and I may even prefer it that way. \n\nNot one for "the arts" (as in poetry, literature, visual arts, etc) necessarily; I'm more moved by invention ideas and things that may play out into the future (though, this here still could be an indication of Ne-Te or something. Idk). 
3	I am punctual and hate when others are not and make me wait, its a huge pet peeve. Miyasaki's movies are awesome, I watch them over and over, never get tired. :)
5	I am not a crying baby, I just can't show my true emotions I can't be that vulnerable... still, I hope one day I'll be able to do that.\nI'm pretty smart, I get really good grades.\nI hated literature and history class in high school, though I've always loved to read.\nI find "romanticism" so fake and a little bit uncomfortable, I mean, I belive in true love, but love is a strong word that is almost always misrepresented.\n
2	I can use logic easily, and I would say I’m more of an ambivert than an introvert. If I don’t hang out with people for a while, I go crazy, but also if I’m around people constantly. 
2	I'm not weak, nor timid, nor a cry-baby, nor an emo. \n\nI am good with household chores, I dress for fashion, I love meeting new people. \n\n\n\n
2	>That being said, in what ways do you not fit INFP stereotypes?\n\nHere's a couple: I'm not suffering from depression, I socialize a lot (but still highly value solitude to recharge), I have artistic ability but never practice, I enjoy having things organized and structured\n\n&#x200B;
2	I'm very confrontational, I'd say that's not typical.
2	im not shy,socially awkward or socially anxious at all,im very confident and open.I don't relate to all the social anxiety posts.
2	I don't get offended by most things. Usually, unless it comes from someone I really care about, I'm able to laugh off any insults people may give to me. \n\nAlso, I'm not shy at all. I just don't talk to people unless I have something to talk about with them. If I can keep up a conversation with the person, then I'll talk as long as they want me to.
1	INFP, 4w3, Neutral Good and Slytherin?	Anybody else? I am just very curious to see what this exact combination looks in other humans o_O
1	I'm infp and 4, but I forget what the second number was. Definitely neutral good. Not sure about the harry potter thing. I'm not really into that.\n\nEdit: I did the quiz and got gryffindor.
8	I forgot how tiring having colleagues was.	As soon as I start a new job I get an urge to go back to freelance.
8	My dream to end all dreams is freelance or working from home. It is my true American dream. 
2	What did you do freelance? 
12	INFPs, when you really like someone do you get more creative?	
19	I can't explain it but when I am falling for someone it give me motivation to literally shake the world... I feel like I can do anything and nothing can stop me, I am most productive and creative during that time... and vice versa when I lose that person that gives me my drive I feel like there's no point in doing anything so yeah... ups and downs
13	Yes, when I am in love my mind is filled with so many ideas and I gain so much energy. Once I receive the love back, I feel like I can do anything.
11	Yep, I’m actually talking to a girl pretty seriously for the first time in like 2 years and I just feel more confident and quick witted when I’m with her.\n\nI think it’s because we INFPs need to care for people, that’s when we feel the most fulfilled. They bring out the best in us because we want to give them our best.
6	Yes, when I like someone, even if its a one sided crush I feel more confident and productive, my creative juices start flowing lol. 
3	I do my best work when it's a gift.
3	It's actually reverse. When I'm heartbroken, the creativity flows. \n\nWhen I am blissfully happy, my muse doesn't exist and I dont understand how to translate happiness into art. \n\nThe past few years have been happy, tinged with tragedy. The tragic moments are full of art: painting/poetry/sketches/photos. The rest of the wonderful seasons are just so yellow with loveliness I have no way of containing it into a piece. 
14	Relaxing day with my tea (sis), what are you guys up to?	
1	Working. That tea looks good! :)
1	Inspired to set tea of my own!  I'm at work but not working yet.  Must get my things in order so I have some idea of what I should be doing instead of clicking Reddit.
1	Tea bag really? Loose tea is the way to go come on!
1	Skipping school to paint something random while being caught up in my thoughts. You know, the usual
1	ugh sis the TEA. wig flew
41	[Image] Create without fear 💛	
1	Really love this. But I can't say that I think like this: ( how do I accept this and make it part of me? Does someone have experience with that?
3	Aside from self understanding and political system building, what is the INFP good at?	INTP here. Pretty much the title is how I feel. I'm pretty good at understanding politics. Pretty good at self actualization. But don't really feel that useful outside of that context. It's like..I'm good at learning. I feel like aux Ne with a dom introverted judging function feels kinda...idk just wrong. It's like Fi/Ti+Ne is good for making a system, and then we go through a bunch of possibilities with Ne. But then after the system is made I(and maybe you all) just kinda...don't do anything. Ne dominants can also think of more things that could go wrong with the system. We are primarily troubleshooters of the system we have made(which should be identical from Fi and TI). But if we make it correctly we aren't needed to troubleshoot. I feel like I'm only good at helping people become better versions of themselves and give un-empathetic advice(inferior Fe), but that I don't really have a "ideal state" for myself. Like not knowing where I fit into society. In essence, useless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think we would be great in one place(each respective in the order INFP, INTP): a emotional system we have created is artifically broken by something/someone and you are asked to fix it. A mathematical form of logical system we have created is artificially broken similarly. I can see both of these being done in video games by the way, though emotional content in games isn't where it needs to be yet for you all (lots of money in shooters that appeal to INTP pretty hard). \n\nMy reasoning: Ti and Fi can understand a system INTENSELY and our double perceiving functions offer us two sources of ideas to solve the problem. Ne doms don't have Si causing them to be slower at this, but their secondary judging function(extraverted) is higher making them better with people.
6	Language learning.\n\nMediating.\n\nProblem solving.\n\nEmpathy.\n\nAble to get along with most people.
3	empathy
2	It would be better for sure, but you seem to be implying that INFPs are the only type that could fulfill this role. I personally believe that any type could fulfill it, but with different motivations and methods. Types like ESTJs aren’t always about making profit, remember they also have Fi; they have morals and they do want to protect their loved ones, sure there are corrupt ones but that happens in every type. E.g. Hitler was an INFJ.
2	INFP should rule the nation , i mean everyone will be equal . Unfortunatly we put ESTJ and other people with low moral and strong individualism .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInfp are good to support people if you ask me some help i will (except if i'm not in the mood or too close too you), i'm personally good to redirect a conflict on me : i try to defend everyone so everyone end to be against me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe spread love , i see the good on each person , i always give a 2nd chance to everyone : except for rare occasion the people who are seen has "the bad guys" became my friends or at least have a good esteem of me because i've tried to understand their true believe . We have this capacity to see through the appearances .
1	I haven't seen this mentioned, so I will say it. Creativity. Brainstorming, thinking outside the box.
6	Let's meet up (USA - SE MI/NW OH)	You know, if you're up for it.\n\nThis may completely flop, but after seeing threads like [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/ahybrd/i_wish_we_could_have_an_infp_meetup/) and [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/aib4ee/comment_your_location_lets_meet_up/) and noting that there were a few of us in the general vicinity. I thought it would be cool if we could arrange a sort of regional meet up.\n\nIt doesn't have to be anything super exciting - I guess in my mind I assumed we'd just all meet at a coffee shop or something. We can figure out date, time, and location. I'm pretty flexible. My weekends are mostly open and I'm about the same distance from Ann Arbor/Ypsi as I am from Toledo.\n\nI'm 34, male, from Michigan, if that matters.
2	This would be awesome! I joined a local MeetUp group for multiple IN-types, but I'd love to hang out with INFPs exclusively because I think it might be easier for me to connect with someone. I'm in Austin, TX
1	That would be cool to meet some other members . I'm from the Cleveland area so I'd be interested. 
37	Do you like shoegaze?	I know how much it’s associated with INFPs, but any time someone asks what kind of music everyone on here likes it never seems to come up. I like shoegaze.
14	Dude, I love shoegaze. Slowdive's Souvlaki is one of my favorite albums ever 
8	Yes, I do. I feel like shoegaze is made by introverts for introverts. 
6	I love shoegaze!!! I find it so hypnotising but so powerful live. I saw Slowdive live and it was like the noise was assaulting all my senses and penetrating every single one of my pores.\nI know Beach House is technically not shoegaze but I got the same vibes with them.
10	Yes.   I often gaze at shoes and wonder what feet may someday be borne within their threads.  I wonder what will undo the stitching and what trails they will beat.  I wonder when the colors will fade and how long they will go unused in the dark corner of a closet.  \n\nThen I notice people staring at me and go on with my life. 
6	YES. I've seen many bands live, but Slowdive and My Bloody Valentine were two of the most incredible shows I've seen. That music can put you into a certain state that no other music can. 
5	I absolutely love shoegaze! It almost puts me in a trance and eases my mind more than any medicine or sleep-aid
5	yes lol, I went through a phase of researching random shoegaze bands, but I don't listen anymore
5	It's okay, I'm into all kinds of things, and I really mean that: I have thousands of albums of all genres, but mostly am skewed more towards extreme forms of metal such as black metal and doom metal and whatnot. \n\nThat being said, there are a few bands I listen to that are categorized as "post black metal" or **"blackgaze"**\n\nLike Alcest:\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwE5FG-pIdk
4	What the hell? I love shoegaze. Shoegaze, dream pop, all that jazz. Never knew it associated with INFPs lol.
3	I’m listening to Ceremony right now. So yea.
5	post-rock, ambient and shoegaze are my favorite 
2	Ya like jazz?
2	Yeeeeeeeeeee
2	Yes!!!!
2	Yeah.\n\nI like jazz too.
1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLqfkSTtEAI\n
773	This was me... Nah, it is still me.	
72	I understand this. I'd often just want to be by myself during recess.\n\nAt the same time learning to socialize is a good skill to have. So the teacher isn't wrong to push that either.
11	When I was like six I got kicked out of the school library once because it was recess time... I still think about it sometimes.
25	It's funny. I didn't see these pics depicting school recess. I saw my highly-extroverted mother dragging me outside to play with the neighborhood kids, most of whom were mean. My elementary school teachers let me stay inside at recess and cut out letters for the bulletin board. :)
9	Anybody know who the artist is?
7	I didn’t have many friends in primary school and when they were busy at lunchtime I’d sit by myself on the fields daydreaming. \n\nAdults would always come up to me and try and talk to me- I appreciated the gesture but when I told them I was ‘just thinking’ it was the truth, and I was happy doing it. 
3	I used to get yelled at for staying inside reading than playing with my cousins outside.
3	This was me pretty much all through high school. I’d skip lunch everyday and go hangout in a teachers room and just read. 
3	This is still accurate as an adult. 
3	Seems like many of us remembered being drug from our little fantasy realm (be that reading, listening to music, day dreaming, etc.) to be shoved in with a bunch screaming children. As a child, I liked to do both, but when you're made to act aggressive (an adult telling you, you ***have*** to approach a group of children you don't know for instance) it can make you feel pretty much like the weirdo.\n\nYou know I thought my kids would be more like me so I was prepared for little introverts. Nope. I gave birth to what seems to be three extroverts, lol. My husband is an INFP like me too.
3	She’s trying to acclimate this child to social interactions with others. It’s what pre school exists for. 
2	That was me in kindergarten with Legos.
1	Japan 1936 ?
1	My Mother says this was me at nursery. Never changed!
1	Me too 😊
1	It me
1	So glad my parents were introverts and never did this to me. They would tell my friends I wasn't home if i didn't feel like playing with them.
1	Awww
1	Wow @me

2	Survey on Personality and Flirting behaviors	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
52	Haven’t made art in a bit, but something inspired me recently

2	Nice, it looks like a glitch frame from into the Spiderverse. Cool work my dude
3	MBTI Compatibility (INFP)	Do you believe that there is an MBTI type that is most compatible for INFPs? Least compatible? I have read MBTI compatibility charts; although, I was hoping to get input from fellow INFPs. :)
7	I don’t think compatibility comes down to type, so much as it comes down to the maturity level of both people in the relationship. This goes for both romantic and platonic relationships. \n\nFor instance, my INFP type makes it natural for me to desire to learn about other people, yet never reveal much about myself, but if I continuously act upon that instinct/natural inclination, then you could say I am not compatible with any type, because I will never enter into a deep and fulfilling relationship of any type with that way of doing things.\n\nBut if I actively act against that mostly negative trait, which holds me back from meaningful relationships, I could be compatible with just about any other type... but they may not be compatible with me because of similar reasons—their inability to act against their own type’s natural instinctive flaws.\n\nDoes that make sense?
5	Personally I feel like as I've gotten older I'm noticing that as an INFP I really have not been compatible with anyone I've dated, nor can I imagine someone who I would feel compatible with. I'm a She, and feel like being organized, practical, down to earth and sociable are all valued strengths that men look for in relationships and I am none of that haha. I feel like if I were to pair off with another INFP, it might work, but I feel like two people with their head in the clouds all the time would be tiresome.\n\nSo I guess personally I'm starting to realize I might be an island. I'd rather not be someone who others have to take care of like a child, even though that's probably the dynamic in many INFP relationships. I feel like if I try to make my own shit work for me, then I could be just fine alone.
4	We have to define compatibility here.\n\nIf it’s for self growth I would say ENTJ but this can be a very difficult relationship, nevertheless I think the two types complement themselves perfectly.\n\nStable relationships on the other hand would be imo INTJ-INFP or ESFJ-INFP.\n\nFun relationships would be ENXP-INFP as Ne would flourish.\n\nFinally, I think that ISTJ-INFP and ESTP-INFP would be the most difficult relationships.
3	Hmm...if possible I think it is better to date someone who was different enough that they can bring a different perspective and help you grow, but similar enough that you have something you can relate to.\n\nJust curious, is there a type you wish you were? Like I am an INFP, but if I were to choose, I think I would want to be the ENFJ. They are like the hero type, which sounds nice in a fantasy sort of way. https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality\n\nThis is just a theory, but I wonder if the type you admire is the type you are most compatable with. What do you think?\n\nThe only thing that puts a wrench in my theory is I dated an ENFJ, and we were like oil and water, such different personalities. We were not compatible at all. That is not to say I could not be compatible with a different ENFJ, but the one I dated was way too insecure to make me feel love.
2	In my experience, most compatible so far: INTJ enneatype 8 (I'm 4w5, and this INTJ is mature and in touch with his emotions)  \nLeast compatible: Any type that has nothing in common with me, is narcissistic, avoidant, generally if they are sensor-thinkers I feel lonely in the relationship. If they are SFJs or Te-doms, I feel overly controlled. If they are NFs, I feel more friendship than romance. If they are INTPs, no one makes the decisions or pursues.
2	Honestly, I think the most important thing at the end of the day for dealing with other types is proper communication. I don't think an effortless match is possible, even if better ones are.\n\nMy best relationships have been with people who told me, either then or later, that they were ENFP or ENTP. And when I say this, I mean relationships that made me happy and didn't end on super sour terms. Relationships that I look back on with no or few regrets. I don't know what any of the other types I've dated were, and I'm cautious to guess. I've also had relationships with a lot of introverts, and those tended to be longer but end with more heartbreak and distress. If I had to guess types for more recent crushes/relationships/random dates - ESTJ, INTJ, ISTP. I'm very hot and cold with ESTJs. There's either amazing chemistry or complete misunderstanding/dislike.\n\n&#x200B;
11	Making up characters in your head?	I've realized I done this since I was very young..often when I was lonely and had nobody else to talk to,they sometimes conflict with eachother and give me "answers" lol I know it sounds crazy but nothing crazy about it since I knowingly created these characters even "god" I created in my own mind and sometimes ask these characters what todo based of the image of god(I'm mostly an athiest) but the idea of something pure and peaceful is nice to have around.Anybody else do this or am I the only one lol?
5	I have lots of stories that I made up in my head and imagine being the characters in them. I sometimes write interviews with some of the characters for fun. I usually end up laughing so hard during these interviews, because the characters are funny and sarcastic and tell me off for the crap that I made them go through.
5	That's a yes from me, I even got more involved with it over the last while. I've ended up with 3 characters, and half of an origin story for them. They all hold different parts of me, and usually I can look back on things I've done recently and come to the conclusion of something like "well I did X because of Y and that sounds more like this character". It's a great way for me to understand myself better I find.
2	Oh absolutely. I didn't have imaginary friends, but I had storylines running through my head all the time with interesting characters, and I always wanted to play out their lives/experiences. 
2	/r/tulpas
2	I think I can relate to this.\n\nAnd there, I thought I was crazy for making up characters in my mind. LOL\n\nGlad to know that I'm not alone.\n\nIt's like there are many me(s) in my mind, the innocent or pure hearted one, the selfish one, the bi\*ch one, etc.. LOL

3	Oh that's me.
-3	INFPs are wolves in sheep skin, i have never met people from this group of characters that are okay in any way, yeah, for the first 10 days of knowing you its all alright but later on man, if you fart you are the worse and they are nice and cuddly while being actually, the worse.  \nIm sorry for explaining it this way to you but i think most of you are aware of this and the fact that these people and ENFPs are so childish that its not cute or funny, quirky ... its cringy and annoying.  \nIve tried everything there is in my power, to be okay with INFPs and ENFPs, because most of them are around me.  \nAnd man man...im just sitting here remembering, horrible, i never wish upon anyone an SO of these two types, these people are ultimate hypocrites and so selfish that there are no words for that, but again, they will act all cute and nice. Just plain horrible.  \nSo this poem and people in the comments, look at yourselves outside your imagination , outside this label you gave yourself, mature a bit
1	I thought this group might appreciate this post I made on facebook.	What VR is for me is a chance to explore my options for my future.  Without it I would already be suffering substantially from my circumstances.  There is no social option within reach that I can conceive of that I actually want.  My ideal social life was my family and getting together as a family with family friends.  \n\nNothing as a single person appeals to me much because I don't know myself as a single person.  I never have.  I'm an introvert.  I don't hate people, I just don't thrive off of them.  I enjoy observing more than being.  That's the challenge.  Most social options are extroverted by design.  Introverts are social with people they can connect with not social to connect.\n\nVR is 100% voluntary.  When it's enjoyable it's enjoyable and when it becomes tiresome it's easy to be excused and one is immediately already home.  It also includes meeting people we might have never met by design or even accident by sticking with what we know.  The empathy that results is powerful, and that enriches my real world experience as I see people as Individuals instead of subconsciously assigning them to groups that I have no interest in.\n\nMake no mistake there will be a lot of criticism and skepticism and fears about the technology and it's potential impact.  They aren't entirely invalid, but if you take a second look at who is promoting those views as alarmists you will find it is the extroverts and the winners of the existing game.  You won't actually find that harm in people who actually like VR.  \n\nWhy?  Because real people like virtual reality.  Fake people have thrived on virtual imagery.  In VR you can't post a selfie or status to be someone.  You actually have to be that someone to be that someone because everyone gets to pick a pretty face if that's what they want.
1	I had a comment disappear.  Someone seemed to think I was off topic for the group, but the relevance is we are introverts.  VR tech is really a good fit for us.
29	It is when we pool our thoughts that the ripples of our mind breathe into the tranquility of life

2	a shitty mechanical pencil, and some paper
2	Steadtler Rasoplast black eraser! This is hands down the best art supply I've ever purchased. Its an eraser that dosen't smudge or leave marks. I got mine from amazon. 
1	I tried everything, but I always go back to printer paper and a mechanical pencil. 
7	Have you ever gone on a date with another INFP?	If so, how’d it go?
9	I have.  It was great until it wasn't.  The passion between 2 INFPs is unparalleled in my limited experience.  \n\nBut the fires that burn hottest burn out the quickest.   We were both idealists who overlooked each other's flaws.  We magnified each other's personalities, both positive and negative.  There was a genuine love between us, but it was eventually overcome by the tsunami of our hidden dark sides colliding.  \n\nIt was amazing, but it left me broken, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.  \n\nI still consider her to be one of my closest friends, but it took time to heal and be able to be around her.  There is space between us now, but my love and respect for her has never been stronger.   \n\nIt is absolutely worth it, but don't get too caught up in your passions.  Remember to always grow and see their flaws alongside their beauty.  Remember to grow together slowly, and you will have the closest, most loyal partner you could have dreamed up.  Take it too fast and you'll crash and burn.  
11	This isn’t exactly what you asked for, but I went out with someone who is an INFJ (I know it’s not the same but also equally rare).\n\nWe had matched on tinder, and I remember superliking this girl’s profile because she was insanely cute and went to my school’s graduate school for medical sciences, and me being an undergrad senior who was planning on going to medical school, I thought we would be a really good match.\n\nA couple hours later I get that fabled “you’ve got a new match!” notification and I opened my app to see that it was the girl! My heart kinda sank a little when I saw that she had messaged me first, which if you’re a guy usually meant that it was a bot.\n\nThe message read:\nDoes that dress come in a size 4? Screw it let’s cut the bullshit here’s my number. \nXXX-XXX-XXXX\n\nNow OBVIOUSLY this situation is a little sus but then again I did have a picture of myself in a dress so I texted the number and introduced myself as the guy in the tight red dress.\n\nAnd it was a real person! \n\n\nWe texted back and forth for a bit, and we eventually make plans to go on a date. We arranged to meet in a coffee shop somewhere in the city and of course I had to get there a few minutes early because I was so so nervous and needed time to shake off the nerves. I was in a really emotionally abusive relationship a couple months before and that was the first time I was putting myself out there since. Anyway, I pick a table and sat with my back facing the door.\n\nTen minutes go by from our designated time and still no messages from her. I figured she must’ve ghosted or something but I got a text from her saying “can you turn around so I don’t accidentally hit on a stranger?”\n\nAnd of course I turned around and she was even more gorgeous than in her photos, which made me EVEN MORE nervous. I don’t really consider myself a good looking dude and I’ve never really had a girl be this forward with me in any situation so my heart was really pounding here.\n\nI got up, gave her a hug, and we just kinda sat and chatted about our lives, how we ended up in the city, etc. Anyway this girl is incredible and throughout the conversation I’m trying so hard to focus on what she’s saying but I’m also thinking to myself what the hell shes doing here with me and if she is disappointed in what I look like irl or if she doesn’t like how I sound or a million other things. But we finished our coffee about an hour or so later and I asked if she wanted to walk to the park nearby to pet some dogs. She was super excited and we went ahead and good god this woman loved her dogs. She practically went up to every dog owner and asked if she could pet their dogs and every single dog absolutely loved her. I’m talking crazy tail wags and lots of doggy kisses.\n\nAt this point I’m kinda just standing off to the side staring at this babe of a woman in a yellow sundress just playing with a half dozen fluffy dogs on a clear spring day and I swear it was the one of the most picturesque moments I’ve ever witnessed.\n\n\nAnyway that date ended up stretching out for about 6 or so hours and I went home with a giant shit eating grin on my face.\n\n\nAlso I’m sorry I just realized I rambled and uh yeah\n\n
6	I dated another INFP for a while, and he was known to show up for dates in his pajamas...nice dude tho
4	She dressed terribly. I thought maybe it was to send a message or something. I don't quite remember. All I know is that she wore a Minecraft hoodie and hot pink shorts. She looked like a child, and I was mortified. It didn't go well to say the least.
4	I think I did the other day, although I’m not sure if she was an INFP as I didn’t ask her. But she had all the traits of one, at least based off of our date. It was hands down one of the best first dates I’ve ever been on, if not the best. We connected over so so many things, both on more superficial levels as well as deeper ones. I found myself super excited and giddy throughout most of the date because what she was saying seemed to reflect exact thoughts that I’d had in the past, and vice versa. It was such a great feeling to be validated like that with someone that I really like, especially because romance has always been a somewhat difficult area in my life. I did get anxious halfway through because it was going so well and of course my brain was like “You better not screw this one up” so I think I got a little too into my own head at some points. We actually talked about our respective social anxieties, though, which helped calm me down a little. Overall it was a really great experience, and we have another date planned for this Friday!! Go me! :D \nPs. Also she was really really cute! And had beautiful blue eyes. \nPps. I hope this post doesn’t come across as braggadocious. Just wanted to share my experience! 
3	I don't think i could do it. It would be like looking in a very annoying mirror.
3	I had a 8 hour long second date with a Infp male.  First date was also cool. We end up kissing. That was surprising because I didn't thinked he like like me and my vibe wasn't flirty at all.  \n\nThis has happened before. With another Infp. Feeling really accepted and comfortable. Similar interests and semi deep talks. Then a haze of passion. But then reality. So right now I will be more ground about things take it more slow and get to know the person. I don't really care to break my heart again. \n\nAll in all I Infps are pretty fine people and would recommend dating them. \n\n\n\n\n\n
2	Not dated but just a friend. Before I used to like this INFP-A guy, he’s really mature and wise for his age. Good listener and decisive. He’s one of those people who helped me stand back up again after being left by a guy whom I thought was the one for me. He’s so down-to-earth and assertive, I‘m aiming to become more like that (assertive). Any type that is healthy or is on the road for maturity, sure are amazing and wonderful. 
2	My first serious relationship was with an INFP. It did not go well. We had a really strong connection, and the fluidity with which we communicated has never been matched. It often felt like we each had a hand in the others brain. At times this seemed amazing, but it turned out to be a huge flaw in the relationship. Because we could read each other so well, we picked up on all the negative signals as well as the good. I could always tell when he was lying, which he did a lot. We'd both grew up in broken homes, and had a lot of baggage neither of us were mature enough to handle. Both of us were highly sensitive and highly emotional, so any conflict turned into an end of the world tyrant. We were the couple that was always breaking up and getting back together, and drove everyone around us nuts. Drinking and partying also played a role. Because his issues were more severe then mine, I was often forced to be the responsible one. Not fun. 
12	hey guys, do you have strong dissident opinions that you hide because you don't want to get into that?	Since I was a kid, I always wanted to be the real me in life, and paradoxically, I always found it hard to accept myself for a certain reason. When I met MBTI I was enthusiastic about it because for a while, I saw in this theory a fabulous mask that I could use as a way of ignoring the fact that accepting myself would be accepting that I'm a bit boring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean, since I was born and until now, I imagined myself as a thousand different people, with thousands of different jobs, hobbies, tastes, locations, etc. And although I am the one who most wanted to be (at the core), I'm also someone that I don't completely like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be clear, I will use MBTI to explain it. Did you know Jhon Lennon? He was not what the majority think that he was; a saint and an idealist. Actually, he was terrible sometimes; he bothered his friends, was unbearably critical, was mean with the other beatles, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, I don't know what's my type, but sometimes I can't help but perceive myself as an obnoxious 1w9. **NOT IN THAT WAY**. I don't behave like Lennon; I'm not unbearable, I don't bother others and I don't criticize anyone, but I share with him a characteristic that bothers me: I have intense political opinions (my opinions have logical reasoning anyway, just saying) in addition to my views about life that I swallow all the time because those talks put people away and almost noone understands me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to perceive myself as a Lennon. Someone that is known to be a cerebral person that is into boring ethic things. It's just something that I don't like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I know what was the childhood of Lennon, and I'm not judging him. I think I could be one of the few that would be his friend knowing who he really was. Maybe because I also went through child abuse.
3	Yep.  The only difference was social media.  I viewed text debates as fair game debates.  Overtime I realized a lot of people take then way too seriously and others are just trolling, etc.  I reached a point of rarely speaking my mind online except my own timeline where people can take it or leave it \n\nI don't care for any drama, and part of that is exhaustion from toxic people, not my personality, but I don't relish conflict.  Principle makes it necessary sometimes, but I have learned it usually isn't, at least not for opinions, no matter how logical they are.\n\nAs one meme suggests, I'm over it.  You can tell me 2 + 2 equals 7 and I will throw you a thumbs up.
24	why don't INFPs just... talk to me about things?	the dreaded words you may or may not have expected: I'm an ESTP\n\nI love INFPs despite having few areas to actually connect with them, and honestly our main conflict is just usually that the INFP doesn't communicate their issues/problems\n\nI'm a very accommodating person and like to act as a peacemaker/mediator in my own way, so it's difficult when I want to adjust for someone and they're just... not talking about things\n\nthis isn't specific to any individual INFP, it just kind of relates to all of you, you are really poor at communicating with me, even if you're not with others\n\nI assume it's something about my personality, being that I am basically a cold and blunt weapon, capable of mass destruction without really meaning it\n\nbut man I really love people and I really love INFPs\n\nhow do I encourage the INFPs in my life to understand that communicating with me is okay? or, even better, how do I convince them that I say a lot of stupid things because I can't help not thinking before I speak and things they may perceive as offensive aren't really meant to be?\n\nyou're all beautiful amazing people and I'm not just saying that because I want to bed every single INFP, even though that is also true
13	Most of the time, you are right, I avoid talking to ESTPs for reasons that vary from they're intimidating, they talk about things that I don't understand, they talk too fast, and move too fast, and possibly come off like they have ulterior motives and are trying to game me somehow. But recently I encountered an ESTP and enjoyed a platonic conversation with him. How did this conversation happen? I was checking out his RV, he was there, and we got to talking about van life. He was happy to answer all my questions, and gave me more info than I knew what to do with. So in this case, a connection of sorts happened because we had something in common. Find something in common with your INFPs and they'll open up to you -- although I think there's only so far a sensor can "get" an intuitive and vice versa.
9	Honestly, there's not much you can do. We will rarely open up to someone that's not in our "inner circle". Try your best to be nice, but if you accidentally hurt an INFP and they don't tell you, well, that's on them. You can't make it right if you're not aware of it. If you suspect that you've said something wrong, feel free to ask. "Hey, I was thinking about what I said earlier and I realized it might have sounded offensive. It wasn't my intention." \n\nBut yeah, honestly, most INFPs really need to work on their communication. 
6	Honestly, I'd say just be really emphatic about the fact that you want to accommodate for them, and you want to hear them out and make the changes they need. Often, people say things just to say things. If you're really, really sincere and often repeat your desire for communication and lack of thinking before you speak, we'll eventually get the message. We love you too, by the way :)
5	Well can you give us an example of being offensive, but not really meaning it? And if one of the INFPs communicated that you were being a jerk, how would you respond?
3	I get along great with ESTPs, one of my best friends is one actually, and though I'd feel comfortable opening up to him, and have before, he does not share the same depth of feeling and often doesn't understand my own feelings/issues when explained or offers very basic and unhelpful solutions, (go out where people are and start talking, dont look just leap, if you dont want to be anxious just stop thinking about what you're thinking about etc.) I know he means well but I'm still often very selective when it comes to which parts of me I share with him. \n\nAlso I'm a dude please don't bed me 😂
3	because youre usually an insensitive shit\n\nso yeah some people (me included) will gladly accept your shittiness for what it is (because hey, at least its honest logic), but thats NOT how infx types work
3	Speaking for myself, I wouldn't communicate with you if chances are either you're not going to change anyway, you're not even going to understand what I say, or you're going accuse me of being oversensitive, so communicating has no points for me. I mean I'm not knowing for sure that that's going to happen, but as an INFP, I am very observant and secretly evaluating your character collectively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want us to communicate, show us that you're not a person that is going to do either of those. For INFPs, the way you say things matters as equally as what you say. Personally if someone not close to me is being offensive (misogynistic,  xxx-shaming, etc.), I would just avoid him/her because I learned that it is just not worth my mental energy to say it out loud and have a chance of getting the "mass destruction without really meaning it."
2	Estps are funny. The ones I've met can be silly and fun and never really take it too far. Their personality is admirable and I do not dislike any personality type, so I'm going to try to appreciate estps more.
2	Try asking them thought provoking questions so they can open up, but just be patience with their response. Also give your own input so they know where you stand on certain issues- they may tell you if they agree/ disagree. If you ease these type of questions in and you show you sincerely want to listen to them, they’ll probably talk more. This is kinda vague, but hope this helps a little 
2	Most people of the ESTx types annoy me simply because I am not a fan of quick energy and would rather take a little bit to think through what we're about to do. Nothing against you guys I just get tired quickly and would rather spend time in my basement playing vidya or watching movies...im such a hermit lol
2	I usually like when people are straight forward and blunt.  I don't get offended easily and callous statements don't bother me unless I'm being critiqued.   And maybe that's the ultimate issue here, if I fear you might turn your cold blunt weapon towards me, i'm going to have a hard time opening up to you.  It's very possible your INFP friends are just intimidated and maybe even a little jealous of your carefree forward style?   But, I don't think you should tip toe around them or try to be overly nice and caring either.   That just comes off as insincere and patronizing. 
1	Y’all can be pretty intense for us and that makes us shell up I think. You’re like a strong bursting energy and we’re a soft radiating one.
1	I’m too quiet. No lie.
1	Same reason why INTJ dislike ESTP .The difference is just INFP hold their opinions in their head because they don't want to be mean to people .\n\nLet's INxx talk about universe or any future-oriented ,we listen to you talk about latest fashion/extreme sport/location .But ESTP is freaking disinterested in anything that considered future because they see it as waste of time ,which cause other parties to hate you because they care about future alot .
1	It kind of seeps out slowly. Have patience.
13	What if.. we constantly tend to ask what if...?	
3	What if can take you good places as well. If things seem hopeless, still, anything could happen. What if something good happens tomorrow. Don't give up hope. It's not what if that is the problem, it's that people use it for negativity.
2	What if I can't stop asking what ifs?
1	My ISTJ friend asks "what if" all the time. I don't understand, it is like he is obsessed with "what if" scenarios. I have noticed I say "what if" a lot now too since meeting him. It probably rubs off on other people. We talk like our friends do.
1	What article is this from?
1	A big part of my job is to ask 'what if?'
27	It is the darkness that makes the light seem bright to our tired eyes	
3	I love that caption. Are you a writer?
16	I’m almost 21, still a virgin, and feel like the only way to fix it is to fundamentally change myself. What is so wrong with me?	I feel like I’m gonna sound like some bitter incel writing all this, but honestly I try my very best not to fall into that toxic mindset. I don’t think I’m owed a relationship from anyone, but it just feels so shitty watching people all around me find love (or at least sex) effortlessly, whereas the only advice I’m ever given is ‘improve yourself’. Most people I know haven’t had to jump through hoops just to get someone to care about them. Relationships are something that just kinda happen for most people, so what the fuck is so wrong with me that no matter how hard I try improve myself, nobody gives a fuck?\n\nHaving said that, I realise the world isn’t all sunshine and rainbows and I do have to work at it. I get I’m not the most outwardly attractive dude. I’m 5’6, skinny (before anyone suggests the gym, I’ve been there and done that, no amount of muscle mass cures the fact that people don’t really find me attractive and I have no self-confidence), and honestly just look like a little nerd. I still take pride in my appearance though, I’m not some unhygienic neckbeard expecting people to fall for me even though I put no effort in. I buy good clothes that fit me well, I have good hygiene, i even get my eyebrows done for God’s sake. I’d say I look a lot more attractive than a couple of years back. I try my best in class, I read in my spare time, I’m pretty outgoing and friendly with everyone I meet, and while there’s been a couple of flirtations here and there, it’s never anything that goes anywhere. \n\nMy real issue is my lack of self-confidence. I think people focus too much on confidence: I know it works, I know people who are not conventionally attractive in the slightest who hook up with people all the time because they’re pretty cocky. But I think as long as you’re attractive enough you can get away with not being outwardly confident; plenty of shy people get into relationships all the time. But a shy guy who’s not exactly killing it in the looks department like me? It’s basically a no go. I don’t want to fake myself into being some overly cocky dude who hits on anything with a pulse. Sure I might get laid a few times, but along the way I’m sure a few girls would be creeped the fuck out, and I don’t want that at all. Don’t get me wrong either, I’m not a socially awkward mess who can’t talk to the opposite sex: I have plenty of girl friends, most girls just tend to view me as like this non-sexual being though. I get along great with them, but I don’t have the confidence you need to sit and flirt with someone, push the boundaries here and there and build up that tension. It just feels awkward as fuck to me and like I’m acting out of character. I just end up coming off to people like a completely harmless little dude who is good fun to be around, but who the thought of having sex with makes them double up laughing. I’m still awkward and self-conscious enough though where, on the very rare occasion someone does seem to be flirting with me, I get fucking terrified and shut it down, or think it’s some big joke, or any other rationalisation as to why anyone would want to flirt with me of all people.\n\nEssentially if someone is giving me any kind of attention, I tend to read every little thing they do as potentially being flirty, which gets me stuck in my head too much. But the very second someone is flirting with me and there’s no other way of interpreting it? I freak the fuck out. I’ve had girls way out of my league flirt with me and I’ve found ways to stop it in its tracks, only to kick myself for it later on. Again, that’s an extreme rarity though, which makes it even worse when I don’t have the guts to do anything. My brain just genuinely cant comprehend someone being attracted to me, even though it’s what I think about most of the time. My friends all know I’m a virgin, and all relentlessly tease me since I’m the only one not in a relationship. It is so constant that even their girlfriends will join in. They all find the whole thing fucking hilarious, but I don’t think they realise how much it gets me down. My self-confidence is already basically non-existent, but that just drags it down further. And the thing is, by making my sex life into such a laughing stock, it basically means any girl we meet instantly knows going anywhere near me is just a complete joke. \n\nRecently I’ve even tried Tinder and stuff, and got way more matches than I ever thought I would (about 50 or so maybe in a month), but I have no idea how the fuck to flirt with anyone on there, it feels weird as hell. Most people don’t reply to the first message anyway lmfao. A couple of times it’s led to sexting or whatever, but again that’s very rare. There was one girl who literally told me she wants to hook up with me, offered to pick me up some night and told me to make sure I buy protection, but I completely freaked out about it and didn’t go through with it. I started asking myself, what the fuck am I doing this for? Am I really gonna lose my virginity in some girl I’ve never met’s car just to be able to tell people that I’ve had sex? It feels fucking degrading and weird to me. I still have Tinder, but I don’t think I’d even go through with hooking up with someone from it. It just doesn’t feel right losing my virginity in such a weird impersonal way, and I doubt anyone on there wants to be the one to take a guy’s virginity in some random hook up\n\nSo, rant aside, what the fuck is so wrong with me? Why is it that very few girls ever take an interest in me, and see me as some completely non-sexual entity, and the few that do try to flirt with me I block out? I feel like I’m my own worst problem, and that I need to shift people’s opinions of me and make people see me in a different light if I want to get anywhere, but I just have no idea how to do that without acting like someone I’m not. I’m naturally just a good-natured, slightly awkward guy that has trouble with flirting with people; that’s what people usually find endearing about me, but it’s made my romantic life completely non-existent.
12	In the same boat, also almost 21. My only advice is to not focus on it so much, because that is, ironically, what works. When people see that youre devoted to school or hobbies or other things they'll find that attractive and admirable. The only times I've had girls come to me to give me their number was when I really didn't care and I was focused on other things. Girls are weird.
7	Enjoy your life. Enjoy yourself and how you are right now. Dying a virgin who was happy and enjoyed their life to the max is a thousand times better than being miserable because life did not follow the schedule you set out for it for when things are supposed to happen or in the way they were supposed to happen. I mean this. I lost my virginity at 34. I was too busy enjoying my life to care one way or another about my sexual status. \n\nThat being said, (and who wants to hear that really?) there are books and conferences and youtube talks on flirting, dating, seduction, courting etc. They are endless. The only thing stopping you from looking it up and implementing it is fear, and there are books and youtube talks on that too. Some pretty good places to start are the HOT APES ted talk for flirting and Mel Robbins 5 Second Rule for fear. 
5	Not gonna lie, i am not 21 nor a male so we kinda have nothing in common. However, maybe it's less about trying to find someone to hook up with and more about, as cheesy as it may sound, connecting with people and spending time with them. Maybe the eventual outcome of all that time (whether it be a romantic or a sexual relationship) shouldn't be your first and foremost concern. But then again i'm probably just spitting bs here
4	31m virgin here. Just chill. 
3	I'm 23 and still a virgin. In fact, I've never had a relationship. Yikes. I don't let it bother me too much though. I spend too much time alone in my room to meet someone in the first place :P So you are sort of doing better than me in that respect.\n\nDefinitely sounds like you have confidence issues. You say working out won't help you be more attractive, but maybe that isn't necessarily the point? \n\nWorking out is supposed to give you confidence/improve your mood (endorphins/hormones). Maybe you just gave up too early?\n\nFind something you enjoy and embrace that, I like to practice music. Don't worry about finding someone, we are still young. There is plenty of time to let something happen naturally.\n\nI don't think anything is wrong with you, I think that being a male INFP is just kind of rough since we are so rare. We don't really fit into the typical male stereotypes. \n\nOne thing that significantly helped me become a more confident version of myself is meditation. Consider giving it a shot.
3	It's gonna sound really cliché but sometimes it happens. I'm a 27M and I didn't quite figured it out yet, but since I stopped trying to think how to act in a way that the other person likes me, and let myself relax and just be there, my relationships changed a lot. I was lucky I met my best friend in university, she's the ultimate extroverted artistic superstar (ESFP) and I'm like an INFP Gollum on acid, and we just got along because we allowed each other to be who we are. But damn, everything started to fall into place when I showed people my passions, little pieces of my inner world, debates, etc. About relationships, I just broke with my first boyfriend, and he really came to my life in a moment I stopped trying to get a partner. Flirting online with people was always a miss from me because most of  people wanted just sex, would be extremelly judgemental or picky (Funny I made more friends than anything in those apps); since I just wanted to really connect with a person every sex encounter was so forced for me that I dropped it quickly. It's funny because I feel like I'm not that attractive and sometimes gorgeous dream-like people tried to explicitly flirt with me and my brain completely crashed and burned in front of them making me act like a total moron, and I'm sure it has to be self-confidence.\n\nI don't think you have a problem, you just need to expose yourself and obviously people will be judgemental and hurt you but it comes a moment when you are still grateful because not holding yourself back lets you meet a lot of people who likes you truly, and sometimes people who not just like you but love you. It takes a lot of balls to do that and a lot of mistakes. It's my experience but I'm sure you don't have a flaw, other than fear to be hurt or not being good enough.
3	I honesty run into alot of the same problems, I had alot of sexual encounters in college, but couldn't make relationships work FOR SHIT and often would either just retreat from the other person or the other person would find someone else and be done with me haha. I haven't had a relationship/sexual encounter in over 3 years now and, while I do still feel a strong need to connect with someone on an intimate level, (and doesn't help that I literally dont know anyone who ISN'T in a long term relationship), I try to just live life and focus on myself now, just live life to the fullest for you and good things will come your way ✌✌
2	Wish I could help you man, but you basically described me too :D\n\nI've had one relationship though. It didn't last long, but I wasn't the problem, so I can't have anything useful to say it
2	i wish u all the luck . ive had a multitude of flings but never a long lasting anything . its gotdam depressing!! especially when u feel attached 2 someone to find out they were only using u for the sex . >.> \n\n\nyour friends sound lame as shit. atleast on the making fun of you side of things. i cant stand that shit . " roast " culture or whatever. fuck that. i only stay friends with supportive peeps. \n\nwish i had any advice other than just agreeing with ur post ... just know that i feel u... and that there is hope
2	Looks like you answered your own question because you just shoot yourself in the foot when a good opportunity comes along. Don't put yourself down because you aren't a perfect 10.\nI find a good trick is to treat girls like sisters to avoid feeling so nervous around them.
2	Being a 10/10 ultra hottie wouldn't give you that much of an advantage, I promise you that! I was an INFPs first kiss, even though he was attractive and in his 20s. \n\nThe more you stress about it, the higher the stakes will seem so you're more likely to panic. You've gotta chill out and let a girl seduce you, because eventually one is gonna try and that's the easiest way to gain some confidence.
1	Im only 18 but Im having similar issues. Im still workout out whether I am Infj or Infp, but I do know both are quite off from the stereotypical male, which is a small solace I take. I am also not horribly unattractive but not great either. And it fors get frustrating just being unable to open up and having no self esteem.\n\nTo build the self esterm, you need to be working hard toward a goal you actually want. If you actually want it, you will actually work to achieve it, and if you are working hard you are doing better than 75% of people, which will make you one of the better people at what you are doing, lead to success and the accomplishment of the goal. I feel this is the ideal way to combat a lack of self worth, as even though I struggle with that greatly still, I have noticed improvementa through reaching fitness goals, ACT test goals, college goals, etc. Also, you need to enjoy the process of doing so, which will put you in a better mood and make you happier and mor econfident. Way easier said than done and I dont do this.  Hope that helps.

2	Just wasted half an hour that my body gave me to plan and practice today's short presentation. I'm too worried about not having showered in 6 days. I can't get up.. someone will knock on the door because someone showering in the morning is unusual. But I really need to get clean. Feeling filthy sucks. 
2	Im taking music for college and majoring in Voice/Opera. do you think I will do good in my chosen program as an INFP?
1	got diagnosed with ADHD inattentive type last week and I'm on concerta now. I CAN HEAR SO MANY THINGS that I've never heard before! the library at my school has lights that *hum* 
1	my FWB just cancelled last minute because he got a massage and now he can't move. I just get so incredibly angry when I make plans and people cancel, specially last minute! Right now, It's like I see red everywhere and I just want to punch him for cancelling things. People don't understand that when we make plans, we organize our lives around those plans. I was mentally prepared for this plan. When that plan falls apart, it feels just awful.

5	It all points to the self	When it comes down to it... We are on a journey of  the self. Everything that happens to us is molding us in a sort of way to conquer what lies ahead of us whatever that may be. But just know INFPs we have to be strong and realize that if want what we want we have to look within ourselves and take responsibility. 
6	I had this vibe during an acid trip and it really freaked me out... gave me like feelings similar to the Truman Show movie. The terrifying yet truthful part was how much work I saw needed to be devoted into shit and it was really eye opening but I also resented it arguing with my own ego about how I should just live life and be. But really, your whole life is just a perspective from your POV and it’s your choices to improve self, and your environment
4	streaming on twitch	i've been really interested in the idea of starting to stream on twitch but then i'll get discouraged by how i view my charisma level and how interesting other streamers are. i'm just unsure of it all and i could really use some guidance
1	I'm doing the same.  First off just stay realistic.  Forget about high hopes and just try to keep advancing in your approach.  Consistency should pay something in time.  You can add me on twitch.  I'm Too_old_for_this_\n\nDon't leave off the final underscore.  Follow and friend me and I will be happy to reciprocate.  \n\nI have some YouTube ideas.  Twitch was just an easy way to get started ND be sure I am doing something.  College has been in my way if running with it, but by chipping away at getting it established, when I do get time I can go to content but not setup.\n\nJust a little on my approach.  I don't have high expectations.  I have an opportunity to give it a go and have fun whether I accomplish anything or not, and that makes it a fun venture for me 
1	I have a rather big channel (1k) on Twitch and YouTube (30k), for the sake of staying anon on reddit. I won't link it. \n\nTry to see it as fun / a creative outlet. Keep a chat open at all times when livestreaming. It's a great experience in all fairness. Best part is: you get to choose what you respond to. As an INFP it's absolutely amazing to be able to socialise on YOUR terms! \n\nThe hardest part is staying consistent. To stick to a schedule. Especially as INFP. Another big thing to consider is this: in the beginning it WILL suck. You will be a rather cringy host, you won't get a lot of views if any at all. Try to not be bothered by this. You have to push through the suck a little and don't be discouraged if people leave your stream. You did something right to attract their attention in the beginning, but didn't necessarily do something wrong to make them leave. Don't forget to have fun! Bringing friends along the ride and engaging with your audience is so much fun. \n\nBonus: you get to be creative! Think: thumbnails, channel art, Twitch emotes, Twitch banner and icons and video editing for YouTube. \n\nI wish you and your channel the best of luck and hope you'll have lots of fun!
1	Just start. Do it if you’re excited about it. You don’t need a plan unless you really want one.
6	Is there an era you’d rather live in? Why?	
13	No.\n\nEven though there are cool things I would have liked to see with my own eyes (Woodstock, the moon landing, etc.), people used to be far more judgemental in the past (and I'm black so that doesn't help). Depending on the country and the era, you could even get executed for some mundane things.\n\nI'm pretty sure that as an INFP male, I would've been called derogatory names relative to not being "manly", because I'm "too quiet" or "too emotional", not being a "man of action" and so on; especially during wartime, the pressure to "lead men to victory" and so on was pretty high, so no : I'm glad to live today\^\^\n\nAlthough things aren't perfect, people nowadays are becoming more and more accepting of others and try more and more to understand each other.
3	As a woman, definitely not the past. I don't want to chance it on the future, either, so I guess no. 
3	Not really, but I appreciate the  culture and music of the 70’s! 
3	I'd love to be a young adult in a band in the 60s...as long as I don't get drafted...
2	ya , 100 years from now would be tite. or even better... a different planet / dimension ... hmmm 
1	Yes but it has to be in the Amazones, like 600yrs ago. I would scape my tribe, eat mushrooms, have near death experiences and then come back to my tribe as the Amazones next chamanic superstar.
1	No. Because antibiotics.
1	60s just because I am a Beatles fan
17	I'm sure it's been said before, but I feel like it's overlooked big time in the MBTI community in general: The best relationship you will ever have is with yourself.	Doesn't matter what type they are, none of your other relationships or partnerships will be healthy until you get to know you and start becoming friends with you. Then, you'll almost by magic find yourself attracting the right kind of people and making decent friends with any type.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but I feel like INFPs, ENFPs, and possibly ISFPs need to hear this the most. You are super lovable people, so start treating yourself like you are. 
3	I needed to read this! I’ve been in a few exhausting relationships throughout my 20’s. Im single now and for the first time in my life I have zero interest in dating. I just booked a trip to Portugal by myself and am excited to relearn and love who I am. 
2	This is honestly the truest shit I've ever read. By looking into myself, I've discovered so many interesting and deep parts and it helped me so well in my development of confidence, finally found what is important in life, what my passions are and my pursuit of meaningful relationships is way more effective since I know exactly what I'm looking for (Now finding them is the complicated part lol).
2	Absolutely totally true in my experience! Do you have a story behind this advice?
1	yeah good luck getting that to happen irl\n\nthats why i see a lot of infps dependent on more confident individuals?

12	20yo male INFP, what is my purpose in life?	Hello,\n\nI'm a 20 year old INFP. I don't feel like I belong on this planet. The world doesn't make sense, I cannot stop questioning it everyday. Not to sound /r/iamverysmart but it's hard to trust anyone, because it feels like I can read their minds and often people have bad motives (especially when it comes to money and personal gain). I can almost feel other people, like I know what they're thinking and their motives. It feels like no one else ever questions their reality, but maybe they have the same thoughts about everyone else?\n\nWherever I go people look at me and treat me differently to others, e.g. if I walk into a local pub everyone will stare with suspicion. Teachers ignored me at school. I try to be friendly and open but it usually backfires.\n\nI find it impossible to be happy, everyday I wake up all I feel is misery.\n\nI've never met anyone like myself.\n\nI have friends, but I'm a virgin and no girl has ever shown interest in me. I don't feel like a person deserving of that, I'm not interesting, I don't know what I enjoy or who I am. Why would someone be interested in me? I think about suicide daily.\n\nAt the moment I just work and feel tired all the time. I don't like this capitalist and over-consumerist world, it's overwhelming, I feel like it's incompatible with our morality and natural needs. I've saved up enough money to live simply for a few months, I'm tempted to quit my job.\n\nAny help/advise would be much appreciated.
9	I have no idea man, similar position, but let me just tell you one thing: \n\na girlfriend will not solve this, unfortunately, if thats what you are longing for
6	It sounds like you need to seek out spirituality in life. There are a lot of religions that ask that question. Maybe spend some time working out your beliefs and you will come to the answer.\n\nFor me I liked Taoism and Buddhism especially for my spirituality and mental health. Quakerism appeals to me too.
4	> like I know what they're thinking and their motives...  ... if I walk into a local pub everyone will stare with suspicion.\n\nSuspicion is in your mind.  Not only do you suspect others of shady motives, you imagine they do the same to you.  You may be surprised that it is just your perception.  Yes, some people are up to shady doings and some might look at you suspiciously.  However, I'll bet you interpret their expressions to mean something about you, while in reality they don't even notice you.  I have a friend with a hint of paranoia.  She projects a lot of her mindset onto others.  Having been projected upon or known the people onto whom she projects her perspective, it became clear over time that it was just how her mind works.  So she sees it as 'normal' and has no frame of reference to know the different ways other people think.\n\nI'd suspect that all of that is why your friendly and open overtures backfire.  If you have a suspicious mindset, others will notice - just as you notice how they are acting or feeling - and react negatively because they sense suspicion or shady motives.  Can you see how we create our own experience?\n\nCarry it on to girls not being interested.  You say you are neither interesting nor deserving.  So guess what reality results from that belief?\n\nEven if you are an empath and can feel others' emotions, you don't know *why* they feel that way.  You can speculate, but not know.  All you have to go on is how *you* interpret things.  But because you are not them, you are probably wrong to some degree.\n\nI'd recommend keeping your job, or maybe a different one, simply because we get back what we put in to life.  I applaud living simply and disregarding consumerist culture, good for you if you can pull it off.  Less stuff means more attention and energy is available to spend on your spiritual growth, which it sounds like you would value.  If you question reality as a practice, you can learn a lot about yourself.  Do so to justify your beliefs and mindset, you'll just dig yourself into a deeper pit of misery.  Question the very ways you see the world, you may break out and find contentment even if the external parts of your experience hardly change.\n\n>I've never met anyone like myself.\n\nI've had this thought, too.  And I laugh that I'm glad because I'm aware of my bad habits, oddities, and such.  Why would I want to meet someone like me?  I work constantly to get that guy out of my life.
3	I just think you don't appreciate yourself nearly enough you should be. Grab a psychiatrist, get ready to spend lots of money and time with them and believe it will help. We've all been there (I'm not even 19, but I have managed to overcome this) and it's nothing completely new. I know they can help, you just have to find the right one, similarly to wives - nearly every one of them is pretty good, but not all of them are for you, so don't get discouraged. Anyway if you learn to love yourself, you'll solve almost everything. Been there done that, you can believe it, I give you my word. You just need a great teacher and the trust that you can do it. My teacher was fascinating, I'm writing a book to her. It's going to be the best book I've written so far. That's the least I can do to thank her for sharing her infinite knowledge and wisdom ❤\nI wake up knowing life is beautiful. I live for my purpose I found with her - writing. I know I'm not a plumber, doctor, mason or software engineer. And that's okay. Not everyone is made for everything. You just have to do what you love and you'll be happy in life. And the first step to it is learning how to love yourself. 
3	I have the same problem. Because we have to choose it. We get to decide our purpose, and its a blessing and a curse because if you take it as seriously as you should, youll always doubt if its your true purpose, but if you ever find something that fits, you can live your entire life without regret.\n\n
3	Huh, 20F wondering the same thing. I've been lucky to have relationships in the past but they take work on bot sides, and even then it's risky. It's better to strenghten/gain friendships or get a dog haha. At least until you feel secure about yourself and your place in the world. \n\nI've spent so much time thinking, and came to peace with the unpredictability in the world. The only thing certain in life is death and taxes, and I'm only afraid of one of those.\n\n\nYou mention that you feel what other people's intentions are. Be careful, I almost fell into that trap of assuming who people are. Back in high school, I would only talk to people who I assumed were like me, which was very few people. I thought no one would find me interested, but you'd be surprised what get if you chat with someone next to you. Never assume everyone hates you, just because nobody knows you; although finding a group that shares common interests is a good place to start.\n\n\nOverall, life has no meaning and we are simply existing. But you can fill in your own purpose. It's up to you to think of your ideal life and what it should be, and it's up to you to persue it. I know it sounds vague, but sometimes you gotta take a step in any direction to change yourself. That's been bringing me peace these last few days; any possibility is within reach. You can literally do anything with your life, even end it (though it's more fulfilling to stick around and see what happens). Just close your eyes and take a big step in any direction you want, and something will change. Therapy also helps.\n\n\n\n
2	Well, knowing half of the world doesn't know if they are gonna have food next month is a pain the soul that cannot be replaced with almost nothing. But yet, there's some magic behind keep wandering, creating, meeting people and give them something to make them better, or just contemplating existence are good ways of feeling sort of validated in this world. I still don't know what is my core passion or purpose on this life but the projects I did and completed showed me that you can feel fullfilled with what resonates with you in the moment.\n\nYou are just 20, it's not easy to figure it out at that age. I'm 27M and it took me a long time just to find a few things to hold on to. Try not to fall in the trap of thinking you are the problem and you don't deserve to connect with people because you do deserve it. But you have to be patient and try to open up a little bit when you meet new people.\n\nThe fact that you care so much about what to do it's a strenght. I met people who were completely lost to the system and didn't care about their personal desires because they had the obligation to be productive in the capitalistic way and there was nothing else in the world.
2	Hi 20 yo female INFP here, I also never dated or anything but I've come to terms with that, soon or later the right person will come and in the mean time I will try to fix my issues.\nGladly I do know my purpose, I came here to help all the people I can and make others I little bit happier.\nI hope that you can find it soon, what helped me was to change my mind set and understand that my actions must only depend of myself not what other people think or say about me.
2	Aw you sound a lot like my boyfriend. We didn’t get together until he was in his mid 20s so stay hopeful. I think this age can be difficult I also was suicidal in my early 20s and I am so god damn thankful I didn’t go through with it because things got so much better.\n\nOk so this may sound like the lamest advice ever but something that truly helped my depression and cynical attitude about the world was volunteering with animals. I love animals. They remind me there is good in the world. Helping them has given me confidence in myself and a feeling of purpose. You don’t have to love animals but if you can try to direct your attention away from your self when you are filled with negativity (and this is SO HARD omg I know) but to an outward source you can help- like when I was very depressed I first started to try to care for a plant and then I was like oh I kept my plant alive woo progress great work major recovery!!! \nSo here is how I think of it- no matter what we will one day die and we can focus on that and how nothing really matters but we have some time in between to do whatever we want- you described yourself as smart and you sound hella unique when I think most of society is the same and boring. I’m sure you have something interesting to contribute somehow to this often sucky world and it’d be a disservice to all of us if you took yourself away before you got to show that 
2	LOL your purpose never ends it will be a constant unfoldment of growth. Follow the things that excite you the most and put your energy towards that using *both* your logic and your intuition. 
2	I know exactly how you feel. I was literally going to make a post just like this. I feel so tired by this world. I feel as if I’m always ignored all the time. People consistently worship capitalist figures. They can’t understand a life outside of it, and believe that if they live like billionaires and watch them, they can become them. This world turns consumerism into a mode of thought, and tries to make the only mode of living life while people are brainwashed into believing this is ok, because one day, they’ll “win” too. \n\nPeople ignore us, because we’re different and therefore, warrant ignorance. Ironically, I too am 20 years old, male, and a virgin so you’re not alone. This world is a sad illusion, but you’re not alone
14	What is your experience with psychedelics (LSD, shrooms, DMT)?	As lots of us here are hopeless dreamers and spend every waking second pondering what ifs, and feeling strongly abiut different things, I was just curious to hear anybodys experiences with these substances. \n\nMy experience: After 20 years of daily pondering about, well, all the stuff you guys probably understand, why are we here, whats the point, why is it so cruel, and longing for something more, I somehow gathered the courage to try magic mushrooms despite all the discouragement (mentally ill people should stay away is the general rule). I suffer from major depression, anxiety, OCD, Tourettes, and god knows what else, but those I mentioned are all diagnosed. I ate 3g dried magic mushrooms and had ALL of my mental turmoil disappear in the blink of an eye, and, well, it really was heaven as far as I'm concerned. I felt nothing but bliss and contentment (mind you I have NEVER felt anything even 10% this positively intense before, I've been depressed since I was a child) for about 3 hours. I have never imagined this can be possible with my brain, how could it? The negative thoughts never stopped for 25 years. But somehow this handful of fungi did it just like that. \n\nThe amount of tears of joy I cried that night.. Needless to say I have never cried tears of joy before or after that in my 25+years of life
8	Last time I took a heavy mushroom trip, I took a bath and had an overwhelming sensation that I was in a womb, then I felt like a baby cared for by the universe for a couple hours, it was very positive, it helped with depression for about a month.
8	I was depressed for a couple of years and I tried to kill myself as well a few times. I was lonely, heartbroken and had no goal or direction in life. At that time I was experiencing with drugs and on Reddit I stumbled on multiply posts talking about the use of psychedelics to help with depression. So I told myself I would not kill myself before I gave LSD a chance to help me. The day came when I got some blotters with LSD, I called a friend to look over me while I took it. Afterwards I was left with a purpose, I finally had found meaning in my life. I understood why I had become depressed and how to fix it. It’s been 2 years now since my first trip and I am really glad I did it. \n\nIt did not cure me, that I have to do myself, but It really helped to get a new perspective on my life. I really hope  and believe psychedelics will be used in therapy in the future, it can help so many. \n\nAlso I am not saying this is for everyone, if you haven’t done it before and want to do so please educated yourself on the topic, some people have been damaged for life by trying psychedelics.
5	I also have hella depression/anxiety/diagnosed OCD issues so here goes:\n\nShrooms: Very pleasant, healing, fun. "Spring cleaning of the mind" is my favorite way to describe it. Left me feeling an afterglow for a long time as well. All the weird circuitous habits and hangups dissolve and you enter a restorative state of new wonder that I found very nice. I took them outside on a sunny day.\n\nLSD: Much more head-trippy than shrooms. Rough come-up. Very dependent on environment and people around. Had a nice time listening to music, lots of insane feeling closed eye visuals/morphing going on. Very strange feeling of almost...precognition? A certain connection with the others around you. Lasts a loooong time and does not really share the pleasant afterglow of shroomies.\n\nSalvia: This shit is legal, for some reason. Ranges from giggle-fits to identity-shedding expeditions into other realms.\n\n
3	Did shrooms a month or two ago, but only enough for what amounted to a buzz. Good time.\n\nDid LSD last July and holy balls. So intensely introspective. Had what I consider a spiritual experience (not religious in the slightest). Looking in the mirror I could see myself reverse age and back again. Looking at nature I got that sense of wonder I normally have, but times ten. After the trip everything was brighter and more colorful. That effect has stuck with me ever since. My depression was gone and I was happy.\n\nNote: Do your research before you do any. Make sure you know what you're getting / where it's from / who is giving it to you. Understand that bad trips can happen by simply entertaining negative thoughts. Avoid that. Understand that things that have been bothering you may show their face. Know what they are, your willingness to examine them, and proceed with the intent to look at it and extract a lesson from it.\n\nBeing with good people (not too many, one you trust is good enough) is a great help. Music is wonderful (stick to upbeat stuff or love music). If you feel something bad coming on, remember you probably have the ability to say no and turn your attention to something else. I saw the trim / molding in a house start to turn into friendly faces that were almost beckoning me to follow (meaning let my mind follow them). Then they turned very sinister. So I pulled myself back and said "No." Then the faces almost looked like little kids that had done something wrong. Sad and apologetic. It was fucking nuts.\n\nPrepare yourself for a trip. At the right dose your mind will take a trip. Through itself, through your surroundings, through your memories, through the world. At higher doses, things around you will melt or lose form. I still remember my friend's face (he took a higher dose) when he looked at us and saw that we were globs he couldn't tell apart.\n\nIt can last 8-12 hours, so plan accordingly. /r/lsd and /r/tripsit can help.
2	I love them, they give me a few hours of pure divine connection with the universe. I recently did ayahuasca with my friends and I felt so loved and protected... 
2	I've tried them, interesting experiences with lots of revelations about both the interior and exterior world.\n\nThe thing is, all the insights that can be had with drugs can be had via healthy routes as well. Instead of psychedelics, I recommend heavy manual research into systems theory, psychology, sociology, science and meditation. The healthy route to enlightenment is to first know something, then to understand it, over the years. The thing with psychedelics is that they take you straight to understanding huge amounts of information without first knowing them, which for the weaker mind can be such an overwhelming experience that it can take months or years to recover. On top of that, there is a tendency to forget most of the insights had during a trip. There is also a bit of a survivorship bias when reading about other people's experiences - you don't often hear about the unlucky minority that lost their capacity to operate in modern society, unless you talk to your friends who work in the mental health sector.\n\nJust know what you're getting into. If you're gonna try it, you absolutely should have the following:\n\n * Good life that you enjoy even without drugs (hobbies, passions, relationships etc.)\n * Decent metacognitive skills, either through meditation or other means. This will allow you have some control over your trip.\n * A safe and comfortable environment
1	some amazing great times, and some nightmarish hellish times.
1	I did shrooms for the first time and I'm not at all sure how much I took but I was able to remain sober seeming when someone knocked on the door, it can't have been too much, but IDK.\n\nRegardless, I realized by the end of it that I was like a mountain and a mother to all and it was around then that I came into my infp personality. I started caring for everyone and stopped being scared to help people with their problems. 
1	I refuse to do any illegal drugs. I'm afraid 1) I'll get addicted or 2) I'll kill myself, either intentionally or by accident. \n\nI have ADHD and high impulsivity. I also have had periods of depression with suicidal ideation and attempts.  Before I was diagnosed ADHD, I thought I had bipolar. Nope, just ADHD and severe depression. I start from a place of being unstable and out of control.  Alcohol makes me break out in handcuffs.  I don't need to introduce drugs to this hot mess. Haha. 
1	I've tried LSD and shrooms a handful of times.  Never had a bad trip, but they're just a little too intense and last way too long for my liking.   I'll never forget the first time I tripped on shrooms because one of my friends just totally lost his shit.  Not permanently, but he was rolling around on the ground, rubbing his head against the couch, making crazy sounds, it was kind of funny but kind of scary.   Another time this same friend stared into an empty chip bag for 30 minutes or so and then proceeded to freak me the fuck out by trying to explain what he had just discovered lol.  \n\nI prefer cannabis.  I get the introspection and occasional revelation without feeling like i'm going insane.  I'm glad they work for you though.  
7	What makes you feel happy and loved?	I want the guy I am dating to feel happy, loved and secure with me. I just want to make his life the best.
12	When someone else starts the conversation with me or allows me to share my opinion without being cut off. Too often I'll be talking and they'll switch the topic to something pertaining them before letting me finish. Granted we're not dating but as friends I still feel like we should still be able to have good convos
3	not being dumped.
2	When someone does something for me which they know I struggle with e.g. a friend once remembered my class schedule because she knew how forgetful I could be. I think INFPs really value little things like that. Maybe you could also find out his love language? Mine is acts of service :)
2	When I'm allowed to be myself. When I can do stupid things and laugh about it. When I can talk about what's bothering me whithout people rolling their eyes.
24	Do you guys get bullied pretty easily?	Not really a serious post I'm just curious because in my circle of friends I'm always the one who gets teased or made fun of. I know they don't mean it, they're my close friends. They just really really like how I react when they tease me. I always get flustered and they like how I just completely ignore it. Do you guys feel like that they take advantage of your personality? Because I usually just shove off any conflicts and take it all to myself than letting it out.\n\nDon't get me wrong! I still love my friends despite all of these because it all leads to fun and bonding hehe I'm just overthinking stuff
7	Honestly if your friends are doing something that you don't like please tell them that you dislike this behaviour. Please place boundaries, I know it is difficult to do this, but you will be so much happier in the end and if they don't change. This may be difficult but it may be a sign that they're not worth your time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	I can relate to this a lot ! My friends are also like this and my personality is also similar to yours I usually just ignore those comments and they don’t bother me because I know they’re not serious . Of course if a stranger would straight up tell me something like that I’d form a reaction lol . Either way I think it’s depending on the person if it doesn’t bother me then I feel no need in taking action then again i feel like if it ever goes too far I should take action and speak up for myself . 
2	Yes I was always usually the punching bag of the group. Or I become the one that people come to for favors (occasionally outrageous or unreasonable ones)\nI say ‘was’ because my circle of friends is small now. It’s made me very distrustful and guarded around people. A few days ago I wrote about having an unapproachable resting bitch face and this is one of the reasons, to be honest.\n\nOf course, I am NOT encouraging other INFPs to become this way
1	Yes. My personality is such that I like to be zany and express myself as kind of dumb. I am, however, a member of MENSA so this is undoubtedly the wrong perception of me. So it goes.
1	In my current group of friends, I've actually noticed that I'm treated very gently when it comes to the bullying among friends, which kind of bothers me in itself. I was indirectly bullied by people who actually meant it quite a bit in middle and high school though.
1	Yeah I totally have this, any friendship group I end up a part of it's always me that gets the most picked on and teased, most the time I see it as more endearing, if I wasn't liked by people I don't think I'd get teased as much, but occasionally it does get pretty exhausting when you're the one constantly picked on.
1	No.  I'm assertive and won't take crap from people.  Among people I know, I'm just not fun to bully or tease because I don't take things personally.  Because I don't mind if they say things, there is little fun to be had by the others (because getting a reaction is the point of teasing).
1	Kinda. Used to be worse. Instead, I just have fewer friends 
1	Yeah, I once thought I was autistic because I'm slow to come up with a good comeback and even then I'm no good with them and jokes. I also don't take humor lightly. Huge target for immature neurotypicals. I'm still too quirky to let myself into society's grasp. 
1	Bullied: Back in my school days--yes, absolutely. Even when I went through a very extroverted phase in middle school, it was hard for me to stand up for myself when I was bullied by someone. I couldn't think of any good comebacks. I just kinda stood there and took it and felt frustrated for hours or even days afterward. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTeased: Also yes. It's been a while since I've been in a social gathering that isn't overly polite and PC, so it's mostly my fiance teasing me and annoying me because he thinks I look cute when I'm mad. My face shows A LOT of expression. 
1	I actually don’t. I’m one of the “popular” ones. Although I’m introverted and always skip parties xd\n\nBut people say that one can’t hate me cause I have a nice personality..  don’t know if I believe that tho! Haha
3	When there are no trails close by, and my introvert nature spirit is, just so sad! All the feels!	
2	Well doesn’t all trails only show trails people already made and mapped? So go pave a new trail! Just go roam around, see what there is.
1	Is that because ur in the middle of the woods, or the middle of a city? What app is that? Is this an AMA?
21	Passion Crisis	I'm currently in school, next year most of my friends are off to Uni. I'm having a crisis because I have no passions. I have no plans, and when I look for options and hear people say 'What are you passionate about' I can't help but get totally stressed out about it.\nI have no passion. I'm not talented in any creative and am doing chemistry and biology. I'm now in the situation where I feel completly stuck. I don't know what i want to do. Is there any advice you have for me/ job ideas for an infp.
6	Hey don’t worry I had the same problem in high school, I ended up at a liberal arts university and basically just did loads of different classes and ended up somehow in a philosophy class fell in love from that day forward and basically can’t really imagine myself doing anything else really and it was only after the fact that I realize how much sense it made Caus I’ve always loved history and big complicated ideas rather than details. So really don’t worry I’m a 100% sure you will find something you love to do it just takes a lot of time. I recommend you look into something that is not corporate structure orientated, I find this kind of settings really alienating and unbearable, so maybe something like Teaching (university level, school level whatever you prefer), social worker for adopted children, basically anything where you can physically see some objectively moral good things happening around you, maybe even psychology but I definitely DO NOT recommend marketing or just business/economics diplomas in general, very dehumanizing and alienating subjects imo. 
5	Practice keeping a still mind. Perhaps adopt meditation if you don’t already. Don’t push the issue and back off it a bit in your mind. I find the answers I am seeking show up in that little space I give myself. Good luck, I’m cheering for you.🤟🏼
4	So if I read you correctly, you are graduating this year and haven't planned what you're doing after you graduate? But you're not sure because you don't know what you're truly interested in? Just take a breath, it's okay not to be sure at this point. Many people fall into their career paths, others are more "fixed", we all approach it differently :)\n\nI would use the time you have this year to go and\n\n1. Do something on your own, feel the challenge and motivation of being truly independent, like travel, or do a personal project (the project you select, will probably be in an area you are naturally interested and good at). Ideal if you can make some money for your savings and use that to do some more things that are 100% independent and tap into you Ne, helping you to explore new things. Like travelling, volunteering etc.\n2. Let me keep it KISS for you around the "General" skill areas. You may have an idea of what 'generally' sounds interesting to you. They mostly all fit under very few categories and you can upskill and shift throughout your life so it's not 100% essential you just pick one speciality: **Business** (marketing, data/analytics, business operations, finance/accounting, customer service, logistics/inventory management, HR and compliance, accounting, production line/supply chain), **Creative** (graphic design, art, music, creative director, videographer, editor, architect), **Tech** (software engineering, product management, ops, user experience design, UI design, QA analyst or tester, hardware engineering, production manager), **Engineering** (civil, environmental, mechanical etc), **Science** (research, teaching, technician, engineering), **Maths** (statistician, data analyst, data scientist, data visualiser etc), **Community services** (social work, community worker, youth worker, age care worker, assessment officer, recovery worker, community engagement, grant developer etc), **Administration** (office manager, office assistant, secretary, reception etc), **Legal and crime** (lawyer, clerk, legal assistant, court support, correctional officer, police officer, detective, criminologist etc), **Health** (nurse, doctor, GP, surgeon, lab tech, psychologist, psychiatrist, nutritionist, physiotherapist, massage therapist, dietician, recovery worker, fitness coach etc), **Education** (teacher, researcher and lecturer, facilitator, trainer, public speaker, trainer, group trainer, coach), **Sales** (customer service, client relationship manager, business manager, customer journey manager, client services director), **Trades** (plumber, manual labour, gardener, handy man, construction, installer and maintenance, metal worker, wood worker etc)\n3. Start dappling and see what you enjoy. And remember to breathe! :)
2	I don't suppose you like to write? There's a good market for medical writers with degrees in the life sciences. Medical writing includes a wide range of projects, from penning healthcare advertising copy to writing clinical study reports and grant proposals. Some jobs in the field require advanced degrees, but others do not. 
1	If you are in primary school, just follow your interest in chemistry and biology.  You'll find work that matters to you later.  You can't be passionate about things you don't know about, so go out and explore different topics or activities.  Eventually something might catch your fancy.  So just *do*, whatever it is.  Some things will turn out to be duds, others will be interesting.  It's all part of finding your way.
1	I have this issue and its burning me every day. Just dont settle on something when it could be better. You owe yourself that much.
1	If you have interests, follow that.\n\nIf not, and if you have to go to school right now, then I'd recommend doing something that you don't absolutely hate, but that also can give you the most money for the least amount of time spent at a job, like something you could maybe survive on part time. I'm not sure what that might be, but if you did find something like that, then at least when you do find your passion, you will have more time available for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr, just something generally useful that won't be a waste later. You can always change careers if you find something new that you love, but in that case, a more general education will likely serve you better than something very specific. It may also help you find something you like.
627	Shy buyer.	
39	And then if an employee asks me if I need help, I lie and say no.
24	I do this legit and then in the total end when I still haven’t found it cause I’m just a goofy ass then I mentally prepare myself for 20 more minutes to ask someone
18	It's honestly easier when you just push through and ask. It's such a tiny thing, the anxiety is mostly in your head.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy issue is that I often ask for things when they happen to be within a 5 foot radius of where I was standing when I asked... there are so many damn things!
6	I like to stare at fancy yogurth glass cups.
2	Word. 
2	istp, same goes, except i hate asking for help in general
2	I do this when the thing could be expensive and I'm not prepared to get it at the shop. While one is not obliged to buy simply because one was assisted by a salesperson, it kinda feels like dashing the hopes of the salesperson, especially when there's a sales commission involved, or wasting their time. Of course I may be projecting, and it's their job to help you and to manage their own expectation.\n\n40 min is a bit too long to not ask for help and still keep searching though.
2	I'm sorry, I don't mean any offense by this but I find this a total waste of time and completely illogical.\nI'd be thinking of everything else I need to do and then just say to myself: "Well the sooner I ask the person over there who's job it is to know what I'm looking for *and tell us customers where things are* , the sooner I can go and get on with my day."

1	This was me before EMDR therapy.
5	Why do you bottle up your feelings instead of trying to figure them out? Is it general INFP behaviour? Or immature INFP bahaviour?	This might come off as a weird post, since I'm INTP myself. I have had two friends that are both INFPs. One is still my friend. They're somehow alike. When it comes to strong emotions, they tend to hide what they feel. I know that according to the stereotypes, I am the one full of logic and can't comprehend emotion, but I don't think that's true. I don't easily call someone my friend; I need a lot of time to build a friendship. I call someone a friend if I feel that I can share everything with them and that doesn't happen really often. These two humans are notable exceptions... they're a bit weird, just like I am. They get my shitty jokes. They can talk about deeper things or feelings they feel, just as I do... but they seem to lose their grip at times. I tell them I'm by their side if they need my help, but they want more to keep the friendship floating than to express their needs. Or maybe I'm wrong, they don't actually need me...? Both seem(ed) to respect me and enjoy my company, even a bit more than I'm comfortable with. They seem capable to go put of their way to do things for me, which is hard to understand for me. But we're all different. Important to note: both these INFPs are male and 19. Do you express yourself better as an older INFP? Or is it basically the same? I'm 21 and female, if that matters.
6	I'll tell you my experience with this.\n\nExposing my emotions to people who I don't have a deep bond with feels scary. It's like an invasion of privacy. If I told them my emotions, I leave myself open to attack. I have to deeply trust someone before they will even get a glimpse of the strong emotions going on behind my mask. I feel much safer keeping up a facade and figuring out my emotions in my head, alone.\n\nI do have one friend who I talk to about my feelings fairly regularly. It took me absolutely ages to get to this point with someone. But, even then, I still feel the need to only share the surface level emotion and not the emotion in full depth. That's because it would be pretty exhausting for them to deal with, and it's probable that they won't understand how I'm feeling. Constantly doing this would just put a strain on our friendship. I just find it more safe to be introspective alone, than with other people. On very rare occasions, I won't be able to bottle up my emotions anymore, and they'll just come out like a bomb. But, I am starting to find ways of handling that by doing things, such as keeping a journal of my thoughts and feelings.\n\nI wouldn't say I don't figure out why I'm feeling how I'm feeling though. I'm constantly analysing (probably over-analysing) why I'm feeling how I am. It's just never in the form of a dialogue with someone. This is the thing I enjoy doing the most.\n\nSo, for me, it's kind of a mixture of wanting to protect myself and them.
4	The thing about strong emotions is that if we didn't push them down, we'd be a complete mess in front of people. Hiding it doesn't mean that it's not there.\n\nThe more I feel, the less I show. Fi is inward focused. I feel inside. It's not expressive. I need time alone to figure out what all the feelings mean. I have always had difficulty expressing myself in person and in speech, but it's much easier in writing. I can remain inward focused while writing.\n\nWhen I try to explain in person, I can't focus on the person outside of me and their reaction to what I am saying,  and also what is going on inside at the same time. When I try to explain, there are long silences where I have to ignore the person and focus inward and then find the right words, then focus on the person and say the words. Check for cues to see if the person understands, is getting impatient, or if they think I'm a freak now. Then realize that I didn't choose quite the right words, focus inward again, ignoring the person, come back with the right word... It's very awkward, and most people wouldn't have the patience to sit through that with me. If I can get a few minutes alone, I could just write it down and give it to you. It's easier that way, but most people would think that's really weird, so I don't do that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess, think of it similarly to how Ti is for you, maybe? I don't know what Ti is like. Probably less confusing? Is it easy to express your thoughts to people the very moment that an idea of a new theory comes to you, or do you need time to process and figure it out alone first?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like to give people things. It makes me happy to make them happy. I don't expect anything in return and I often soon forget that I even gave someone something. So if you're worried about owing them for what they've given you, I don't think you need to be. Although, with the opposite sex, it's possible that they could be giving you things because they LIKE you, but still, there's probably no strings attached.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I was just thinking about this again and I think part of the problem with talking about feelings is that I feel rushed, because speaking is so fast. Being rushed causes stress, stress makes Te kick in. Te wants to be efficient, which makes me approximate, rather than be careful in the descriptions that I use. Later, I will remember what I said and realize that it wasn't accurate, even though I did my best at the time. then I will worry that you'll get the wrong idea of what kind of person I am, based on the inaccurate descriptions that I gave you and it will make me upset. So, it's better not to say anything.\n\nOne thing to add about writing letters. Once I've written out how I feel and figured it out, and figured out why and what that means. I'm done with it. Unless there is some reason that you also need to understand what I feel and why, there is no point in sharing. I've written a lot of letters that I've never sent. Really, I never intended to send them. The times that I want to talk to others about how I feel, it is likely because I want to ask advice about how they would handle something. Usually people older than me whose judgement I trust. The rest of the time, I can figure myself out on my own.
2	A lot of times we only know our surface level “feelings” until we actually talk about them. Or at least, that’s the case with me. The problem with that is when you know you should talk to you “thinker” friends about how your feelings, but you’re not sure how to express it until someone points out that you’re acting a certain way that is abnormal and asks you “why”. \n\nMy husband is an INTJ, and for a long time, even though he cared, I had trouble telling him what was wrong, because I couldn’t figure out how to begin expressing my thoughts and emotions without someone asking a specified question. He’s since figured that out for me, and will ask prompting sort of questions. \n\nA huge flaw with INFPs is that we often times enjoy the idea of social interaction, but not the reality of it. This can be greatly attributed to one of the reasons why we tend to not share our hearts with people very easily. I really do hate being that way, and I struggle hard against those tendencies. It’s like we want a deep friendship just instantaneously, and without effort. \n\nImmaturity is what causes a lot of INFPs to be or stay this way. The more socially immature the INFP is, the harder the other person has to work to pull the INFP out of their shell. Typically it isn’t a matter of disliking someone, it’s just the inability to change and better oneself by strengthening weaknesses.
1	Well, if I know my feelings will hurt the other person I tend not to say them. Or if I think they cannot handle my emotions. Or if I think they are not trustworthy to know what I am feeling and why.\n\nI am not afraid of facing my emotions and figuring them out though. In fact, I feel that is very healthy.
1	I generally don't tell my feelings to anyone, especially not to my two close INTP friends. I like to listen to theirs but don't tell them mine since I feel like I would be misunderstood by them anyway so I don't even bother making the effort. If I really have something to get off my chest I go to my ISFP friend (Fi things). Though that's also very rare. I think it was like 3 years ago since I last talked with someone about my feelings, I just prefer it that way. Fi is an internally analyzing function and I'm feeling more comfortable keeping it that way. If I feel something I want to figure it out by myself and need some time for that.\n\n>Why do you bottle up your feelings instead of trying to figure them out?\n\nNow that's quite surprising. Internal emotional order (a core part of Fi imo) is the most important thing to me and I can't exist properly if I'm feeling something and I don't know what and why that is.
125	But paradoxically when anyone does invite me to something I ghost them hard.	
14	Yep. Feels like a good idea at first, then you're actaully out and before you know it you're looking for an excuse to bail. 
7	The solution: introverts unite! from the comfort of our own homes!
6	Sometimes I go out because I feel like I should socialize, and then I come back home and realize I like my own solitude more.\n\nIt's like, when being by myself feels bad, I go out and socialize, only to remind myself how much I enjoy being by myself.
3	OOF too real
2	I hate going out with too many people. I hate party’s and discos. I don’t like to be outside for too long lol 
1	Recently saw an interesting video about [loneliness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Xv_g3g-mA)
1	In the Netherlands we have a word for 'being in the presence of people'. It's this weird mixture of the meaning of the word cozy and fun, but it really doesn't mean either. We call it 'gezellig'. Whenever people ask 'how was it?' - referring to a social situation - I can always answer 'gezellig' and I'm never lying. I was around people. Had they asked 'was it fun?' I would've answered differently.. usually.
4	DAE struggle with social gatherings, specifically family functions?	I strongly dislike attending family functions and have done all that I can to get out of them. I generally don't enjoy the small talk and feel as if much of my family is tolerating my presence and would be just fine without my attendance. I see them often enough and find the frequent functions excessive.\n\nThere's a fine line between social anxiety and introversion, but I don't feel guilty about missing unless someone calls me out. I've  explained my point of  view  and preferences  numerous  times,  but usually just get  called selfish.\n\nam I being unreasonable or is this something common amongst introverts?\n\n

13	Keeping our sh*t together	Do you have personal strategies for dealing with the overwhelming feeling caused by the complex world we live in? If yes, what are they? If not, is it deliberate?\n\nI've come to the realization that since my teenage years, I have researched and developed various strategies for keeping my mind peacefully anchored in the present reality. My greatest tool in finding these strategies is my sensitivity, because I'm quick to notice whether something is good or bad for me. Below are the most important ones for me, in no particular order. As a disclaimer, I'm a male in my mid twenties, and what works for me may not work for you.\n\n* Exercise, namely weightlifting and dancing. As a teen, I did not have a productive outlet for a certain type of 'angst' that builds up over time during everyday life, which led to me being moody and occasionally dump my bad feelings on other people. Over time I've adapted a regular exercise routine, which includes weightlifting and dancing. The pure focus while being under 250 pounds of metal, and pristine flow state while dancing intensely to the music I love, is something for me that flushes my body and mind of a certain negative energy (cortisol?). Being physically tired while on endorphins after the routine is something that gives me great temporary bliss, which I have to keep up, because I start to notice the bad energy buildup if I skip exercise for more than 3 days.\n* Meditation. I've only done this for a year, but the awareness that I've gained into the workings of my own mind has already paid off hugely. I've realized that there is not one unified "me", but rather a collection of different mind processes, each with their own goals and motives. For me the most commons ones are the mind-wanderer, the planner, the dreamer, the worrier, the hedonist, the self-hater. I'm starting to be able to have a productive dialogue with the mind processes I've mentioned. Meditation is not about blocking the unpleasant parts of me, but rather accept them and work with them. For example, if I need to focus on something important right now and the worrier starts talking in my head, I can acknowledge it and make a deal with the worrier to have another discussion later. The self-hater part in me is a result of certain childhood trauma, and when it comes up telling me how no one will ever love me, I'll just tell it: "I appreciate your opinion, but here's some reasons why I disagree with you". The hedonist wants alcohol, fast food and porn, but I'll promptly let them know that that is not the kind of person I want to be. On the contrary, when the situation is right, I'll let the dreamer and planner out to do their work. Over time, the parts that I don't want in my life have gotten more silent, while the parts I like get stronger.\n* Avoiding "hyperstimulants". Our world is filled with natural aspects of life amplified to their extremes. We like sugar and fat, so refined sugar and deep-fried monstrosities lie everywhere. We like sex, which is why it's everywhere in media, advertisements and as porn on the internet. We like attention and social connections, which is why we get addicted to social media. We like information, which is why we are constantly bombarded with piece-meal news feeds we read and forget. What is common with all of these, is that they are essentially empty calories; they give temporary satisfaction and an illusion of nutrition, but ultimately leave me feeling unfulfilled. They also shift the baseline for normalcy, for which the following examples apply: The longer I keep eating refined sugar and saturated fats, the less tasty normal food feels like. The more I watch porn, the less interesting and beautiful regular women seem like. The more I spend time on social media, the less pleasure I get from genuine human interactions. The more I spend time reading shocking news around the world, the less time and energy I have for the information that is actually useful for me. It makes me sad that our world is filled to the brink with these "empty calories" on all aspects of life, but at least we can take proactive measures to greatly limit our exposure to it.\n* What to eat and when. This is highly personal, and what I do will probably not work for you, but I suggest some experimentation in this department. I eat all my food I need to eat during an 8-hour window, then fast for the next 16 hours until the next day (intermittent fasting). I prefer fat, protein, slow carbohydrates and vegetables over fast carbohydrates. The difference between the right and wrong rhythm and nutrition for me is huge; if I'm doing it wrong, I feel cloudy, moody and tired; doing it right, I feel clear and present.\n* Picking my poison. I used to be addicted to lots of things at the same time, namely alcohol, fast food, porn and nicotine (snus, which is a smokeless kind of tobacco). While ideally there would be none, an approach of slow, controlled decline works for me. Now I'm only down to nicotine, and will keep it for an indefinite amount of time, and that is OK. Perfectionism can be a harmful ideal, and it's always good to remember that "good enough is good enough". It's better to have zero addictions than one addiction, but it is definitely better to have only one addiction rather than four of them.\n\nNow it's your turn - let's share some information so that we can learn from each other and better navigate this messy world.
4	Thanks for sharing, its sad that longer posts always end up with few upvotes. 
5	> what I do will probably not work for you\n\nSo glad to see this when you mention eating.  Too many people think there are one-size-fits-all dietary recommendations, which is simply not true.  Anyway...\n\nExercise - agreed!  I do yoga, bicycle, and walk.  Used to play footie and trained in karate, too.  We are all about movement of energy, transitioning from yesterday through today to tomorrow - and our physical bodies are part of that, too.  Movement is key.  Clean eating is essential.\n\nMeditation - I practice this sometimes.  I've had a hyperactive mind, so getting to the point of being able to meditate was good.  A helpful resource for me was www.calmdownmind.com in which a man blogged about his personal discovery and reflections on how that unfolded.  It helped me sort through my own patterns and habits and open a door to changing for the better.  Simply looking around while I walk abruptly stops the mind chatter, keeping me present here and now.\n\nEmotions - Not taking things personally has had the biggest impact.  When others are upset or happy or bothered are in any other state, it's about them.  I'm not responsible for them being happy or upset.  I might be responsible for whatever triggered it, and will work to change my habits and become a better human being - but their emotions are their business.  Likewise, my emotions are mine to clean up, not to dump on others.  So when I'm off kilter emotionally, I reflect and meditate to find what is going on and sort it out.\n\nNon-judgment - starting with self.  Extend that to others, as well.  If a thought pops up that *he shouldn't this* or *she should have that*, I remind myself that they have their own path to walk and I am in no position to know what is best for them.
3	I take a walk every day. Not only it's good for my body and gives me time to listen to music (I can't BREATHE without music 😄), but it's also THE most valuable and important me-time. You are all introverts, so you know what I'm talking about. In that time I (obviously) reanalyse my thoughts and emotions and I usually write something if a lot of things are on my mind. Writing (read: being productive) makes me motivated and motivation makes me write. I get stuck in that loop and it keeps me in the good mood. I am walking daily so it never stops.
3	I like to make sure I expose myself to things that are helpful, such as informative or motivating podcasts. I also try to steer away from negative, energy draining things if possible...like browsing political subs. So I guess this may build upon your last point by adding something positive to replace those negative addictions. 
2	Thank you for sharing this insightful post. I'm sure you also have the loving mind process, which is why you share this.
14	This was my jam back in 2015... One of the Fi-est songs I've ever heard 😄😄 Drop your favourites down there and tell me what you think about this one (don't worry it isn't rickroll, I wouldn't do that to wonderful souls like you 😉❤)	
2	Love this song! 
2	Wow, this song is actually pretty good. I thought it was a radiohead song in the first part. I can see myself jamming to this. I love the lyrics.
2	this song is great! my favorite is the morning by the weeknd[The Morning - The Weeknd](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir4HfQL4XkQ) 
21	When INFPs *Alone* so hard they spontaneously enter into a relationship with themselves...	
2	I kiss myself in the morning too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: If anyone's interested, apparently this is a short film called Cipher from 1989 and it's on Youtube "Cipher the Video", 40 minutes long.
2	If anyone is curious, yes, the translation it accurate, lol. 
2	This fucking dub bahahhahaha.
2	Lol
28	INFP males, do you feel like you have to "hold back" when talking to your friend's girlfriends because it's so easy to connect with them?	And sometimes you feel like you might be connecting with them easier and on a deeper level than your friend can so therefore you have to be more avoidant and superficial with her? 
23	Just wish single girls were as eager to speak to me as my bros girls.
16	Yes.  I am naturally drawn to get to know people on a deep level.  Some of my friends simply aren't wired this way.  So yeah.  It happens all the time.  \n\nMy friends know this about me.  They also know I'm very respectful and would never do anything with their girl.  I just make it a point to read the room and back off when I notice my friend is feeling uncomfortable.   \n\nIt also helps to steer the conversation toward how good they are as a couple and positively reinforce their friendship.   
3	I will say that I have indeed always developed an unusually good relationship with my roommate’s numerous (sigh) girlfriends. I understand the boundaries and I never feel weird or like I should be dating them instead, but it does make me realize that I just have a knack for connecting with people when the setting is more intimate. Like if we aren’t all in public and playing these games of getting each other’s attention, I finally get my chance to do what I do best.
4	Mr. Steal Your Girl. All the time. I’ll validate all your feelings. Haha. It’s a gift and a curse.
3	Most definitely. Sometimes it happens so naturally I notice that 30 minute sounds have gone by and my guy friends te talking in one room and I’m with the girls. It’s strange.
3	10000%. If I see them enough , I usually have to hold myself back. Some of my guy friends in the past don't appreciate it because I've been told that I'm filling an emotional void they just don't understand.
2	no my social interaction skills vanished somehow and i have no idea how to keep conversations going interesting for others...\nid love to bond with people, but i somehow cant anymore. too woke for all the normies hahaha\n\nmhh ._.
3	Have you ever taken the enneagram test? If so, what did you get?	I got 6w5, but admittedly I was pretty depressed at the time so it might not be accurate. 
7	4w5 :)
3	Ive literally written an entire paper on my enneagram but I can't remember it right now
3	9w1.
2	I got 9w1, but I wish I was 7. :)
3	4w5
2	4w5 
2	9w6
2	9w4
58	Any other INFP guys feel outcasted?	I feel like people just see me as the 'nice guy' but nothing more, anyone else relate? Like, I try to be helpful but people dont seem to see anything past that.
38	Yeah, same here. \n\nI feel outcasted because of my laid back demeanor, nothing really seems to bother me, and I kind of don't show any real emotions or reactions. I don't think people take me seriously, and no one ever listens to me whenever I talk, even though I end up being right most of the time. It's tough, but you've to learn to be comfortable with yourself. 
15	I do feel outcasted (ie I don’t really enjoy typical “guy” stuff, I feel much more at ease around female friends, I make a lot more 1-on-1 platonic relationships than with “the boys”, etc.), but it does give me a sense of personal identity that I cherish deeply. I have my down periods where I feel estranged but other than that I’m totally content with how unique I am.
12	Not like you described, but yeah, I absolutely feel like an outcast. Between my personality and my incredibly short stature (I have a form of dwarfism) I genuinely feel like an alien living among a different species. 
10	My best friend of 20 years is INFP and he is nice but also charismatic and smart. During the earlier years of our friendship, he is friendly enough with people on the surface level but he hardly let anyone know about him on a deeper level.\n\nWe’ve had rough patches every now and then and I don’t know why you guys do this but sometimes, in your times of deepest despair, you push your closest friends away. Like why you guys do that? I couldn’t understand it at first and I was like wtf? You guys (INFP) stopped communicating with your friends and won’t reply to emails. I and a few of his other close friends were angry and basically we were like mate, if you don’t want us, it hurts but okay we respect your decision. \n\nAfter a few months, i think I was at home scrolling through my news feed and it said one of his favourite authors was releasing a new book. I was thinking of reaching out to him but given that he ignored all of us and didn’t reply to any of our messages I was hesitant to do it. After all, who else would want to keep reaching out if your friend stopped giving a fuck about his friends. It took a week before I finally said wth and sent him a message. I told him hey, how you’ve been. I saw author A had a new book. I told myself if he doesn’t reply I’m moving on with my life. \n\nHe replied a few hours later and then I called him. Didn’t get to talk much as I was busy but slowly our messages started becoming longer and longer. When I finally went back to our hometown about two months later, we had a chat. He told me the reason he didn’t reply to any of our messages was that he didn’t want us to see him while he’s at rock bottom. I don’t know if it’s just him or it’s what you INFP people usually do but isn’t the point of having friends are that so they can comfort you when you’re down? I don’t know if he was testing us or not to see who would still be there for him even after pushing everyone away but it did sorta work. All our other friends are still his friends but they stayed at that superficial level while we became best friends. 
5	Most definitely, today especially. My family came over for dinner. I go to school for directing in theatre and i like makeup and fashion and such (im embarrassed of it, mostly because im a guy and feel as though i cant express it).\n\nBut anyway, my family came over and im the youngest and the only guy in my immediate family so im always the center of jokes. Not only that but i cant relate to them on any aspect of interest.\n\nBut hey, i guess that means i have a way of seeing the world in a way they dont, and i get to have that for myself and no one else.
6	Yup. Have a lot of friends but it feels like I'm the only one who is without a best friend. Eventually, everyone leaves and I'll be here, waiting for a best friend.
5	This is something I've struggled with my whole life. I've come to the resolve that I walk alone but will always have people fall in (or out) of my life. I love discussing this but I'll keep it short, you aren't alone. We will find our happiness, it'll just be a much more intricate path than others.
4	i did 4 a loongg time but just recently started (within th3 past year or so) making friends all over the place!! ive made a serious effort to push my comfort zone and forcing myself 2 get out of the house... i still feel like a total weirdo a lot of the times but... i have a few others 2 chill with :)))
4	Yeah I do a lot. I think im seen as a nice guy but not someone you'd ever invite to do anything with. I think my problem is I have a hard time opening up to people who aren't really close to me so I tend to not show as much personality as id like to
6	I feel I am self outcasted? Since I should go out more. But yea. Once I get into a group I get accepted usually easy. As a weird sometimes quiet and a nice guy. But i think the issue is (for me anyway) there are things I take differently or talk about them differently than other ppl.\n\nLike I know few girls around me think i am not thinking about sex a lot, but its because sex is a natural part of a relationship so mentioning it 24/7 is kinda meh.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is, our view of things can make other ppl think we are different than we are before they get to know us for real. Which can take TIME. ^^
5	yup, even though I used to have a lot of great friendships in the end I always ended up alone. It's though but I am slowly learning how to be alone, at least I have a lot of time to be creative, work on my little projects that are making me happy. 
3	Definitely, I've felt this way for many years. I used to struggle a lot more because I would put others needs before my own and was a people pleaser. \n\nOne of the best skills I learned is how to say no and form boundaries. I used to be busy and stressed all the time, worrying about what others think, meeting social expectations, etc. Trying to be a "nice guy" like you said. However, I was miserable and often taken for granted. \n\nOnce I started saying no, prioritizing my own time and values, life became easier and people began to show more respect. If you create a want in others (for your time, attention, help, etc) then you will be viewed as more valuable. This sounds selfish, but that's how behavior works, motivation is derived from deprivation. \n\nStay strong and value your self worth! 
2	I dunno if you've watched the green book, but if you have: i feel like Don Shirley during that scene (if you've seen the movie you know which one I'm talking about) where he reveals how much of an outcast he feels. Never feel like I fully belong to a social group. Much easier for me to have one on one interactions/friendships
1	I only ever feel outcasted wheneve I'm near a bunch of other guys, especially if they're talling about stereotypical guy things like cars or sports. I'm usually able to befriend girls really easily though.
1	Yeah. I don't have the "nice" label, but I simply can't make a connection with people. 
52	Mood: infp	
1	How? Why?
4	INFP-T and INFP-A?	I am laid back most of the time but can get submissive and self conscious but also aggressive and assertive... have other infps “grown into” a mostly A type of mostly T type? I’m about to graduate high school and wonder if I’ll end up leaning or fully go to a T or A type. Any older infps that are willing to share their growth from high school and their personality?
1	I don't put a ton of stock with the 16 personalities test, but I've always tested as an infp-A. \n\nI struggled with emotional volatility a lot as a kid, but I'm pretty emotionally stable now. \n\nMy assertiveness comes from the idea that I'm inherently valuable. Other people can't give me my value and they can't take it away. I don't really fear being disliked by other people, because I don't exist to be liked by others, I exist to be at peace with myself. \n\n
1	T and A weren't a thing when I was in high school, but my enneagram type has changed. I think that T and A are the most likely to fluctuate, so I wouldn't be surprised if it changes for you!
26	any female infps who have trouble hanging out with friends?	im in high school still but multiple times over many months/few years ive gotten the same results on the myers briggs test so i think my personality type is justified. but when im out with friends, if i get ignored once itll ruin the whole thing for me. if im not treated the exact same as one other person i end up shutting up and being stuck in my head the rest of the night. any tips on how to control this?
9	You just go to accept the fact that not everybody will think and act the same way as you and that the world doesn’t just evolve around us. Try to be more vocal because nobody knows what we’re really thinking unless we say it. If it bothers you, communicate. It’s good that while you are young that you practice being more assertive and at the same time open to anything that could strike you and giving healthy reactions. Don’t worry. What you feel is absolutely normal. You just gotta learn on how to deal with it positively without shutting yourself from the world. 
3	Yes, I'm pretty much the only introvert in my regular friend group and it makes it really hard for me to feel like I belong. Even if i'm having fun at the beginning of the night, by the end I just want to go home. Like my friends are really loud and crazy and i'm not like that at all. Sometimes I don't even think we should be friends because we're so different, but I don't want to be completely friendless so I still hang out with them. There used to be more people in our "group" but all the people I got along with the best don't hang out with us anymore. I do have other friends, but I don't drive and so I don't ever ask anyone to hang out cause I hate feeling like a burden or asking for favors so I wait until they ask me. 
2	First, this is so me it hurts 😂\n\nBut second, I always try to force myself to push it aside for the time being. Then, when I can be alone with my thoughts, I try to say those thoughts of "This person said this bc they secretly hate me" (or whatever crazy things I convince myself of) out loud. Many times, when I hear them out loud, they just sound illogical, so I can get over it pretty fast.
1	Maybe there is a reason the people you liked most don’t hang out anymore. Have you tried asking them? They may have the same issues you have with feeling left out. Regardless I would encourage you to keep looking for opportunities to find new people who you feel safe to be yourself around. It can be challenging to take a risk and step out of your comfort zone but it could be good for you.\nAlso I always tell people to find groups or clubs that meet weekly or monthly so you can get to know people more slowly and there isn’t so much pressure.
1	So I did the exact same thing and still do on occasion. Also I had SHITTY friends in high school. And I hate being the person that people seem to graze over in conversation sometimes and will instead focus on the other people in the group.\n\nA few things: first, when you get out into the real world you'll likely meet people who are more like you and will also be very conscious of how others are feeling in the group and so you won't have to question your place or feel excluded because you'll be involved with better people for you. \n\nSecond, in terms of practical advice, I always ask myself: am I acting unfriendly? Am I giving off a vibe that I don't want to be talked to? Usually when this was the biggest issue was also a time when I was pretty self-absorbed and if I was honest with myself, not really interested in who I was hanging out with. Your subconscious beliefs affect how others approach you in conversation and how they interact with you.\n\nSo maybe you could try to focus on how you feel about the people you're hanging out with? Do you want to hang out with them? Are you actually having fun or do you maybe just not want to be alone? Do you guys have things in common? Also, try not to take it too personally if people ignore your or don't give you adequate response. Most people don't even notice they're doing it (sometimes awkward people don't even realize when they're cornering someone). 
2	How to other personality types react to/perceive infps?	Does everyone else see us the same way we see ourselves? Or do they see us as forgettable and passed off easily because we seem to come and go in conversations and friendships from time to time
3	I don't know for sure, but the people that I have clashed with are usually xSTJs. Every little thing I say or do seems to irritate them
9	How to be a good friend to an infp? I'm an intj who has no understanding of emotional cues	I'm an intj who's friends (pen pals) with this infp for quite a long time. Naturally, we roast each other all the time, and there are no boundaries as such. No matter how severe the burn, we always have laughed it off and never been cross for too long. \n\nBut I'm dumb and sometimes feel I go too far. Especially when she's feeling down / not in the mood to be exchanging quips. I just want to make her laugh and not be sad.\n\nAnd not ruin our friendship in the process. \n\nWhat do infps want to hear when they are overwhelmed? 
5	If her feelings get hurt, she probably tempers that with the understanding that you are trying to maintain your rapport. It's very likely she gives you the benefit of the doubt. \n\nBe direct about your intentions/ wishes. Check in when you feel you *have* gone too far. Ask what's on her mind/ weighing on her. Try not to interrupt with solutions, but do ask if you can offer your perspective/ solutions after listening.\n\nIt means a great deal to me when people ask if I can open up to them, when they listen, and when they offer up perspectives I may not have considered
5	I dunno, I don't find intjs are clueless at all. Sometimes tactless, but there are people out there who have much worse ability to empathise, understand etc. And a lot are feelers! Give yourself some credit :-) \n\n1. I would use your intj gift of understanding, to try and see her point of view. As in, a feeling may not be "logical" but it makes sense from within the gamut of her personality, "I can see that she is effected negatively by x, because of y"  \n2. Show you understand, before you respond/react\n3. Ask questions and be curious if it doesn't make sense to you. Even if you need to be silent and "compute" \n4. Finally, articulate your perspective, that clearly shows you don't intend to cause harm, after (very important) you have done the above steps. You may also explain how you approach things upfront "hey i'm sometimes shit with feelings, but it's not personal" before any misunderstanding has occured. Infps will be interested in your individual perspectives, and will remember it. 
5	My sister is an intj so I understand your situation. I often notice she wants to cheer me up whenever I'm feeling down but fails to do so. She would straight away suggest solutions and tell me not to do this and that. I think it's not a bad thing as intjs are great at coming up with good plans. \n\nBut as an infp, I would really appreciate someone who don't judge my feelings first whenever I'm overwhelmed. I would open up and talk about them easily to someone who's more emphatic and genuinely trying to understand it. It's like going through a phase, acknowledging emotions first, then only accepting new perceptives and solutions. Good luck! 
3	Questions are nice. How are you feeling, how did that happen, is there anything I can do for you? \n\nWhen someone tries to cheer me up, it feels like they are not interested in what I’m feeling. I’ll shut up then but I’ll feel even lonelier and crappier, even tho I’ll put on a brave face. It’s the nicest feeling when someone is just interested and let’s me process a bit with them. It passes quickly too then, I need that moment to experience and reflect. Once that’s done, I’ll be upbeat and optimistic again in a heartbeat.\n\nTrying to cheer up doesn’t work in that sense, it just seems to invalidate my feelings, which are there and they need to be acknowledged by me. 
11	Building a relationship.	Me, an ENFP, recently confessed my feelings for an INFP. She says she reciprocates, yet dosnt want to put a label on what we have. How would you guys suggest I build a relationship with her, without seeming pushy and making her uncomfortable. 
8	Just let things flow, be who you are and let her be herself. Don't force anything but rather make suggestions if need be. Also realize communication, maturity and understanding is key. Be deeply sincere and honest. We can be introverted so space is needed depending on the person. If you want us to open up then show that you can also open up and be vulnerable. \n\nAll in all, have fun, create memories. Blahdy blah. \n\nThat's how I'd be in the situation but INFPs can vary a lot. Maturity is an important thing when it comes to us. If we are immature then things will most likely get very messy which id say most INFPs are. If we are mature, we understand, accept and spread our happiness. 
2	They might be worried about getting hurt. Relationships can burn out and sometimes right at the point you think it’s solid for life. Gotta know if you wanna work at this till death my dude. Shit gets boring in relationships after a while n people always leave for some more exciting fling around then. Don’t be that guy when it comes down to it. 
2	This is exactly the same situation I was in a few years ago whenever my ENFP boyfriend confessed his feelings for me (an INFP). I didn't want to put a label on it too soon as I'd only known the guy for a couple of months. If I were to give any advice I would say just try and spend time together to get to know each other, even if it's going out on dates or just chilling in each others company. I find it easier to get into a relationship with someone I have a friendship with rather than someone I see as a stranger. Your love interest probably wants to get to know you better/feel more comfortable around you before they think about putting a label on anything. 
0	Sex goth. A mix of depression, determination and desire	
7	ammmm, ok...
1	ehh I think you should reconsider.
8	Umming and ahhhing about doing further study	Ahhhhh how do you know what you want to be when you grow up? \n\nI’m 36. I’m a qualified social worker but burnt out on the job, it wasn’t so much helping people as ticking government boxes in my mind.\n\nI’m thinking about doing some postgrad study to become a clinical psychologist. But I doubt myself about it and kind of feel stuck unsure whether to apply or not. \n\nHow are some people so sure about what they want out of life, it’s forever this big question mark for me!
14	Any fellow metalheads here?	Our personality type is a seeming rarity wihtin the metal community.  I was just wondering if anyone else here is proud to throw up their horns and headbang like crazy when no one is around? Also, do you go to concerts, and if so, do you go alone or with some people you really trust? I mostly go alone and I really prefer it that way, but I've come to find that I am really comfortable at metal shows, and the people are super nice. It's controlled chaos, where you can be free to act like a maniac (in a civilized way, of course). \n\nSome bands that I'm really into: \n\nNightwish, \nArkona, \nBeyond Creation, \nSuffocation, \nBlind Guardian, \nHammerfall, \nNordheim,\nDying Fetus (eeeek, I know), \nEnsiferum, \nKorpiklanni, \nFinntroll, \nRevocation, and many many more. 
4	I love metal just as much as I love my acoustic songwriters and my jack white.  \n\nI do go to a few concerts, usually with a like minded friend.  
3	Oh yeah! I don't have the looks of a metalhead but for years this is the musical genre that makes me feel at home, although I listen to many other genres of music.\n\nFunny that you ask. I went to a concert last week and plan on going to another one next Thursday! The only thing I haven't managed is going to a concert alone though. I prefer to stand aside of the part of the audience that is moving the most, near the stage enough so I can take photos. The people I've met at concerts are generally nice.\n\nDevin Townsend and Turisas have written songs that helped me through dark times (I wish they knew!) so I suppose they are my favourite artist and band at the moment (I nearly cried when I saw Stand up and Fight played last week), and some of the things I like listening to include Haken, The Algorithm, Leprous, Ayreon, Dethklok, Pain of Salvation, Nightwish and many more.
3	If Hardcore/Beatdown counts...yes (brutal dancing included 👊)
2	Yeah man! Love metal. Part of a band myself - Far From Refuge. We just released our EP recently!\n\nI found playing on stage to be quite difficult until I found I could just enter my own world, enjoy the hell outta what i'm playing and stop caring about what the audience thinks. I love it.
1	no\nbut i love headbanging to some fire riddim dubstep ohya!
1	Hell yeah! I love metal. Also play in a metal band, Burn the Chapel. A lot of my metalhead friends would fit well in this group!
1	 I love metal, but i dislike going to shows. I've been jamming on Beyond Creation and Revocation lately too. Revocation's new album is fucking filthy. The universe is comprised of order and chaos, to me metal can be anywhere within that.   \n\n\nSome of my favorite bands,  BTBAM, Mastodon, Trivium, Metallica, Megadeth, LOG, Dethklok, The Faceless, Zenith Passage, Animals as Leaders, Opeth, powerglove.   Favorite non metal band is Paramore. \nThere are many bands/albums I like but I figured a short list would do.\n\n\nThe HAARP Machine and Native Construct have one album each but they are both excellent. Zenith Passage has just one also but an EP too, definitely albums to check out. 
1	Me and metal have had a few affairs in my time with seeing techno (dont tell techno tho)
1	Had to reply to this post. Oddly enough, despite listening to a lot of metal, I feel weird about identifying based on music preference, it's more freeing. But yeah, Mastodon, Opeth, Tesseract, Every Time I Die, and Karnivool are some good ones. I guess I always gravitated towards prog/metalcore.
33	Possibly controversial: you don’t need to wear extreme social awkwardness and oversensitivity as though they’re unavoidable	I was like that as a teenager but these things aren’t determined by your starsign or Myers-Briggs type. Being incapable of talking to others (as I see some posting) isn’t the price you pay for creativity, it’s a problem that you can address. I don’t mean to be harsh :)
12	Not harsh. I’m 31. In my teens and 20s I was plagued by social awkwardness and sensitivity. I was clingy with both my friends and significant others. \n\nThrow in a dash of being very judgmental based on my perception of the world and how things should be, I can understand why people stayed away. \n\nIt took a few wake up calls for me, but I’ve practiced being mindful of my interactions and frames of thought, and aged like fine boxed wine. \n\nThe other day, a casual friend called me “social” while we were playing a 1:1 board-game and his fiancée was fretting trying to find something. I stopped focusing on the game and almost got up to help until he called me out. I told him no one has ever called me social before. I told him I’m an introvert. He said I could be social and be an introvert. \n\nI considered that me leveling up as an adult. \n\nSorry for rant. Your post hit home with me because for a very long time I was content being what I was and saying “that’s just me”  it isn’t. \n\n
6	This is one of the things that annoys me most about MBTI.  People end up reading so much into it because sometimes the types fit so well, that they forget that they're their own person and just because they're x type and x types tend to do things a certain way that that's the only way they can function.  It can help explain some mannerisms but your type isn't who you are.
5	How can I comfort my INFP friend?	She sometimes gets very worried about her loved ones leaving her and she’ll get stuck overthinking things and feeling awful. How can I support her and help her through it?
3	This happens to me a lot; I get stuck in a cycle of overthinking everything until I convimce myself I'll be abandoned by whoever. What I think I need during these times (personally, may apply to your friend may not) is someone to listen without judgement. Many times, after I've said these fears out loud to someone, I realize just how much I've blown things out of proportion. If your friend isn't in the mood to open up atm, try taking them out to do something so they're not alone with their thoughts. Hopefully one of those helps, best of luck! You're a great friend for trying your hardest to support them 💕
1	Try your absolute goshdarn hardest to get her to open up. This will a mountain of trust placed on you and you must where it well, but that will make her feel better and she will like you a lot more
1	Abandonment issues can have a deeper origin. It happened to me a lot because I felt abandoned by people who I thought were my friends but weren't in the end. I also had a lot to do with it, and self-isolated as a means to avoid getting hurt. Your friend needs to break the cycle of overthinking and that's never easy. The hard work is on her, but if you want to help, you can ask questions about what triggered the situation, help her walk through the cycle of emotions, or remind her that that voice in her head is lying again, and it must be reminded who's boss. Sometimes questions like "what's the worst that could happen, and why?" followed by "what's the best that can happen, and why?" and "what's most likely to happen?" usually help me get grounded and leave the spinning cycle of overthinking. 
5	ESTJs	Do we like them? Do we hate them? Recently, I found out my crush of many years is an ESTJ. It explains so much, I really don’t know how to feel. What’d you guys experiences with ESTJs?\n
6	They are....potentially admirable, reliable  subordinates. Tiresome as superiors. And as peers? Either they're on top or you are. \n\nYou can learn a lot from them. Don't expect much reciprocity though.
3	A friend of mine is an estj and we don't really agree on anything. I'm really just friends with him because I don't want to have to socialize. 
3	I recently saw this video with INFP’s and their relationship with ESTJ’s. Considering we’re opposites, it’s not always the best, and every encounter I’ve had with one has been very interesting. But they’re good people, but personally not people I can relate to.
2	Yes, one of my male friends is an ESTJ. I also work with two female ESTJs. They are a bit annoying/frustrating sometimes but I admire their work ethic!
2	My cousin is an ESTJ. She's great and everything but we rarely have anything in common. 
167	A nice place.	
2	I don't particularly like tropical places, but I really like this! It feels peaceful and energetic at the same time somehow. 
1	Too crowded for me.
31	I got cognitive function laptop stickers because of my current obsession with learning about typology 😂	
2	Where did you get those chemistry ones?
2	Cute ! 
2	It looks great! Love the cuteness of it! Buuut... You have put your last two functions the wrong way around, INFP's are Fi-Ne-Si-Te,
2	Are you Venezuelan? Love from Bolivia!
1	It wouldn't surprise me if OP's mother tongue is Spanish.
1	Damn I really miss my macbook. I loved decorating it with stickers like this 
1	Damn i can relate to all your stickers (except poderosa cause I'm a dude but still 😍)
3	How do you care for your introversion in your relationship/marriage?	I'm engaged to a wonderful, talented, handsome extravert. He's great. But the introvert that I am, I often need to recharge alone, or at least in silence. I want to read, do crosswords, work on design projects, maybe just browse my phone or the internet... Without talking. I have expressed this to him many times, and he has given me space. But I can't seem to communicate that it is a daily need. He's the kind of person that talks to himself when he's working on a project. He wants to show me every video he sees, read every meme out loud, tell me when an article was so boring that he stopped reading it....\n\nHow do you communicate your need for non-social downtime in your relationship (especially with an extravert) without coming across as cold or disinterested? \n\n
3	Perhaps, you can tell him a set time of when you need that "alone time," whether it be 2 hours a certain time everyday, etc. An ISTJ I know wakes up at 6am everyday (even weekends) to workout for 1 hour and then do her own thing for the rest of the time before her extroverted husband wakes up. They are both very happy.
2	I have no clue how this looks for other relationships. My enfj wife needs a lot of time to hang out and socialise like you are saying and I require alone time which hardly happens as much as I like. But me being by myself communicates to her that I dont want to value her love language of quality time. \nI've ended up staying up late (tried waking up earlier but failed at that because I'm a night owl). \nReally It ends up being "me time" when everyone sleeps or on my car rides to/from work and I cherish those times.\nBut yes I agree communication is key 
2	I’m dating an introvert but he likes to recharge together and constantly cuddle and touch me.\nI say I love you so much I want to give my best self to you but in order to do that i need me time to be alone please don’t touch or talk to me I’ll tell you when I’m done (ugh I sound awful) \nBut he’s gotten great at it! When I’ve had a day where everyone is trying to talk to me and I feel overwhelmed I’ll let him know and I’ll come home to an asmr video and some tea and MY SPACE.\nI think w anything in a relationship effectively communicating your needs while reassuring your partner that it isn’t a negative against them- you want to figure out how you two can be best together \nAnd then once I am done recharging I try to be especially kind and affectionate 
1	Daily INFP random discussion thread - March 04	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
7	My dudes. Noise canceling headphones are the best thing ever invented for INFP's. An absolute must if you live in a crowded city surrounded by noise all the time. It's glorious. I love them so much.
3	It's actually so incredibly hard for me to go from the acquaintance phase to friend/good friend phase, especially now in school. Like wtf? How do I do it? Never feels like people are interested.
3	Will I ever feel satisfied with anything?
1	Starting off the week in the shittiest way possible! Not doing my assignments and slacking on preparing for tomorrow's presentation. I can't stop getting my problems out of my head because I can't tackle them if I forget them. I'm forgetting to turn in a lot of assignments these days. If only I wasn't so insecure about working on stuff at home! 
1	I think the worst thing is being underestimated and/or ignored because of the way we are ...\n\nIt's just the way is it and it's a bit sad how it works
7	How do you get out of a ruminating mindset?	I've noticed that whenever I start thinking about something or someone, I can keep thinking about it and all these different types of potential scenarios, good or bad. It doesn't help that lately I've been feeling down about having to cut ties with an ENFP I was seeing but still really like. However, this mindset has been absolutely dreadful for my productivity. Yesterday morning, I woke up thinking about him and stayed in bed until the early evening, which ended up in me skipping breakfast and lunch and missing a homework deadline for a class. \n\nI feel like my laziness/ruminating has caused me so many problems like this in the past. So how do I stop myself from thinking so much? How do you all motivate yourselves to get out of bed and actually get stuff done?
3	Wish i knew. Right now ruminating about a girl i've seen today but know have no future with
1	Just have to decide to make a change, really any change, and put as much of your focus as you possibly can to making that happen.  I used to think I could sit and rationalize my problems away given enough time, but I've found that really just makes me more and more miserable when I do that because it's often an impossible task. So now, I've started focusing on what I can do in the present to try to put all that aside and do what I can to make my future better.  It sorta broke me out of a pretty negative thought loop I'd been in for several months.
1	This is one of the main reasons why I'm gonna see a therapist. Hope it helps. 
1	1. Recognise current thought\n2. Choose what to do (continue, persist, expand upon, work on it, or change topic)\n3. Do what you chose, and focus on it\n\nEasy to say, but not necessarily easy in practice, unless one practises it, like building a good habit or working out one's muscles.
6	Continuing a stolen thread chain: What personality traits attract the INFPs?	
27	I'll start:\n\nHealthy, non-phony confidence\n\na sense of humor\n\nAn obsession with weird nitch hobbies (mostly, because it implies they won't judge me for my own obsession with weird nitch hobbies). \n\nGenuine uniqueness, not uniqueness for the sake of uniqueness.
10	I really like being around people who are authentic and seem comfortable in their own skin. Open-minded and easygoing with a bit of a sly/absurd/goofy humor. Kind and doesn’t take themselves too seriously. Listens as much as they talk.
13	Personally, I'm attracted to:\n\n•Sweetness/Kindness\n•Humour \n•Gentleness\n•Compassion\n•Humbleness (one of my biggest pet pieves is people w/ big egoes)\n•Someone who's protective; you don't have to be physically tough, just willing to stand up for your beliefs, friends, family, etc
7	Sense of humor, the ability to talk about interesting topics, having your own opinion without being a jerk about it, being spontaneous, confidence, appreciation of literature and/or art, standing out in some way. 
5	I tend to like people who are nurturing and understanding.
4	Kindness, usually un-intimidating people who I can approach easily, or extraverts who take me under their wing. I love talkative people because I just like to sit back and listen. (: 
3	Sincerity. People don’t have to be authentic, as long as their intentions were sincere. For example, if a friend doesn’t care about your interests but pretends they do out of genuine desire to make you happy, I really appreciate that. 
3	Curiosity about the world, love of learning\n\nSense of wonder\n\nBroad range of interests\n\nDepth of thought\n\nOpenness to new experiences\n\nEmotional vulnerability \n\nEmotional unavailability \n\nAffectionate\n\nCreative\n\nSense of humor\n\n\nAny one of those traits will cause my attention to perk up
3	Personally, I'm attracted to loyalty. If you're loyal to your beliefs and your family and friends, I'm attracted. Aside from that, I'm attracted to weirdness as I am weird myself. Probably sharing the same interests?
2	Pro-active and curious people mainly.\n\n
2	Smartass-ness, being intrigued in some way, darkness, depth, complexity, kindness, leadership, provocative. 
2	im here to be a brilliant prophetess & poetess in lace and botanical perfume.
2	he should teach me to hear mermaids singing.
2	I love ENFPs like Russell Brand, Ricky Gervais, Alan Watts etc and ENTPs such as Stephen Fry and John Cleese. I really admire witty, fun-loving, outgoing and friendly (but not in-your-face) personalities. 
858	For those struggling	
35	Lol i should save this and look at it everytime i start overthinking
30	When I was a kid the song “it’s the end of the world as we know it” (ok i can’t remember the song name, but that’s the chorus lol) came on and I said that that song was weirdly sad for how happy the music was. My mom replied by saying “the end of the world as we know it isn’t a sad thing, it just makes way for a New better world. Every time you learn something it’s the end of the world as you know it because you see the world in a new way, and every time it feels like the end of the world that’s just something to learn from. It’s always the end of the world as we know it, but that’s a good thing.” I try to remember that whenever I’m down.
17	Ughhhh.....\n\n...I think i should just print this out for myself.
8	This is very tru, so much shit can happen. Even go thru what you thought would be one of your worst nightmares n you still come out the other side n you’re still kickin ass. 
7	My meltdowns this week would try to say otherwise. But this is very true.
6	This is the only way for me to move on from things 
5	Thanks for this!
5	Ahh, procrastination, we meet again. 
5	Not easy to say with someone who has mental illnesses, but okay.
4	I had an awesome day but few words from someone are not letting me sleep. \nAhh I hate it
3	Truth don't forget.
3	A very accurate representation
3	Yup this is me. I’m acting like my world is a mess but it’s really not as bad as it seems. In facts it’s probably some normal shit most adults go through.
3	I needed to see this today! Thanks for sharing!
3	Needed this. Am currently recovering from my very first surgery and wow is this painful. Just seeing this helped me to feel a little better.
3	Oh man, I'm in a struggle atm... But can't lie, every single time I got over it, it was a lesson in disguise.
3	There’s a lot of wisdom in this
3	I should make a T-shirt out of this
3	I get the idea but if you really think everything you struggle with is the "end of the world" you need better coping mechanisms and possibly therapy.
3	Love this. Thanks 💗
3	I feel like the size of the "unpleasant" part seems kinda insulting imo. But overall I get what is being said, and I do generally agree with the idea.
3	Yoooooo I think every mistake equals death, 29 years later it never fails
1	Learned but also forgotten until the same shit happens and you relearn it.. only to forget it again 
1	More like another god dammned person that got in my way
4	INFPs, would you mind providing examples of how you think your humorous/comedic side is expressed or is perceived as?	
8	Nearly all of my jokes are based on the ridiculous. I usually make strange/random comparisons between things that create humor. E.g. I was playing a game with some friends where one said a word and we had to say another related word or sentence; so one said “Irrational Genocide” and I responded with “Peeing on an anthill” lol.
3	Dad jokes, my dude. I love wordplay- who doesn't love a good cringey pun? \n\nI will say I was told by someone that I reminded them of Spongebob. To be honest,  not a very flattering comparison, but whatchagondo? 
3	I don't know how my humor is perceived, but I can give you examples of humor I like:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhVbLJvYP8s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhVbLJvYP8s)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnVzPhnqeN0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnVzPhnqeN0)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35rVw1zskA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35rVw1zskA)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbycvPwr1Wg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbycvPwr1Wg)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFGFEgRLTk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFGFEgRLTk)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpWa2uJZb1g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpWa2uJZb1g)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK73RlSGRns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK73RlSGRns)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO10s\_HK6d0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO10s_HK6d0)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIneIwPFN78](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIneIwPFN78)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkAQLLbJbDw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkAQLLbJbDw)
3	I'm usually perceived as the guy with the weird perspective on everything. 
2	Most of the time people roll their eyes. I've developed a reputation as having my own sense of humour that not many others share. I don't think they think less of me for that, but it's difficult for them to laugh along when it's something silly I find really funny yet can't actually explain it in a humourous way 
12	I haven’t seen anything like this, so I edited a video that encapsulates how climate change makes me feel. Thought you guys could relate ❤️	
1	W E L P . . .
1	Yes. I can relate. I can’t express it in words. Your video does a good job though.

5	Tips on Emotional Control	I think this is something a lot of INFPs may struggle with, but yeah I have this bad feeling that I'm soon to be fired from my current job after having been fired from my previous job already. The reason why I was fired from my previous job was due to an issue that I had had since I was about 6 years old and that is exhibiting self control and not taking out my issues on others. I've been rude to customers before in a passive aggressive way, or run off to the bathroom to cry and that is no good for the businesses or employers and I work in the service industry.\n\nI hate emotions though. I've always dreamed of simply not having them anymore because I think to be a type with dom Fi is honestly just awful. I can't escape from feeling or emotion. I try not to cry at times, but it's as if my body makes me anyhow. When I'm in a messed up emotional state the world feels surreal and broken, and I feel like everything inside is some kind of jumbled up ugly mess and I barely feel like I can coherently speak, even my blood pressure feels like it rises...yeah, it feels hard to balance like I've lost my feeling. At my worst, I completely lose my ability to care about others. INFPs may say they're nice and considerate of others and I've been described that way too, but people that truly know me that do not see me through rose-colored lenses have told me that I can be incredibly self-centered at times.\n\nI have no interest in talking to anyone about my issues, because I've done that for years, nor do I want to see any kind of therapist or psychologist because that has also already been done. I need to be the one to change myself and my attitude. I'm posting on this subreddit because I don't know other INFPs irl. I only know of ENFPs who try to excuse this type of behavior (because they behave in this way too) and push the blame to others like they'll say,  "They shouldn't blame you for being human." meanwhile other types (a lot of people I know are thinkers or Fe users) will say, "Make different choices when you're upset, try to control your emotions. We all have to do it." I think though that INFPs struggle a lot with this type of thing and so yeah, I wanted to ask people that have Fi as their first function constantly looming over them and stressing them out how they have come to control their emotions and function properly in society. Ie, not getting fired for being rude or an emotional wreck.\n\nEDIT: Actually I do know one other INFP irl but they're male (I'm female) and they also seem to hate their job, but idk they seem to cope by doing stuff like being a furry, playing video games, buying game and furry merchandise and idk that's just not really a path I wanna go down..that type of escapism. We're also getting too old for that kind of stuff I think. I also have an ISFP friend that copes with stuff like being really into K-pop or drinking and smoking almost 24/7. I also drink and smoke, but not at work.
2	I'm not sure how to respond because the only way that I TRULY learned how to get in control of my emotions was through techniques I learned in therapy, or techniques I learned in school while studying psychology/social work. So if you say that you don't want therapy, then all I can tell you is what has helped me, but I truly believe that it might be useful for you and that the RIGHT therapist/counselor might make a world of difference if you found them and gave them an honest shot.\n\nI relate a lot to what you said and I feel like I was a lot like you. It was always the joke that I cried all the time (at "everything). "Rainbowsandkitties is so emotional". When I worked customer service I spent too many times to count locked in a bathroom crying or raging after an encounter with a customer. Sometimes I couldn't hold the crying back and I did it in front of customers, which was slightly more acceptable than raging, which I didn't do in front of people. But I would be literally shaking from adrenaline/rage when talking to people and trying to keep a cool demeanor. \n\nFirst, it honestly took some years and a lot of practice to keep those emotions in check. To be able to <feel> that first rush of anger/sadness/fear/panic/etc., in my mind acknowledge it and name it: "Ok, hi rage. I see you. I understand why you're here. And I need to focus right now instead. So I'm going to take a couple breaths and continue on with this conversation with this idiot customer" and let it go. Once you get that power it is amazing, but it takes time and practice. \n\nI would meditate before shifts that I knew would probably be high stress. There's a meditation where you imagine yourself surrounded by protective light. And for me (because I'm a dork) it basically became my "buff" or my "protective spell" that was on me for that day. So if someone came at me with a high emotion (mostly anger) it meant that I didn't have to absorb it (as empathy normally do). It's just a way to kind of visualize the thought process of again, naming the emotion that they have, and recognizing your body's natural response, but consciously telling your body: "Nah, it's good! We're protected. We don't need to take on that."\n\nI never really had a problem with passive aggressive remarks. I guess my suggestion with that would be to first try to identify them before you say them as being passive aggressive. And once you've got that, then try to stop yourself from letting the words out. So say nothing instead of something bad. Often a passive aggressive remark is in response to an angry customer's question, yes? Well, sometimes questions don't need to be answered. Sometimes it is just best to remain silent. If they follow up with a: "WELL SAY SOMETHING!" Then you can rehearse a: "I'm very sorry, <segue into whatever needs to be done to complete transaction>". \n\n"YOU GUYS ARE THE WORST EVER! WHY DO YOU SUCK SO MUCH??"\n"<you bite your tongue - no response>"\n"WELL?!?"\n"I'm very sorry, did you say that you wanted cash for your return? I could also put it back on your debit card instead"\n\nLike I said, it comes with time. You can get there. But for me therapy and 12 years of customer service did it lol 
1	Do you know why you are feeling this way? And do you know what makes you feel better?\n\nFi in itself isn’t an issue, the way I see it. Being centered around the emotional ebb and flow can be tho if you take it seriously as if it is ‘truth’. By observing it you might gain some distance and understand better what creates these ebbs and flows. \n\nYour feelings seem to control you. And that is perfectly human up to a certain point but the question is I think, how do you take that control back? The you as a whole. Because even tho emotions move through us, so does logic and combined they are a great force. \n\nYou won’t lose your ability to feel, noone can without harming themselves I think :). So it’s healthier to embrace your emotional side like a loving parent and guide this part of you through it in an observant and nurturing way.
1	I also need to work on controlling my emotions, less so for the sake of a job or for others but for myself. But when I am in a situation where my emotions could get in the way of work or relationships with other people, it sort of helps me to think of how little I am really in other people's lives and in the large scheme of things and then further I think about how little the moment I'm in really matters in the scheme of my life. I guess I just put things in perspective, I think about how little bystanders care about my emotions and how little I should care about whatever is going on. Then I go listen to angsty music.\nBut hey I probably need as much help as you do 
12	Say what you want about Fi, but it makes incredible music	So many influential and prolific musicians were probably INFPs or ISFPs. So there, Fi haters! 
6	No idea which direction to choose.	First of all, I love this sub, it's one of my favorite places on the internet.\n\nSecond, I guess I'm a weird iNFP because I do have a lot of drive and motivation, just am terrible at making decisions and sticking to them. So my dream is to be in a creative career for my job, and in the last couple years I've been trying to get there. Creativity has always been my strength and I always rank in like top 80% for artistic. \n\nSo over the last year I'd been pretty sure I'd wanted to be a fine artist, a painter. I did some portrait classes and life drawing/oil painting. But I'm not making much progress and it gives me anxiety now, despite how much work I'd be putting in. I don't get the art world at all and it feels like everyone and their mother is a painter these days. I'd lost a ton of motivation because of how my stuff STILL looked like crap, so I just stopped and wondered what else I could do.\n\nWell I'm also an exceptionally good writer, but I don't really feel in my heart that i'm meant to be an author. I love fashion and fashion design, but it's super competitive and egotistical and I don't have the funding to start anyway. I like music but can't sing to save my life, and can only partially play the piano, and also everyone and their mom has a band. I like graphic design but I guess I want to show my work in galleries rather than design pamphlets. I also have taken fading interest in acting, directing, comics, and screenwriting.\n\nI don't know which direction to go in. I feel like I should be able to be better than I am but i can't pick one thing and stick to it, out of fear there's something else BETTER for me, or that it's not what I'm REALLY passionate about. Meanwhile I have a bunch of mediocre, half-started projects.\n\n**Tldr:** I just wish I had one passion that I was sure was right for me (like most other people) and I could just do that thing. Instead I have a bunch of things that I'm so-so about, with some talent for, but fleeting interest/passion. What I most wanted (to be an artist) I suck so badly at and it doesn't even excite me, the things I'm objectively best at (writing, fashion) or that do excite me (acting, design) aren't really where I see myself. \n\nI just don't know what to do anymore.
1	I absolutely know how you feel. It seems like we have the same interests and the same issue. I've always loved drawing/painting, but I would need a lot of practice, even schooling to make a career out of it and it's not what I really want anyway. I've always wanted a career in fashion but it's so hard to break into the industry and i'm scared that if I go to college for it I'll end up either quitting or not being able to find a job. Or the billion other variables that go along with picking a career path. I guess i'm just trying to say that you aren't alone. I feel so stuck where I am in life and sometimes I just want to give up even trying to do anything, but I know that if I do i'll be more and more unhappy every day :/.
102	Another pic for you fellow infps out there.	
7	Looks very Skyrim
3	Can’t wait for spring! I’m too clumsy to hike on ice.
2	Is this skyrim?
1	A mood.
31	All I want to feel is the things I've never felt, but all I want to feel is the things I've already felt.	Damn.
4	yes
1	u.u/
1	INTP for contrast. I wish I didn't have to feel anything. ug
58	Same. Anyone else?	
2	Yep, the it BLOWS
32	Pretty sure this belongs here.	
4	Is that a car accident or a spider disco?
1	When you not quite break the fourth wall
22	Do INFP'S feel really nostalgic and/or melancholy?	Is that a common trait for infp's?
15	Yes, more frequently than I would like. 
12	Not always... I guess we just feel the melancholy of life more than others naturally would.\n\nAs James Baldwin said, “Life is tragic because the sun rises, and the sun sets.” 
8	Yep, that child Si
7	All the time.
6	Outwardly I'm pretty sunshiny and positive. I'm gregarious and approachable and I think I'm well liked among my colleagues. That said, I have a generally pretty melancholy and pessimistic view of the world. I hold little hope for the future of humankind, I'm sentimental AF but you know what? I'm having a great time! lol  I can't quite explain it. I enjoy my life despite everything. 
3	The most nostalgic person I have ever met was an INTP. She just oozed nostalgia. She especially loved showing me old films. They made her truly happy I think. \n\nThe most melancholic person I have ever met was an INFJ. He cherished his melancholy and he felt emotions on a whole different level than me I feel.  But he was an empath so that probably makes a huge difference.
3	I'm an ENFP and I feel that a lot. It's somewhat self-induced. 
2	All the time and it sucks.
2	Who doesn't?
1	Don't everybody feel that tho, sometimes? \n\nw/ that said.. I can put myself into that sentiment sometimes via music/movies.. then there's those ones where it hurts to even think/remember  once you decide to further indulge im that *feel..\n\nanyways, it really lets one know how fast time is moving..
76	To all the INFPs out there, what’s your favorite place that you look forward to visiting again? Here’s mine. ✨	
5	Redwood forest - it's really serene and the size of the trees is awe inspiring.
4	Banff, Canada. 
3	Infj but I'd love to visit that place
3	Astoria Oregon sitting on a rock by the coast
3	New Orleans. That city is a living breathing entity all on it's own.
3	Bali
3	Dreamy 💙
3	For me, Mykonos Greece 
3	Grand Teton mountains, but i'd love to visit utah for the first time.
3	Yes, mine involves a tree as well, it is special as it was there and then when I had a vision of my true nature.
3	Prague. It’s a romantic, historic, peaceful, and introverted city. 
3	One time this guy I was dating took me to a lake near where he went to school. I'm from a different area so I have no idea which lake it was (there's a lot in the area) but it was so beautiful and peaceful and you could see so many stars which is really rare for my area. Nothing ever happened between us and we're not even friends anymore so I can't even ask him to find out ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.
2	Inner workings of my mind.
2	White Sands National Monument in New Mexico. Miles and miles of perfect white gypsum hills. It was the quietest and most peaceful place I have ever been.\n\nThat, and Assisi in Italy.
19	A poem I wrote while I had to stay in a mental facility. It’s referencing all the safety measures they have there	I’m not crazy\n\nbut\n\nevery time I go to \n\nwash my hands\n\nthe sink says\n\ncrazy\n\nevery time I close the door \n\nof the bathroom \n\nit screams\n\ncrazy\n\nI look down at\n\nmy stringless pants\n\nand they scream \n\ncrazy\n\nmy mind begins \n\nto think \n\nmaybe\n\nI’m fine \n\nI’m fine is what I say\n\nAnd I am\n\nBut others tell me \n\nI’m not\n\nJust because\n\nA petal falls off \n\nA flower\n\nDoesn’t mean we\n\nThrow it all away\n\nwhy do we do this \n\nwith people\n\na flower is still \n\na flower \n\nand\n\na person is still \n\na person\n\n— labels damage \n
6	I like it
4	I really like the poem and i hope you're doing better now!
3	Your poem is honest and raw, and I find that beautiful.
2	I like it.
2	That’s so beautiful :). \n\nWherever it is that you are going, you’ll get there. 
2	“A person is still a person” Beautiful. Stay strong. 
10	Feelings	Hello my dear INFPs \n\nI have something weird to say, every year I have a certain feeling that I create and sometimes I get nostalgic about it and I miss it. For instance: I have a certain feeling for 2014 that If I remembered i’ll get very nostalgic and sometimes cry and this feeling could be triggered by a song or a smell.\n\nAny one like me ? (I’m a male INFP) 
7	I always get a strange feeling when the seasons change. Most notably spring. When I go out that first sunny day when the birds are chirping, even though I think it's nice as well, I get a pang of anxiety which I haven't yet completely figured out the source of. I think it's something to do with the signs of time passing? After the long nap of winter everything is coming back alive and moving on. \n\nTrying to say that I think I can relate. 
6	I do this all the time, usually through a song I hear. It transports me back to the exact emotion... summer songs really get to me, I remember how free I used to feel. 
4	I have this problem as well I remember back in Jr high when I use to play Team Fortress 2 for hours at a time with my friends and how much fun and simpler things were back then.\nA friend of mine at my college told me that we just look back on things as being better, that later in life I’ll look back on the things I’m doing now the same way I look back on my childhood currently. \nThat outlook makes me believe that things don’t just get worse or harder, that everything is actually ok and I should focus on the things that matter and the things that make me happy.
3	Yup, same.\n\nI'm especially vulnerable for this when I'm feeling down or not satisfied with my life. 
3	Yes 100%. I like to think of those feelings like smells where they are so strong and evoke such emotion yet are almost impossible to describe. \n\nI have a very specific feeling associated with the fall of 2013. And another completely different feeling yet one just as strong associated with a specific few years of my childhood.\n
3	Smells, songs, even the sunlight reminds me of a certain time period in my life.
3	Yes, but those nostalgia trips are never to good moments.
2	Yes I have nostalgic feelings for every year . For example .. whenever I hear Drakes So Far Gone mixtape I think about college .. or me and my friend driving with the top down and the breeze flowing through our hair . 
2	Songs and smells, yes.\n\nI don't have feelings for certain years, but I remember feelings clearly and I understand creating a feeling so that I can relive it. I tried to explain to someone once how I'm kind of addicted to the sensations of certain feelings and how I like to recreate them and experience them over and over with minute changes so that I can explore the different possible nuances. Both positive and negative. They didn't get it and tried to tell me how I could learn to get past my feelings... As if it were a bad thing.\n\nI love to make up imaginary scenarios that make me cry.
2	Nostalgia is that phantom happiness, that upon passing through you, leaves with something you didn't know you lost. Such sweetness mixed with sharp pangs of bitterness- for such an insubstantial feeling one is left with a swelling, full heart.
2	Personally, I've never broke down to tears but have been there where you sense the 'feelz' comin, decide to indulge in the 'feelz' a little til you hit that point where it becomes hard to even reminisce & you start to really feel the feelz of being overwhelmed coming.. & I stop myself right there & snap out of it!.. lol\n\n..spending my childhood in East Asia, walking round the city my mom would often visit this cosmetic chain where they sprayed this perfume in all stores to the point you can literally smell it even if you're just a passer by in a distance..\n\nFast forward a decade, now living in London; One day I was just walkin inside a shopping mall & could smell that same fragrance which immediately brought on all the 'Feelz'.. I knew it was that exact smell & went over & checked it out..\n\nI told my mom about the smell giving her a vague description  e.g. "..this perfume that used to be sprayed in that shop you used to go to", she couldn't quite put her nail onto what shop it was so I made a point to have her check it out on our next visit.. so we did & immediately upon being close enough to sense it she quickly uttered "SaSa.." which was the name of the cosmetic store.. (it was so obvious  because it used to be everywhere which I'm sure added to the fee..)\n\n\nP.s. just wanted to add, it's funny how the nostalgia is extra potent or maybe it just somewhat wears off once you know where it came from.. maybe that's why accidental nostalgias are the strongest having caught you off guard.. it's like your minds scrambling through all this extra shit in the past that you aren't even aware of whilst trying to figure..\n
1	Grimes old music makes me travel to when I lived near the beach and I could go for a walk, full headphones and weed, no humans at all.

256	Take a giant breath and enjoy the breeze! Mindfulness in a painting :)	
5	Please credit the artist ❤
1	Too cold 🥶 
1	WOW Justin I have seen your work on instagram, I think you are a great artist. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I'm asking you for your email (or other kind of contact) because I would probably need an artist for my work. I can't draw but I writte (poetry, prose) so I need an illustrator.\n\nSo please could you give me some contact.
1	♡♡♡
1	In english language word mindful is a westernized translation for sati, what it means is concentrated mind i.e. concentrated on the present moment. But concentration implies effort and control, what it should mean is the opposite, a mind that is unfocused, effortlessly present, a mind that is indiscriminate like a space in a room, mind-less rather than mind-full. But a lot of people are afraid of that word for its negative connotations, mindless means an idiot or a fool, easily taken advantage of, easily fooled. All this confusion and fear arises from a false notion that mind is inside rather than outside.

1	Needed this. Thanks!! :)
1	Fur is murder. (Great painting tho)
-1	And nothing productive got done that week.
5	Consider the birds.Consider your own soul.	
1	Souls travel across time like clouds across the sky? I read that in Cloud Atlas and the image stuck in my head. It's actually quite a beautiful statement on our interconnectedness. 
0	I don't see how this is related to INFP. 
38	I sometimes worry I give off unintentional creepy vibes	I feel I can't help it sometimes. I'm extremely quiet and I know that unsettles some people. I brood and stare into space often because I'm always thinking about something. I'll throw in random comments/questions or switch subjects with little notice (though I'm working on stopping that). Depending on who you ask, I have a 'resting bitch face' (is there a male version of that? lol) or a resting sad face. My taste in music is what many people would call 'depressing' (but it's not depressing to me). \n\nSometimes I get dirty looks or deadpan stares when I make eye contact (but the same people have no trouble talking to others). I feel that people just really don't like me for some reason. It's easy to say "who cares?", and I don't, honestly --- but I've never done any harm to anyone.  \n\nThe only explanation is that I creep people out somehow.
9	Sometimes people hate the intensity of our emotions, ya know? I feel like this so much. I think it's because I'm always in a bad mood. 
6	I can relate perfectly to what you wrote. Also male and resting bitch face. I understand that I don't make the most inviting impression on people but the *dirty looks or deadpan stares when I make eye contact* are really a nuisance to me. Like, I don't think I intimidate them in any way and I don't intend to.\n\nI feel like people often see me as a creep or a complete weirdo just from my facial expression and unemotional voice.\n\nOn the other hand, at least we still got the ENFPs, some of them seemingly love this shit.
5	Yeah I go through this on a daily basis and I hate that I'm quiet and have an extremely dry sense of humor that most people dont seem to get, but my family and friends say that stuff and everything else I am is why they love me so much! Also I was at this party last night and a whole bunch of people kept coming up to me and telling me that I was really funny and they liked how different I was from everyone else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was really just a long, very conceited (sorry) way of saying that you're probably just getting inside your head too much and people probably are trying to figure out what youre thinking/waiting for you to approach/smile first etc, just keep doin you and fuck what anyone thinks!
3	Urgh this is me 100%. I’m really not a liked person and I very rarely have been. I don’t open up to many people but those I do, love me. So I know it’s not because of who I am. It’s because of the vibes I give off. I’m also incredibly anxious socially. Sometimes I hate who I am.
2	You are not a mind reader. It is not worth wondering about or assuming. If someone says "dude you are being creepy" or you ask a trusted friend or family member "Is this creepy?" and show them what you are doing maybe you can work on it. But if you are just doing your thing and decide that others actions mean you have a problem all that you are doing is torturing yourself over your own projections. \n\nThat being said, creepiness does sometimes happen. But it is a communication problem not a personal problem. What would you like to communicate? How do people who successfully communicate it do so? 
1	I'm the same and also have a somewhat dry or even dark sense of humor. \n\nMade a dry joke to an exchange student a while ago and she said "a lot of people here joke about bad things, but you're different because you actually mean it". \n\nI tried to convince her that that's not true but she wouldn't have it. Oh well. 
1	I used to get that because I was so reserved and withdrawn. \n\nMaybe you hate the suggestion, but you could try smiling more. Just a relaxed smile. Once I learnt to do that, things got easier haha. And side effect is you’ll feel more cheerful, smiling has an uplifting effect within. \n\nAnd people may smile back. Instant happiness!
1	I relate! Sometimes we are not aware about how we are perceived by others. Even though I’m a sensitive, kind person at first I may seem cold and unfriendly. \nI’m trying to learn to come off in a more approachable way. You can try too, it takes practice. From everything to being aware of the tone of your voice, to smiling, to making eye contact, to your body language. I’ve learned that what you don’t say can be just as important as what you do say.\nCommunication is key— both verbal and non-verbal... something I’m trying immensely to learn, something I think INFP’s, who are naturally secretive and shy, may struggle with.
1	You are a fucking strange creep.\n\nBut that's exactly why I would have a few beers with you and talk the esoteric philosophical talk with you.\n\n😎 🍻
1	Happened to me many many times before. What I discovered? It was the RBF thing (resting b\*tch face syndrome). I was basically in fight or flight mode and sensors could really sense it off me. Once I smiled more walking in public (took much practice) then extrovert sensors started opening up to me and saying hi more. 
0	Pics, or you scaring off other people never happened.
1	Caught between an INFJ rock and an INFP hard place: What do you think?	  Hi everyone. This had also been posted on the INFJ subreddit but I have yet to receive any replies.\n\nA little background: I have been following MBTI for a little less than a year now and I am still uncertain of my personality type. The first time I took the test, I got INTP but felt like this was inaccurate. I have taken several tests and get caught between INTJ and INFJ. I am aware that the tests are limited by the fact that J and P can be inaccurately attributed to the result of the user based on their ability to plan and organize. An investigation of the cognitive functions and an analysis of my overall behavior relative to other J and P users (in terms of language, socionics, the types of discussions on the INTP, INTJ, INFJ, INFP forums) has led me to believe I am either INFP or INFJ. For starters, i've noticed that INFP and INTP tend to be more specific in their method of communication (correct me if i'm wrong). They tend to use their past experiences and more concrete reasoning when describing their thinking/feeling positions. The reasoning does not have to be "logical", but it is usually more grounded in experience relative to the dominant Ni users. This makes sense given that Si is shared by dominant Ti and Fi users as a sort of background function. I think I do the same thing in an effort to organize my own thoughts and/or feelings, because they do not make sense when they sit in my head. Writing my thoughts/feelings down and trying to distract myself with music, work, exercise and food keeps the demons at bay so they don't pound their fist on the cerebral door. I know I am an introverted intuitive. But I don't know what my strong functions are. I usually get Ni and Si pretty consistently on the cognitive function tests (such as through keys2cognition and idrlabs), but that is a contradiction. Ti and Te are usually in balance on both. Fe is much higher on the idrlabs measure than the keys2cognition measure, but relatively balanced in keys2cognition.\n\nIn my head, there is a war going on and its name is the "inner critic". It takes in and processes so much information and it doesn't know what to do with any of it. It's like an inefficient machine that takes in events, conversations, information and spit out useless garbage that I take to truth. And I never feel like I have enough of this information to come to a conclusion. I sometimes feel like I'm living a lie because I create my own stories from this faulty machine and I have to tell myself that it makes sense and that I should live by these "truths" because it gives me a sense of direction. The machine throws around these thoughts/feelings without me knowing until I very rarely obtain something that has any meaning. In the event I DO get something that has potential, this intangible thought or feeling gets beaten up until it's meaningless and I have to go back find something else or think more to get closer to my answer. Going out in public, taking part in conversation and observing people only makes me think about this further. I'm also an HSP, so most of the situations I find myself thinking about don't manifest in positivity. More often than not, daily life only gives me more questions that I can't seem to answer. This process occurs until I find myself back at the original question of "Who am I?". And this loop (intentional word use) is causing a lot of mental exhaustion. I probably could have learned a new language or done something more meaningful with the time I've spent pondering this. I spend months on four letters while others improve humanity every day and try to keep the world from breaking apart at the seams.\n\n\*This sounds a lot like OCD now that I am reading it over\*\n\nOn a more personal note: I am currently in a transitionary period in my life and do not know who I am or what I would do with that information if I knew who I was. I am feeling increasingly depressed because I am losing a sense of direction by looking too much into myself. My inability to come to a conclusive decision is making me feel anxious and uncertain. If I do not know my "type" or how I act among myself and others, I feel aimless and do not have something to look to; like i'm walking blindfolded in a world full of people who have managed to take theirs off and pity the people who haven't removed theirs. I feel disconnected and avoid people, justifying this behavior by telling myself things like "It's because I know too much" or "All these people are going to hurt me emotionally", "They say one thing and do another", "You can't trust them". **I understand that such an answer is not required in my life or the life of others, but I feel this information is necessary for me to unlock my potential and produce some feeling of closure/rest**. The first step (concluding my "type"), however, has served as a roadblock to being "me" (despite not knowing what that is). I feel like I could move forward without four letters or stupid enneagram numbers, but my need to know has been an itch that i'm trying to scratch.\n\nIn conclusion: I would really appreciate it if anyone with some MBTI magic can dissect this post and produce some sort of answer (whether it be INTJ, INTP, INFJ or INFP). Feel free to ask questions if you think they will yield an answer. You are all very insightful people and I am always surprised by how much you all know about typology.
4	Infp/infj look very similar on the surface, but are very different in the way things are processed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister is infj. She says that she is more aware of other people's feelings than her own, that if people with strong emotion are around her, she gets confused about whether she is feeling her own emotions or the other person's. I don't understand that at all.\n\nFor me, as Fi dom, I am acutely aware of my own feelings and use that along with my imagination to understand what other people are likely feeling. I often recognize in someone's expression a feeling that I have felt before and my own experience comes flooding back to me and I feel it all over again, so I empathize with them by understanding them through my own experience. And it doesn't have to be the exact same circumstances for me to empathize.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other big difference is Ne vs Ni.\n\nMy sister described Ni sort of like a bunch of connected nodes and if one is removed, the network re-forms in a new configuration. I'm not sure if this is also incorporating some of her tertiary ti, but even so, this is how she describes intuition in infj. Ni takes many things and works them down into a single conclusion.\n\nNe works in the other direction. It takes one thing and then combines it with other things, maybe even unrelated things to come up with possibilities, then grabs onto a possibility and creates more. It takes one thing and expands upon it. To me it feels kind of electric, exciting and branching, or going higher and higher with an idea. Maybe like pathways with many forks and choices. I don't know if I'm describing it well...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, mbti is not necessary for unlocking your potential. I think it may even hinder you. If you learn your type, might you then limit yourself to what you believe your type should be like? I am definitely infp, but in many situations, especially in a forum where I'm not so worried about personal relationships, and feel that honesty is beneficial for people, I tend to be blunt. People often think I'm a T type because of that.\n\nI often see people thinking that infp means they are supposed to be cute and warm and artsy. Maybe some are. But how do you know you don't have mathematical talent? If you think you are infp and decide you'd better try to be an artist or write songs, maybe you'll never discover other talents that broader experience would have revealed. That would be sad. Try lots of different things. See what you enjoy and what you are good at. Pursue that, and don't worry about whether it matches your type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, I understand wanting to know. It would make me crazy too if I couldn't figure it out. there are lots of articles online about the differences between infp and infj. Some are better than others. Maybe that would help. Also, I paste this link all over the place, because I love this description of the different functions depending on where they are in your stack. Let me know if it helps. [https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/12/how-each-cognitive-function-manifests-based-on-its-position-in-your-stacking/](https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/12/how-each-cognitive-function-manifests-based-on-its-position-in-your-stacking/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	I have 2 INFJ friends and they are a lot alike. They are both extremely sensitive to other people. They are both very aware of interpersonal relations. They overthink things constantly. They ask a ton of questions. Non stop. They ask questions because they are dying to know the answer to satiate their curiosity and also they want to understand and also because they want to do a good job at work. They are both artistic and they both paint abstract art. The similarities are uncanny. They are both sensitive men, which is rare for guys I think. They are sensitive to their partners needs. But being over analytical can probably be problematic. Also they both feel extremely different from everyone around them. One feels like an alien and he says that frequently.  They both are addicted to making eye contact. They are both sarcastic and they both are surprisingly friendly with strangers, cracking jokes to lighten a mood. On the surface you would think they were extraverts, but deep down they get drained from people. They have both struggled with perfectionism.\n\nFrom a media standpoint, Jennifer Lawrence's character in Mother reminds me of an INFJ so much! She cares about her personal space. She is so cautious of people in her environment. But also so full of love and care for her partner. Also, Dylan from Bates Motel reminds me of an INFJ in ways too. He has a natural instinct that feels very INFJ. Just this common sense about people and how they work. This natural intuition of who people are.\n\nAs for INFP, that is me. I love books. I love learning. I will ask questions but not a mile a minute like my INFJ friends. I prefer not making eye contact while talking and instead I have to remind myself to. I am more reserved around strangers. I care deeply about people. I believe in morals and doing the right thing. I am afraid of conflict. It can be difficult for me to make a decision, leaning one way then leaning another. I am the mediator seeing multiple perspectives. I hate telling people what they should do because ultimately I feel like they should know what is best for themselves. I am open minded. I try to see the best in people, whereas I feel like an INFJ can be more critical.\n\nAs for INFPs in the media I feel a lot like Andrew Garfield in interviews. There is a video on YouTube that compares Andrew Garfield (INFP) and Carey Mulligan (INFJ). It is a grest video. I think Steve Grand is also an INFP. He is a gay country singer. As for fictional characters, I am almost positive Ned from Pushing Daisies is an INFP. Quiet, reserved, but filled with lots of love, and strong morals.\n\nAlso INFP and INFJs have different eyes and different smiles. The INFP eyes open wider and look more innocent looking. The INFJ eyes open more narrow and look mysterious. As for the smile the INFP smile goes up and pushes up the cheeks. Whereas the INFJ smile goes to the sides and makes these lines on the side.\n\nE.g. Benedict Cumberbatch smiling in this photo: http://larkable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/benedict-smile.png. See how it spreads wide and there is a vertical indent an inch to the left and right of the corners of his smile. That is a very INFJ thing. \n\nAnd here is a photo of Andrew Garfield smiling: http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Andrew%2BGarfield%2BJustin%2BTimberlake%2BAttends%2B6Opgz7dhnOql.jpg. See how his smile spreads up and it makes a V shape on the sides where it meets his cheeks. That is very INFP.\n\nI hope that helps! But maybe I just made you more confused!
8	Suggestions for well-paying careers that INFPs will be good at?	So I'm at a loss for what I want to do with my life.\n\nI'm going to college to become a teacher, but I'm not sure if I want to do this because of problems I hear about with school administration, but more importantly I'm not sure if I can move the field forward in a positive and progressive way. I have had similar thoughts of becoming a web developer and then a copywriter, but I'm not sure what I want to do anymore.\n\nI want to make decent money in my career but I also want it to keep in line with my morals as an INFP. \n\nWhat is your career? What are some careers INFPs will excel at, that won't leave people hurting for money? Thanks in advance!
4	I currently do Medicaid enrollment at a hospital, I see people from all walks of life. They are confused and I am able to speak in a language that they understand. But I am losing that job and going to a dual opioid treatment center (Suboxone 😯 and cbt group therapy) I am terrified. Keep your options open, find a way to run your career on your own terms. Learn to say no at times or you will suffer from Compassion Fatigue. INFPs are little burst of sunshine from what people have told me about myself. Help others it will be something you are naturally good at but avoid the overhead hovering at all cost\n
2	If youre into technology you could try UXD (user experience design)
2	I'm in operations at my current job. Allows me to investigate how people work, understand how they can be better, and implement those changes to put my team and company on a better track to success.\n\nThe downside is that I am constantly approached for my opinion on anything that goes on in the office. When people saw that I tried my best to quickly resolve issues- my insight became more sought after. It's draining and I'm doing my best to set boundaries.
2	This might not be what you want to hear, but every job has its irritations and some element of administration. Even if you choose entrepreneurship or the arts you’ll have to deal with this. So if that’s the only reason you don’t want to pursue teaching, it might be worth reconsidering. Otherwise, take advantage of your college or university’s career resources. They’re used to this kind of dilemma and can help\n\nEdit: if you want to improve education, maybe consider academia, research, or politics/public policy 
1	I'm a translator. It's a decent job, I do work a lot but I love it. 
1	Indie comic book writer, non-superhero comic books.
3	alone again	hey yeah it's me, if you saw my earlier post on being alone in school, good but if you didn't, here's a summary: I don't have friends in class at the moment and I feel so out of place.\n\nThe bonding camp happened, I went but I called sick halfway through. I couldn't do it. I just absolutely dislike bonding with a bunch of people who aren't my kind of people, and now they're bonded.\n\nI met someone else who's more worth it though, so it's fine I guess? She's introverted like me, too. I really like her, but she's 28.\n\nThat's right. Bonded. Really bonded. They're family now and I'm a stranger.\n\nI feel so bad and left out, they never talked to me since day 1 and it's pissing me off. You see someone alone? Go talk to them.\n\nWell the good thing is, I'm not alone. One of my friends is alone in school too. But bad thing is, she's in a different school. I guess I have to deal with being alone for the next two years now, any tips?
2	Hey. I understand how you feel... high-school was absolutely brutal for me in the regard that I never found a clique or a set of friends to call my own. Take it one day at a time. \nI know that feeling alone may make you think that something is wrong with you, that you are damaged in some way. You’re not... you’re just more unique than anybody else, and there’s power in that.\nI will tell you that it does get better. I’m in college now and I don’t feel pressure to find a clique. In life what truly matters are the things that affect your life. All the kids who I couldn’t bond with in high-school don’t affect me now. I don’t depend on them, I have myself and I’m doing good for myself. Just know that In the end the people who come into your life and stay will be the things that are truly valuable. If you have fake friends like I did in HS and if they leave and forget about you then good riddance! There’s a story that can better illustrate this:\nA boy was sad because the girl he loved left him. A man asked him, “Why are you sad? She should be the one that is sad. She lost somebody who loved her, while you lost somebody who didn’t love you.”\nAnyway just stay strong, “This too shall pass”. I hope this makes sense lol.
5	Any other INFP metalheads here?	Enigmatically to my wife and all my family, I’ve been a huge fan of metal music since high school. It started out with hearing All That Remains on Guitar Hero II and expanded from there. To this day, I have no tattoos or piercings and only where the occasional black tee, so no one automatically assumes I’m into screamo and most are surprised upon the discovery. Though, I’ve always been prone to acquired tastes (e.g. coffee and dark beer). \n\nI prefer melodic metalcore. The relationship between the rough and clean vocals is like a winter storm to the warm hearth waiting inside. It’s the perfect marriage of raw emotion and swift intellect; rage against it all and reason through the issue. \n\nMy favorites are Demon Hunter, Wage War, August Burns Red, and Wolves at the Gate. My recent metal playlists have had Born of Osiris, Veil of Maya, In Hearts Wake, Sleeping Giant, I Am Noah, Phinehas, For All Eternity, Fit For A King, The Healing, I The Breather, Erra, Bring Me The Horizon, and blessthefall. 
2	Demon Hunter is my favorite metal band of all time! Their new album is awesome. Been a metalhead sense middle school myself.
2	Me! Everyone is always extremely surprised if they find out. I certainly don’t listen exclusively to heavy stuff, but I am a big fan. \nSilent Planet and The Ongoing Concept are my top two, but I greatly appreciate Phinehas, Gideon, La Dispute, and Northlane too.
2	I ended up with a full black closet and a couple of tattoos. Giving it some variety now that i have a need to stop dressing like a teen. People actually get surprised when they see my singing some country or pop stuff. \n\nWhat you said about the vocal dynamics, one non-screamo band i often see this happening is mastodon. The band has a big variety of styles across ot's albums, if i had to pick a favourite album it would be the hunter.\n\nAs for melodies that just flood my heart into emotional nirvana, i am stuck into stoner metal. I go for hour long-trips with samsara blues experiment, somali yatch club or mars red sky.\n\n
2	Hell yeah! 🤘 I'm really into hardcore. The more chaos the better. Check out Jesus Piece, Vein, Sanction, Sectioned, Vatican... absolutely love all of those bands. 
1	I find I'm sorta all over the MBTI spectrum, I used to always type as an INTP, now it's consistently INFP but the N has been drifting towards S and is like 52/48 N right now, so I wouldn't be surprised if it places me as ISFP at some point in the future.  But yes.  I'm into it at all levels.  My favorite band currently is Gojira, but I can pretty much get into almost anything,  heavier the better.  Really enjoy the work of the dudes behind both Infant Annihilator and Black Tongue.  Complete opposites style wise, other than both fall on the extreme end of heavy.
1	Bmth, but the "older" stuff (yes I am one of those fans) 
201	I'm proud of all of you.	
9	Depression is exhausting but I cant stop discovering, and wandering, making me feel grateful for my existence.
2	Thanks, I sure did need this!
1	I’m not sure if this still applies since I tend to write about some of my worst and best moments and publicizing change. Sure, I’m not open about many things, but I’m still open.\n\nI’m into being held accountable by the public/strangers. Is that not a good idea?

2	Daily INFP random discussion thread - March 03	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
3	Developed a very inappropriate crush on a coworker who invited me to hang out at her house. It's inappropriate because she's in a happy relationship and clearly has no reciprocal feelings. But she's the first person in a long time who is of the opposite sex and (seemingly) enjoys hanging out with me solo. Just gotta ride it out I guess. I hope this doesn't make work awkward.
3	Any INFP wanting to see a soul being literally crushed should watch the Peter O'Toole classic "Lawrence of Arabia."\n\nWarning: Your soul might be crushed as well.\n
3	Hey. You guys genuinely make me happy. You keep a lot of wisdom inside you, and from an Ni Fe perspective, I truly respect the complexity of your feelings. Your form of creativity is probably my favorite. It's sincere, genuine, and real. I know how society can make life difficult to navigate for you at times, but do know that another small group of people deeply appreciate who you are and how you's be. Stay comfy.\n\nLove, \n-an INFJ
1	I am best!\n\n&#x200B;
1	Just discovered one of my best friends at university was an abuser in high school from a mutual friend who is no longer friends with her. Absolutely devastated and confused about how to move forward with her and our friendship ....:( \nI still want to see the best in her and think she’s changed — classic infp
3	Weird fears	So i have this weird fear that gravity will reverse and ill float into space. I got pretty scared one night while walking home and couldnt enjoy the starry night because i could feel my mind and body drifting a little. Its called casadastraphobia. \n\nObviously it wont happen but i always scare myself thinking about that "what if?" Lol.\n\nDo you have any weird fears?
1	That the floor will fall out, and I usually feel it to an extent. 
1	I have a severe phobia of worms that makes getting around during the rainy season more difficult than it should be. 
7	Thank you stranger.	So I was invited by a coworker to a banquet to celebrate her husband being cancer free. It's in a vfw and I walked in gave her a big hug and him also along with a firm handshake while maintaining eye contact and congratulating him. There is food for everyone and I got a plate and picked a table on the other side of the bar with all the regulars.\n\nI only know her and her husband even though I've met her daughter's in passing. But they are all sitting with their families. Feel like I'm intruding so I sat over here.\n\nA sweet bartender saw me sitting alone and asked if I needed anything I politely said a coke and she gave me one no charge.. very nice of her. A person from the party happened to wander towards my end of the bar and before I could answer the bartender from earlier said he is being polite and sitting over here. That made my heart soar seeing that someone who I met it passing got me.\n\nSorry this was long and maybe too descriptive I just needed to write this.
77	Upon seeing this I kinda assumed it was posted here in r/infp. Surprised it wasn’t. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯	
6	That is why I limit reddit usage. It's not all that great and *usually* a waste of time. Still good posts every now and then but most of them- you already got that covered. But to be fair if you weren't feeling so great it can be helpful? Just don't want to encourage it.
3	Favourite INFP actors/actresses?	I know we must have this thread all the time. Anyways, mine is probably Hugh Laurie, not least because of House as well as his stuff with Stephen Fry etc. but also I think that Andrew Garfield is the cutest boy alive.

12	Are your workspaces usually disorganized?	I just came back home from college for this weekend to study for my exams next week. Before I moved into college, my sister (INFP) and I (INTJ) shared a workspace.\n\nNow that I’ve come back, my entire work area has been colonized by her books and study materials. I asked her to move her stuff while I temporarily worked in the living room. She said she would but when I went and checked again, everything was the same. Last time this happened, I cleaned the area myself and she got upset, saying that “everything was in a specific place” and now she doesn’t know where her stuff is. Sigh.\n\nI was wondering if most of you guys are similar, and how I can compromise with her on this.\n\n\nTLDR: My INFP sister makes our study space very disorganized but when I (INTJ) try to clean everything she gets upset that I put her stuff in the “wrong place.” Is this relatable for you guys?
9	The time thing is a point to focus on, you might have expected her to do it within the next 30 minutes, whereas she might've filed it away as something to try to remember to do tomorrow afternoon. If she's like me any sense of urgency you're feeling will very possibly be completely ignored unless you explain why (and make it compelling). As for my workspace? It often looks... overburdened and underorganized, but yes I know where everything is and it would take hours if not a full day to recover if someone moved it. If someone did, without a need and without a right to do it, it would be an act of violence. Here, you certainly might have a right, just maybe see what she thinks about that before you do anything.
4	My everything is disorganized.
2	I've been disorganized my whole life, but I have an amazing episodic memory so I very rarely lose things. In fact, the only time I ever lose objects is when I clean up and mess up my "system", and my episodic memory becomes useless when I don't remember a specific, meaningful timeline of events leading up to the placement of that object. It's very strange, but it works for me. About compromise; I'm really not sure. Growing up, my brother was the exact opposite of me, but we had separate rooms so we could live in our own worlds. Maybe try and make a separate study place for her where she can make her perfect mess and you're not upset by the disorderliness. 
2	*Looks at his workplace* Uuh yeah same...
2	I think a lot of INFPs are like this, but not all of them.\n\nMy room/desk reflect my mental/emotional state, so when I have my own room it's spotless and extremely organized (which is my current situation), but when I have to share a space I can never seem to keep my side organized :P\n\nI think sharing a workspace with your sister would be nearly impossible if the mess gets in your way....
224	Where the INFPs at?	
25	Hey, I do not appreciate being attacked like this 
19	Uhhhh...wishing that you would take interest in me, all while hoping that you don't actually strike up a conversation because there is a chance that you could talk about some shit that I'm not into. That way, I don't have to pretend to care about what you say, just so that I don't feel like an ass wasting my time and yours investing energy into something that I know will result in nothing, just because I don't want to hurt your feelings. In truth, I'd much rather be at home reading a book, playing games, listening to music, writing, or watching a series on Netflix. \n\nWhere are you? :P

12	What were your experiences with teachers and university professors?	In grade school, teachers got on my case for daydreaming, not paying attention, not doing the assignments exactly how they wanted (even if it was right), and not participating (I'm not condoning daydreaming in class, if that's what you're thinking, I'm just saying it like it is). Teachers even complained to my parents that I was 'too quiet'.\n\nIn college, professors thought I didn't care and gave me a hard time for not participating enough and not asking questions (this was in the second and third year advanced but smaller classes, where participation and discussion was a larger part of the grade). In fact, when I approached a professor in his office to volunteer in his lab, and he almost fell off his chair. I never asked why he reacted that way, but I'm sure it was because I always gave off a bored, apathetic vibe. I rarely participated in class discussions because of my social anxiety. I have this idea that every single word I say is going to be taken apart and mocked. I feel I have to rehearse everything I say.
3	I was generally quiet as well and had to force myself to speak up in class. Twice a class was my goal. That felt like a lot to me. Even in small classes.\n\nThings were better in grad school. Profs take more initiative to have one on ones with students imo. Helpful for me.
2	any sensor teacher i disliked, especially sj types\n\nive liked all of my intuitive teachers except for intj and enfj\n\nalso doesnt help that even the advanced classes have around 40 students packed into the room\n\ni daydream, doodle, compose music, and generally remain not in the present during classes, although you can be damn sure i already know the material. most teachers just do not recognize that it is possible for a smart person to not be engaged.\n\ni rehearse everything i say for the same reason, but also to make sure that (rather than getting across, it also has a cutting edge to it that asserts my dominance over those who provoke me enough to even say anything in the first place).\n\ni also hate it that whenever i do something smart, the whole class just starts clapping. like fuck off, im just smarter than you, if you really cared, you would learn on your own time too.\n\ni usually only speak up if anything stupid/illogical/immoral happens, in which case i dont stop until it stops (leading one specific estj math teacher to almost give me a multitude of detentions, but my intellect saved me from those as well, as i had learned by that time to play with others' emotions and sides of an argument, although i rarely use it because it is a very dangerous and unforgiving tool).
1	I didn’t try to the pay attention to most of my classes, i’m more of the type who likes to read the notes and put them in practice.\n\nThat being said, professors for me really didn’t have a shit as long as you didn’t disturbed their classes. So since I’m the quiet type, i spend all my semester almost invisible to them, although some rare starting to recognizes due to my good grades 
1	I had good relationships with most of my elementary, middle, and high school teachers because I did well academically with that kind of structure to keep me motivated and they tend to like and automatically know the students that perform well. Now that I’m in university among thousands of students, I have a nonexistent relationship with most of my professors. I don’t talk with them unless I have a reason for it, so I’m not the type to introduce myself or ask questions. If I need help I’ll consult the internet, friends, maybe just maybe the TA, before the professor. I haven’t ever gotten that far yet. Although a few professors know me from classes I did well in, its on their initiative, not mine 
1	I understand this completely. I do research now and I’m quite good at it because I’m capable of sitting in silence and focusing on my work for hours but I never thought of asking any of my professors to get involved in their research in college because I was so scared of rejection. I also worried my grades weren’t good enough. Good grades don’t necessarily translate to being good at research though. I tend to only do well in things I care about and neglect others.\nI don’t really have any advice other than to say that I relate to you and sometimes I get sad thinking about our education system. I was such a dreamy child and I would get yelled at for not paying attention I wish the world would adapt to understand introverts better 
52	Understand me.	
8	Am I the only one who thinks this sounds really pretentious? 
2	as in sj's\n\nthis isnt only an infp problem, its pretty much every inxx type (except intj)
17	Im a deeply damaged infp, I dont relate to most of you, atleast not yet	I was violently raped at age 5 and repressed that shit untill I was 19, im 21 now, im a guy and I still dont truley know myself. I fight numbness and I still struggle with feeling emotions, I got some dark shit inside of me that im too afraid to face. My introspection mixed with my trauma has shown me the darkness of the human soul, I have evil inside of me. Currently I cant love, I can only hate, I want to love, I want to care but loving and caring means I have to make myself whole again and to make myself whole would be to face the pain and I cant do that yet. I hope to use this truama to make some cool dark art, I work on my art 6-8 hours a day and hope to be a dark artist, I feel as an infp who has seen the depths of hell it would be meaningful for me to turn my darkness into art so others can see hell
5	You more than likely suffer from complex post-traumatic stress, among other things and it can be incredibly hard to change those patterns, it can take some time. You can go hang by r/c-ptsd if you haven't already and find some resources and support, it can be a start in learning more about your condition, and deconstructing it. I don't know if we ever truly heal completely from such things because we never got to experience normal development and unfoldment that is suppose to happen, but you can be transformed into something transformative, a force of healing. Please share your art with us.  <3
2	Therapy is a good idea. Making your art is healthy too, but therapy can teach you other healthy ways to cope with your issues. I am very sorry for what happened to you. It's not right, it's not fair, but it happened all the same. It's forever a part of your story, and you have to make the choice to either let it destroy you or use it to help others. I do think you need to get some help for yourself before you can fully help others, but you can get there :) 
2	There's a therapeutic treatment called EMDR that is very useful for processing trauma. When you can afford it, it may be a useful treatment for you. I want only the best for you. Be well.
2	Awareness is the first step and you’re aware. Now, take the steps needed to love yourself, commit to it, be it therapy, going on me-dates, meditation, exercising etc. That’s your priority. Everything else is bonus point. I wish you all the love in the world bud.

2	 = Me, you and other people who can help.\nI've lived my life this way. A lot of it (the depression) may be exacerbated by mistreatment and neglect when I was younger. But I can't break the constant loops, being overtaken by counterproductive thoughts, not being able to focus on healthy thoughts, feeling hopeless and like nothing I do matters. You're not alone.
2	I have the trifecta...since around 13 years old (so 30+ years of this). So far, it’s been a complete roller coaster of debilitating depressive lows and failure and great highs of academic success. I guess I appreciate joy, connection and beauty more than most, but I also feel crushed by the dailiness of life.

2	Enneagram Test Results	I was bored looking through some post on this forum and saw the enneagram test so i decided to take it. My test score is a 9 but it said taking into account i am a 9w8. I just wanted to know if anyone got similar or any different. btw 9 is a peacemaker and I think it fits me!
2	Tested as a helper w achiever which I think is accurate. I love to help people and really get off when I see that light bulb click on. As far as I achieving, I do like to get things done, right now I’m in grad school so being successful in that is important, although I’m furthering my education to have more freedom in my career, not necessarily to have more ‘success’.  When I decide to do something it’s all or nothing and I can be a bit of a perfectionist in the pursuit. 
1	Which test did you take? Do you still have the link? 
1	I just took that test and it said it didn't know whether I'm a 6 or a 9, but I'm probably a 6w5...where do you go to learn about the wings? I could never quite figure it out...
1	I’m a 4w5 in a relationship with a 9w8 
0	Wait, what?!	im watching some curriculum health videos for 9th grade phys ed and the person reading the script says that there is a stereotype for guys to like sports and girls to be more emotionally sensitive.\n\nim wondering where the stereotype that guys were more Se strong and girls more Fi strong came from and what your opinions on this stereotype are, because it seems like a big load of bs to me
2	it is BS. it’s just a product of traditional gender norms that men should be stoic and aggressive and women should be timid submissive. 
1	Probably comes from more men being T and more women being F .
4	I'm participating in a danceathon for CMN today!	This is happening today. I'm dancing at the WVU rec center. Please donate to help the kids.\nhttps://events.dancemarathon.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&participantID=569272&referrer=boundlessfundraising\n

8	Combatting Loneliness	I've been lonely for almost as long as I can remember but these past few months I've been brutally lonely. Every few days I seem to have another mental breakdown or a sudden burst of extreme sadness. It just feels like I'm not getting enough from my friendships and that they don't actually care about me or they just accept me only because I tried to talk to them. Is there anyway to fight this? You guys might be the few who understand what I'm talking about, I'm really struggling and need help. Thanks 
4	What is weird about loneliness is it can happen even while surrounded by friends. There are some great videos on The School of Life, which you can find on YouTube, that talks about loneliness. They also tackle other emotions too. I recommend those videos for everyone because we participate in schools to learn about science and history and language, etc., but not for life.\n\nAlso what helps me is grounding, meditation, and visualization (which is a type of meditation). Visualization comes naturally to me, I am not sure if it is because I am an INFP. But I picture a fire inside my chest. And that fire is what feeds me the energy and strength and courage to do what I must do and stand up for what is right.\n\nGood luck!
1	Hey i am going through this too. I mean i have my family around me and a few (3) guy friends i talk to online sometimes so yeah my meeting friends up for an outing life is pretty non existent. \n\nBut tbh i cant relate to feeling lonely at all. My life and the way it has turned out rn is pretty intentional and i am fine with it because i know it’s a phase and i know it will pass soon. Until then i am just really doing things i enjoy by myself. Reading, watching nature documentaries, playing video games and just being fun and light hearted around my family. \n\nI think once you realise that this is a phase that will pass you will make the most of it as long as you are also actively trying to also get out of your comfort zone. May i ask you, what is your age? And are you studying or working or both?
1	When I make a friend on the internet that I can talk almost everyday I just stop wanting to have other friends, because it feels  too much of a burden to me.\n\nI know that this is bad because I'm relying on one person and if something happens I will be alone again for who knows how much long(I really don't like meeting people to even on the internet and i'm picky about those things) but I don't want to try to have more than one of these close friendships at the same time.
1	INTP here. Sorry to butt in. I have a grown INFP daughter. We have the best time together when she is feeling up to it. TBH, I'm shit with friendships, but I'm thinking deeply about what you said. "Not getting enough from the friendships" \n\nI think you've got something there. \n\nI recently discovered I was not getting enough from my alone time. My gf got me a subscription to Games World of Puzzles, and it's helped me be happier. I get a lot of enjoyment out of the puzzles, and my alone time is very refreshing now.\n\nSo maybe ya, your friendships aren't  cutting it somehow. I think it's a solid theory. \n\nHave you tried the enneagram? It helped me loads. I am less lonely now. Took work. Still needs work, but doing better. I understand my needs better. \n\nhttps://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test
1	Yeah. Try to learn how enjoy your own company, doing things alone, be aware of the enjoyable time that you've spend in a company of people that you've connected with, be grateful for it.
1	i felt the same way towards my friends, and when i tried to talk to them, a bunch of stuff happened, and they basically told me to fuck off. lost my two closest friends and now i'm lonely as fuck.
1	Why Is Game Of Thrones Called A "Song?" (A Song of Ice and Fire is the book series name of GoT)	
2	Now Game of Thrones can be enjoyed by anyone, but I think this 5 minute video is a great "ode" to INFPs your desires and your struggles, your dreams and your idealism.\n\nSo I posted this video here.  A short 5 minute video that makes its point and then has no more to say.  I shared for I hope this video makes you wonderful INFPs smile, or feel something in your hearts.\n\n(Oh yeah George RR Martin is an INFP)
3	Just found out i've been mistyped INFP, and actually an INFJ.	Similarities all across the board between the two personality types led me to settle and half heartedly convince myself that I was an INFP since that's what the MBTI test results said, although I couldn't differentiate their functions and clearly see which I one I was using. Te and Se inferior seemed all too similar in terms of what their insecure to.After watching a really well made video that explored the dichotomy between the two types I can say for certain that i'm an INFJ. Throughout the video I could relate to every differentiation on both the personality types that were supposedly said to be exclusive to one of the types, but when the video said that INFJs hold people in their lives as totems for memories I knew I was an INFJ. Many times i've abandoned relationships, and avoided people due to the fact that they held memories of a time in my life that was unpleasant. My association with them buried the dissatisfactory memories that were created during that time. Oh well, I guess i'm an INFJ.
3	INFJs and INFPs appear similar on the surface but are wildly different, if you research cognitive functions it's easy to discern between the two, also most ISFJs mistype themselves as INFJs too 
1	Can you link the video?

22	Curious. Do we agree INFPs are intensely creative, artistic or visual in one form or another?	Not in a boastful way, in a general way of viewing the world and what you like to do or think about. I would add that this is regardless of if you are “good” at creating or not.\n\nI have not met an INFP outside of the “creative type.” Just curious.
9	I think so. I have heard (source forgotten) that many YouTube celebrities fall under this type. They seem extroverted and happy when they’re allowed to express themselves in their videos but quiet and more withdrawn in person.
2	Not all INFPs create art. But, I think it's common because Fi encourages the kind of internal contact that provides inspiration, and Si gives the ability to match present things with past experiences: ex, to draw an imaginary face based on multiple real-life faces that I've seen in the past.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(I can see Ne and Te helping too, but Fi and Si would be the big ones.)
1	In one way or another yes. I’m trash at drawing, but I was the best improvisation player in my jazz band. I think when we find a way to express ourselves, we just naturally become good at it. I also really appreciate watching other people do just that, I love watching people draw or graffiti or  write poems or music. 
27	Some space/cover and light/dark balance for you.	
2	Do cloudless skies freak anyone else out? 
160	Why is everone here so god damn good at drawing?	Seriously I see so many talented artists putting their work on here like it's nothing. "I was bored so I drew this" and it's like... one of the most amazing things I've ever seen?\n\nAlso fuck you guys for being good at drawing. I want to be good too but I can't maintain the habit of actually doing it for longer than two days lol. (Take no offense, I think it's great that you're great and I'm happy for you (but also jealous as all hell)).
75	Uh, lots of us suck at drawing, which is why we don't post our drawings. Only people that don't suck at it post.
9	I'm sure there are things that you're suowr good at too though! \n\nI suck total ass at drawing, but I would like to think that I'm an okay writer, and an okay photographer too. Everyone has art in them, wd just express it in different ways. 
7	I post my shitty art anyways 😂. I’m not good at all, but hey I’m proud that I at least try.
6	Probably not all are good artists, but creativity in one form or another is a common INFP trait. 
4	[Here's my art I hope you like it](https://imgur.com/a/b5TItfm) 
3	THANK YOU! It's a rant that has been lurking at the bottom of my soul.\n\nAlthough this would be much better if it was a comic coming from blobby stick figures.
3	There is an old book (which the author bases on their one-week workshop) that claims it can teach people how to draw more of what they see (as opposed to drawing based on impressions, cartoons, symbols, representations, etc) within a week or so. It shows before/after self-portraits from participants on the actual workshop, and it's completely mind-blowing how much improvement there is. I only did the first exercise many years ago, doing the self-portrait, and I thought mine was actually pretty good while in general I can't draw at all in general beyond a stick figure type level. The main reason I didn't proceed with the book was because it meant I had to buy these weird art supplies I had never heard of and I wasn't sure I could buy them here (very few art stores). I was a kid back then with no money but the same excuse isn't really valid anymore 🤔.
3	Art isn't subject to just drawing, art and beauty comes in many forms. It takes deep understanding of emotion to produce amazing art, and us INFP are both great at seeing and understanding beauty and also creating it from our introverted feeling. 
2	Not everyone. I do abstract stuff cause I can't draw at all. 
2	I’m not LOL I’m one of the most un-artistic people I know! 
2	It's all practice, you dont even have to draw something every day, or even every week. If you create something even just once a month you will gradually improve. As an infp you might find it comes quite naturally to you :) 
1	It's where you spend your time, being the day dreamer sometimes I will just spend all my time thinking about drawing, how to make something work out.. practice practice practice
1	I heard once it takes about a week to form a habit. I kept a habit of drawing everyday for 2 years, but I could have been more productive with it. Anyway, the simple answer is practice. A more complex answer is drawing similar things over and over again until you get it. I can draw decently most of the time, but I pretty much have never practiced with colors so I'm terrible at doing most things beyond than line work. Jealousy and discouragement is bound to exist, so just choose to move past it. 
1	I know! I’m not good at drawing but i do cool makeup does that count for something haha 
1	My problem, for fucking *years*, is that I can't decide on my artistic medium.  Everytime I sit down to draw I'm like "this could be a waste of time if I never draw again" same with a bunch of other stuff.  I want to get into painting, my artistic lack of skills be damned, but the inks are fricken expensive.  I am infp and I am very artistic and creative - in my head - it's just that I've been unable to express it for my entire life out of frustration of not being able to express it.  It's a fucking catch 22.  
1	I'm bad at drawing but I can be really good at some other things
1	I suggest you purchase the book Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt will teach you how to draw. 
1	Lol I can’t draw for shit. I write music instead
1	Just let it go and do what your heart desires. You can do it 💙
1	Check marco bucci on youtube. Its really just workabd commitment
1	I started drawing from a very early age, I stopped drawing a few years ago but I want to come back. I dont' know how bad would be if I tried now though lol
1	I'm sure you're creative in other ways.  I don't post drawing either.  That's not my thing.  I dance.  What's your jam?  We all have one?  Drawing is something more postable, that's just why it's seen here more.  
1	They practice. I am lazy so I dont, but I love a good painting. 
0	Practice.

1	This is just gorgeous. I love her expression and the hair. The warmth of the colors is breathtaking
6	What in your opinion are the strengths on an INFP?	Just curious. Do you guys know thyself from the inside out because of strong Fi? What other stereotypical strengths are true or just true to a certain extent?
10	Compassion. Morality. Creativity. Independence.
6	Creativity, understanding, sensitivity, compassion.
5	Perspective.
3	Sincerity, integrity, and individuality.
2	Empathy, self understanding, wisdom 
2	I’ve been told by many people that they appreciate my authenticity as a person. 
1	Perception and empathy
2	Any Volunteers for an Obscure Memory Post	Thinking of the Pixar movie INSIDE OUT...\n\nI'm going to compose a blog post about memories. Memories that are obscure, but they have made an impact on you in some way over the course of your lifetime. They make you wonder why or how because it's a memory that plays in your head randomly from time to time. \n\nI wanted to have some volunteers ( no names will be used only your quotes) to share a memory and what they may have learned about themself from said memory.  Once written, I will share the post on here for everyone to read.\n\nTo give an example: (true story) in grade school we had to color in cornucopia for thanksgiving. Every one colored theirs natural colors, I colored mine blue green. I was the only one. Over the years, it showed my nonconformity to certain rules. \n\n\n\n
2	I have a memory of being in the forest around age 5 or 6. I was there with my mother. I remember just standing there looking at the trees, with this intensely happy feeling as if all that beauty outside spoke to me and rested within me. As if all the trees whispered to me and I could hear them. As if the grass and moss and the sky resonated in my being. \n\nIt’s a very silent feeling when I think of it, but also very powerful. No seperation, one with what I saw. I still have this feeling regularly but that specific memory is filled with this enormous sense of wonder. It’s magical to me.
14	Older INFPs, what are you up to now and has life gotten easier?	I feel that life is too hard as an INFP and I always have an existential crisis about why I must be here...
12	I'm way too old to be on reddit, sorry! It's just so interesting seeing what you guys are up to- our generation was incredibly boring.\n\nHaving said that and twice the age of most posters, it does indeed get easier. Look, I had no clue why I was so different but kept it to myself. it took awhile to figure out no one else has a clue either, they just have different ways of expressing themselves, coping and interacting with the world. Most are doing the best they can, same as you.\n\nYes, it got tons  better. It's not a bad idea, just dealing with what you can and handing the rest over to something bigger. I'm not familiar with the Mormon faith but have a feeling the same entity has different ways of reaching us- if that's what found you, much Peace to you.
7	34, successful functioning adult here. With all of lifes experiences and lessons, life gets easier. 
3	I will be 30 at the end of the summer, which will be 2 months after I get married, which is 1 month after I graduate from college.\n\nMy life has not been anything I thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, I don't regret it, becuase I have definitely learned a lot. And alot about myself. And understanding my ish as an INFP has been a big part of that.\n\nThings I've learned....  The Existential crisis will never stop completely. But I have learned to recognize the spinning feeling, and slow it down. And to not over compensate for my dispair at imperfection. (oh FYI, I'm also OCD, so sometimes I'm not sure where my actual personality stops and my disorder takes over, but I'm actively working on understanding that, too.)\n\nI almost always feel like the odd one out, in any room (except when my moms around; I thought it was just bc she's my mom, but turns out she's an INFP too...) For so long I fought against that outsider feeling, trying to get in. I questioned why I saw things so differently, felt things so deeply, why others couldn't understand my point of view. But now I accept that quality as a strength. Especially as a (budding) graphic designer, I have found that in collaborative work, I always bring something valuable and unique to the table. Unfortunately, I am still managing my intense frustration that always mounts everytime I work in groups.\n\nI've been in college, to some extent (full-time, part-time, online, etc) for 12 years. And I'm finally almost done. I think my struggle was always that I gave 110% to everything, because my passion would take over. I burnt out hard, over and over again. I kept exceptionally good grades, but would drop out of school because I couldn't maintain that energy, or manage the emotions that come with fully investing in EVERYTHING.\n\nBut, here I am. Finishing college, with an amazing fiancé who appreciated my eccentricities and is patient when I don't want to leave the house for days, or just the same when I suddenly think of some huge project that we must start now! Luckily he's an ENFJ who actually finished the things he starts and can make decisions when I'm woefully indecisive.\n\nBest of luck to you, and just keep checking in with yourself. Nurture the introvert with resetting and alone time, schedule social interactions to maintain relationships. Know that most people don't understand how you're feeling, and have patience with those that take things for face value!
3	I don't know if 22 is considered "older" but I'm more comfortable with who I am now and social situations no longer freak me out. I also have a longing for new experiences. There is the occasional existential crisis, but only when I'm going through rough times.\n\nI wouldn't say life is overall easier, but that's just due to personal situations.
4	Hey I don’t know how old you are, I’m 22 so there is still a lot left for me to learn! I have struggled with this same crisis off and on but I found that for me the thing that helped the most was religion and getting out there and having as many experiences as possible. \n\nGetting out there is soooo hard, but it’s worth it because its giving me confidence, I learn, I grown I develop new talents and I meet people who I love. The more I have different experiences the better my life becomes. I highly success researching about a vision board and making one of your own. Having those goals, and seeing them come true is very motivational and you don’t even care about the other crap because you realize you can make your life what you want it to be! \n\nBut my number one foundation for having hope is through God. It does not matter what religion, but this foundational belief will hold you through give home and peace. My religion has given me a foundation for who I am, I am a child if God. He knows me. He loves me, and he has a plan for me. If he is watching over me and protecting me then I know everything is going to be ok. That has given me hope and in those moments where I feel unloved, alone, worthless etc that has been my foundation and I can look forward knowing there will be a brighter tomorrow. If you are looking for a good place to build your relationship with God I suggest The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints \n\nI hope this helps! Life is hard. It has ups and downs, but know it comes back again and you will look back and be amazed with all the good in your life. I promise :) \n\n
1	Well I don't do manual labor for work anymore and come home in pain most nights, and am not in a relationship I constantly feel weird and non committal about. 
1	27 here, yes. I was just thinking recently how in my teens I thought there was no way I could be a functioning adult and I’d surely end up living in a mental hospital. I have a career, a relationship with a partner that understands me., And i focus less on my existential dread by feeling like I am benefiting society in some way. Things always have the potential to improve. I found things that I was very passionate about (helping children, understanding the world, striving towards curing disease) and worked to find a way I could do those things that my personality matched (for example I could never be a nurse I get overwhelmed interacting with people and I hate sticking to others schedules) so I became a research scientist and volunteer in my free time to visit children with the disease I research (working directly over volunteering also felt too social for me/committing to quiet time in a lab is easy for me) \nOnce I found a field I enjoyed I started meeting more people I related to and I made good friends. \nThis was all post college for me honestly up to about 22 I never thought things in my life would be ok so if anyone feels that way I hope you are able to change things \nSometimes I’m still like what’s the point one day I’ll die but I also see a therapist for when those thoughts are too much 
7	TWO INFP MEN DATING	TWO INFP MEN DATING: Match made in Heaven or ticket to Hell?
6	I was in an M/M INFP/INFP relationship. We got along great! We were really comfortable around each other. We enjoyed our time spent together and we enjoyed our apart time too. He was also really open minded sexually which was nice. He was funny, charming, easy going. Sometimes he would be stubborn or be frustrated over seemingly little things, but I probably was the same way. The only thing that ended it though was he was not ambitious enough for me. I wanted to move to California and he did too, but he did not want to make the leap. I hated where we lived so I had to end it... :(
1	Each of your ideals may be different and you both may not want to take a leap so... nothing happens until one makes a decision and makes an action happen :) from another guy infp dating another guy infp...
14	Anyone else feel the opposite of meticulous?	Even if I don't 100% care about something, I do still give it my all. Still, things slip past me. Most of the time I do try for my best but things don't always turn out pristine. \n\nEx)\n\n1. I cannot cut straight lines with scissors. Even if a straight line is marked and I'm fully concentrating. Nope.\n\n2. When working with data, I usually miscalculate a few numbers. I almost expect that now.\n\n3. Wrinkled clothes bother me, but I'll try to fix them by tucking things in and heading out anyway. Not always successful. \n\n4. Terrible at folding laundry, arranging shopping carts most effectively, etc.\n\n5. Tries for a good product. Sees a mess up I've done. Tries to fix it. Can't. "Oh well" attitudes ensues over the obvious flaw. Feels terrible only after others point said flaw out and/or gets annoyed at self for the 5th flaw of the day. \n
2	I do all of those things lol. I expect to get better over time, but supposedly it will always take a bit of work. (Te as inferior function)
1	Sometimes I have to force myself to be meticulous, and it completely drains me. And yeah, I can relate to what you're saying; I'm basically incapable of tracing/drawing a straight line or cutting on the dotted line lol.

3	Everything will be ok in the end - if it’s not ok, it’s not the end. \n\n(Sometimes attributed to John Lennon)
3	\n“Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won't either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could.” -Louise Erdrich

49	It's funny cause I'm on a website called 7cupsoftea right now as an online counselor. For fun.\n\nWtf is wrong with me lol
26	How does this work? I feel like if I had a friend I listened to intently and then they did not listen to me I would probably not be friends with them.
22	jesus christ this comment section is way too accurate for comfort because its making me realize the self damaging shit im doing
20	I have never been called out so hard in my life
15	I feel this. It's not that my friends wouldn't want listen to me vent or whatever, but I always feel like it wouldn't be right for me to do the venting for some reason... even though I know I need it sometimes.
24	lol mood 
12	Ooooooof this is a big one. \n\nThere’s something about us (or me at least) that opens people tf up. One girl shared her worst life story that she hadn’t shared to anyone in 6 years first night I met her, another I met a few months ago has probably told me literally all her tea from her past lol.

3	I think this fits somewhat to every introvert?

1	lol INFP don't make very good therapists tho, I can see them empathising/sympathising with something/someone else other than their patients in half the situations that leads them to react in ways irrelevant or unhelpful to the wellbeing of the patient. 
1	But, how about that feeling when someone turns things around and gifts you with the same deep listening and genuine care you attempt to give to others? \n\nWhowhathowwhyhuh??????
1	Yeah usually I'm the one my friends go to in order to dump all of their emotional baggage on, but if it were to be the reverse situation I don't think that they would extend the same courtesy, either that or they might get thrown off by everything and sort of distance themselves from me. Which is why I frequent Reddit and other online forums lol
5	Do you have any best friends/confidant? When did you start thinking this person might become my best friend?	
1	After 45mins talking. She is INFP and I am ENTJ (male), we shared common values and well, between our types there is so much chemistry 
1	I met an INFJ, and we can relate to literally everything and we've became really close friends after 2 weeks or so

0	Enfp looking for advice on how to love my INFP	Hi you guys!\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to start off by saying thanks for being some of my favorite people on the planet. I find so so much peace in your presence(s).  I've come here to seek general advice on the following scenario:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've fallen very deeply in love with an INFP male. We're both in our 20's, but he's 4 years my junior. We met at a live music event a few months ago and immediately had a very intense spark of chemistry. We've had a few face to face visits since then, and we text or talk on the phone daily. We live about a three hour drive away from each other. Last week he seemed to get overwhelmed (triggered by what, I dunno) and decided he doesn't want to commit to a long distance relationship. That things have gotten pretty serious (he admits he had a definite part in that) and that he's not sure he can commit to being together and being hours apart. We both have some pretty big life changes ahead of us, and although at first I kinda lost my mind, I came to terms.\n\nWell, sort of.\n\nI know that if we are meant to be, that this is the best course of action. Digging in and trying to make it work will undoubtedly make it fail.  We've seen each other for music stuff since the original convo and he's assured me that his feelings haven't changed but that he thinks it's best to go forward this way. I believe him. I believe the feelings are mutual. We had a mutually teary and lingering goodbye.\n\nI don't know how to behave now. I've always been the one to initiate conversation, but should i? Do I still get to tell him he's handsome or do I pretend to be platonic? I have a heart that's covered in scars and I've learned a few things about love. I know that he's the best match for me, that I've met, up until this point in my life. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to honor that, even if it means stepping back and giving space. It hurts my heart, you guys. Send help.
2	That's tough. I'm a male INFP and recently pursued a female ENFP who lived far away, however we didn't spark like you did so this might not be helpful.\n\nPersonally, if a woman says she wants to stay friends, I believe her and usually want the same. Of course this comes with talking. Someone to share ideas and vent.\n\nI'd suggest taking a step back and letting him initiate a conversation. This will better let you know how to love him as you put it.\n\nBest of luck!
1	Boy I don't know. Maybe girl INFP's are different so it's not fair of me to comment. I'm sure it's been wonderful and everything you feel it to be but if he's withdrawn, we can make avoidance an art form. That's a shame, if you have a great connection. Having been tough enough to have that difficult conversation, it's a little terrifying to consider doing it all over again, if we think it'll hurt someone yet again. Hence avoid the whole thing with increasing determination.\n\nMaybe behave platonically? That's doesn't feel like a burden and sure leaves the door open if he's reconsidering things. By platonic- maybe a text a week although personally I'd still feel crowded- yes, it can be that unbelievable. Guessing he'll be very grateful to you for being so cool about it.
1	I also suggest the friend route (for now). I can be a very stubborn Infp and if I make up my mind about something I stick with it. If you stay his friend you respect his wishes to not push the relationship and get to know him better- try to find out what triggered his freak out or understand his thought processes. Make yourself a safe space for him 
3	Blowing off steam. A LOT of it.	First off, I'm not looking for any solutions for my path. I pretty much know what I need to do, but I'm tired of carrying this bottle I've should've emptied a long time ago.\n\nTruth be told, I've been broken for a very long part of my life. Looking back, I've never seen reciprocated love between my parents. They divorced pretty early in my life, and until recently, i haven't really understood the depths of pain and torture around that whole scenario. there were two guys who were looking like very good step fathers, but when it came to it, they betrayed my family, betrayed my mom. they leaving hurt sooo much more than i thought it would.\n\nI've been to 9 different schools before graduation, and moved 13 times. For most of my elementary years, i was bullied at almost every school. In second grade, I not only moved states, but the school I went to had a white minority in students. it was easy to see why. Everyone there was racist against white kids (the majority of students were hispanic and black), and almost from day 1, I was bullied. The teachers didn't see it, and before I could tell them, they knew who my sister was , and threatened to beat the shit out of my sister if I told the teachers or fought them. I thought it worked until I found out they were bullying her and we switched schools.\n\nthe following year, I started to break down. I had begun to become more isolated, but I had made friends who stepped in and stopped the bullies. at least for that year. the following year, during halloween, I found out that they were just using me because I would give part of my lunch out to them, and helped them out for stopping the bullies.\n\nDuring the summer before 5th grade, we moved out last major move. we moved to take of my great grandfather. he died right when school started. I became a horrible person too. I was hanging out with the outcasts (they were the only ones who accepted me, nobody else liked me, and I pretty much became like them) until I found out that one of my "friends" was bullying my sister. I fell apart even more, became even worse after that (I started to become really good at stealing and lying). I had begun to trust less and less with every passing year.\n\n8th grade was the hardest year of my life. I wasn't bullied or anything, but no one spoke to me. I sat by myself at lunch everyday. I was a great student, so I went to high school during the afternoon. I sat by myself most of that year on the bus, except when we were full. I... contemplated suicide that year, too. And I nearly did it. I found two pieces of steel cable. \n\nI.... was one step away from doing it. The thought of my mother and sister, who went through all of this with me, crying at my funeral was the only reason i stopped myself.\n\nthen life got a little better. I was beginning to build a small friend circle, and begun to believe in God and Christianity. In the summer after my sophomore year, I went out on a date from a girl that I had known from church for 4 years, been friends with for 2. That was honestly the best part of my life, feeling that romantic love. or so I thought.\n\nthe following day, I found out that she went on the EXACT same date with her ACTUAL boyfriend (she told me she was single). Then I found out that our friendship was fake, everything we did was fake, and that our date was a trial run for her for her boyfriend. I... I'm still recovering from that one.\n\nIt didn't get much better. the last school i went to, i didn't have any friends. everyone I knew that went to that high school from before had changed, and none of them really knew me. I didn't want to go to my graduation. at least I had begun to have a better understanding of christianity and Jesus, and I had stopped stealing (my lying went way down too).\n\nNow I'm here. I failed the army, I'm at a job that pays the bills, and I'm slowly becoming part of a church that I truly enjoy being in. but my fear of opening up is soo strong, it feels like i'm choking when I confront them.\n\nI'm also talking with a girl there who's absolutely stunning. I mean, she's gorgeous, she's smart, and she's on fire for God. I've just become friends with her and her family, and I'm getting situated quite nicely in the circle of mutual friends. I've even led the young adults group a couple times (I write a lot of posts on my facebook using imagery to talk about my experiences to help out others who are hurting).\n\nBut I'm soo scared to actually open up to any of them. Every time I opened up my heart in the past, they (not current group; my past relations) took the shards of my heart and stabbed me, and left me to bleed. I'm soo broken hearted, but I've had a really good life relatively (my mother has always loved me, and so has my sister. I've never been homeless, never really starved, I'm better off than so many other). \n\nBut a part of me wants to feel understood. i want others to know where my laughs comes from, where my tears comes from, where my love comes from.\n\nBut I gotta work on me, ya know? I spent so much of my time hating on myself, blaming myself, that, until recently, I had no self value, no self worth.\n\nBut I'm getting better, and that's a start. even if I cry on my way to or from church, or while I'm in bed trying to fall asleep. I need to confront my fears soon, or I will possibly miss out on the best thing that might happen to me (i'm going on a coffee date soon with that beautiful girl so I can build up a relationship with her. even if it's just a friendship starting out). I need to build an actual relationship with God and Jesus though, cause if we end up dating, i want to make sure that God is with us all the way.\n\nI'm just tired of being nomadic, of being a lone wolf. This church, this group of friends, and even this girl is the best thing to happen to me. I need to open up again, and show them who I really am. I need to conquer my fears.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you guys are this far, thank you for reading. I know it's a lot, and that it should've been dealt with a long time ago, but I'm at least starting to deal with it now. 
3	Hang in there my friend. I hope everything works out for you, God bless :) 
2	I’ve read it all and have come to a conclusion: you’re a survivor, a fighter and you’ve been through some of your hardest battles! It’s time for you to embrace your scars and face your final boss, who is, that voice in your head. To me, you’re a fighter and a brave one. You got it! 
103	Took this pic yesterday hope you guys like it!	
2	Pretty. Looks like a great meditation spot. ❤️
1	Reminds me of my childhood place Tro.\n\nWhere i grew up.   \n\n\nNice pic!
1	That is gorgeous! If I lived nearby, I'd never leave. :)
1	Looks like something out of Skyrim!
3	What kind of drunk are you?	I'm currently drunk, so why the hell not? \n\nI'm a happy drunk, so what about the rest of you?
4	From Social to laugthy joking uncle, quiet listener with death stare, to locked in my own mind only responding.
3	Hope you had a good drink (although as this is 8 hrs later maybe you're recovering now?) anyways:\n\nI don't think I am one type of drunk, I can be happy, shallow, philosophical, externally emotional (particularly negative emotions), very blunt and cold towards people, vulnerable, stubborn or unpredictably hazardous, in any combination possible. It's a lottery that is only partially affected by what I'm drinking that night\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA good example is that I once started a night happy (but generally shallow), became unpredictable and smashed a laminated window with my head, stubbornly proceeded to go out to the local nightclubs, despite some of my friends' advice and a possible concussion, and then later became silent and philosophical, only snapping out of spacing out to join in on deep conversations happening around me as everyone else was coming down on the floor of the house we ended the night in.
1	Old overly sentimental drunk. I much prefer weed.
1	I'd have to get other peoples opinions but I can't because I always drink alone 
4	Romance?	Im a 17 yr old INFP in high school and im kinda confused right now. I got my heart broken by someone half a year ago in the summer, and since then i havent been the same when it comes to romance. I like a lot of people, but dont really love any. I dont want to try things or ask any of them out because im too afraid ill just get led on and abandoned like i did in summer. Its a combonation of being scared to actually express myself and not being able to get the bitter taste of feeling used out of my mouth. Ive begun to feel like im just not worth any effort. If anyone has advice id greatly appreciate it
3	Approach them without any expectations. Ask them out without any expectations.\nWhy? You have to be patient because The One really exists, so that might be one of your fellas or someone u will meet in the future. But you will discover who is by interacting with the people you like. 
2	Just live your life and learn new things. Too young to be messing with people. Trust me young people's main downfall is thinking they got control over the 'situation' or whatever. That arrogance will come with costs. I have a sister-in-law who is a moron that believes they will never be happy if they don't have someone. Don't be her. Don't cripple yourself with your delusions. You're young and vulnerable. Fact. Find more meaningful things (like volunteering) to do this spring and summer through places/sites such as volunteermatch. And if you happen to be in Indy, I can connect you to people. Just.. understand that your priorities are in the wrong place. You aren't a bad person. You're learning but you're vulnerable and susceptible to being fooled by yourself and others- as well as ideas. You don't need love right now, and that's okay.... I wish someone could have broken that down for me when I was your age.. You don't need it right now and it's fine.
2	As someone who is 22 and still going through the exhausting life of dating, I hope I’m able to give some helpful advice, so I’m going to give you the advice I would have given my 17 year old self. First of all, don’t settle, let yourself heal still from your heartbreak, and know and be okay with the fact you will experience more. I have had a lot of adventures so far in the world of dating and one of those lead me to an extremely toxic and devastating heartbreak. But this experience taught me something- it taught me its ok to love people whole heartedly over and over again because yes there is a good chance we will get crushed, but we never die from it. \n\nAs far as dating people you’re not crazy about, please try your hardest to avoid it. I’ve dated so many people that I wasn’t crazy about, let them into my bubble and it just feels more lonely than ever. Even if it takes years to find someone else you’re crazy about, wait for that person to start putting an effort in. \n\nMy last little piece of advice is as hard as it may be, focus your energy on all other places except love. As INFPs are biggest goal in life is to find our soulmate, however it’s consuming, and it’s energy I wish I would have put into figure out myself and my life instead of boys who ended up not mattering. Plus when you find someone you’re willing to open up with again, you want to be able to offer them an amazing and successful person. Hopefully this all makes sense and best luck to you!

3	Do you guys ever feel mean for being a little distant or introverted? I like people and I want to be everyone’s friend, but then reality sets in and I realize I don’t have the mental or physical strength to be everyone’s friend. I become more stand-offish and I feel unkind and rude. Anyone else in the same boat? How do you deal with it?

1	Thanks! That helps a lot. I tend to think too much about these things, and often the best answer is to just stop worrying 😊
1	I always wake up right before something happens. An earthquake, mom checking on me, and today, a text from a friend.
15	Can't stop going out of my way to help others to the point that it is making me resentful and messing with my life.	I love helping people! Whether it's something small or big I will usually do what I can. My problem is I don't have the balls to say no to people when it is warranted. I get myself into bad, compromising and even life threatening situations sometimes because of my inability to tell people to fuck off. People walk all over me. My friends have the mindset of what's mine is theirs. I don't mind sharing and in fact I love it and also go out of my way to do that. There just comes a point when you can tell people don't appreciate it anymore and now just expect it. When I do hold my ground I am the asshole. I have let a friend who has already fucked me over in a similar situation live with me when he has no job and is an alcoholic. Instead of trying to get on his feet, he got comfy. I have worked consistent 40-60 hr weeks at jobs that were part time bc I couldn't say no. Today I literally cancelled a Dr appt 45 mins away bc I was about to leave work and got asked to stay. I told my boss about the appointment and she asked me to reschedule and stay. Sometimes I can say no at first but if someone pushes even a little I fold. I know it's my fault and I have the capability of saying no. I'm tired of being taken advantage of.
8	This is a feature of codependence. It's rooted in low self worth.\n\nYour needs matter too. You matter. When you say 'No' to things that feel wrong, you are showing yourself the same love and respect you generally show others.\n\nPractice your 'No' (refusing to do things or make commitments you secretly don't want to) on people who will respect it and not push back. When this becomes second nature is when you'll be able to stand your ground in fights or debates. \n\nAs far as your alcoholic friend goes, you are inadvertently enabling his addiction by saving him from the consequences of his own choices. Do what you can to get him out of your house (legally!) and soon. Get law enforcement involved if necessary. This is NOT being an asshole; it is allowing the necessary consequences of his addictive behavior to come to bear as a means to protect yourself from its (financial and psychological) influence, and motivating the addict to see and consequently deal with the true and destructive nature of their disease, earnestly and honestly. \n\nOf course, your addicted friend might just go off and find someone else to sponge off of; but just know that you're protecting yourself and helping him by kicking him out of your place.
2	Have you read about the concept of ”the shadow” in jungian an freudian psychology?\nIt can surely help you stop being a pushover, especially if you value being kind to people. The shadow is all of those aspects of yourself that you shun bevause you do not value them. In your case your ability to be ”necessarily selfish”. \nI link one of Jordan Petersons (like him or not) videos on the concept of the shadow. Brilliant stuff. https://youtu.be/iDQ8DiP_Y_A \n\nThe reason I came to think about it is because you mentioned the word ”resentful”. And resent is an agressive emotion, even though it’s not as expressive as anger. Sort of sn latent form. Point is that this emotion tells you something. And if you don’t listen to it you will become more bitter. Maybe you’ll even hurt people close to you without consciously wanting to do so (I’ve experienced this first hand, even done it myself) And that’s the total opposite of what a people loving person would actually want. So i’d suggest looking into it. Interesting in the very least. Also useful.
16	Anyone want to just hide from the world?	21 year old Infp with OCD here, really hating life if I'm honest. Spend my days at the office with nothing to do, just staring at the clock. Thinking about my ideal life, I honestly think I'd rather spend my days in some tiny apartment, working from home, working from 9 till 3, buying the bare minimum of food I need to survive, play videogames, browse the internet and just do that until I die.\n\nNo disrespect to any girls or women on here but if it wasn't for my sexual desires I honestly don't think I'd want a gf. I'm a loner, I've always been a loner and I've been a loner quite happily, most of the time at least. \n\nEvery time I try and act like a "normal" person I usually just get anxious and exhausted. Social gatherings, learning to drive feel like such an ordeal. I know this lifestyle isn't considered the traditionally happy or healthy one but maybe I'm just a bit different.\n\nCan anyone relate?
2	Are you really an INFP? 
2	Have you thought about writing? Not like in writing on reddit, but getting your thoughts on on paper.\nI feel it can be very cathartic. It also gets you this sense of having a story. Like ”even though my life is messy, I am still here, which means I can still change it”. \nI know what you feel bro. I have also isolated myself to a degree. But anything that lets my ”negative” thoughts be processed, instead of shunning them, seems to help me. Which is why I love writing.
2	You should start doing things to improve your life, or you will continue to live in misery.
1	Anafranil is an old school med that's pretty useful for OCD.
1	Im inexperienced, i cant do much to help but i can duggest you maybe start acting on impulses. Instead of just thinking "man i really need to clean my room" or "i should work out" actually do it. Take things a step at a time, and take time throughout the day to stop and simply look and listen to your surroundings and appreciate the simple beauties there
23	How to answer douchebags who ask you "Why are you so quiet?" or "Why don't you talk?"	Here are some ideas:\n\n"It wouldn't be interesting for you to talk, if there was no one who listens, right?"\n\n"Well, if you were a fish, would you climb trees?"\n\n"Every time you talk, I learn something new about you, but you only repeat what you already know. That's why."\n\nWhat's your awesome response?
17	 Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt.  \n— ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 
13	I always just drop the line: "talking is silver, listening is golden"
10	I have been working on the art of not responding. Either just looking back silently, Or just ignoring completely. People usually make a nervous laugh after. 
8	Because I don’t find you interesting enough to waste my energy .
7	"Because I don't feel like talking"\n\nBelieve me I would love to make a witty comeback to douchebags. But I also don't want to start shit if I don't have to. Unless they keep provoking me, I don't want to say anything that would lead to more talking. 
6	I always say "what should I say?" because i'm not opposed to having a genuine conversation but I'm not gonna talk to fill silence, that is pointless.
3	Because I dont have a thing to say, period. I love being cunt and honest.
4	"The more I listen, the more others speak. The more they speak, the more they reveal their weaknesses. I use the information to plot their downfall and take over the world."
2	I like observing and being behind the scene
2	because I was really enjoying what you were saying :)\n\nPut them down with kindness. Everyone will respect you more if you take the high road in this rude and annoying question

4	How to be on time	I struggle to be on time everyday. I don't understand why? Even if I am ready for my Job/appointment  I still will be late. \nI hate this habbit and want to change.\nWhat do you think can be a cause of this behavior? How can I change?\n\n Anyone else have or had this problem? 
4	Same here, even my boss doesn't bother nagging at me anymore, everyone around me has gotten used to it but it's still embarasing every time.\nI think for me the problem is 'give me a sec, I'll do one last thing before I go' mentality and always underestimating the time it takes plus heavy procrastination and just lack of focus... 
3	I used to have this problem but now I plan to leave 5 minutes before you would normally leave.
2	I've found that I usually wake up plenty early, but then I do other things or just take too long getting out of bed. Or even if I'm ready I'll wind up browsing the internet or watch a YouTube video or something. If I don't allow myself to indulge in distractions then I leave on time. \n\nAlso I'm bad at paying attention to things like road conditions/weather for potential slow downs. There's apps like wayze that will help you leave early enough when you input your destination time. \n\nDunno if those apply to you, but hopefully they're helpful in some way. 
1	Giving medicine I don't take enough myself, but you need to set an alarm to start getting ready and one for when you have to get out within 5 minutes. You will also have to accept arriving early to whatever place. You don't want to be trying to keep your arrival always 5 minutes prior because it doesn't put into account traffic and other unexpected events, but at the same time don't be that weird guy who is an hour early either.. This is what I intend to do for myself as well. I think we 'know' what we need to do but we procrastinate to make that necessary change/criticism on ourselves while we keep kicking our own asses asking why we still do this to ourselves. It's like a very pervasive form of laziness. Also cutting out how often you make excuses to yourself would benefit this route of change.

1	Lucky Man - ELP
1	Makes me think of The Smiths.
1	Who else immediately thought of Nobody by Mitski
1	The opposite! Songs that sound sad but are actually... hopeful\n\nFrom Hurdy Gurdy Man to Adagio for Strings
1	I actually hate listening to sad music, I listen to things with positive vibes because I feel as if my very mind is a jukebox stuck on a playlist of sad songs all the time, why would I want more sad?
799	Anybody else like this?	
168	Yes, and I always feel profoundly uncomfortable after talking too much. I tend to back off for a while after. 
31	I can turn into some stereotypical genki ENFP and talk about topics I often force into the conversation but generally only around people I'm comfortable with and when I'm physically comfortable (if I once sit on a comfy couch I'm sure going to stay there) +being drunk and some energy drink also helps. Though, actually I'm one of the most introverted beings I know.
23	Only when I’m tired. \nThat thing about INFPs becoming ENFPs when they’re sleepy? Oh it’s true...
22	This! And than i get shit for being silent.
8	I tend to talk more in messages or text and ramble and babble like a mad man. Or if I'm comfortable with someone and I have something to say I can get excited and talk like I'm crazy too. Otherwise in person at the very least I don't talk much because I never know what to say or do. But you start texting me about something I'll text you all fucking day to the point I force myself to stop because I feel like I'm being an annoying shithead.
7	yeah but there is totally an inbetween
5	Yes, absolutely. It's become more pronounced as I've gotten older, too. It used to be that I'd only babble like a lunatic to people I knew, but now I've started to unleash the insanity on total strangers. Like most of you, I find it exhausting, and sometimes I'm physically ill for a couple of days afterward.
4	Yes, but eventually someone says something I do not appreciate and my mood drops.
5	What I end up doing is I don’t talk and slowly after making small comments to a person and they look like they aren’t annoyed I talk more and more until they finally hate me.
4	I have worked at a call center and was a cab driver where I was known for telling bizarre stories to my fares so I can talk to anyone about anything at any time\n\nOn the other hand I also have gone into what I call my hermit mode where my current record is four months without speaking a single word\n\nRight now I'm over three months in hermit mode but once a month I take someone shopping because they don't have car other than that day I do not talk\n\nI can talk but if I do it's nonstop BSing or no talking at all...I too have no middle ground
3	Yeah I'm wondering if I'm turning into an extrovert recently...
3	Some what of a similar energy here being a 5 Enneagram INFJ. But it’s more often than not if I think someone actually gets me. Or is interested in a subject that I’ve been thinking about and keeping to myself. When I’m really in my element. Then yes the Buddhist monk absolutely. My INFP best friend does this too but it’s not necessarily the absent minded professor aura that I give off. He’ll go on rants like me and it’ll be something knowledgeable but his is more entertaining and autonomous lol.
3	Ambivert!
3	Im actually Enfp/Infp so I go from moods where I want to be alone to where I NEED to be with someone
4	I can only be this extroverted with a handful of people, mostly girlfriends and my best friends, and even then I can revert back to being an introvert in the same encounter. As others have said, I feel uncomfortable talking (about myself) too much.
2	Meeeee. A few Lukewarm days in between but yea. I'm either ready to party or quietly resenting your mother for your existence. 
2	Definitely. I am like this with deep conversations especially. I think I ramble to prevent any awkwardness since I want everyone to be comfortable. 
1	This is so true.
1	Shit, thought I’m the only one 
1	I'm the former at work (which got me in trouble because tone 9f voice issues) and the latter everywhere else unless my dad's around.
1	Damn hell yes.
1	YES BAHAHAHAHA
1	Yes and no becouse I am hyper communicative with my close friends&family but not with others. And yes I feel very tired afterwards. 
1	It's so awesome knowing I'm not the only one who does this! It's freeing!
1	i will say yeah but ive come to read  the comments 
1	Why is this me? 
1	i'm a proud ambivert 
1	Yaaas
1	 ✋ ANFP 
1	It bothers me when people say extroverted introvert. That isn't a thing. Introverts can be outgoing, talkative, and social and still not be placed into a category they aren't. Introverts just don't roll on and on and on without a break. \nIt makes it seem like being introvert isn't as desirable as being an extrovert. No personality type is better or worse than another. 
1	That was me especially hype chatting on and on for hours or will u just leave me alone
1	Hahaha yes. I have moments where I talk a lot and go off on tangents, or my quiet contemplative moments, which are indistinguishable from my social anxiety moments on the outside, apparently.
1	I believe its called an Ambivert....
1	Yes haha no in between 😁✌
1	Hahaha yes! I love this subreddit and I love all you INFP’s. A place I can call home! 
1	Damn straight. 
1	 I can also relate to this verry much
1	Yeah I think you have Borderline personality Disorder...
0	If anyone did 4 lines of coke and 30mg of Adderal they’d be dead.  
29	Why does this hurt so much?	
1	We love you, INTP poster! 
1	Wait which one is nf
234	Why? I can't even fight back in this condition	
23	I don't think I've ever seen something so relatable in my entire life.
18	From childhood I learned that anger was a bad emotion, so i repressed it for a long time. I thought I couldn’t feel anger or much of any emotion. One night I was drinking with an INTP friend at his place, only the two of us. When my friend drinks he can get really angry, not towards me, but to life and such. I was drunk myself, but when listening to him and trying to understand his stories from childhood I felt all my muscles getting warm and tense like I was ready to punch the next guy coming in, it felt like I got transferred his anger, but only a couple of seconds later I was crying because of the anger I had just felt. Then my friend cried too. It feels good to cry and even better when crying with a friend
8	It gets really annoying if you're trying to make a compelling argument.
7	i don't get angry often. i usually get sad when i should be angry, because it makes me sad that i was treated the way i was. not angry
4	Just to break the stereotype here, I rarely ever cry. :P
3	hahaa sometimes true, what about #'s 1-4?
3	I'd rather shout than cry. Takes me a while, I keep it all inside until it all builds up then watch out!!! I explode like a kettle boiling... and it just keeps coming out till I'm done. Then quiet. And guilt for doing that to the person. 
3	Lately I've needed to cry but I just get mad or really sad. I think I'd feel better but I just can't seem to cry 😐 I just get that really really empty quiet sad instead, dang it. 
3	This must explain why I couldn't retaliate against the bullies back in elementary/middle school. I took their words a little too personally. I couldn't defend myself against them because before I can think of a good comeback I constantly get overrun by my emotions and keep looking like I'm about to cry afterwards, which serves as a catalyst for them to make fun of me even more. Hell, I still take some hurtful things that people say to heart to this day.
6	I love to punch walls and smash shit like Björk's hyperballad. Its so good. 
2	Punching seems more socially acceptable these days.. God forbid someone shows a tear??  It's like a crime to cry, Ive always dine both, cry and punch... Just let all that shift go wild.  Lol. 
2	It's so true I hate it!!
2	Is Ben Barnes INFP?!!! A girl could only hope😍😍😍	
2	Could be.... :) I have a crush on him and I'm an INFP. My last celeb crush was Stephen Colbert, and he is an INFP (which surprised me completely). The way he talked in his recent interview on Carson Daily about imagining himself stranded on a train, that's a total INFP move. He's also very private yet gregarious. 
7	Relationships don't last?	So I fail to understand what I do wrong and how it even happens. I'm always all-in in every relationship of mine and every time... Every single time they breakup after a couple of months or so... Not sure how and why this happens. My recent girl broke up with me for not going out with her to a courier office since I had work. and That's stupid and pretty sure that is not the real reason behind it. but they never tell what it really is. Funny thing after all the heartbreak and shit I have been through I really don't feel bad about it at all. I mean, I'm happy and all but I do feel bad about how it could have been nice and maybe lasted longer for a change.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry about the rant. I just didn't know who else to talk to this about. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
37	Huh, sounds a lot like you guys	
9	I can say with absolute certainty that Google maps was made to keep us alive.
7	Nature IS our home. It's where we come from isn't it? 
7	Trick question, there is no home.
5	All that is gold does not glitter,\nNot all those who wander are lost;\nThe old that is strong does not wither,\nDeep roots are not reached by the frost.\nFrom the ashes, a fire shall be woken,\nA light from the shadows shall spring;\nRenewed shall be blade that was broken,\nThe crownless again shall be king. - J. R. R. Tolkien
2	Lmao!  Is this an INFP thing?  Yes I’m so directionally challenged  
1	Burial - Where Is Home?
1	I'm a runner, and often I try to run in parks/ other areas I haven't before to explore nature. Can confirm that is indeed me. Thank the universe for Google maps 😅
1	mmmmmmm........no
6	How do I help a grieving INFP?	Okay, so my friend (INFP in question) had the worst day of his life the other day, the cliff notes are he had a bunch of terrible stuff happen, and all of it was his fault.\n\nMy instinct is to get him a small gift and then to leave him alone (because that’s what I’d want), but then it occurred to me that maybe he’d rather I offer to talk or do something with him? Thanks for your help. \n\nEdit: what about a new art medium? He’s super creative and bouncing around from medium to medium, so maybe having an outlet would be nice. 
7	Well, I can’t speak for all INFPs— but personally— I think it would be most meaningful to spend time with people I cared about. Many INFPs believe that their purpose in this world is to do good, so naturally when they feel they’ve done wrong, they’ll go into a state of grief. I think the important thing for an infp to learn and remember is the fact that UNCONDITIONAL love exists, and just as they give it to others, they can be the recipients of it. \nPersonally, I found the message of grace when Im in the wrong to be much more impactful than downplaying the wrong I’ve done; because, an INFP will rarely downplay a wrong they’ve committed in their hearts, even if it seems they do.\nSo, I’d say spend time with him, listen to his heart, don’t try to rationalize his behavior or his mistakes with him, but instead, have an honest conversation about his decisions and the impact they’ve had— and above all, the message that he should come away with at the end of it all, is that he is still loved and that nothing he can do will change the love you have for him.
6	When in grieving, I think INFPs are likely to set a wall around them for awhile. And because of the Fi function is dominant, talking while in deep pain won’t help at all. But usually, if they’re healthy enough, they contemplate on it for awhile and will then reflect as to why such things happened and that embracing the event is the eureka to that epiphany. It’s a normal process, we’ve also tackled this in nursing. The 5 stages of grieving DABDA. (Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance) \nAssuring to your INFP friend that you will be there once they’re on the right track again will definitely help them because you gotta use strong words that has to do with trust and certainty to get their attention
6	Offering to talk is nice since INFPs often feel like perpetual listeners haha; even if he doesn’t take you up on it, I’m sure he’ll appreciate it.\n\nThanks for being a great friend.
3	Just offer up that you're here to talk if he needs it. If he doesn't take you up on it right away it's because he is in solitude trying to sort it all out.
3	I personally find it difficult to accept gifts. Usually a good idea is if you have the knack for cooking, whip something up and then maybe put on some sort of movie. That's what would cheer me up.
2	Offer to listen; make it clear that it's not a burden to you. For me, it really helps to just talk about things that are bothering me, but I often tell myself that it's a burden to others. \n\nIf he doesn't take you up on it, offer to go out and do something fun or stay in & try to get him to laugh / think of other things. \n\nAbove all, just know that even being there for him & making the effort will help more than you know!\n\n
26	😍	
1	wow. i never thought airplane farts could actually look cool
10	Angry	I know that we’re one of the nicest and kindest people, but I get so angry when people try and put other people down, or when people feel entitled and I can be the nastiest person about it. Really mad in a group that feels entitled rn. I know I won’t be as mad in a little while, but it makes me so mad that people don’t understand they hurt others.
4	I’ve always found it so interesting that when people are unkind to me, I’m just sort of baffled and go quiet to contemplate whether I deserved it. I’m better with that these days but I can’t say I’m very adept at fighting back, never have been.\n\nBut when people do it to others, whether I know them or not, I go into this protective stance where I’ll defend them for all I’m worth if I can. And I’ve done some crazy things that way like stopping a guy from stabbing someone else with a knife. I look back upon it extremely confused, because it’s so not ‘the normal me’.\n\nIt’s bizarre. Doesn’t seem to add up.
3	Not wanting to make friends in a new city	I just moved cross country to Denver, CO for a job after college about a month ago. I'm really enjoying the city so far and the area has a ton of stuff to see and explore. That being said I am still getting used to full-time work in a bit of a high stress position so when I get back from work and on the weekends I have just been relaxing or taking walks around the city by myself. \n\nI know at this point I should try to go out and socialize, but honestly right now I've just been content with my own company or chatting with family and friends back home. I worry that this is the INFP in me not wanting to interact with new people.\n\nIs it healthy for me right now to just enjoy my alone time or should I press myself to socialize?\n\nEdit: I should clarify that I for sure want to make friends in Denver just struggling to find the motivation to at the moment
1	In situations like these I try to give it a chance before. I often find myself thinking "nah, I'd rather stay at home and chill than go to that party", and then I force myself to go anyways because I think I should. And then I end up really enjoying myself. On the off-chance that I don't, then I know that maybe I should just lay back and be on my own for a while. I don't believe in the "it's too late to make friends now". Make friends whenever you want. 
1	Mm, there's nothing inherently wrong about enjoying alone time. I will say that the older you get, the more your world tends to shrink. Comfort and the seeking of it speeds that up.\n\nDepending on your level of introversion, I'd say being receptive to new friendships is the way to go.\n\nHave fun on your adventures in your new home!
1	New city new you
1	That all sounds normal and healthy to me. I do the same. The difference for me though is, if I have an off day in a new city I sometimes start to second guess myself and criticize myself for not having more friends, forgetting that it was a conscious choice to begin with.\nIt’s hard if difficult stuff comes up and I suddenly need more support and there’s no one to reach out to or to help to distract me. It’s rough when that happens, on the other hand I’ve had several years of my life where I spent most of my time alone and was totally okay with it.\nI’ld say it’s a coin toss which is the “better” way to go.\nIt definitely takes a lot of energy and time for me to make new friends either way, which is why I probably procrastinate. I’ve found recurring social events or groups are the way to go. There’s less pressure to get to know people as you know you will probably see them again plus you have more time to suss them out in a group setting before getting involved and finding it’s not a good match.

3	Can any of you relate to the things i feel and think?	I just felt like i should share some of the things inside my mind and my life, and im curious if any of you fellow INFP's can relate. Im INFP-T\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hate intimidating people. Asking me how i am is fine, but meeting yourself with my friends/family without asking me first will just make me distance myself even more. And in general if someone "sticks" to me will make me toxic and distant. Call me stupid, but im still distant from one of my friends just because he "monopolized" one of my best friends a few years ago. He just lost my trust for like... forever... i'll never tell him something personal about myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really really hate small talks and dumb questions, or when im trying to explain something to someone, and instead of telling me that he is not interested, he have to stop me when im trying my best to explain something to him, just to tell me something irrelevant to the topic we're talking about. I can get extremely angry and mad. And in the end we always end up arguing about something dumb and stupid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hate when someone is arguing with me without defending his claims with proof. If im arguing with someone, i always say why im right, including facts and proof. If you have different opinion, you better defend it because i wont tolerate it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow about the phone calls part you all probably know about, i can partially agree. I really hate phone calls. I usually hang up and text the person. I prefer texting. On other hand im really attached and interested in technology.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone tells me that i walk, speak and read very fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have different kind of friends, and i cannot meet them together because they are all different (some of them even hate each other) and somehow i just fit with everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm a good listener, but if i have something on my mind, i will stop you just to say it as fast as possible, because if i dont i will forget it a few seconds later. The words just match up perfectly in my head and i just gotta say whats on my mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can never be myself with any of my friends. I can be a small part of me when im out with one friend, and im another part of myself when im out with another friend. Im just... never myself...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes i reach for my phone to check the time, then i forget what i was going to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf someone tells me that person x is bad and i shouldn't talk to that person, that wont stop me to do so. I'm very individual, and i wont believe you unless i assure myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI listen almost everything, as long as it sounds good. Rock, Hip Hop, Pop, Rap, Metal, R&B, Classical... whatever is on your mind is fine, as long as it sounds good/there's meaning behind the lyrics. Thats another reason why i find common ground with music genres when i meet new people. You may listen just... lets say... Disturb of Columbia... and even if i dont, i probably know similar songs that the person probably knows as well in that genre.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mind is always busy thinking weird stuff. For example, i imagined multiple times someone teleporting next to me, and if someone teleports to me right now, i wont be surprised at all... My motto is "expect the unexpected", and thats what i actually do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love sharing personal stuff, but mostly with random people online, because they dont know any of my real life friends, and they have no idea about my past and how people around me see me. So i can be actually myself, and i can introduce myself the way i want to, without having to worry if he knows my best friend, and what he may have told him about me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm always 2 steps ahead. If someone asks me to do something/is about to do something, im always thinking why is he doing that/asking me that, and what is going to happen if he does it/i answer him. I feel extremely vulnerable if someone knows something bad about me or any of my weak points. If they know nothing bad about me, they cant judge me or take advantage of my weaknesses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really value my past, and everything that happened. I have a hard time selling my stuff (like my old phone for example, ive been using it for 2 years, i cant just let him go, he means a lot to me, i know all of his marks and scars).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm ether this, either this. There is no inbetween. Im either completely independent, or im completely dependent. There is just no inbetween\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have to mention that i've been having these things on my mind way before i knew what INFP was (i exclude the phone calls part, that was the only thing i mentioned and i realized after i explored INFP)\n\nI cant say no. And people abuse my kindness.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for my bad englano, im sure there are more things on my mind, but i just cant think of any at the moment. Looking for your comments, and im really curious if any of you feels the same as i do.\n\nPlease guys, excuse my englano, after re-reading what i wrote i really want to kms. Sorry.
1	I feel pretty similar on all those topics. Only really thing different is that I've gotten really used to small talk. I'd never initiate it but I could answer happily enough. Other than that yeah.\n\nAnd it's sooo awkward explaining to people that I never call anyone
2	Wondering if there are any Beat Makers or Crate diggers in the INFP sub	I love to dig for records (meaning looking for vinyl records) but it's been a while since I've produced any music from it, probably more than a decade. If you're reading this you might be a crate digger and if you are not then no worries, skip to the next post.\n\nI've made short attempts a few years ago making beats again, using an Akai MPC, participating in small challenges on reddit and provided some piece of it on a short deadline. Having a deadline was really helpful or else I wouldn't produce anything :)\n\nI'd love to find out if there are other beat makers, crate diggers in the INFP world. \nLet me know how your expierience for you was so far.\n\nIf you can relate, tell me what's your experience and what's your thing.\n(if you want to send me your soundcloud link I'm up for it)\n\nLet me know I'm not the only one\n\nPeace\n\n\n
2	I honestly love sampling old records. Because I make music so I can put it om streaming services, I don't do it anymore and I really miss it. I have so many beats I'll never use and they're all my favourites. Idk if you've heard of him but 9th Wonder is one of my favourite producers of all time. His sample chops are insane.
1	Yo fellow record collector!\nI make music too but it's weird synthesizer experiments. I'd love to hear the stuff you make!
1	Yeah I've gotten into making beats recently, haven't sampled records really I've just been using random clips I find online or apply a lot of filters to make my original stuff sound grungy
1	I don't make beats, well not yet anyway. Thing is I love beat music the louder the boom Bap the better or some cool jazzy riffs mellow me out. Said all that to say this is the 1st mention I have come across in reference to crate diggers and what not... being in a cult for 15+ yrs and not having access to social media the world past me by.  I missed the whole Internet wave when it started.\n\nI thought that all well most music was sampled and remixed by records...plastic STILL :/  So when I got on social media in 2016-2017 I mean really got on, and found out that beats were being made via computer generated whatever you call its, and that practically any one can make them. It was hard sifting threw and finding Spin Masters... I'm so corny I know...I was hyped and almost had a melt down. But its music right...after listening to some old radio station that spin from the crates every thing became clear again.\nKeep spinning...   
1	Some Rant about Myself	For some reason I feel good about myself when relating to people, so I felt obligated to write basically a brief life story. I think I'm INFP, but there is always the possibility for mistype, so sorry if so. Though it seems the closest I've seen so far.\n\nI have autism and school was really hard for. Socially that is, not academically. I always wanted to interact and be included, but never knew just exactly how one did it. I mostly ended up gravitating to groups or people and staying nearby, but participating was just as difficult - what does one say in a social situation. So in the end, my primary school years were made up of little actually talking to people. The time without them was then composed of staring at nice patterns in the fence, reading and 'making my own fun' by enacting scenarios from a game I played etc.\n\nWhen it came to secondary, I was just as socially unprepared. I proceeded to basically get into a situation where everyone liked me (or was nice to me at least), but still I had no real friends to speak of. So I tried sticking to a group. I sat with them but could never find a way to contribute to discussion. I was never invited to any out of school stuff. Eventually they started to hint I should leave, but they were my only semblance of having friends, which seemed really important to me for some reason. Then my crush asked me to stop, and I did. I basically always had some crush, but usually actually doing anything about it was beyond my confidence. All I could do is send subtle signals so obfuscated they could only be interpreted as annoying.\n\nThen I went to simply not having any friends, which actually wasn't as bad as I expected, but still with the feeling I should have some. It was especially depressing with all the kids TV shows that say 'Friendship Conquers All!' Then came 6th form - I think the first point I was able to interact in a normal way somewhat. But the trend didn't change, and I either sat at a group table (who didn't want me gone this time) on my phone, or alone working on random Maths/Physics ideas, a story, past papers etc... It was difficult to say no to anyone, but also true friendship didn't happen as I couldn't ever say anything beyond talking about the A-Levels.\n\nWhen I then came to uni, everything changed. I'd been imagining uni to get rid of all my problems and it actually did to my surprise. Meeting people seemed easier, and before long I got one really good friend (And a bunch more that only continued as far as the other person kept contacting me). He's an INTJ and somehow we get along really well. My personality of being really quiet had a strange thing of switching to the opposite and being really energetic with my family or by myself. This finally extended beyond that here as he seems to be somebody who doesn't seem to mind me saying everything that comes into my head. It was a surprising change I was happy to embrace. It was very odd then during the Christmas holidays to then automatically revert to my quiet self when meeting any old friends from school. He's the only one I actually actively want/need contact from now, but if anybody talks to me I will happily respond to be polite. And I can't bear the thought of them hating me. And that's something I often exaggerate - I get to know somebody, but suddenly they stop acknowledging my existence - it must be because I was awkward at that social gathering (Turns out it wasn't).\n\nI was surprised so much INFP stuff seemed to fit me, though the more I write the more scared I am I got it wrong (mostly because I want to belong to something and my brain keeps saying each faction is too good for me).\n\nA weird thing that happened once was I was dumped, but didn't actually feel anything. I was really confused because I didn't feel sad and couldn't figure out why, so any insight to that would be invaluable. On the other hand, when I get really emotional (usually over really stupid stuff), I keep it in for ages until it eventually bursts like a flood gate and I'm sad and crying for a day, often then going off on my own and thinking about it for a long time. I want people to acknowledge my sadness, until they offer to help and I suddenly feel it'd be selfish to accept it. The emotional breakdown is normally over by the next morning.\n\nI usually try and use logic to structure any arguments I have, only accepting evidence as a deciding factor. But then I get a choice between something nice and something healthy and always choose the nice one.\n\nOne of my favorite things is fantasy worlds - eg. Star Wars, Star Trek, Inheritance, Harry Potter. But only if they fulfill two criteria - 1) They have a detailed expansive universe I can imagine and is consistent and explored, and 2) Aren't literally our current world in the present or past. When they are done right however, eg. the Dominion War, it's the most exciting thing ever and I cannot stop watching no matter what.\n\nI'm not sure if this is worth reading, but thanks if you did. I wondered if anyone could relate to anything here, or I guess provide explanation or feedback on my life? It almost seems my personality is everything at the same time - Introverted when with normal people, but really alive with some select people. Using logic to decide, except when emotions decide something else is more important. Being an emotional rollercoaster when my parents say 'This is common sense' and I don't get it, but emotionless in a breakup. Being actually quite smart in most things, but acting dumb, using bad puns and using sarcasm a lot in actual speech. Being told I'm a good person, but knowing I only do a fraction of the things I would be doing if I actually was 'good'. Accepting basically any argument or instruction unless there's a really good reason not to.\n\nI feel this'll probably keep going forever if I continue, so I'll just stop now and let you find the conclusion in the last few paragraphs.

7	The mood of this sub	The last couple weeks have felt so negative.  I'm not talking about the typical "in my feelings" posts, but the ones tearing down those people. \n\nSure, we are all individuals who should be so much more than a self deprecating hive mind contributing to a uniform depression.  However, I feel like all the posts attacking one another are toxic, uncalled for, and childish.  \n\nLet me get this straight.  MBTI should not define any person.  We should not reduce ourselves to our "type," ever.  But we as a community should be better than how we have been acting.  \n\nWe are all individuals at different stages of self discovery and developmental maturity.  I remember when I first discovered personality typing.  I was excited that someone else had been able to define the way I was wired with words that had escaped me my entire life.  I was relieved that who I am was something normal and that I wasn't a broken person.  Finding structure and words and definitions to my "personality type" gave me confidence in my own unique personality.  Defining myself as an INFP allowed me to free myself from all the things I am not and acted as a catalyst fueling my individuality.   But it took time.  \n\nAs I look back on the years slowly inscribing words on the pages of the book of my life, I see so many phases.  If I came here now when I was just beginning to learn who I was, I would have been crippled and stunted in my journey of self discovery.   We need to be accepting people especially if they're depressed or searching for labels.  We need to recognize that they're growing and that time, not harsh words, will allow them to transverse the boxes we inevitably close ourselves within.  \n\nMBTI is a great tool that is easily misused.   Most people fall victim to typing and labeling themselves.  It is important to remember that most people grow out of that stage.  It is important to meet people with love, especially when we disagree.  We are all searching, striving, and growing.  Sometimes it is totally necessary to label and define ourselves to give us a skeleton upon which we build our individuality.  \n\nPlease, I'm begging you.  Stop tearing people down.  You're better than that.  The world does that enough on its own without your help.  Support and love one another.  Remember that people are in different stages of development.  Remember that some of us were hardened by difficult life experiences and others weren't.   Remember that there are countless factors that shape and inspire us into the people we are.  \n\nIf you want to educate people in this community that they are so much more than four letters, I applaud you.  Just remember to do it lovingly.  If you want to tell people their relationship with someone of some specific MBTI will probably be unique, do it lovingly.  If you want to remind people that their career isn't tied to some personality type, do it lovingly.   \n\nIf you think my take on all this is bullshit, then let's discuss it.  I'm also always looking to grow.  I just think that there's been too much anger and frustration in this community recently, and I know we are better than that.  
2	I agree. This sub reminds me of the /bpd sub. If you’re not self aware of your own identity and strengths , you can get sucked into the mess. Like a crab in a barrel \n\nThat’s why I usually hang out in the other mbti subs . The /intp one is pretty cool 
2	I totally agree! I think we should respect people enough to give them the space to have their own process, without criticizing their path. Is there a way to include tolerance and acceptance into the description of the sub? I think we need better boundaries around this. \n\nWe have to have faith that whatever people share on here it’s ALL a part of the process, judging people for being honest and authentic about their emotions is counterproductive and anyway there is NO right or wrong way to take a path of self exploration regardless.\n\nI can’t stand it when people tell me I’m “too” sensitive. I’m NOT. And who is anyone to tell me I am anyway? I’m comfortable accepting both the light and the shadow in my life and feeling intense sadness or joy. If people want to put me down for that, I have enough self love to know it says more about them that they aren’t truly comfortable with themselves than it does about me, but people come here when they are searching and vulnerable and in need of loving kindness and acceptance and this type of criticism will only drive the more vulnerable among us away. Which is really unfair and totally lame, not at all what being an INFP is about, in my opinion.\n\nFinally, I think if people are being unkind and insensitive it’s our duty as a community to tell people their behavior is not wanted here, in a kind but firm way, to stand up for our fellow sensitives, otherwise good people will leave and only the really thick skinned and reactive people will be left. I think we all need to work on better boundaries so people can feel safe and comfortable sharing openly here.
1	I don’t agree with the MBTI test. I think it’s great that you can relate to something and that way it comforts you and you feel good.\n\n
0	It’s mostly just young people being young, but yeah, it does also piss me off.\n\nBest you can do is just not give weight to those people/their posts because they’ll figure it out for themselves, not by fishing for compliments or sympathy on this subreddit. There are a lot of walking stereotypes and at the same time what they talk about doesn’t really amount to anything.\n\nI just peacefully wait for the real and good posts to come about.\n\n

9	I despise society so much to the point of no return(Sensitive topic)	I was born a happy childhood and family I still remember I had many friends and I got along with many outside school. I used to be very optimistic and believe in good for everyone and crave for true equality for everything including animals (that's why I was very sensitive when seeing pet stores). Things start to go down when I enter my 3rd grade. I am Japanese and am born and raised in Hong Kong so I attend local school there. In my 3rd grade I started being bullied due to my race but I guess it also because the class seems to be a bit more wild compare to the people outside school that seems to be more friendly. In school, they would beat me, bother me in class and make fun of me even though I didn't do anything wrong. They always call me "fkin jap" and make fun of my country even though I am half. This is where I begin to hate all Chinese and be a pro-Japanese. I still remember I hate Chinese and China so much even now I can't let that hate go aside. But the hate didn't stop from just hating a race. I couldn't tolerate them so I change to a Canadian international school. Things were slightly better with no beatings anymore but I get make fun of due to my weird personality. I learned that I have bad social skills so I try my best to impress others so I can make friends since I was a total loner but I ended up being called annoying. So I gave up after many attempts and decided to walk the path of a lonewolf. Soon I begin to be exposed by gender inequality I felt. Tbh, I was bullied by girls as well in the past but teachers never blame women for some reason and I myself couldn't understand and sort my feelings anymore. In my Canadian school, many teachers were feminists. I still remember my English teacher being so irrational to me but were good to girls even though I did nothing wrong. I feel like she just hate on me due to her instinct but I am used to it. I also had an issue with the group project and another teacher always side with the girl and never at least listen to what I have to say. I always have the feeling many people don't like me on the first impression and even if they do, we will ended up being enemies. I was exposed to both discrimination through race and gender that's where I begin to hate humanity and society completely. I also couldn't tolerate the misandry in media and many shows. Now I feel so much hate, anxiety and stress on this world, on society, feminism, almost everything. I also fkin hate the gender norms, social norms where they force you to be someone. My god.... I just want to be myself. When I refuse to do something that I feel irrational and unfair people would also tell me "man up!" "And you call yourself a man?" WELL FK U! I am a woman then! Fk this world I hate it so much that I wish it burns down. Sorry I just have too much hate in me and I have been locking it so long but I just couldn't.. I joined MGTOW when I couldn't hold it any longer but that doesn't mean I am making friends there. I never expect to get along with people there and I don't think I desire to make any friend now compare to the past since my personal time is more valuable than ever. But I join mgtow because I felt more liberated from society and social norms and realize that I am not alone. But again I have fallen so much now. I just hate everything. I am writing this to be prepared to be criticized and banned. Honestly, this world sucks for INFP and for me specifically. Sigh.. I want to get rid of my emotion so I can truly live peacefully but social norms, gender norms, society's restriction and discrimination will probably get that emotion back from me. Sigh... Sorry. 
4	Reading it, it made me feel your anger originates from not feeling accepted. And that can feel very unsafe. It’s hard to love a world that makes you feel unsafe. It’s easy to fall into unhealthy patterns where you either try too hard to fit in while sacrificing yourself, or getting trapped in bitterness and your defensive walls.\n\nI understand it in my own way, I was raised with much abuse and neglect, and then later on got bullied for years. I felt unsafe everywhere, it’s a horrible feeling. \n\nStill, it is not a ‘truth’. It is subjective, a result of all your experiences. That doesn’t make it less true for you :). But it means that by changing your perspective, you can change your experience. \n\nOne of the key insights for me personally, was: stop waiting for what you need to come to you from others, and start giving it to the world. Indiscriminately. Regardless of how people treat you. Be what you need in your life, whether that is attention, love, compassion, joy... whatever. Embrace it, figure out what it means to you and *be* it. \n\nFor me this worked miracles and freed me from many defensive mechanisms. The funny thing about being what you need in your life is that a: you’ll experience it anyway because you’re embodying it, b: you’re not depending on others for it which releases you from a victim mindset and c: people will respond to it positively. Not always, not everywhere, it’s not like a magical social fix... but people respond so differently to me these days than they used to when I was still so hurt and reserved.\n\nYou can feel better. And you can feel like you belong. Anger, even tho it can be very useful at times, won’t get you there. 
4	You gotta lotta venom outta you my dude, hope you at least feel better now it's out. Idk why but reading this made me think of vrchat, have you tried that? It's free and kind of a different way to socialize, you may like it! At least worth a try, but that's up to you! 
2	Going through those feelings after feeling let down or betrayed is totally normal. I love the Krishnamurti quote “It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.”\n\nYou are not alone. A lot of us feel disillusioned with the world right now. I may not agree with your politics but I can identify with your feelings of alienation.\nThings were supposed to get better with technology and progress, that was the promise right?\nInstead it looks like people treat each other with more contempt and alienation everyday.\n\nMy solution has been to put my faith in Mother Nature and the spirit world instead. To pray for guidance and wisdom from the ancestors, and stop expecting the modern world to fulfill me.\n\nIt has also helped me to write F#@k you letters, that I never send, of course. This allows me to get out my rage and work through my feelings without fear of being judged or accidentally making the problem worse. \n\nA really good supportive counselor has helped me tremendously as well.\nIt takes work, but I believe eventually you will find healing, if you keep searching and try to have faith.\n
1	Everything originates from yourself, find inner peace. Change how you perceive the world instead of blaming the world for what you perceive it to be. 
3	What would be your perfect place to live?	
2	Norway fjords or Denmark forests 
1	Anywhere warm and sunny. Probably on a tropical island next to a beach. Or on top of a building that overlooks a city.
1	Somewhere close to the mountains and the beach, the countryside and the city, very little rain, and legal marijuana. 
3	Wanted to start a thread that's a variation of a common theme here. Instead of single songs or artists, albums that you love.	We've done song threads before, but I think it would be fun to have one of entire albums as well. Something about really well made albums is special, and I tend to get attached to them.\n\nI'll throw in one I got for Christmas when I was 13 that changed how I thought about music from there on out. Kid A - Radiohead. I know Radiohead is very popular and not exactly a lesser-known gem, but this album holds such a special place in my life.\n\nHere's a link to two songs from it: Optimistic and In Limbo - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YUFDJneteU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YUFDJneteU)\n\nAs a sidenote: Thom Yorke is a rumored INFP.\n\nAdding another: I've loved all of the albums I've heard by them, but Vackatimest by Grizzly Bear is something special - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5WdKqmK9s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5WdKqmK9s)
3	I love this, I basically only listen to entire albums instead of just songs 😅.\nMy favorites:\n\nBjörk's Vespertine.\n\nNew Order's Power Corruption and Lies.\n\nAphex Twin's Richard D. James Album.\n\nBeach Fossils' Clash the Truth.\n\nBlack Marble's A Different Arrangement \n\nAnd many more lmao
3	Queen II is easily my favorite album right now. It's a masterpiece from start to end. Though I love (almost) all of Queens works.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThough out of other ones I've liked:\n\n* American Idiot\n* Wasting Light\n* To The Moon OST\n* Chuck\n* Station to Station
2	(for the moment)\n\nTransformer by Lou Reed\n\nASAP Rocky - Testing\n\nRequiem For An Almost Lady - Lee Hazlewood\n\n
2	Disturbed - Indestructible
2	Palace - So Long Forever
2	Mindless Self Indulgence - Frankenstein Girls Will Seem Strangely Sexy
2	Big fan of Jessica Pratt’s new album Quiet Signs.\n\nOne of my all time faves has got to be Max Graef- Rivers of the Red Planet. bought it on vinyl even though I’ve no record player and no intention of getting one. Tbf its a really slick album cover.\n\nAnd an oldie I’ll always go back to is Stereophonics- you gotta go there to come back. Great album but for me it’s the nostalgia factor more than anything else.\n\nAlso pretty much anything by Charles Mingus.
61	I know this is an unpopular opinion here but PLEASE : stop equating being weak/frail/inept/etc with being an INFP.	Those are not defining aspects of a personality. Those may be common among individuals with this specific type, but it is in no way a trait. 
25	I hate this stereotype too. It holds people back from becoming their best selves. 
25	I know five other INFPs and none of them fit this stereotype. They’re all rather determined, individualistic, creative and well-spoken. They may be nice and sometimes quiet but they don’t let people push them around, either. They may not make a fuss of it but they stay true to themselves regardless of outside influence. That’s what being an INFP means to me!
12	I am a warrior Queen, á la Boudicca, Joan of Arc, etc. Fuck with me and you're fucked. I never understood the trope of weakness.
7	Yes! I'm a sensitive person and that is a strength not a weakness. I hate this world for being such a callous and lifeless place so I fight back by not giving a fuck and being myself.
4	I saw a lot of it in a fb page i was in.  All these people assuming that because I'm infp that i must be on the verge of committing suicide or self harm... \nI cry at beautiful moments in life because i appreciate that there is beauty in the world not because I'm weak.  We INFPs are strength personified because we are so aware of everything and everyone. Our intuition exists so we can help ourselves and others.  Our empathy allows us to give support and a sympathetic ear... \nEverywhere i look, there is need for us to exist... so how does that make us weak? 
3	It’s not an unpopular opinion here I think. That assumption frustrates me. 
3	I've always been somewhat baffled/entertained by this assumption of weakness. In December at my sister's wedding, my grandpa drunk-cried to me about how I better be careful who I marry. "Sarah (my sister) is strong - she can handle a broken heart. You just be careful." Usually it doesn't bother me that people see me as fragile. I know myself well, and have handled things like rejection, abandonment, betrayal, grief, etc.. Do people not realize I've been through some sh*t and come out the other side just fine? Being underestimated has its perks, but it was a little disconcerting coming from someone so close to me. 
2	I see. Maybe it's that unhealthy variants of such tend to visibly express these traits. I do, and still to an extent, identify with these traits, but then again, I'm probably not on the "healthy" side of the spectrum, but, the polar opposite of these mentioned traits here repel me more than the mentioned traits.  But idk.... I think there's a part of me that likes the idea of being seen as weak or frail, yet surprising people, and showing to be quite the opposite when under duress, but that this "strength" of sorts, is not one of insecure aggression, but more of the qualities of being a solid rock, if that makes sense. 
2	I don't see how that'd be an unpopular opinion
2	completely agree! 
2	Every two months or so I see a post like yours and I always wonder where are these posts you’re talking about. Admittedly I sort by ‘hot’ so I’m not that well versed in this sub but if I would see them, I don’t think I’ll get upset like you do. It’s a phase we need to mature from and I have mostly empathy to the ones who are stuck in it. I may try to correct them but I would do it gently as I know how sensitive we are. \n\nSpeaking from personal experience here. I’m a male INFP who fought his “INFPness” in the past. I wanted to be masculine, somewhat, cynical, lighthearted and always strong. Like my ESFJ father more or less. I wanted to stand for myself like a “real man”.\nThe result- neuroticisms, depression, anxiety and feeling of self betrayal.\n\nSince then I’ve learned how to be strong in my own quiet and kind way. \n\nYour post sounds to me like an ESTJ telling me to man up. 
1	I sometimes feel like this sub has been hijacked by people who post like they know what an infp is. On some posts I can relate, on most of these posts I just don't get the warm and cuddly stuff.
29	Me, how bout you?	
3	yup sounds about right
5	"I'm in this picture and I dont like it"
2	Sameeee
2	Yup i'm messy and make weird noises.

1	Makes weird noise effects... yep
1	Yaaas
5	DAE have looow energy often? How do you manage this?	Hellooo comrades.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I live in London which, although not as climatically crappy as believed, has a mad unpredictable weather god. This past week we have been blessed with some awesome sunshine, super-charging me with a breezy buoyancy and lust for life! Anyway, the lack of sun has really put into perspective for me how much energy affects my ability to be active and productive, and how low a supply I generally have... can anyone share tips or approaches they have to managing time and tasks when they're feeling particularly inert and low? Thanks in advance x\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Lack of sun has highlighted how different I feel when low on energy, how can I get around this?
2	I'd actually suggest getting a blood test. You could be missing some vitamins, maybe vitamin D if sunshine has an impact. It could also be low blood pressure, anemia, anxiety... I don't mean overwhelm you with this, but finding out the causes of my low energy has helped me greatly.\n\nAs for solutions, there's nothing like exercise and healthy eating to boost your energy levels. A boring answer, I know, but it does work. Sometimes just drinking water or having a healthy snack helps. Also, hobbies. Do what you enjoy! 
1	Use your Ne. Do some active . Whether outside or inside .

2	Love the INFP ambassador! Great pick. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(This has probably been posted many times before, apologies!)
1	I don't know how I feel about that interpretation of my type.. but I do or did like to imagine I'm flying or driving a different more important vehicle or something when I'm in my car.. but I don't think I am as air heady as she seems... Oh god.. I can't justify this. 
1	Followed some links, didn't know who the INFP was, but she is Aurora and an amazing artist...wow. \n\nTwo videos. VERY INFP...\n\n[https://youtu.be/FqTpi7x-2fg](https://youtu.be/FqTpi7x-2fg)\n\n[https://youtu.be/wNLGztDp5DM](https://youtu.be/wNLGztDp5DM)
15	Regretting what you said or didn't say is the point of having a conversation	I often replay recent conversations about topics that are important to me and of course I often come up with more accurate and better responses to challenging questions or counter-arguments. This often causes some feeling of regret.\n\nI just realized that this is actually quite valuable. You may not have expressed yourself in the best way possible but after all, the conversation sparked some new insight and clarified your worldview.
2	Should I force myself to socialize?	Tl;dr version on the bottom.\n\nA short background: I just moved into a new country. I look obviously foreign here, but everyone seems really kind and is very helpful to me. I am taking language course to help myself to adapt more and to be able to talk to locals. Even so, I really like my own time inside home, doing art freelancing and write some short stories to myself, or perhaps publish it one day. I live with my husband at the moment and he is the main breadwinner, but I still feel like adding both of our join-saving so I have been freelancing small stuff online.\n\nSo, a kind but very extroverted friend invited- with the way of forcing me to join a community of spiritual improvement. Me, being unable to refuse, decided to give it a try, convincing myself it is good to meet new people. It was a nice experience, the people there were very kind. I had nothing bad to say about the community, it was very calming and peaceful.\n\nBut honestly, the idea of having to meet this group every week tires me. The people are nice, to the point that I cannot make any good reason to stop going there. But I realise, my problem is: every week, I dreaded the day of having that group meeting. The thing I dread the most is having to go out of home to do the meeting: to socialise and spiritual sharing. Sometimes I said I am tired (not physically though.. I guess, mentally) so I can avoid to attend the meeting. But I know it is a weak reason for the community, and I am ashamed of it.\n\nMy extroverted friend said that this meeting can untire her (and me) from our exhaustion, but this meeting for me, it is exhausting. Do I sound like I am making excuses here? I once met a member of the community in public and she is 'looking forward to me coming back'. She is very kind and gentle, and I somewhat had the feeling of wanting to go again. But when the day came near, I dreaded to go again and I felt unhappy instead.\n\nWhy am I like this? I had no reason to dislike the group, but I dread socialising a lot even when I know I need to. I am fully content and happy socialising with my husband, and many of my hometown friends (through Skype call and such) and for me it is enough socialising. But my kind, extroverted friend think I am not socialising enough and insisting me to go.\n\nTo add on the top of that: it is a paid meeting. I make random earning with my freelancing and if I am to come to the meeting, I would spend most of my freelance earning that month for the meeting, which my friend told me it is "very important" for me. This adds to my misery (if I can say that) as I really want to save up for my husband and me, even when I don't earn a lot.\n\nI am sorry if I explain it in a messy way, but it is everything connected one with another. I want to hear fellow INFPs' thought in this. Am I being too much? Am I making excuses? Should I actually force myself to socialise? Am I being weird here? If I end up deciding to go for the sake of 'pleasing others' and 'it is important to go out', I would still have the misery feeling every week and my freelancing money will go away for that as well. Is it fine if I refuse to go because I know I cannot possibly live my life, dreading the meeting every week? \n\nIs it bad to stay at home a lot and not socialising as much? Honestly?\n\nTl;dr, my extroverted friend force me to go to a weekly meeting which I have to pay to go to, because this friend told me it is 'very important for me' and 'I have to socialize'. It is a good meeting, but I always have the misery feeling every week before I go. I love to stay at home a lot. The community is very nice so I have no bad excuse not to go, the only excuse is I don't like to socialise, which I think is not appropriate to say.. Should I force myself and keep going?\n\nThank you for the input. I really appreciate it.
4	Why don’t you cut back on it? Maybe once a month?\n\nOr socialize in a way that feels meaningful and doesn’t cost you money?\n\nI also think how you feel before isn’t the best thing to judge; you really should think about how you feel after as the best indicator of how good something is.
2	Your time and money is valuable, and you should try to invest it in things that are valuable to you. This meeting has a high cost but a moderate value, so I'd suggest investing less time (since you probably can't change the price) if you feel like it's worth it.\n\nThis friend sounds a lot like my sister, who is an ESFJ. She will probably be upset or disappointed if you say you won't go and try to change your mind, so be prepared to be firm! It's ok to not want to do things you enjoy sometimes, even if it seems strange to feel that way.
2	You don’t have to if you don’t want to. I see no reason to put yourself through it unless you feel a sense of relief after because it was actually fun and it was just your anxiety talking beforehand. That’s how I tend to socialize, I check afterwards if the whole situation nets positively. If it doesn’t, I won’t do it again unless it’s things I have to do obviously.\n\nShe may tell you you need to socialize but she’s talking from her perspective. For her it’s good. For you maybe not. There’s no wrong or right there, everyone should listen to themselves in these things.\n\nPersonally I’d see if you can maybe find some people you enjoy having a cup of tea or coffee with when you and they feel like it. Seems much more healthy to me, and it would cut down on the monetary stress. You are perfectly allowed to consider the money, you should invest it in what you want. \n\nDon’t let others dictate how you should feel. Listen to how you actually feel and see if the outcome is positive for you. If not, it’s not a good option for you and that’s fine :).
40	If only reddit could save me	
3	There's no easy way out and no way to make sense of things quickly. But maybe that's the beauty of things, after all. \nDo any of you guys know what to do when you know something, but don't realise it? Because I have that. Like, all the time have that. I wonder if any INFP's have that as well
1	You ok? Need to chat? Send me a message if so.

11	I've got an addiction real bad...	God I love to play my guitar. I've been playing for about a year and a half now. This past month I've hit a huge increase in skill level and I've been blasting grateful dead concerts while jamming along and I just can't stop. I don't know where I'd be without my good old guitar!
1	Tell me about it! I play for 9 years and it's probably my main thing hahahaha
1	me with piano
14	Alright... what’s with all the idiotic 13 year old girl tumblr post every 2 mins.....	i really don’t relate to any of them and find myself cringing at it. I’ve taken multiple personality test and i always get infp, maybe cuz i’m on anti depressants. 
3	Having the following traits as the dominant ones in your decisions: introvert, intuitive, feeling, perceiving - doesn't necessarily mean anything more than that even if you took the test. You don't have to love nature or be an activist or an empathetic altruist or whatever. You are you. No personality test can tell you who you are. \n\nThe MBTI can only accurately guage 5 traits (if we include T and A). The rest can be seen as far fetched pseudoscience. Because it makes assumptions about the combination of what you checked. There's the theory of functions, but well, it's a theory. \n\nPersonally, some things were pretty accurate. And many people that are in this subreddit seem to be like-minded. \n\nAbout the 13 year old Tumblr girls, you know that's what they do. You reach early puberty and you start taking BuzzFeed quizzes and personality tests nowadays. The 16personalities site takes you with open arms no matter which one it is. The sensitive youth, especially intuitive feelers tend to be rather fragile.\n\nWhen most people take the test they feel like God has descended upon them and they're accepted now. The 13 year olds do feel very strangled and unaccepted by their surroundings. They search for communities online. And reposting something that another 13 year old made that they relate to... It makes sense. You don't have to relate. You can cringe. \n\nUnderstand that this personality test is not the personality/intellectual breakthrough that you may be looking for in your life. This is just a bonus to take with a grain of salt.\n
2	Its ok not to get it all. I don't get a lot of stuff on here, and admittedly some things are a little too much for my taste (and I agree with you, can be a bit cringe), but I can empathize with perhaps a time I might have felt that way or an age. Some people who are in a bad place just need to get that out somewhere, or if they feel something odd they just need to say it. If I don't get it, I just move along to something I do get.
2	I think too many people subscribe too strictly to everything which may be present in the box that they choose to align with, and it turns into being offended.. this is why categorizing or boxing yourself is bad, and people don't want to be boxed.. but also for some reason people want to be boxed.. it's rather frustrating and I see a lot of posts in this sub where people want to speak up about it, but it's.. rather pointless.\n\nI hope someone followed that..
2	Maybe because we're all different people. And just because we're INFPs doesn't mean we all are the same gender, age, or take anti depressants. \n\nPersonally i'm okay with posts like that because it makes me happy to know i'm my own breed of INFP.

9	Is it okay if I keep uploading my drawings here? I would love to know what you guys think.\n\nIt's a drawing inspired by Hermann Hesse's novel Steppenwolf. I could relate to him and his process so much, I thought maybe you guys could as well.\n
2	I love how clean everything looks. Also I relate with drawing cuuurves and a lot of hair.
2	I love the ink work! So happy to see someone using pen and ink :) 
7	Feeling more like a loner nowadays	As of recent, I've been feeling more and more like I just don't want to socialize. I do stuff with friends and people I genuinely have come to like, but find that I like doing stuff by myself more. I'm so much more comfortable in my thoughts than directing my energy outwards. It's not even that I'm socially anxious as a person, I just like being by myself whether I'm out in the world or inside. Anyone else feel the same? If so what's a defining  experience where you realized you're perfectly content not being around people?
3	I feel the same. I hung out with friends the other day, and couldn’t help but wish I was alone. I’m alone so often, that I’ve become so comfortable in it, and it’s safe to me.
2	I had depression in my teens years for like 5 years and now that I can look it from outside I am more comfortable with myself. What I have learnt is love for myself, taking my time and just remember it will go away on some point. \nDoing things I like bring me back to be happy not all of sudden but i have noticed that every year I get faster to shift my mood and learning psychology behind and having compassion towards myself. \nIn the starting it would take me weeks or months to get out  off it now in a day I feel better.\n\nExercise, eat healthy, nature time, having rituals helps a lot. 
2	If I could I’d stay in my room forever. Since I can’t, I spend a lot of time thinking about how I can I grow to be a giver to others without compromising myself. Cant say I’m there yet but I guess it’s part of the journey.
2	Yes, I know that most people hate being unfollowed or unfriended on social media, but do you take it especially to heart a little too much?	Because I do. I ponder for weeks, even months, why the person did that. Sometimes years
3	deleted my social media it was bad for my health, but yeah i dont get sad/offended but i think what i did wrong
2	It’s a form of social rejection, so it makes sense it could be taken very personally. The Black Mirror episode White Christmas demonstrates it well. I am sorry that happened though. As upsetting as it can be, try not to let it bother you too much. People have all kinds of reasons for doing the things they do, and we will never figure them all out. 
2	I usually just unfollow the person so i don't hurt theirs feelings, even when they screw me
1	INFP to INFJ	 \n\nI was in a conversation with a friend the other day about MBTI and the types. We were exchanging our types and ideas on them. My friend looked at me with a puzzled looked and told me he found me to be more of an INFJ than INFP. I wanted to prove to him that FP is where I have sat pretty for quite some time now so I decided to take the test again.. To my surprise the results were INFJ. My eyes were wide when I read this and of course my ENFP friend over here laughed and sipped his coffee, pleased with my results and himself.\n\nDo you guys think its common for people of these types to bounce back and forth so to say when it come to that last function?
2	The J/P scale is always kinda hard because it is often the least correlated with the cognitive functions. To be clear, the J/P are not functions per se, it only tells if the the extraverted function of your first two is a judging or perceiving one.\n\nINFP:\n\ndominant function is *introverted Feeling* (judging)*;* auxiliary function is *extraverted intuition* (perceiving)\n\nINFJ:\n\ndominant function is *introverted intuition* (perceiving); auxiliary function is *extraverted feeling* (judging)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[EII-INFj = MBTI INFP](http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=EII_Profile_by_Gulenko)\n\n[IEI-INFp = MBTI INFJ](http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=IEI_Profile_by_Gulenko)\n\nThese descriptions are from socionics, a slightly different path from Jungs psychological types. Differing function definitions and function stacks but all in all it has more similarities than differences to MBTI.\n\nI also had the problem that I could identify with both MBTI INFJ and INFP descriptions but the cognitive functions made it clear for me. Though you could also try the socionics descriptions for that matter. The EII-INFj fit much better than the EIE one.\n\n&#x200B;
4	Is it just me?	Is it just me? If someone is late I'll go through a lot of different scenarios of why they would be late, then I'll start thinking they may be doing it on purpose, and start getting mad at the person, who then shows up, and it was something normal. But I'm still kinda mad.
3	I am late myself so often so it doesn't bother me with others that much but I do go trough tons of different scenarios about everything so I guess it is not only you that overanalyse why someone is late :D 
2	My tummy gets upset when I have to wait on too long for someone or something. Like the anxiety of waiting for something doesn’t go through my head but gets manifested physically. Like I either want to vomit or go to the bathroom, it’s just weird and bothersome 
2	Yeah, but I don't get mad, I just start to panic and imagine a bunch of horrible things that may have happened. My "worst case scenario" muscles are real swole.
1	yes. my best friend always comes late and i’m always so mad at him but after 3 minutes i’m just insanely happy that he is even there xd
1	I keep getting error sending man haha 
1	 I'll either think they're doing it on purpose, or become worried something happened to them. Regardless, when they inevitably show up late for a normal reason, I'm just relieved
50	Joining in on the picture sharing :) took this yesterday	
3	Breathtaking ^^ what a nice mood
3	Yess road pictures are my mood
3	Incredible.  \n\nTook a gander at your Instagram. \n\nWow.  \n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what equipment do you use for your photography?  
2	Wowwww

6	Unfollowed her on Instagram.	A long-term on and off crush followed me on Instagram when I made a new account a couple months ago. I'm someone who obsesses over things, and overanalyzes things where I don't need to. And I felt like having her on social media meant that I was clinging on, even if I may have convinced myself that I was doing otherwise. I'm sure I'll still think about her for a little while, but if there's one thing I've learned in love and war, it's that the things you want most in life will come to you when you least expect them. \n\nIsn't it funny how that works out? Being desperate for love only makes you more likely to not get it. But if you focus on yourself and treat yourself like you're the prize, like you don't need other people to fill that emotional, lonely void in you, you'll be the right guy/girl, and stumble into the right person.\n\nI'm a believer in fate. While I don't believe in soul mates, I do believe anyone who's meant for you will come to you eventually. And I think that in society, we idealize or over embellish love. Could it be that as I mentioned before - we love that feeling of being in love, because it helps fill that void of unhappiness in us? I'm not saying that it's not natural to want love, but it just seems like we over romanticize it.\n\nAnyway, before I ramble on further, I just wanna say that as melodramatic as it seemed - I did cry when I did it. I guess because it seemed like I was "killing her off in my head". There's just something about letting go that's so difficult. And even if it's just a minor gesture - unfollowing her - it still felt huge. No resentment or disrespect on my end, and I feel like she'll always have a soft spot in my heart, but there's no point in dwelling or being pressed for her, in the hopes that maybe one day she'll feel the same way. \n\nThat only happens in fiction. We live in the real world.
4	There’s always difficulty in letting people go. It’s okay. You must do what’s necessary for yourself. 
2	I felt nothing when I recently deleted my Facebook account of 12 years. Then I realised that I won't be able to see my crush (photo) anymore and finally shed some tears. She's the reason I created a Facebook account in the first place.
1	why didn't you talk to her and see if she liked you?
1	You inspired me to unfollow my old crush. It's way past time...
0	Eh hundreds of children die in Jemen everyday. You will be fine, try to not obsess over these things. 
2	What do you regard as pretentious? We can all agree that the compulsive need to sound poetic at all times can come off as pretentious, but can art in itself be pretentious? I'm curious to what you all think. The way I see it, as long as its honest; is it really pretentious?	
2	Art is in no way in and of itself pretentious. I see pretentiousness as valuing yourself as being much better than others around you and it shows through choices of language and demeanor around others. Occasionally I will do or say something that’s very pretentious like explain meanings of song lyrics in ways that don’t really make a lot of sense but sound fluffy and people will call me out. Sometimes I’m regarded as pretentious because i’m that one guy not talking to people when i’m in a large group. It’s just the personality. 
1	I guess it depends on humans. I often speak loudly on topics that people don't talk that often.  They fear because it could be taboo or "embarassing" or they just don't have much experience on that field. To these people I sound pretentious or condescending to them. I even felt guilty sometimes but it changed. What can I do that I perceive and see the world I see? I only learned to phrase my toughts and ideas better. \nHowever there are pretentious people. I think what it means that you do things only just because it will induce specific reactions. Like I will say that religion sucks just because I know it will bring attention to me or something like that.
2	Daily INFP random discussion thread - March 01	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
8	I had the most beautiful dream last night. I had a girlfriend, but not just any girlfriend, she was gorgeous and silly. We joked around and danced together at random places. Even in my dreams I thought this was too good to be true and I kept trying to pinch myself or do things to test if it was a dream. \n\nNow that i'm awake i'm sad, but also happy. Happy that maybe one day I will meet her, the girl I danced with in the middle of the street.\n\nEdit: Yeah sorry if that was random, I just thought you all would understand this bittersweet moment I just had. Now back to reality :/ 
3	This doesn't really pertain to anything in my life in particular, but I'm curious. Is it okay to keep secrets in a relationship (family, friends, SO)? Like are there general levels as to when it's okay or not?
1	Anyone 30+ in this sub?\n\nOr am I seriously all alone....
1	I feel like Bohemian Rhapsody was good but not as good as people said it was. I kinda wanted more of a personal story focused on Freddie, but it felt kinda slapdash in a lot of ways. 
66	Aberystwyth, surreal	
5	>surreal\n\nAgreed. It's crazy how there's a humongous Nuclear fusion reactor just floating around in space and we're just slowly rotating around it and using the energy generated from it. "Reality is crazier than your wildest dreams" - Me\n\n&#x200B;
3	Ayyy Wales! I moved to Manchester from Wales recently for uni and goddamn I miss all the nature and beauty. 
2	What kind of clubs have you all joined?	I ask because I joined an anime club, because of course. :P
2	While I have personally never joined a proper club, I found myself LOVING working on the scenery of a school play last year. My school didn't really have that many clubs, but debating and MUN were fun, even if I barely participated.\n\nNow that Im on college I hope to find some more stuff to do, but Im just trying not to fail and learn how to manage my time atm.
2	i don't even know what a club is. As far as i know we don't have that in Spain at places such as college or school
2	Chinese studies
2	Book club baby.
2	My favorite thing close to a club was being a DJ at my college radio station.  Got to listen to, discover, and share a lot of music with other people and made a bunch of friends with similar interests.
5	Sorry?	I was thinking today, and I know it runs in our circle to struggle with mental health, I feel like someone needs to say sorry for our countries letting us down, we don’t get the attention or funding yet millions of people choose to end their own lives, so yeh sorry I guess. If you have been let down or had to wait weeks for counselling you needed that second or didn’t have the money to get help it couldn’t afford the medication they peddle us, they aren’t going to apologise so I might as well do it. 
4	It's OK, someday having mental health problems will be treated as any other health issue 🤞our societies are just learning, its up to everyone who's been let down to speak up and change all the prejudices, one person at a time. 
10	i've been following this subreddit for a week now because my boyfriend is an INFP. it's nice that i get an insight into his mind, and i feel a lot of memes here is how he feels irl	there was a post about the best ways to show love to an INFP is to basically do stuff they care deeply about with them, even if you're not into it. oh and being very physically affectionate. both of which he absolutely loves and i'm being more aware to do these things. i'll occasionally send him screenshots of posts/memes here and he'll completely agree with it\n\ni'm an ESFJ and i wish our subreddit was as active as this one :(\n\nbut thanks all, i'll continue watching from afar
56	Spring hype! Its coming! Wish you all great green adventures! :) and soul lifting experiences in nature!

1	ENFP + INFP Relationships	
4	Did I get played?	So recently I crashed my car. I was driving too far on the side of the road while turning, skidded out and annihilated the front. Bent the chassis, the front light and the bumper came off. The car was given to me as a present by my father, something I wasn't expecting as I'd been saving up to buy my own and this was a beautiful gift. So it had a lot of sentimental value. When I crashed I wasn't worried that I could've died, I was immediately disappointed that I'd ruined something my dad gave me.\n\nA mechanic who drinks at the pub I work at immediately went to go see it, told me I could get it repaired but it'd probably be as much as paying for a new car. Now I really like this mechanic; when I thought my engine fumes were leaking into my car, he was there first thing in the morning to check it out. When he heard I crashed he went down there immediately to take a look and picked it up. \n\nHe said he'd get it scrapped but he'll need the log book - at this point I'm borrowing a friend's car which I had to borrow £1000 to get insured and taxed - I give him the log book, then a couple of days later he says that just as he was about to take the car to the scrap, his mechanic friends say they could probably bend the chassis back. So he did, it worked and that now he'll replace the bumper, the lights, sell his cars and use mine until he's saved enough to buy his own.\n\nNow he's coming to the pub in my car. Parking it there and I can't help but feel so angry about it but also I'm not sure if it's wrong. He told me he was going to do it like it's not a big deal, so I feel like I'm missing something... Is it because Ive got my own car now? That I wouldn't have been able to repair it without him anyway? My INFP-ness can't get around that he doesn't feel like he's a bad guy for it, so I can't think he's a bad guy..I'm pretty sure he's nice. I've seen him as a nice person for a while with the odd dickishness.\n\nPeople think I should call the police or demand my keys back but I don't know... 
3	I would say something and be very angry. He probably thinks because you are young you will not do anything.
1	You can sit down with him and have him explain what his plan/intention with the car is, maybe there is something that is being miscommunicated. I don't know much about cars either but it does sound fishy. And maybe your dad who bought you the car can give you insight too so if you do need to be a bit more confronting with your mechanic friend you can be confident that there's another person who agrees with you.
1	He took the car? Do you not still legally own it then? 
1	What kind of car was it?
782	I feel personally attacked	
61	I like to smell nice for me, not for other people 
22	I laughed a little because it is so true. I go out so rarely that sometimes i just pretend that I am so i can do all the preps like shaving etc which i wouldnt do but it feels nice sometimes.
35	Still important to practice self care, take care of yourself for you and no one else regardless if you’re going out or not!
15	Ah don't be it is true :) Just shower and read :) It's better than people anyways. 
13	I like to smell good for me!
9	Haha joke's on them- my sense of smell is very sensitive so I go unscented as much as possible anyway, being perfumed bothers me.
11	[deleted]
5	I love this! XD great sense of humor 
5	Haha. I like those shades of blue though. 💙
5	Might i get the link? Scientific purposes..
3	That can't be true, it smells like brown and blue.
2	Really gave me a good laugh! I think I need this soap around just to make me laugh 😁.
2	Wait a minute, I recognize that brand wrapping. Is it from a store in Ann Arbor? 
2	It's probably great for people with skin sensitivities 
2	oof
1	That made me giggle. Thank you for sharing!
1	The soap knows what's up 
1	That's hilarious 
1	Pfffft because we don't stink as much as ppl who go outside. \n\nIt's better to use unscented soap anyway. 
1	Well.. okay. If you insist I will stay at home. 
9	Does my Instagram make me seem like I’m an INFP?	This is just for fun haha. I saw another girl do this and hers gave off infp vibes if you know what I mean. I don’t think mine really does honestly. But, just curious! https://www.instagram.com/florangelkay/
10	If you're an INFP, I'd guess you're assertive, because the only INFPs I know are turbulent and have like 3 photos on their insta and theyre not actually in any of them! I'd sooner guess ISFP maybe? You've got a bit of an INFP vibe but you seem pretty grounded in reality
4	idk does mine?\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lance3015/\n:p\n\n—\n\ni dont think it is like people will look through your photos and be like „woah what is that feeling i am getting of these. its so unique. its so ... oh its so infp“ :D\n\nor is it?\n\nto be honest you do not look as basic as most girls , more like someone who is a whole wonderful world to discover, who is worth the time to get to know, you look naturally pure and cheerful, and as if you understand/feel the world in its true form.\n\nor maybe its just because i know you are an infp haha\n\nno srsly INFPs are the best <3
2	Más como una ISFP, pero luego vi tu sonrisa sincera y como tocabas el piano (y guitarra) y ya no tengo tantas dudas, parece que te inclinabas más al lado intuitivo. \nQuizá porque sabes tomar muy MUY buenas fotos y sales muy bien me vinieron dichas dudas. \n\n(Vi que eras de Venezuela, así que este ENTJ peruano decidió escribir en español)\n
2	Yeah definitely got infp vibes from your insta. Musically gifted✔️ soft smiles ✔️ extremely modest yet sophisticated ✔️  
2	This is fun! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nISFP and/or ESFP vibes (you seem to be with a lot of different people, making the I vs E difficult to place). Lots of Se shown through experience and physicality. You seem stylish, which is also often associated with Se in the top four slots. The page seems more Ni than Ne as well because none of the pictures seem random and/or out of place. It looks like a well thoughtout arrangement. You also seem happy and spontaneous in most of the pics and/or look like you're having fun, which throws huge SP vibes generally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would second whoever said INFPs would likely be more hidden on Instagram. FaceBook would be different though because you have the ability to monitor who (mostly friends and family) sees what more so than on Instagram. 
2	Hmmmm...you have some INFP vibes but overall your page seems more ESFP
2	I'm sorry but to me you look fake.. like something is off. Perhaps you arent as happy as your IG shows?
2	I was going to say no, but the pictures where you're sipping a drink and chilling up in nature definitely triggered my INFP feelies.
1	You seem more S, no eerie blurred stuff lol, so many confident looking pictures of you... *with other people x\_x...* :3
2	Anyone has any experience about relationships/friendship with an ESFP as a INFP?	I'm curious about other people experiences and see if it's common to have specific problems between you and the other person. 
2	My mom. It's a lot of me (INFP) playing therapist/idea wall. On good days lol we both dig food tho
2	I am typed as an INFP and I have a close ESFP friend. We both don’t like the mbti typing thing because some people dwells too much into it that they reject some people just because they see that they’re incompatible types to be together. But I do love my ESFP friend, we call ourselves dudes hahah and what I like about it is that we both respect each other despite of us being introvert and the other extrovert.\n\nThe thing that I don’t like though is that how YOLO her motto in life is that sometimes I find it stupid and just reckless and that despite of giving advices sometimes, she still goes on her way and then I’ll be like, “you didn’t listened to me dude. Ugh” we’re also honest to the point we insult each other sometimes but it doesn’t break our friendship, it just strengthens it because we don’t like the fake stuff. It’s a fun friendship btw. 
2	as for friends, it takes months of mutual emotional understanding and trust in order to become well established friends. at that point, they sort of tone things down and the friendship becomes a lot more casual (although the mutual understanding is almost a guarantee that the friendship will not end easily)
1	I often hang out with an ESFP girl, then we often do things using hands or body like sports which she likes and I don’t like. But also we often talk about what and how we feel and think things. She says talking about those things is very hard and she doesn’t wanna do that because she is not good at it, but also she says she can do it and have fun when she is being with me because I can help it. So in our friendship, we both try to let each other does what each other wants to do so we both can have fun while hanging out. Also I always tell her things what I feel about her honestly and try to solve problem together, she also does that to me. That’s why we don’t have any problems but actually our style is totally different so if ESFP or INFP stops caring about counterpart, probably friendship gets worse. Because ESFP likes sharing the time or experience while having fun but INFP likes things interesting and meaningful which ESFPs are not interested in so much.I’m not native English speaker so this could be difficult to understand but I hope you understand what I mean.
85	Just did this with my wall. I figured you guys may appreciate it.	
2	A bit too crowded for my taste. I would put it on the interior back side of a cupboard while still able to open it, and do so when in need of some good, but personally inquired inspiration.
2	Amazing !!
2	I DO appreciate that OP! Great job!

2	I work on my craft 6-8 hours a day but I never feel like im doing enough	I struggle with perfectionism so this might be the cause of it. I draw 6-8 hours a day, on an average day its 4 hours study drawing (boxes, anatomy, gesture, construction), and 2-4 hours a day working on personal drawings which mostly consists of me rendering because I like longer drawings. Ive kept up this pace for the last few months since I decided I wana pursue art, ive only been drawing 7 months prior to taking it seriously so Im behind most others my age pursing the field (im 21). I am progressing fast but I feel like I should be doing more, I never feel like im doing enough, I feel this impending doom before every life drawing class, for example I have an uninstructed life drawing thing on friday and I feel this impending doom of failure that can only be resolved if I study anatomy for 8 more hours and even then it wont feel like enough.\n\nI do like the work I do and I am proud of it, and I think I work hard, its just I wana be great, not just good. So I never feel at peace, I dont know if this anxiety is the price I have to pay for the drive to be great or If I can have my cake and eat it too?
2	Well you’re probably good enough now that a lot of people would tell you that you’re a very talented and excellent artist.  Obviously those people can’t see the potential you see in yourself.  You gotta chill out and start practicing enjoying your craft.  If your focus is set on improving you will miss the learning journey you’re on - this is usually the period where many artists create their most fine and original works.  You aren’t some magician and you don’t have magical powers - you’re gonna learn at a steady and slow rate like everybody else.  You’ll never be good enough for yourself, and you’ll spend your life improving and improving and improving - and if you don’t chill out and enjoy your craft more you will miss out on the most meaningful aspect of your art.\n\nAlso, you want to be great not just good?  Those terms are so stupidly arbitrary.  I know you in your mind know where that line is, but it’s just nonsense.  You’ll improve steadily as you practice, and even if you paint the next Mona Lisa I doubt you’ll feel like a great artist because as your fans crowd around your masterpiece you will scoff and tell them about all the weaknesses in it that only you know about.\n\nEnjoy your craft.  Pursue your craft.  Don’t worry about how quickly you’re progressing, make art that you want to make.  Don’t compare yourself to others and their progress, and for the love of God don’t expect perfection from yourself - you wont find it and you’ll be disappointed.  You practice like a madman, your improvement will come and it will come quickly.  Be patient with yourself, and don’t let anything spoil the unending joy you should feel from pursuing what you love.  I wish you the best.  :)\n\nOne more thing.  I reread your post.  You’re still in school right?  Why the hell should you expect perfection, you haven’t even finished your instruction yet.  Fuck perfection, fuck it in the face, it’s bonkers for you to both want to learn such a complex craft and also be afraid of messing up.  YOU NEED TO FAIL!  People learn far more from their mistakes than from their successes.  Also, its pretty stupid for a person who maybe has only studied art for a grand total of a year to be obsessed with perfection.  You are supposed to be learning, and yet you seem frustrated that you just can’t be great.  Chill out dear friend.  Learn.  Learning is not performing.  Learning is not being the best.  Learning is not excelling past your classmates.  Learning is about knowing your limitations and working to overcome them and it takes a long time and a lot of work to make progress.  You’ve probably made a ton of progress, and you’ll learn more as time goes by.  Be proud of what you know now, do the best work you can, but you’re not a wizard, you’re not gonna be a pro if you haven’t put in the time.  And I don’t mean per/day time, I mean it just takes a lot of years to get any good at this stuff.  I bet you make some pretty damn impressive art right now, I wish the best dear friend.  :)\n\nEdit: holy shit I read your posts and apparently you are a magician.  That’s so badass.
9	Discussion thread: Thoughts on dating as it relates to being INFP and MBTI?	I'd like to hear about any of your experiences, whether you've dated a lot or a little.\n\nI've had a lot of dates/relationships over the years (for context, I'm in my 30s), and I do notice certain patterns, but as I've gotten older I haven't dated much at all. I find the dating scene to be thoroughly unenjoyable since there's no longer a novelty to it for me. I think the "newness" of it all was what kept me interested in my teens and 20s. I now feel like I'm almost too picky, in a sense, because my level of tolerance for behavior I don't like is so low.\n\nI do find very weird patterns in the people I date. Ones that I really can't quite explain. I've dated a lot of actors, for example. I've dated musicians, but they were ALL metal enthusiasts. The most bizarre recurring theme has to be the body builders. I'm not particularly athletic, but I've ended up with a lot of people who were into competitive weight lifting or things like that. Got me really into watching strong man competitions for a while.\n\nMy longest relationship, I realize now, was with someone who was a friend but there was no real sexual attraction there. I was only 18 when we started dating and didn't really understand how relationship dynamics work yet. We were together for three years and I broke it off for three reasons: 1) We never did anything new. It was like clockwork and it got very dull. 2) My ex's friends had very strong conservative ideals about gender and country. They were starting to get really into the idea of "a woman's place" and my ex slowly started gravitated that way too. It didn't sit well with me, as I was starting to realize that I felt strongly about gender culture not being so black and white. 3) My ex was turning into a bit of what would now be called a "neckbeard" stereotype. He once made me feel bad for weighing 125 pounds at 5 foot 3 because, when he met me, I was more around 118. He talked a lot about how college girls were and how I needed to be careful before I turned into a college girl stereotype. He was also mean to my friends, and my friends told me they didn't like how he seemed so condescending to me and them. Have no clue what he would have tested for MBTI.\n\nTo balance out with a positive story: My favorite more recent relationship was very short but very nice. It ended with no hard feelings and I think having someone there to care at the time was what we both needed for a little. Interestingly enough, this was before I did MBTI and this guy mentioned that he tested ENFP. He was having a hard time getting over his ex for sure, but we had a lot of fun hiking and going to farmers markets in the meantime. We enjoyed each other's company for sure.\n\nAdding one more story: My biggest fish that got away told me he was an ENTP. This was right about the time I took my first MBTI test in a class so I kinda knew what that meant but not really. We never ran out of things to talk about which was awesome, but I was too scared to ask him out. He was really smart, if a bit too blunt sometimes. I don't know why with him I would have felt so bad about being rejected. It just would have been utterly disappointing. He also seemed flirty with everyone, so things that seemed like flirting might not really have been. He also seemed charming enough to have no trouble with dating so I figured the competition was too much if that makes sense.\n\nJust my ramblings to add to the convo. I'd love to hear more from y'all to see if there are any similarities or differences.
6	I dated an ENFP on and off for two years and it's been the hardest to get over. I felt so incredibly understood, so loved (he was VERY verbal and physical in his affection towards me), we communicated on the same wavelength and always made each other laugh. Ultimately though I think because we were so similar it broke us (and we both had some emotional issues, I would say me moreso). But I never met anyone more dedicated and wholesome, yet still had a good backbone. He was incredibly immature when it came to life, but very emotionally mature when it came to dealing with me. A lovely fucking guy. I think about him daily.\n\nDated someone else who I think was probably an INFJ (which was usually nice although he suffered from severe depressive episodes), and a slew of INTPs (which I just cannot. They're robots and we never mesh).\n\nSTILL WAITING FOR MY ENFJ.\n\nI get what you mean about the pickiness. I feel like it's really hurt my relationships and dating in general is hard because we're such intense idealists. IT'S GOTTA BE PERFECT OR IT'S NOT GONNA FLY.
5	My first ex, and the longest relationship is with an ENFP. We are still friends. I feel like she really knows me. Whenever I get upset I talk to her, because she got a way to calm med down. Always, I'm really grateful for that. She can feel with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy most recent ex is an ENTP.  And yeah, she got a really flirty personality. Almost every guy in school thought she was flirting with them. Most of them even tried to date her but no one suceeded.  After one year of friendship I fell in love with her. She had the same feelings for me. Crazy amount of confidence and selfrespect in that girl, really strong boundaries. I've never felt so great and insecure at the same time by dating someone.  Still healing from the breakup. I really miss my bestfriend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut seriously, how do we date? I feel like through friendship is optimal. The thing is I don't have any available  or potential friends that could lead to something. I don't go to school right now. Tinder? I can only focus all of my energy into on person if it gonna be genuine. And I kind of want it to be genuine .\_.
4	I dated a lot in my 20s.  Like you found, some patterns appeared.  Some patterns were superficial (left-handed blondes), others were actually worth self-reflection and deeper understanding (controlling or short-tempered).  Until I figured out why I was drawn to women like that, the pattern would repeat.  Grew past it, then I no longer found myself attracted to them.  I've seen enough of that to now question any attraction I feel.  What is it about her that draws my attention?  If it seems benign, then ok.  If instead it seems to be because of some imbalance within myself, I work on that instead.\n\nRelationships are good for discovering what about ourselves is problematic - yet we often see conflict as a reason to point a finger at the other person.  Even if we learn not to blame and to take full responsibility, it makes a big difference *how* the other person works with us to get past the problems.  So it turns out compatibility is more important than attraction.\n\nThe pickiness you describe could probably also be stated as self-respect.  You won't date someone you know is __ because you've done that before and know better now.  So what if he has good qualities or is good looking?  You know it won't work out, so you don't waste your time.  That is just self-respect.
4	Yeah I've definitely noticed a thread of similarities. \n\nMen I dated casually almost always ended up being ENTJ. It's because the confidence pulled me in, but we clashed too much to last.\n\nMen I fell in love with came from both ends of the spectrum, so its shown me that love is not about type, it's a choice. \n\nLongest unrequited love was ENFJ, longest relationship was ISTJ, and my current relationship that feels like a dream right now is ENFP.\n\nI like confident extroverts who are sweet sweet sweet. I adore sweetness. 
3	I am a 24y/o INFP female and my longest relationship was with an INTJ male of the same age which started when I was 17. This was also the first time i heard about the MBTI. In that relationship of close to 5 years, I felt like we understood each other well and I was his first love but things didn't work out due to eventual personality clashes of sorts and family drama unfortunately. I was sure that he and I would get married because of how long and invested we were into the relationship.. :/\n\nAfter that, when I was 22 I had dated an ENFP guy over long distance for a little under a year. He was older than me by 12 years and in the beginning it felt like we had everything in common. Unfortunately he lacked maturity and responsibility somehow and so i disliked that quite a bit. I think he was also suffering from bipolar disorder which was very difficult for me to adapt to and eventually he treated me very badly so the relationship had to end.\n\nMy most recent relationship was with an INFP male who was one year younger than me and this lasted for a little under a year as well. In the beginning i thought we had the most amazing connection and i felt like I was understood. I was also ridiculously physically attracted to him which is not something I think much about in relationships as I normally just value personalities in general. In the beginning of this relationship, I felt like it was finally the end of my search, but then family drama occurred and he was gracious in offering to let me live with him to reduce my suffering. It ended on relatively bad terms because of incompatibility for living together and daily lifestyle and because it was my first experience with living with a significant other, im personally the most discouraged by the failure of this relationship and think that I personally will need a lot of time to heal or I may just forget about relationships in general due to personal trauma :(\n\nDating is hard and despite the fact that I value relationships more than anything in this whole entire world, sometimes I guess we just have to cope with ourselves and hope that we never have to settle for less than our ideals, even if our ideals are perfection.
2	Yes, the amount of actors with hyper high sexual energy that I attract is incredible. But since Im a musician I had very boring dates with other musicians since they were so close minded about this art. Also for some particular reason I atract the yuppie logical extrovert for some reason and they usually get really offended by my chill-stoner 0 drama vibes.\n\nI just ended a relationship with an ENTP who drained my patience with his controlling behavior. It s so painful to fall in love with someone who loves you but speaks almost a different language. Thats the only relationship I had in my 27 years. Anyway, my english is broken so Im gonna take a 2hrs break.
2	Put me in the dating a little category. Very little. Ok none at all. Everyone makes it seem so easy.
2	I was with my ex husband for 7 years (married for 2) and it literally killed a piece of my soul. I dont know his MBTI type, but he was very cold and emotionally distant. I would ask him often, “do you even feel emotions?” He also never wanted to be intimate and affection is so incredibly important to me. Towards the end I felt so hollow and desensitized. I will never be with someone who is that emotionally unavailable again.\n\nMy next boyfriend was suuuuper affectionate and it was fantastic. Unfortunately he had a lot of growing up to do so I just recently ended it.\n\nRight now I’m not interested in dating. I have noticed that all my serious relationships have been with people I’ve known for a long time that blossom into relationships. I’m definitely not opposed to Bumble. Never tried Tinder. \n\nI’ve also never dated two guys at the same time. Even if I was just casually dating them I would feel like I’m doing something wrong. Or maybe I just simply don’t have the energy to keep up with dating multiple guys at the same time. \n
2	I'm in the end stages of a relationship with an ISTJ I love dearly but we know we are not "the one" for each other. We've both been putting off the breakup because we are so emotionally dependent on each other but when I move away for a new job we know it will happen. We've been dating since we were both 17 and now 23 year olds and have never gone through something like this. My relationship sounds eerily similar to the one you describe in your second paragraph. \n\nWho do you talk to when you are single? He is my best friend and the first person I tell everything to. The typical INFP in me doesn't want to bother my friends and family with the types of conversations I have with my SO. I can't remember what I did when I was single, share more with friends? Or just not share as much at all.
21	Self Discovery and introduction	 Hi guys,  \n\n\nI'm a guy, 38, french, software developer and recently took some personality tests.  \nI discovered that I'm INFP.  \n\n\nAfter reading some things about this personality category, I almost totally recognize myself in it.  \n\n\nEasily emotional, tears in the eyes while listening to intense music or movies.  \nI'm working in a 4 developers open-office.  \nOne year ago, we had a new colleague in the team. Sympathetic, but extremely noisy and a really heavy, crappy sense of repetitive humor.   \nTalking to himself loud. Whistling. Singing.  \nAlways commenting conversations, even if not asked to.  \n\n\nI asked him a few times if he coud stop talking loud and it worked for a few weeks, but he can't help.\n\nAnd I don't want to be seen as the man who always feels disturbed.  \n\n\nWell, after 12 years in this small company, I decided to leave. Not only because of him, he's not the root cause ; but part of it anyway.  \n\n\nTwo months before I leave, time is long when you're waiting for something :)  \n\n\nAnyway, I feel better now because I know that I'm certainly not alone to feel that way.  \n\n\nHi to you all guys !  \n\n\nNico 
16	Hello. For your next job you can introduce yourself as an INFP. If it doesn't go well you can explain "INFP means I'm the New French Programmer".
3	Sweet! You go!
3	Best of luck in your new ventures! :) my husband is also an INFP developer, and he feels alone sometimes. Glad to see others are out there! :D I think your creativity has to help in development, and the idealism is always good, in my opinion! 
2	Hey mah man ! Turns out i'm not the only INFP French dev around these parts :D\n\nBest of luck to you ! Here's to hoping your next job will go extra smooth :)
2	Greetings from a 41 y/o INFP guy.  I'm also in software engineering (except i'm a tester that wishes he had the coding skills to be a developer).   I work from home, which was great the first few years, but I think it's slowly driving me insane.   Your loud talking and whistling colleague sounds annoying, but there's a part of me that yearns to be in an office with someone like that.   The only person to annoy me is myself and that's not good haha.  I do have a team, as my company practices scrum, but it's just not the same when you never see any of them face to face.  Are you going to pursue another software engineer job or are you thinking of trying a different career path?
2	26 y/o infp girl. \n\n*says "hello" in silence*
5	Being an INFP and working as a theater actress...feel like Jekyll and Hyde...	Seriously, no one would guess that this is what I do as a first impression. What the hell happens when I am on stage? Also, auditioning is a torture, unless they happen on my scarce loud caffeinic crazy days. 
2	I super love theater. Maybe because I don't like the limelight on my personal life, but give me a mask and baby watch me shine! \n\nSo awesome! How long have you been in this field??
2	Well... Oh, I remember once  \nwhen we were in the city...  \n...we tried doing an improvisation...you know,  \nthe kind that I used to do in New York.  \nUh, everybody was supposed to be  \non an airplane...  \n...and they've all learned from the pilot  \nthere's something wrong with the motor.  \nBut what was unusual  \nabout this improvisation...  \n...was that two people who  \nparticipated in it... Fell in love.  \nThey've, in fact, married.  \nAnd when we were...  \nYeah, out of fear...  \n...of being on this plane,  \nthey fell in love...  \n...thinking they were going to die  \nat any moment.  \nAnd when we went to the forest,  \nthese two disappeared...  \n...because they understood  \nthe... The experiment so well...  \n...that they realized that to go off together  \nin the forest was much more important...  \n...than any kind of experiment  \nthe group could do as a whole.  \nSo, uh, about halfway  \nthrough the week...  \n...we stumbled into  \na clearing in the forest...  \n...and the two of them  \nwere fast asleep in each other's arms.  \nIt was around dawn,  \nand we put flowers on them...  \n...to let them know we'd been there,  \nand then we crept away.  \nAnd then on the last day of our stay  \nin the forest, these two showed up...  \n...and they shook me by my hands,  \nand they thanked me very much...  \n...for the wonderful work  \nthey'd been able to do, you see.  \nThey understood what it was about.  \nI mean, that, of course, poses  \nthe question of what was it about.  \nBut it has...has something  \nto do with living.  
2	Ugh YES! This is why I inevitably had to not pursue theatre. I couldn't push past my audition fears. But being on stage is so fulfilling. Taking over a role and becoming the character is some therapeutic shit.
1	Why, because you are in front of a crowd?  It seems that wearing the mask of a character would ease the anxiety.  Far more stressful to be *yourself* in front of that crowd.  Or is this not so?
5	Hi fellow INFPeople, what music genre, type, or song, just "does" it for you?	I am enjoying a song callled clocks by Niklas Aman it always gives the brain power a boost.  I have found I can only enjoy music that has little to no speaking so instrumentals are my fav.  Any music with layers and fusion of sounds and tones always gets my mind and spirit so busy. Like vaporwave, ambient, and anything from metal to hip hop.  Each type is for a different mood.  But almost all are non vocal How bout you folks?
6	Most of the time it's the more melodic electronic music (Illenium, MitiS etc.) to keep my spirits up. Recently also a alot more of the more weird and creative type of electronic (ZES, Taska Black, Lorn). Also Ambient and Chillstep if I was around many different people for too long to recharge (Jacoo - Withering   is one of my favourites). I also like some K-Pop bands.
2	I like opera for focusing on the quality of the voice. Probably the quality of sound is the best general statement I can make. Sometimes I need the energy of a form (Queen, etc etc), or the playfulness within musical and lyrical elements (Stephen Sondheim), pure genius (Ravel, Rachmaninoff, Satie), or an iconic spell (Dark Side of the Moon), creativity (Herbie Hancock), my playlist is the most eclectic I know of. I'm suggestible. Suggest something :) 
2	Aaaah, There's too many to count. It ranges from Vocaloid to Owl City, to K-pop and J-pop, to complextro, big room, electro-ish music in general, then There's anime and game music, Vexento, Icona pop, T.A.T.U, the Pet Shop Boys.\n\nAnd a whole lot more so I'm not going to bore you with even more.😹
2	Really depends on the mood. That's why I have around 50 playlists with different themes and genres on my spotify ha ha (I actually began doing that with 8tracks.com, those playlists were badass).
2	I’m really into alternative r&b now .. Solange Daniel Caesar Sabrina Claudio .. HER.. \n\nSummer walker - girls need love too . \n\n
2	This song is all I have mostly listened to for the past 6 months. Its the best song I've ever heard, and it did something to my soul. Paul Brady is a master musician, and I hope his interpretation of this song touches you the way it did mine:      \n\nhttps://youtu.be/cBGkhPx529g
2	same. i love a lot of electronic genres most people that is ask about never heard of.\nfor me music is about music and freedom of imagination and feelings it gives to you, and not about someone singing about something.\nfor every mood there is a perfect fitting genre :)\n\nand yess the last months im hard into vaporwave <3 \n\n—\n\nwhat brings me the most placidity is probably\nambient intelligent jungle (like the label Omni Music UK)\n\ni got to love breakcore last year. some years ago i couldnt have imagined to ever enjoy such chaotic  styles, but here i am. (venetian snares, the flashbulb, ruby my dear, squarepusher, enduser, ...)\n\nfrom the music that can be labeled as a genre my last few years favorites were:\nDrumfunk,\nHalftime,\nLoFi House,\nUnderground Dubstep,\nBassline Garage,\nLiquid Funk,\nVaporwave,\nBass House,\nChillhop,\nRaggaDub,\nBreakcore,\nPsy Trance,\nHard Techno,\nDrum&Bass,\nCrossbreed,\nIntelligent/Ambient Jungle,\nNew Retro Wave,\nNeuro Hop,\nRiddim,\nSpeed Garage,\nUK Garage,\nCyberwave,\nNuDisco,\nFuture Bass,\nJump Up,\nHybrid Trap,\n...\n\ni also really appreciate music that is very experimental and that i cant even categorize. when its pure noise, ambience, glitches...\ni just call it „musical colors“ :D\n\n
2	Taro by Alt-J
1	Sublime and Some Grateful Dead after a good toke up
1	Wardruna - Helvegen
1	This city is killing me- dusty brown\nDlz- tv on the radio\nJane doe- converge\n\nThese are usually my go to songs if Im feeling super emotional. I listen to just about anything except country. I’d say my favorite music is super chill ambient electronic music. 
1	*Ludovico Einaudi* anyone? 
1	Soundtracks from movies and games. In music I get more caught up with the melody than the lyrics.
1	Lounge and melodic progressive house. Mmmmmm.....
1	I really like Twenty One Pilots.
16	I wrote this poem instead of working on my paper that’s due Tmr	It’s 8 am an the sun shines bright outside \nshut the fuck up birds I hope you die \n\nAlarm clock buzz and I’m in bed \nVoice in my head say I’m better off dead \n\nTalentless hopeless no aptitude \nShit I’m hungry where the fast food\n\nI try to be a stand up guy \nBut at the end of the day I \nFeel like a small fry \n\nLooming depression yup it hangs over me \nMy brain never skips an opportunity\nTo constantly remind me of my inadequacy\n\nUtterly hopeless dystopian\nShit talker in my head trying to rope me in \n\nLungs expanding but I still can’t breath \nPlease god set me free and let me be me \n\nHow can I escape? nowhere to run\nNowhere to hide \n\nHow can I play it cool when I’m dead inside? \n\nWhat’s the remedy? \nFeels like reality’s really trying to \nSuffocate me \n\nJust can’t get this Existential dread out of my head \n\nCan’t seem to get ahead \nLet alone make it out of bed \n\nWere born we live \nThen we’re old and dead  \n\nMaybe I wasn’t destined to shine\n\nMaybe with the passage of time \nMy fruit will be ripe on that vine \n\nSorry try again \n\nBetter luck next time \n
2	A bit gloomy, but great stuff, homie! \nLove the part about wishing death on the birds lol
2	Not able to stand for something	I think this may be related to fear or a kind of distaste of becoming rooted in some fashion, and to start with, there are issues of being able to stand up for oneself. With ideas, my default is not to tear down, but to think how something may or could be, while at the same time, not being very invested within them. It's like a detached, "seems cool" kind of sentiment here that more often than not, doesn't get applied to anything. \n\nThere's also the idea that if something sticks out, it could be struck back down, so a fear here of that "striking down", or the consequences that follow from it may exist. But there's something about "rooting" or being "set", or making a firm decision that I just don't like or relate to. It just seems to cancel out other possibilities, and perhaps that's why I find it to be frustrating. I'm not exactly sure why either; Could be related to the Ne. I understand the other point of view; someone could view me as very wishy washy, "not all together", passive, and overall, a lame, milquetoast "sheep" or something along those lines. I'm not sure I'll do anything to change their mind about that either. It all just seems to be tiring, but I could see a situation where standing for something may be preferred. 
335	So I wasn't the only one who did this	
68	that insane amount of relief after figuring out the text would end before it ever got to your turn
17	I still do this now in high school.
10	Or trying to predict when you will be called on for a stand up presentation. god i can almost taste the fear and dread of watching the clock and calculating whethere there would be enought time for you to go that day. i could probably get fired from my job and evicted from my apartment today and it would be less stressful than then
8	I did this if I wasn't spacing out that day, in which case I'd be totally lost and get in trouble.
9	This was actually the only time I was confident participating in class because the words were already right there for me haha
8	I did this during college Latin class. I'd count the people in front of me and find the sentence I would need to translate and do it before the professor called on me. \n\nOnly I miscalculated one day and completely fudged the translation. The professor shook his head at me and said, "You can do better." 🙈
3	I continued doing this in college.
4	In elementary school I was the one who corrected everyone at the hard words cuz I’d be reading ahead. My 4th grade teacher thought I was an egotistical asshole, at the time I had just wanted to help, not hurt
2	THIS.
2	Just did that today at Latin class aswell 😂
2	Actually no but I would start laughing so loudly in the middle of the reading because the anxiety was realllll
2	Yes but then saying it wrong anyway because the pressure is on ! 
1	I had a really hard time learning to read as a child, and would be so embarrassed to stumble over the words that I would just make up my own none sense story when it came to my turn and get in trouble. I also had really bad hand writing and would fill in essay questions with spice girls lyrics. Always thought this was an awful way to get children to read. Teachers had no sense of humor and would just publicly shame you, rather then be encouraging and help you through your mistakes. I guess it helps introduce you to the real world where everyone will judge you, but man dose it leave trauma scars. 
556	I love this kind of eerie pictures.	
12	Oh wow that's nice.  Not exactly eerie to me.  But maybe.  (Of course I'm INFP so I can't decide.)  Pretty anyway.  Thank you for sharing!
5	Why are all the signals on? Someone is going to crash
3	"Please put on your 3D glasses now"
2	You'd enjoy [@patamuswarmer](http://www.instagram.com/patamuswarmer) on instagram. Scroll down a bit for pics like this one.
2	Oh wow!  Neat photo, quite evocative. \n\nAway from the city where you can actually see the stars.
2	Hey,  that's my Gboard background!
2	Have you checked out Gregory Crewdson? He's got some uncomfortable eerie art. It's kind of suburban/middle class noir.
2	This was my desktop background at work for a long time. I love this pic.
2	Beautiful! 
2	I'm right there with you, so beautiful.
2	That's beautiful :) 
1	I love this kind of photography too!! Seriously check out this account on Instagram, the energy in her photos are beautiful and eerie too https://instagram.com/s.ilver?utm_source=ig_profile_share&igshid=1b4jxxfendmma
1	Beautiful!!
2	Inexperienced (20M) INFP seeking advice	This is my first post here and I'm very excited to hear (read) what you have to say. I've been in only one relationship, which got off the rails pretty quickly and it's been quite a while since. My question is: how do you get over the feeling that keeps you from talking to someone you like? It's been hell for me for as long as I can remember.\n\nThe relationship I had was started by my now ex girlfriend (obvious hints, holding hands etc.) and I kinda went with the flow. I can't even remember what happened, it just did xD\n\nAny advise or stories will be highly appreciated. Thank you for your time! 
9	Dude. Just do what I did and don't initiate anything. Then regret every single missed opportunities 10 years later.\nJust do it! Do it the way you feel like, be honest but do it!
2	Eye contact, smiles, being nice, being supportive, opening up about yourself, trust them. I feel like that is most of it.
2	I think it's really good to practice keeping them human. If you put them into a category of this special person you really want to not mess things up with, you'll never be able to relax and just be in the moment. So try to remember they're just another human like yourself, looking for a meaningful human connection :)
2	Simple, Make it so that u take action before ur brain has time to intervene, if u cant do it in 5 seconds it aint happenin
2	You just have to really know your worth and if they’re worthy. If they stopped talking to you or they wanted you out from their connection, then do the same. Kick them out of your picture too. They don’t deserve you. Sometimes, you just gotta acknowledge that your sanity matters more. We can’t be martyrs. But if you see a window of interest or perhaps flicker of hope from the other side, then perhaps it just needs a little push and efforts to win a girl’s heart. Take it easy too kiddo. Sad but these days, people are way into temporary things, know what you’re investing yourself into. Although scarce, there are still gems out there who will stick for a long time and be willing to have you. 
1	I usually take a deep breath, roll my shoulders back, remind myself that "people ain't shit," and that most people who have gotten to know me think I'm cool. I usually ask basic questions that you ask a new friend when you're trying to learn more about them. e.g., birthplace, music, hobbies, family, etc. I like asking about music and making playlists for people if we have similar tastes. 
1	Write her a poem . Or draw . Or invite her to a concert ..casual . “Oh I have two tickets to .. “
1	Outgoing One Sometimes....	So I have always been super outgoing when no one else was. Like, I will dance and be silly randomly in front of people, but I hate dancing at clubs or when other people are dancing. Idk?
2	Honestly, I feel this. Like in group projects at school with people I didn’t know, no one would talk and just stare at each other, but I would take the initiative. Even today, I was at an orientation and all the girls I sat with were quiet until I broke the ice. In any other situations with others who are outgoing, I’m quiet or nervous as hell. 
3	Should I feel guilty about not wanting to go out and do anything today?	I’m trying to push myself to wake up relatively early, go out and experience the world on my days off. Yesterday I succeeded at the waking up, cleaning my room and cooking breakfast, but then I just couldn’t find any desire to do more: it’s cloudy and rainy, and there’s nothing specific I can think of doing. No movies I want to see that I haven’t already. I work weekends, so Tuesday is my Friday. As such, there aren’t too many activities in my city during the week because most are at work. I’ve thought about just tracking down local comic, and music stores and just spending time there in my downtime, but I don’t know. When I can think of anything to do, or when it’s gloomy outside (which has been just about everyday since October where I am) I just prefer to stay in. But I always get guilty when I do this because I feel like I should be out enjoying my day.\n\nShould I feel guilty for not going out even when I truly can’t think of anything to do?\n\nAre there any simple activities I could do that any of you guys do regularly that I could try to break out of my comfort zone? I like writing, gaming, movies (I will be seeing Captain Marvel next week so there’s that), comics, stand-up and open mics, and concerts (I’m seeing one of my favorite bands in March). 
2	I don't think you should feel guilty, everyone deserves a day "off". Just to turn yourself off and enjoy living, this world is already pushing everyone to be busy every moment of every day.\n\nIf it makes you happy to be busy, then by all means, do so. But if you're feeling like doing nothing for a day, well, who is to say that isn’t fine too.😸
2	Why should you feel guilty? Enjoy the beauty of the world around you. 
1	Just a random idea. Maybe if you live in a cool place you could try and get into photography. Just exploring and getting to know different parts of where you live and also taking fun photos 
5	Tips for talking?	Does anyone have any tips for just spitting out your words? I am not sure if this goes for everyone- but I feel as though I have a good grasp on what goes on in my head. When it comes to saying it out loud though, I either don’t articulate what I’m thinking in the right way or I just blank hard. Any advice? Sometimes I feel like my journal is the only thing in the world who truly knows what I’m thinking and how I’m feeling. 
4	i feel this... in my head it makes sense but expressing it is impossible 
3	Sorry I don't have any change on me right now
3	Honestly, I rehearse a lot beforehand ha ha! \n"What you understand well, you enunciate clearly".\n\nBut yeah, we're better at writing for sure. 
2	I wish I had some great tips but I can only offer some understanding lol. I too can never seem to express what I want with spoken word. If there is *any* pressure for me to say something I will go completely blank in the head. Sometimes words sound very beautiful and philosophical and wonderful in my head but come out so flat and lame once I let them out *or* I just can't find them anymore when I need to. I also often "think in English" and have trouble translating thoughts back into my native language without them turning ugly but I guess that's a different thing completely. :D\n\nWriting is the only time I can let my words out the way I intended to. And sometimes when I'm talking to myself too. 
2	Confidence for one, might sound strange, but it's true. Nervousness breeds awkwardness. Then there's experience, the more practicr you have the more you have to draw from when communicating. Just try to externalize as much as possible with you shoulders back and your feet planted.\n\nPs. Maybe don't listen to me. I'm an awkward piece of shit irl.
2	Did I write this and forget?? Lol things always sound so much better in my head, but when I open my mouth it’s a train wreck. I’ve gotten a lot better the older I get. The more you speak the better it’ll get. Try reading things out loud when you’re by yourself. Also, speaking in front of a mirror might be helpful.
1	This is a little extreme but I started to take the drug propanolol for public speaking and found that on those days when I took it I was more well-spoken in general, even when not in front of a crowd. It lowers your blood pressure so I was relaxed and didn't feel the extra anxiety of "oh my words aren't coming out right, I'm sounding like a fool" while simultaneously forming my sentences. I can practice speaking and observing how it feels so that when I don't take the drug I can find that mindset again. It's my miracle drug for sure!
4	What do you think about ISTP's?	
7	So why you're really asking is that you like an infp and wondering if they could have interest too? 
4	I am married to an ISTP. \n\nOf course I love him-for many different reasons. \n\nThe most frustrating thing can be how much I like to elaborate on what I am feeling, and upon the feelings of others. Oftentimes my husband seems to do things in a systematic way. Not saying he can’t be tender and show emotions in what he does. But as an INFP, it feels like I have a built in system evaluating my emotions and the emotions of others. I am sensitive to emotional things, and when conflict has to be addressed, it takes a great deal of effort to confront it-if I do at all. Meanwhile if my husband knows a conflict needs to be addressed, generally he will just go and take care of it.\n\nWe both enjoy quiet time, and while other people fill our “social cups” we don’t seem to fill each other’s. \n\nI appreciate many aspects of him. But I do wish he would be more open about some of his feelings, since that’s so big for INFPs. We INFPs care about the little details ISTPs may disregard. \n\nHe’s 28 if that makes a difference.
3	I can only speak of my own experience with the only ISTP in my life: my father. \n\nFirst of all, he's a very hands-on kind of person while I'm the very opposite of that. We don't have too much in common and even if we do, we enjoy different parts of the same thing. F.ex. he is fascinated by musical instruments while I find wonder in the stories and meanings behind lyrics and melodies. He focuses on the world surrounding him and I focus on the world inside my head. Sometimes I can't keep up with what he's going on about and sometimes he'll get overwhelmed by my talk of theory. But he is in no way dumb or shallow though. We have had a few great talks about politics and world's injustices. Our point of views are just very different. He is more of a realist while I am an idealist.\n\nI admire about him his general lack of corcern for other people's opinions. He doesn't really care about what's fashionable or popular but is instead driven by his own intrinsic motivations. My mom (ISFJ) is the worst overthinker ever and I know he finds her hassling and worrying to be a complete waste of time. He is in no way a people pleaser. He doesn't make sacrifices for others unless it's for someone he really cares about and unless they truly appreciate his effort. He shows his love with things that he does, not with words. That makes it sometimes hard for me to talk to him because I really **like** to know about what's going on beneath the surface while he probably prefers to keep all that stuff hidden away in some deep dark cave in his subconscious. \n\n***Overall*** an INFP and an ISTP will generally be very different but I don't see why we could not still get along and care for one another. Personally I find there's this aura of quiet confidence and perhaps a little taste of danger in the way ISTPs unapologetically present themselves and I find it very attractive. But maybe in long term I might start to find them a bit underwhelming and vice versa. Idk lol. I hope this wasn't a completely useless word vomit. 
3	My absolute best friends both tested ISTP when they took the test. One from high school, one was an old roommate.\n\nWe were (are) so, so different at yet at some weird level we still understood each other. One of my best memories is having chinese food on Thanksgiving with my old roommate because our family's lived in other states. We watched some random videos on youtube and had a great time.\n\nSo far, anyways, all around cool cats. 10/10, would friend again.
1	ew. wild pseudo-intellectuals (my brother's an istp, so i know from experience)
1	Intelligent, hilarious, and very desirable in a way (his Se was sexy, his Ti admirable, his Ni intriguing), but forever hard to really know or feel emotionally intimate with was my experience with one ISTP. We clashed when it came to his Fe and my Fi. He was more social than I was while at the same time, clueless as to how to deal with people.
58	Saw every one sharing their art / photography. Here's something I took during the summer	
2	Beautiful, where is this
2	Trees hold a lot of symbolism. I like how the branches sort of stick out like knives to protect it's trunk and stands tall like even though it's lost it's youth it shows that it's strong as ever.
2	This song is so INFP (About the struggles of depression)	Watch the video and read the lyrics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZkI3ASz8Lg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZkI3ASz8Lg)
2	Not responding to friends or family who want to connect with you is sooo relatable. I don't ignore my mom's calls, but I get extremely anxious when I see a call from her coming in. When I'm talking to her, I can't wait for the conversation to end and when I don't talk to her for a while I start to miss her but it feels like we never have much to talk about. 
32	The worst thing you can say to an INFP?	I'll start:\n\n"Nobody cares about your experiences or whatever creative product is representative of them."\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
46	Don't be so emotional.
22	Relax \n\nIt’s not that serious 
21	I hate when people aren’t paying attention to what I say or feign interest in what I say. I’d much rather have them straight up tell me they don’t care or would rather speak about something else (even if it would be hurtful to me).
17	Idk about INFP in general, but I got hit with one that most likely affects INFP males due to stereotypes:\n\n"You wouldn't know, you've never really been under emotional stress"\n\nI mean yeah I have but my coping mechanism is to deal with it internally thanks, you just don't know because I had to get good at hiding it.
13	That's a bad idea. Makes me quiet when my coworkers say it.\n\nI live in fantasy where every idea works out. 
9	How unoriginal 
12	Anything while I’m already speaking because I will instantly shut up
10	Anything that attacks my character. I try so hard to be kind above all else, so an insult to my character is the worst thing I can hear.\n\nEdit: That, or insulting my intelligence and meaning it, but that might just be me.
21	Any variant of "nobody cares" is up there. As is insulting me for my core values or aspects of my identity. I've heard both of those my fair share of times, being fundamentally an idealist, as well as a non-neurotypical LGBTQ person.
10	How's the weather? What do you do for a living? What do you drive? \nAll meaningless.. imo
9	stop overthinking, it's no big deal, stop taking things so seriously, you're wasting your time, you're too emotional, etc
7	Gaslighting and invalidation. I don't care about randoms, but those I really like and respect (note: there's not many of those people). 
7	"You're impractical and you can't survive in the real world."\n\nThis one hurts so, so much.
6	- Why are you so serious?   \n\n- well because that's the ducking way I am, you peace of shtttt (that's what I would think while burning all that's precious to him/she in my mind) 
6	in my case, any kind of condescending tone hurts me right in the guts and makes me angry, but I don't know if it's a infp thing at all\n\n&#x200B;
7	“Okaaaay. So?” 🙄🙄\n\nLike, for real? I’ll give you “so what”, you friggin’ jerk! Arrrrgh!!!! I freaking hate that expression/face they give you with those words. At least freaking act like you give a damn!
4	"There is only one way to do this" or "that's just how we do things".\n\n In situations where these are obviously not your only choices, why limit yourself? 
4	When you put effort into something and someone comments about your work even when they didnt do anything.
4	Part action, part saying. "You're too good for me" *removes themselves from your life despite your best attempts to help them*
4	That's not how the world works
4	“Get out of your head”
4	Defending/protecting myself for the first time in my life and then the other person calling me selfish and/or toxic.
3	Just do it, everybody else is.
3	"You need to toughen up. You're too sensitive and its childish. Learn to act like an adult and not be so weird!"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso: \*Shows someone something I'm working on or that matters to me\*\n\n"Yeah, sure whatever. Anyways..."
3	One I really don't like is when people try to joke and poke fun at my being quiet by saying, "God, you talk so much, I can't get a word in edgewise!" Cause even if I would have had anything to say, I'm sure af not going to now. 
3	"You only do useless things."
3	Ah, reading this thread made me feel like I accidentally stepped into ESTJ/ENTJ/ESTP territory. It's bringing up all the insensitive stuff my friends of those types said so shamelessly and sternly to me. "You're such a kid." "Must I babysit you again?" "You're always sensitive!" "You just have to be the whiniest bitch!" "Drama queen!" "She doesn't get it." Agreeing with each other (AKA ganging up on me) in their condescending "adult" petty tone because they can't comprehend how I think. Clearly I'm triggered and now I must take my leave to cool off. 
2	I would simplify yours to simply “Nobody cares about you”. Which, yes, I have been told.
2	Stop overreacting. Don't act in the heat of the moment
2	Lmao!!! Good one
2	‘That’s lame’\n\nNot really a phrase but when people are really patronizing when I’m expressing my hurt. Sometimes I rather people just listen to me instead of tell me what I’m doing wrong.\n\nWhen they say nothing at all or make a face like I’m an alien.
1	I said "we should go just for the free food" to an INFP I had just met, she reacted quite seriously :/
1	Smile
105	A calming sky/travel aesthetic	
7	Very Vaporwave
5	Where is this?  I know in San Diego the strip is really short and they get really close to the ground like that but it doesn't really look like San Diego?
3	Reminds me of Vice City. I love those trees
2	Hello fellow LA infp
2	Love it
2	There's nothing calming about this. Cars, traffic lights, advertising, power lines, an aeroplane... man's destruction of nature.
2	"QUIET" Susan Cain	Have you read this book? What do you think?
2	Yes, and I thought she did a fantastic job of describing an introvert’s place in the world. I appreciate that she doesn’t try to say that introverts are really any better or worse than anyone else, that basically they just have their strengths and weaknesses. It’s a great book for introverts who don’t feel accepted for who they are. Though, honestly, I wish every extrovert, or at least anyone who thinks that an introvert just needs to “break out of his shell”, would read this!!
1	Loved it. She said on Twitter that she's an INFP...unsure if this is true to her functions or not or what she based this assertion on
1	I don't think there's any other book on being myself that I've felt so relaxed by. 
51	Picture i took a few months ago	
3	Beautiful. I miss snow. None happening where I’m from. :) it’s sure cozy to look at though.x
2	Nicee❄️☃️
1	What a nice place 
1	This is gorgeous. Is it a park? 
1	It reminds me of the graveyard in that Phantom Of The Opera film for some reason. Very beautiful.
5	Anyone else really not like overly aggressive/purposefully annoying characters in sitcoms?	A problem I always find in binge able shows is there's episodes where they introduce an unlikable character who's main purpose is to just be annoying and to force conflict. I guess irredeemable characters come off as lazy and it just irritates me that they're the focus of the episodes, I usually end up skipping the episodes anyways
3	unstereotypical infp characters?	I’m just asking bcus the only one I know of is Anne from Anne with an E imo. 
3	Fox Mulder from X-Files, I think. Love that dude. 
3	Yuri Lowell from Tales of Vesperia
3	Pain/Nagato, Spider-Man, and Frodo
2	Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes imo.
2	Kenshin Himura, my fav anime character ever
1	Vash the Stampede?
1	Lou Reed, both the character and the man
3	“Hey man!” Ughh	Dunno about the rest of you, but I hate calling any other member of the male species “man”. It feels like this word is a substitute for an actual, meaningful connection...it’s meant to show that you know a person a bit better than the average, uh, man, but apparently not well enough to actually say their name or greet them in a way befitting your relationship. Like personally I am somehow decently well put-together and try to look like I know what I’m doing (lol), yet I always like to greet my friends and coworkers in as immature a way as possible. I just hate convention so much and these social rules.\n\nIt’s not unlike my emails with my friends where we work out plans for the weekend (I’m 34 so yeah, I have to email my friends to talk to them :/ ). And it’s always generic “when are you free?” “I am free at X o’clock!” “Then we shall meet at X o’clock at Y PM!” Ugh IM SO BORED. I can’t ever just write a normal response to these things, like if I didn’t make my font size 100 for no reason or something similar then I wouldn’t bother.\n\nCan anyone relate to any of this?
1	It’s just my default thing to say when it’s a guy whose name I’ve used too much in the conversation already, or whose name I forgot. I have no real feelings toward it.\n\nI see it as a tool, it doesn’t have to mean any specific levels of connection. A lot of that depends on tone too.
1	Well, I detest "lol" but it's so prevalent that I can't really do anything about it.
1	Spice it up. Use dude. Bro. Guy. Bud. Buddy. Fella. Güey. Compa. Put a "my" in front. Use emojis as a substitute (ugh ). \n\nBe creative in your self-expression. What's the worst that can happen?
1	I call my friends "man" all the time. Its not that different from saying "dude" or "bro" its just another way to get someone's attention. People don't say "man" because they are forced to, but its just very casual and universal. Not every interaction has to be emotionally motivated.
1	my default greeting is usually along the lines of "Yeet uwu whats up?" lol
13	02272019 - Mixed Media: Acrylic/Digital. Just something I’ve been working on...	
1	This is super cool! I love the contrasting color. I've always been a fan of mixed media, especially a classic like acrylic paired with modern digital.
12	Anyone else find themselves emulating and thinking like characters in fiction?	I’ve noticed that when I get invested in characters, I can often really think and feel the way they do, even if they act and think in ways that are contradictory to who I am. \n\nIf a character I’m invested in is an apathetic anti-hero, I’ll think in a very detached way and not think much of killing or people dying. If they’re an empathetic hero who has a strong aversion to killing. I’ll feel very empathetic for everyone and feel that everyone can be redeemed or rehabilitated. If they’re a character with a strong sense of Justice, I’ll feel that sense of justice too and feel a need to do things justly and righteously. If they’re a chaotic character that doesn’t play by the rules and rebels against authority, I’ll feel free and rebellious, like I just need to do things my way, like I just need to forget about the rules and like I can stand up to any authority. \n\nFor example, I had recently watched a few episodes of “Dexter”, and I began thinking in a very detached way, then I thought about all the evil people in the world and how this world would be better off without them, and I felt like I could kill without remorse and that I’d be doing a good thing. Another example is after I played as Jimmy Hopkins in “Bully” I felt a need to stand up for everyone who needs it. I felt I could take on anyone and felt a strong aversion to authority. I felt very cynical. I felt like a tough rebel that could beat up anyone who asked for it.\n\nDoes anyone else here get like this?
4	It’s been this way for me for as long as I can remember. Not just films but books, paintings, and most of all music. \n\nI think this is why it’s especially important for people like us to be particular about what we “consume” in our everyday lives. \n\nYou are the sum of what you think about.
2	I’ve been going hard on scott pilgrim recently
1	No, generally I don't immerse myself in the character that I don't feel kinship with. 
1	Sometimes yes we can get 'stuck' in the mindset if a character.  I like tobthibk that people INFP or not have the natural ability to create characters for stories or do acting😎
3	INFPs and Mental Health?	I was recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and I struggle w/ addiction. \n\nI was curious to know if this personality type is more prone to certain mental disorders, etc.\n\nAny thoughts?
10	Definitely. We see the world way different and cause we mostly get out of it (cause of introverted and dreamy) it makes us forget a bit where we actually are. I believe we are definitely more prone to health issues cause there is just so much to think about and what goes wrong in this world and you want to do something but you can’t in some cases. 
5	DaveSuperPowers talks about in his videos how each type has their own demons. I am no expert so this is the gist of what I recall.\n\nIPs have the most issue with self-identity vs the tribe. In other words IPs know who they are and struggle when the tribe does not accept them.\n\nEJs also struggle with self-identity, but it is more that they try so hard for the tribe to accept them that they don't know who they are. They have these moments when they are alone where they ask themselves, "Who am I?"\n\nThese are not always the case, of course, but they are just common patterns in the typology world.\n\nIJs have trouble with order vs chaos. And they have a very difficult time if things are not in their control.\n\nI think EPs are also order too, but it is like they shun order. "Don't box me in, bro!"\n\nHis videos go more in depth of the different types if you are interested. Davesuperpowers on YouTube.
6	I'm so sorry to hear you were diagnosed such and I hope you do get well. I believe even BPD can be healed and I wish you'll find the way. I know it's a struggle.\n\nINFP's nature is fragile, the most fragile of all the types. \nWe need almost perfect conditions to emerge to adulthood intact. INFPs who were subject to abuse or neglect as children are prone to develop bpd.\nSource- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ZH0SjK9cE
2	Yes . I have that too and if it matters I’m also a Pisces .\n\n\nI schedule my crying now . 
14	Although I love all your beautiful sunsets, I've been feeling pretty gloomy lately..	
1	Wow I love this shot. Well done OP!
74	<3	
7	Water is my favourite element 
3	Ah...peaceful. There's nothing better than a day at the lake. Thanks for sharing!
2	Amazing. Like there's a bunch of shining gems on the bottom. 
3	INFP dating an ESFP	Last year I met an ESFP girl (has ADHD) and we fell for eachother. We dated a couple of months and we had a lot of fun, but then she ghosted me. Fast forward a couple of months later she calls me and we reconnect, but after a short time she ignores me again. Then the same thing happens again. Just a month ago, she calls asking how I’m doing and such and tells me that I can call her anytime I want to. So I did, but again she ghosted me.\n\nI might have put her too high on a pedestal, I just found everything about her amazing. But I was the one being reserved, she was the one making the moves earlier on. It was not until she told me she could see a future with me and talking about maybe moving in together I let my guard down and I thought she was the one. And I know she is going through some shit, but I am not sure if I should put my foot down or wait for her longer\n\nHave anyone here experienced something similar with an ESFP?
5	I have no experience with dating ESFP girls :D. But my idea is that someone should treat you and your feelings with respect, and it doesn’t sound like she has.\n\nWhether her life is too tumultuous atm to stick around, whether she’s fickle, whether she needs to experience clear boundaries in order to respect you, in all cases I can imagine, you’re better off being clear and putting your foot down. This uncertainty is probably doing you no good and just waiting for her to change won’t send the message that she needs to respect you too. \n\nJust my interpretation of course. Anyway, goodluck figuring it out :).
3	I have a parent ESFP, so the dynamics are probably completely different, but mine sort of comes and goes whenever he pleases too (my parents are divorced) and is generally very difficult to reason with. I think it could be their Fi if underdeveloped that can make them selfish. At this point I've already given up.
1	She would want to have a guy that will challenge her and dominate her. They easily get bored and the idea of romance may interest them but it’s gotta be exciting and not all cheesy and head over heels. 
1	Well based on my one experience with an ESFP who also pursued me first and came on pretty strong... ESFPs will dangle themselves in front of INFPs and then claim they just want a less committed arrangement that suits their needs. INFPs will give too much of themselves to the ESFP. So it's not worth it.
9	Why do you think INFPs are good at playing villains in movies, video games etc?	Do you think it’s because they tend to be more creative and are able to put themselves into a role far more than anyone else? I looked up to see that Clancy Brown is an INFP and he has portrayed 2 of my favorite villains, The Kurgan in Highlander and Lex Luthor in Superman: The Animated Series and Justice League Unlimited.
11	I think we are good at being the Anti-Hero because we can see injustice from either side. Villains can sometimes have good intention, and we can sometimes sympathize with that. Also feeling like we are being controlled can lead to some going rogue, especially when we don't think the "good guys" are right or have bad intentions. I think INFPs are good at being neutral, and sometimes that might mean taking the side of the "bad guys". Just because we oppose the hero doesn't make us the villain. \n\nEdit: For example Killmonger from Black Panther, yes he was the villain in the movie. But his father was killed by the King of Wakanda and he was rejected by an advanced civilization that just wanted to hide in isolation. Leading him to fend for himself growing up. So he just wanted to give other people of color a fighting chance. Yes his methods were excessive, but I sympathize for him and i'd probably do the same if I were him.
4	Being a theatrical and voice actor who gets type cast as villains, this is the rare question I seem to be entirely equipped to answer. At least with regards to providing my own perspective.\n\nI think /u/sum1rand0m is onto something, at least when it comes to a certain kind of villain. The villain with good intentions can definitely be fun to play, especially when their goals are reflective of my own were I to be a far less ethical and empathetic person. Playing those characters is a sort of wish fulfillment, allowing me to engage with my desire to be a dangerous social revolutionary without having to, you know, hurt anyone in the process. Sometimes I do want to burn the world down and install a better one in its place. Villains who have an agreeable purpose are interesting, sometimes even sympathetic.\n\nThe Preacher, the primary antagonist of my own novel is this, at least at first. His goal of granting immortality to humanity is downright respectable. His method of killing enough people en masse to force the goddess of Death to manifest in front of him so that he can devour her soul and steal her power is... well, it’s utilitarianism at its absolute worst (and mind you, I’m leery of utilitarianism at its best).\n\nBut not all villains are social revolutionaries with utopian aspirations, and I’ve enjoyed playing other kinds just as much in my time, for other reasons.\n\nFor instance, there’s a character I would refer to as the dystopian revolutionary. This is a person who wants to burn the world down, and create one in its stead that everyone else would think is objectively worse. Make no mistake, this person has ethics and values; in fact, they dedicate themselves entirely to the pursuit of them. It’s just that their values are alien and monstrous. This is where you get your Jokers.\n\nTiberius, the villain I’ve most consistently played (in four pieces at this point), is definitely this. Where I would look at the world and see systems that enforce suffering and competition and conclude that these systems need to be removed so that we can be free to be our authentic selves, Tiberius sees an entirely different problem. He believes that the nature of humans is cruelty, sadism, and ruthless competition, and sees society as it is currently ordered as placing an undue restriction on that. His is an ethics of evil, similar to the bastard lovechild of Thomas Hobbes and Marquis De Sade, but it is an ethics nonetheless. He believes in something, and he would die for it; even if that thing is something any non-psychopathic human would categorically reject. He would die in the name of a sadism that he calls freedom. Tiberius is Fi at its absolute worst and most narcissistic, and janky as he might be, he still sort of works as a character. After all, if we accept that someone can be monstrous, then behaving like Tiberius does might actually be necessary. People need to do something to justify their own existence and actions to themselves, after all; ascribing your own monstrosity to the whole of humanity and then masking your cruelty as an attempt to “liberate” people could well do it. It’s entirely possible that he’s such a narcissist that he doesn’t even realize that other people with different perspectives really exist, or at least thinks their opinions are wrong and misguided. I actually see dystopian revolutionaries popping up a lot of the time when people attempt to create utopian revolutionaries, which is interesting.\n\nThen, when your heroes are revolutionaries (and I do love a good revolutionary hero), you get villains who enforce the status quo. They could be doing this for any number of reasons; perhaps they are in a place of privilege and benefit from crushing all opposition. Perhaps they legitimately believe that the status quo is the best way to run things, no matter how broken we might think it is. Perhaps it’s simply that they have a place at all within it. Often, some combination is true. People who legitimately believe that something unsalvageable is worth saving have the potential to be terrifying. Here is where we get the Inspector Javerts, though this can easily be made more evil than him. These people range from “just following orders” to “I believe in tyranny”.\n\nOnce again citing my work, Death in my novel is essentially this. She is responsible for living beings aging and dying, and she has built an entire society around the glorification of horic but ultimately pointless sacrifice. Why does she do this? It’s a similar thing to Tiberius, actually, but with a Fe twist; this system, which she herself creates and enforces, is the only one which needs her, and she can’t accept the idea that she wouldn’t be needed. She has to be instrumental, she has to have people want her and say that she’s necessary, even good. For this, she is willing to literally condemn an entire universe of beings to (eventual) death. She enforces social rules and values with an iron fist, because she knows that any crack in the glass can lead to the entire facade shattering, and she wants to believe it. She can’t stand it when people don’t *need* her, when she’s not *helping* them by killing them. Narcissistic Fe is just as dangerous as narcissistic Fi. Without empathy, both of the feeling functions become dangerous. The former can manifest as a desire for status and stability, and a belief you know what’s best for others without actually caring about them. The latter is usually represented by a deep knowledge of your own desires without any concern for how they affect people beyond yourself; self-actualization at every cost.\n\nThen there are villains that are ultimately just broken, pathetic people. I’ve played a few of these as well. They tend to be sad reflections of ordinary or even brilliant individuals, with some crippling flaw or suite of flaws that holds them back from truly reaching that point. These people can be any of the above, or neither. A lot of petty criminals, for instance, work when portrayed this way. It’s not a grand kind of evil, or even necessarily evil at all, so much as just an... empty person. They’re miserable, they’re pathetic, and we see just enough of a glimpse of someone real in there that we want them to fix themselves, yet at the same time, they’re the kind of person who could probably hide a body under the floorboards and lie about it to their families without actual remorse. They might feel vaguely bad about it, but they don’t really know what remorse is. I’ve met a few people who remind me of this in my real life, actually. Some of my own family members included. These people are painful to watch, painful to write and painful to play, but there’s a reality to their situation. People who have been left behind, and beaten to the point that they’re just empty shells, with very little of substance left to save.\n\nAnd some characters are just moustache-twirlingly evil. They’re boring to think about, but sometimes amusing to play. Orcus Tenebrous Thanatos, Demon Prince of Undeath, took this role in my D&D campaign, and the players loved how much of a total nonsensical dick he was.\n\nOf course, these ideas just reflect my own experiences with villainy in fiction. So take them with a grain of salt.
2	They get salty easily
2	Clancy Brown is an INFP?! YOU'RE KIDDING! He was really intimidating in Highlander, he was great in shawshank redemption and I've recognised him whenever I see or hear him in anything else since. Now I just want to hug the guy!\nIn answer to your question, INFPs can make good actors because we see other points of view quite easily. We can change our perspectives on things quite easily and we can emotionally resonate with characters, even if they're not real people. A lot of what we are like day to day can also be put on for the sake of others (to make them feel comfortable or something), we're all actors really. 
2	Because they aren't playing? World will turn too good people into villains often enough.
2	A lot of great actors are INFP’s, and yes I believe it’s because INFP’s have a lot of empathy. They’re excellent at putting their minds into the shoes of others.

4	Any dancers on this sub?	I'm 20, almost 21, and I wanted to dance as a kid. I have always been in love with the art, but my family wasn't financially stable enough for me to afford lessons. I still want to learn, but most places I look cater to kids and I feel like I missed the boat.\n\nIs it (realistically-speaking) too late for me to learn how to dance? And if not, where the heck do I look? I've been trying desperately to find a studio that focuses on adults (especially beginners, as I have literally no experience), but with no luck. My want to learn contemporary and tap is still very much alive. \n\nAny help/encouragement would go a long way. I also have mild social anxiety that makes the idea of being terrible in front of people who know what they're doing absolutely awful. Feeling pretty stuck, ha.
3	I have the worst dance moves, quirky, silly to say the least... but if the musics fine, I just don't give a fck, I truly dance like nobody's watching, even being a shifty dancer I'm proud of my moves, they got me some pretty nice hookups back in the old days hahah\nEven if you're 83 and have arthritis, if you're into dancing, don't give a darn about anyone else!  you should try some classes, just enjoy yourself😁
2	Its never too late to learn anything! I just recently started to learn dance and I'm 21. This might not help much, but I don't take lesson bc I too coukdn't find any places that teach older ppl...or at least kids not in middle school lol. Theres plenty of ways to learn to dance online - yt even! if you really want it then finding ways to do stuff you want to do, even if you're alone, is always an option. follow that passion and hold on to it. ik you can do anything you set your heart to. <3
2	I took ballet when I was little for a few years, but didn't keep up with it. If I improvise on my own though, it tends to take on that quality. I always wanted to take Highland dance, but never had the opportunity. Later, I was introduced to a community group that did Jewish folk dance. That was a lot of fun, but it requires more people for a circle or line, so I don't get to do it often anymore. 
2	Yes! Dancing helped me when I was growing up to come out of my painfully shy shell. I've also been hoping to continue as an adult but have the same problem in finding a place. \n\nHonestly, there may not be a place to necessarily "teach" you at that age but so much of dance lessons is just trying to mimic what the teacher does in front of you. You can learn so much from Youtube videos and I still do that sometimes when there's a fun Kpop dance or a choreographed piece to a song I really like. Do it in front of a mirror if you can or record yourself so you can see what you're doing wrong/right. You could start there and then once you have more confidence go to dance workshops that you can find online. I just search "dance workshop [my city]" and some popped up.
1	Thank you guys so much! I'm super excited to start learning. ❤
4	Hey INFPs, I've got a question	So, as an INTJ I think the truth should come before someone's feelings, what's your opinion?\n\nAre feelings more important than logic or is it the other way around?\n\nWhy?
15	I think it can depend sometimes, but I generally agree as long as you’re not a dick about it. There’s telling the truth and then there’s “telling the truth”.
9	The fact is the truth. The hurt feelings of a fact receipent is also the truth. To be as honest as possible whilst minimising harm.
7	As long as saying the truth brings more good than harm. I find that there are truths that some people don't want/need/are ready to listen, so what's the point to speak em if it'll all make it worse? 🤷
4	Ultimately, it comes down to my *feeling* of what is more important in a given situation. Truth is nothing without its context. Is delivering the truth going to produce the outcome I desire, or is there a better way? Sometimes people need to hear what hurts so they can reflect and improve, but sometimes it backfires. Or is this thing I'm convinced is true truly true at all?
2	IMO one isn’t more important than the other. If truth needs to be shared it should balance with consideration of the feelings of others without either being diminished. 
2	It’s hard to state a black and white answer, as sometimes truth matters more for me, and sometimes feelings. But I’ve been with an ENTP for quite a while now and I’ve noticed I’m usually much more avoidant of speaking the truth as I see it if I feel it’ll hurt someone else’s feelings compared to him. I need a very solid reason to pick truth over being considerate. He’s just baffled by that. Being with him has made me slightly more confrontational (in a friendly way haha) as I can see I’m overly concerned about hurting others. \n\nAnd truth is a bit tricky anyway. Who decides what is true? A lot of it is still subjective perception. That feeling makes it more difficult too for me to state things very assertively.
2	I would rather hurt you with the truth than comfort you with a lie. \n\nI value honesty highly. 
1	Life is nothing but what’s going on in your head. Different feelings cause us to think differently, but then that kind of thinking makes me want to do something only when I’m feeling suitable for the task.
1	I’m inclined towards the *feeling* that feelings are more important. ;) Of course logic/facts/science are to be embraced in that technological progression and stability in a society depend upon them, but I believe without feelings, we may as well be hollow automatons. I think so much of technological advancement has occurred *because* of a passion for discovery and innovation, and I would quantify passion as an emotion/feeling.\n\nAdditionally, humans are complex and sensitive creatures and need care, compassion, and understanding foremost. A baby may come into the world and be saved by some technological advancement, but without nurturing and love, the technology certainly doesn’t guarantee its well being.
1	Truth and logic are separate things. And what does either one have to do with holocaust/Vietnam jokes?
1	Truth is the basis of logic, and the determined handling of the truth can only be achieved when your mindful set of life rules (morale) steer the decision, which is made after learning the truth, in a favorable direction.\n\nHow you feel influences the choices you make in life. Knowing this, I'd say emotion is more important.
1	I think it's important to have a healthy respect for the Truth, and for Experiences--both my own, and other people's.
1	It depends on our values. But naturally as an INFP I will not usually tell someone how I feel about them if it is negative. Now if they asked me what I thought of them, I would find a polite way to say how I feel.\n\nSo say for example, someone did something that really bothered me. I would bite my tongue. But I would keep it in the back of my head for next time. Eventually there may be a "final straw" and then I will show anger.\n\nI hope that helps. Oh and I should also add, as an INFP I can feel uncomfortable speaking my mind if I feel they will become upset. I don't like conflict. But it is something I have worked on.\n\nAlso, I am not a fan of white lies. If someone asks me a question I will try to find a tactful way of saying it, but I am not going to lie to you to make you feel better.
65	Can I sit and think here forever please

1	Hey! I think I have those exact same pants. Do you also have the brunotti jacket?
4	Advice on this behaviour	Ive noticed based on my past relationships im normally at the ready and waiting should my other need me. Even putting things a side just in case, to go and be the best partner I can. However it seems like its really hurting me in the grand order of things. \n\nHonestly im just trying to be there for them as much as possible and I don't wanna let them down, but i dont understand how to balance this.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice?
5	I inevitably put my partner’s needs, goals, basic wants before my own, too. \n\nWhen single, I’m confident, independent, and a people magnet. Guys and girls want to be with me. They want me to turn my focus toward them and let them in. But when I get into a relationship, my habits of putting them before me take over and gone is my former self. Gone.\n\nI don’t know where you are in life, but living alone in my own house has helped me balance this trait of giving my everything over to my partner. By not spending every free moment together and allowing time apart (without texting), I’m able to develop and maintain what they were attracted to in the first place. I’ve been with my current guy for 4 yrs now in separate houses. When we see each other it’s fireworks because I’ve allocated space and time to be me. \n\n\n
4	Ask yourself: are you doing this to be the best partner you can be, or are you doing this because you have an innate need to *feel needed*?\n\nWe’re inherently caring creatures, us INFPs, creatures who want nothing more than to make the ones we love feel comfortable and cared for... but sometimes we neglect to care for ourselves in the process because we’re tirelessly investing the entirety of our being into others so that we can have some semblance of importance in someone else’s life. It’s highly romantic for them, but highly toxic for us, and it ultimately creates an unhealthy co-dependency that leaves us open to being emotionally manipulated.\n\nI think in order to combat this kind of behavior — behavior which I am entirely guilty of and have been told multiple times that I get taken advantage of because of it — we need to look at why we choose to set aside ourselves for others. Do we seek external validation in the form of help because we don’t feel validated enough in our relationship? Are we insecure about how the other person feels about us, scared they may leave us if the slightest inkling of independence exposed itself? Is our partner unhealthily dependent on us? Do they have issues they need to resolve internally as well? Instead of putting your life away for the sake of your partner’s potential needs, invest more energy into self-validation and take the time to build up your confidence so that you won’t need to feel needed as much.\n\nINFPs also have the tendency to idolize their partners, so it’s easy to fall into the habit of being too available in the initial phases of a relationship because we’re so deeply in love with our partner that we fail to see the flaws in our own actions toward them. Take a moment to see the human in your partner so that you won’t feel as obligated to be the “perfect” partner for someone who isn’t perfect themselves — you’re both human, and it’s okay to sometimes have conflicting desires. If you want to do something that your partner doesn’t, don’t let your rose-colored glasses forgo your time for theirs! Relationships are a two-way street, and just as you compromise yourself for your partner, they should also learn to compromise parts of themselves for you, too.\n\nIt’s not to say that you should neglect your partner, nitpick their flaws, fight pointless battles over what to have for dinner, and focus wholly on yourself, but make sure to remember that it’s okay for you to be you and do things for your own happiness, even if it doesn’t leave you as available as you were before — if who you’re with truly loves you, they’ll understand. You should keep to your hobbies when you’re in a relationship, be steadfast to events, people, and values that are important to you (unless they bring your partner pain, then you two can discuss it), and stand your ground when you feel you aren’t being treated fairly. Personal space and a little independence are two key components to any healthy relationship!\n\nI’m sorry if this wasn’t too helpful — I’m in the same boat, so your question challenged me to understand why I behave the way I do. I’m interested to know what kind of advice others will provide! :)\n\nTL;DR: dedicate some time for yourself, develop more confidence in yourself, and know that having personal space/independence in a relationship is essential to its survival!
1	Oh I can relate to that. It is a constant balancing act. Love should mean you are willing to sacrifice your time for someone else, but you also should be free to achieve your dreams. I think this is a millennial problem though. I feel like the previous generations knew it was okay to give up your dreams. Now it is like expected to give up your relationship to pursue your dreams.
1	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 28	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
1	I haven’t been here in a while. I will not provide a recap or an explanation, but my mood has been fluctuating recently. \nThat is all. 
1	Life is sad. People are unaccepting. How can I get rid of the past if I don't run away and cut off all possibility of reattempting to connect? Stop submitting to parent worship and help a living breathing independent human into a better life. Home, clothes, and food, only do so much to one who chooses their mind over their body. Who cares if it's not the "adult" solution?

1	why are we broken? like why is it that all of the ppl around the world are broken..? I've been asking myself that question for some time now.. and three years ago I asked that question and others around me either mocked me or joked about it or completely denied it.. it is so weird but true.. but why are we broken? why are you broken? is it a basic instinct that make us needy and to stay with others? or to be creative and make things to occupy?, what do you think? 
3	My best friend(since 7th grade)is an ESFP.	I'm the peanut butter and he's my jelly-muse. We communicate harmoniously. I can only really open up to this one person and when others hear me talk to him, on the phone mostly, they often get mad. I'm not as open with most people as I am with my bestie and they start to think I'm hiding things from them. Which I am, Duh. Who's your Jelly?
2	Sounds amazing.\n\nI don't have jelly, only more peanut butter. Because when two INFP's hang out it gets wild, it's like we can speak our minds for once.

3	Fun fact: when you burn sulphuric acid it burns with a blue flame. There is a [volcano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ-yGJIT-hA) in Indonesia that actually gives of sulphuric acid and therefore looks blue. As a chem student my self I wish it catered to us more.

16	Do you often feel that nobody likes you?	
18	You dont need to be an INFP to feel that way, and yes often i do
7	I often feel that no one likes me back romantically, everything else yes tho
4	someone in high school told me "nobody likes you" in front of the class, so since then, i've always been paranoid that no one likes me.
3	Hmmm, not really. I mean, I am under no false pretenses that everyone loves me, but I know I am likable and a good human. I used to feel that way, though. I think what helped me most has been that I have learned to share happy times as well as side times with my friends and SO. I try not to overshare the bad times—only when I really need help, because I try to be mindful that my emotions can effect other people, so I only bring troubles to others when I haven’t been able to get through them on my own. My friends have begun to do the same, and since we haven’t been overburdening each other with our problems, and yet we also have not been hiding them, and since we have become more comfortable with sharing our successes, (even when they are super tiny, like learning a new crochet stitch) none of us have really quite experienced that symptom of depression. 
3	Yeah, most of the time. I'm constantly paranoid that people are going to turn on me if I say the wrong thing. It's something I'm working on, for sure.
2	I always feel like nobody likes me. I don't have any close friends or family I can talk to. Most people avoid me and I avoid most people despite my need to be somewhat extroverted. \n\nIn my experience: most people only "like" me when I put on a fake persona that I think others will like. And those same people dislike me when they learn that the persona is fake and see the real me. Even when I'm fake, there are plenty of people who would like to see me buried alive. \n\nThe takeaway: people are always going to dislike you whether you're fake or not. It's up to you to decide who you want to be in this confusing world. Do what YOU want to do and be who YOU want to be if you know what that is. And when you finally find that true "YOU", hold on to it and never let go. The only people who will matter in the end are those who stuck with you because they loved "YOU". In the meantime, us INFPs need to look out for each other and keep watch for our land of milk and honey.\n\n*Edit: "like"
1	I don’t care as much anymore. In 7th grade I wore this really cool black jacket, and some kid I barely knew called me a poser. I was so upset and for a while tried to look like what my “group” looked like. \n\nSilly me.\n\nPeople are so much more than stereotypes and labels. \n\nI am myself now, dressing in what makes me happy, and those who stick around are worth it.❤️
1	I'm more afraid of being unable to love others well...\nI've received quite a lot of love from different people but I don't know how to reciprocate and that's very heartbreaking.
1	The opposite . I feel like people are obsessed with my energy and suck the life out of me \n\n\nI don’t like ppl 
1	For me it’s more they just don’t care 
15	Rest in peace Egg dude.	Today I went to my local park to feed the duck, but honestly I like feeding pigeons more. They seem a lot more grateful than the ducks who have already gorged themselves on bread (dw I know you're not meant to feed ducks bread but that's what other people feed them, I brought seeds)\n\n I started at the bridge and circled back to the bridge. But upon the second visit about 2ish hours later there was a pigeon egg on the ledge. Naturally I picked it up wrapped it in tissue paper. I know that you can technically use the warmth from your hand to incubate the egg. I was aware i couldn't do that for several month but whatever. On a side note it really stank which I figured was just the poop on it. I kept the egg in my pocket and used one hand for warmth. I also successfully held a pigeon dude.\n\nI then needed to go the shop to get food and stuff. As a pigeon dad is was my duty to look after that egg. I couldn't  just leave it in the car, so I went to the shop probably smelling like the worst fart imaginable. When I got hope I had a panic when i felt the egg in my pocket. It may have just been the tissue insulating the egg but it didn't feel as secure. I unravelled the tissue to my worst fear the stop of the egg was caved in and some egg juice was leaking (which to reiterate smelt so bad that i can still smell it now). \n\nEgg dude has no chance in this condition. With a heavy heart i rolled the egg into the garden. I planned our lives together, as we grew old. I wanted to call you Archimedes. I was going to use my heated blanket blanket to maintain the temperature while you where in your egg. I was going to teach you cool tricks. I will meet you again in that great omelette in the sky. Rest in peace my smelly friend.\n\nTLDR: Found a pigeon egg, took it home and it cracked in my pocket.\n\n&#x200B;
5	Rip egg dude, you will be missed 😢💔
2	You were a great egg daddy.❤️
4	Bless your heart, sending all my love to you and the late Egg Dude 💙
4	Do you guys ever envy ENFP?	I envy ENTP(as an INTP). Seems like a more social and creative person than me. Our strengths are Fi and Ti, aka a holistic system of some "thing" but it seems like anybody could achieve that with enough time. We just happen to stick with it a bit longer and be the first to actually reach the whole model. But ENTP responds faster to situations without the whole model, but is sometimes wrong. So when we get the whole model before they do there is a brief period where we work effectively quicker until they get understand it all too.\n\nBecause of this it makes me think...or believe for the sake of my own mental health...that there must be some advantage to being a dominant internal judger beyond just learning...otherwise it's just like they are us...only can actually talk to people...\n\nIt feels like they do everything better except one thing...sticking to developing the whole system. But if they sat down and actually tried they would have our "secret"(that we willingly share) and again be better than us. Idk...just how I feel. I know I shouldn't type envy but it's hard to overcome the feeling.
9	Eh. I work at being the person I want to be, embody my personal values with as much integrity as I can, remaining congruent with them as I grow, change, mature.\n\nThere'll ever only be one you, and the world would be dimmer if you didn't express that truest self. You don't have to become another type to get better at doing certain things.\n\n
5	Nope. They have their problems.
6	Honestly, I'm not particularly jealous of my ENFP brethren. I've envied INTPs and ENTPs for their rationality before, but when it comes down to it, I care too much about myself to want to change.\n\nThere are certainly things that would be nice about being an ENFP, and a faster processing speed might be one of them. Speed isn't everything, though, and I care more about depth. Having a stronger Te would also be nice, but I wouldn't give up my Si for it; I'd rather have a massive backlog of information and experience to evaluate my ideas against and refine my values with than the ability to structure and organize things in an "objective" way (whatever that's supposed to mean coming from a human). My Te is decent anyway, except for in times of crisis, as is a common enough thing for those INFPs who forced themselves through the education system.\n\nAs for sticking to developing the whole system, based on the ENXPs I've met, it's actually a lot harder for them than you would think. As in, they basically can't, no matter how hard they try. They aren't even necessarily aware it's incomplete, because it's functional, and because they'd rather move on to the next thing. Which isn't bad necessarily, but it is worth noting. We all assume the things we do best are easy, because they are easy for us, but that's rarely actually true for other people. That thing you're better at? It's not the tiny, trivial thing you make it out to be. It's wonderful and needed, just as much as theirs. Theirs might be flashier, but since when does flash matter?\n\nYou mention talking to people as well. I imagine that ENTPs might have an easier time talking to people than INTPs, given the presence of a higher Fe, and ENFPs might do better than INFPs as a result of higher Te. Ne and general extroversion probably don't hurt either.\n\nThat being said, it should still be entirely possible for you to talk to people and develop meaningful relationships. The trick is identifying people who want to talk to you, who are interested in the same subjects you are, and more importantly, who possess reasoning and communication styles which are compatible with your own. It can be difficult at first, especially if you come from a "conventional" environment. But you know what? If you can't be comfortable in a conventional environment, that's perfectly alright. Buck the convention. Find your own counterculture. If it doesn't exist, make it. It's not always easy, but it can be done; I've done it, after all, and if I of all people can figure it out, I'm sure you can.\n\nSo, no. I'm not jealous of ENFPs. I think a lot of them are great people, and I'm glad they exist, but I'd rather be the best person I can while remaining fundamentally myself than become someone else who honestly, would have their own insecurities and problems anyway.
2	I sometimes wonder if I am an ENFP. How it works for me is if I am with someone 1 on 1 I can be talkative, especially if they have a positive demeanor, this includes strangers. If it is a 1 on 1 and they have a negative/nasty demeanor then I wont talk to them at all unless absolutely necessary. If it is a group setting and I do not know them then I will hang out in the back and observe, only talking if spoken to directly. If it is a group situation with friends I am usually asking questions non stop. I feel like I am in between introverts and extraverts. 
2	No. Never has crossed my mind. 
2	I envy the energy they get from being with people.  \n\nAs an INFP I feel like I am more sedate and deliberate.  
2	No. x100000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	No. 
1	Not jealous, but they are my favorite types to be around by far. Have three amazing ENFPs in my life and they are just amazing. 
7	The problem.	The problem with us, fragile and out-of-this-world, is that we have to contradict ourselfes so often that it is hard to understand who we are and why. You have to be strong to be fragile. You have to be sad to be happy. You have to live grey life to dream. You have to be empty to be full.  It is just logical, but only we are crossing the line so often. Society, the people, we don't belong to them. Noone wants diffrent worlds, noone wants to see world as it is, as we see it.  If you dare to dream you dare to say this world is not enough. You see and feel more. And people don't like it. The good and old ostracism. These days we are the outsiders. We have to fight this modern machine everyday because it is ment to be sensless, to be empty and we are not. People just don't know we can be both. We can create and we can destroy. I loved this world but no more. I will care for it, as always, but these day I just feel like empty reversed hitman. I just fix things, give some empathy and go next. Nothing there for me. I am on a mission.  Nothing much. \n\nTo sum up this sudden attack of toughts that i will post despite having thousands of pictures, drawings, poems and novels that i never posted because yet I have to be strong to show that indeed i am fragile and I am making art. One day. My last contradiction is that i live this life, i feel so much yet i believe it is all meaningless because it all just ends. Why would someone make me feel and see so much yet make mebelive that it is pointless? Yeah we are here and now and we should embrace it but why? Noone will remember, noone will know.
4	You’re a great writer. We need more people like you in this world, to shake things up.\n\nI fucking love outsiders, but I realise that no matter how much I preach to people about The Velvet Underground they are always going to be overlooked, or in the corner of the public eye. The reason being they did not put themselves here to be appreciated by the masses. They - (my favourites) Burroughs, Kerouac, Thoreau, Emily Dickinson.. will forever be outsiders because their intention was and is to represent us.\n\nYou are not alone and as sure as I remember, you remember. And others - no matter how rare - will remember. \n\nIt’s like over the weekend I was in Mallorca, and this old dude who owned this bookshop was moaning to me about “how nobody reads anymore” and “they’re all on their phones” and in my head I was like “Hey, I’m here.. I’m talking to you! I read books, my soul is from the fucking 70s!”\n\n\n\nAttack of thoughts... Yes, your attack of thoughts triggered the same in me.\n
4	"If you dare to dream you dare to say this world is not enough. You see and feel more. And people don't like it."  Very well said!  You are a phenomenal writer!
3	By being out-of-this-world we are more in touch with reality than all of the people focused on the practical - a popular illusion, the popularity of which disguises its illusory nature. We are taught, trained, molded in such a way as to disregard and let atrophy the imagination unless it can prove itself to be of economic use, yet isn't it the ultimate act of make-believe to believe and act as if the world really is the drab, lifeless world of survival? If the truth is that nothing matters, we all die, there's no master plan, well, what are we doing wasting our lives following empty dreams that are not our own, working jobs we don't care about, devoting our lives to a social game that leaves us unfulfilled while simultaneously reinforcing the hegemony of this *realistic* worldview eclipses all others, which kills even the possibility for beautiful, rich, infinitely deep experiences - the attempt to try to scrape some meaning out of our time here - and just so happens to be doing a remarkable job killing the planet too? This is the difference between active and passive nihilism.
2	Great writing. It’s so true. I’ve been thinking about this a lot. I contradict myself a lot, but it makes total sense to me in my head. It’s hard that other people don’t understand, but I guess I would never really want to change that about myself. I’m learning to be okay being an outsider. “On the outskirts. On the fringes. On the edge and off the avenue.” \n(I wonder if Suzanne Vega is INFP).
5	Fellow INFPs, what are you majoring in? How'd you come to declare your major?	I'm planning on majoring in Communication with a concentration in Technical Writing or Media Arts and I wanted to hear some of your stories. \n\nI was originally on track to be a CS major because most of my peers were all about that STEM life and it seemed like it could lead to a profitable career. In the end, I learned that I suck at coding and I don't enjoy STEM courses all that much. \n\nNow here I am, about to major in Communication at a Tech school of all places. 
4	Formally, I'm majoring in the Liberal Arts and Sciences, but because my school is weird, I'll have to pick a focus area next year, which defines what I'm actually studying most intensely.\n\nIn high school, I wanted to major in Physics, because I thought that was what intelligent people did. Looking back, while I could've handled the material just fine, that would be a deeply unsatisfying life for me. I kind of drifted around for a while, and I currently have many things I could see myself majoring in; journalism, political science, literature, drama, history, sociology, women's studies (I know, it's a cliche, but I do like the courses I've taken in it), creative writing...\n\nWhen I really think about it, though, it looks like my choice is going to be philosophy. Of all fields I've looked at, it's the one that manages to keep my interest the longest, and I love the way in which it allows me to look at everything and draw connections between them. Specifically, I love to go deep into moral philosophy and investigate the countless different ethics and values across the centuries, all in the name of creating a better set of beliefs for the future.\n\nSo, yeah. Liberal Arts and Sciences slash Philosophy. Why? Because it works where nothing else really does, and that's a good enough reason as any right now.
5	I went to an art school for 3d modeling and animation, cuz I always loved art and wanted to work in the games industry.\n\nNow I work as an automation engineer at a big bank. I'm not even that great at coding and wish I got a cs degree to learn more. I'm scared that it'll be hard to find another job with my art degree. Thankfully my current job is pretty chill and it pays well enough so I can constantly go out with friends, freely travel, and buy anything I want.\n\nI look at the game industry and I'm glad I didn't join that with all the stories of layoffs, shutdowns, and slave labor. \n\nI don't wanna discourage you in any way from what you want to do, but that is my story.
4	Literature. I’ve wanted to teach high school English since sophomore year ish of high school. 
3	Probably English with Creative Writing concentration. I don’t really know where it’ll lead to tbh. Good luck!
3	International business because I loved learning languages and dreamed of moving all over the world. Now after graduating I've learned my career will be a lot more "business" than "international" which isn't very fulfilling, but we'll see where it takes me. If I could do it over again I'd be a liberal arts kid for sure. 
3	Education, I first majored in Political science but o struggled if you are looking for a good major busniess is always solid.
3	I'm currently majoring in applied mathematics. I came to the decision sometime in high school - I saw the beautiful structure that mathematics follows, as well as how the logic flows.\n\nYeah, I know it's not a typical "INFP" thing to be interested in, but I found the level of abstraction to have its own merits. Plus, it's not like you get married or attached to any of the ideas you study in mathematics, and there's no real "morally wrong" aspect of it, so it's nice. Nobody can really do something that's truly "wrong" because it's 100% logic-based.
2	I'm still a junior in high school, but I plan to major in Equine Management at the University of Wisconsin, River Falls. \n\nI've always loved animals, but I couldn't be a vet bc I would hate to see them sick / in pain. Or, even worse, bare the responsibility of having to put any down. \n\nI absolutely adore horses, although my favorite animal is wolves. I thought about studying wolves in the wild as a career, but most of that job is writing papers, etc. I've considered wildlife photography, but it's incredibly difficult to make money as an amateur just starting out. \n\nMy plan is to work for others for a brief time out of college, saving enough money to acquire land and horses of my own. From there, I'll give lessons, lead trail rides, etc to earn money. I'll be my own boss, be surrounded by horses, and enjoy every second of my career. I may not make much money, but I'd rather be truly happy & passionate about what I do than rich and miserable. Follow your dreams, work hard for them, surround yourself with people you love, and I believe you'll be happy in life!\n\n
2	Oh, I nearly had the same path. I took programming classes in high school, but after a while I got bored of it due to being poorly taught. So I then applied to college as an advertising major. As I got closer to school starting, I started having doubts about a career in advertising due to my standards of advertising being way higher than most sloppy ads thrown on the television. I may want to learn copywriting later on. That sounds like an extremely fun job.\n\nAlso, I'm fine working in groups, but I am terrible at networking. I don't know how I would survive such a competitive market.\n\n I looked back on what I knew, and I chose Information Technology. It seemed to line up perfectly with my previous classes. I am not much of a math person, but I can code decently. Coding isn't hard, but it can be pretty annoying if you don't understand it. Anyway, I'm not going into IT to be a programmer. There's already plenty of that. I heard from one software engineer that 90% of IT is working with clients to determine what they are looking for, and the last 10% is in the actual coding work. Also, technical writing is interesting, but it's strange. It's like taking the writer out of the writing and leaving it with soulless text. \n\nI am still trying to find what I'll do with the major, but I don't think I'll regret my choice.
1	How interesting... I majored in Communication and minored in Publishing. I am now a graphic designer / marketing manager. I started school thinking I would major in Psychology or English but ended up switching to Communication as I thought it would get me a job easier. Plus it's more interesting and focused. I tried to do CS and did one or two courses and failed miserably as I, too, suck at coding. \n\nIf I could do it again, I would go to a tech school and get more practical skills in marketing/design instead of university.
4	Hello I’m new to this sub!	So I’m basically going through a re-evaluation of what type I am since my social anxiety makes it hard for me to know whether I’m an introvert or extrovert (up until today I was sure I was an enfp) but I think, at least for now, I’m an infp. And btw, this sub is so lovely all the posts are sweet.
2	I too am not sure if I’m enforcing or infp, but I think I fit in well with this community, and I’m sure you will too! :)
46	Anyone else enjoys looking at the sky? Something about the sky just makes me relaxed and maybe because... majority of the time I’m off day dreaming h a h >>	
7	All day . I love the skies
5	A blue sky is heavenly to me, makes me so happy. I live in the UK and we get a lot of pale grey skies 😏
5	Yes. Looking at the sky makes me think that there's more out there than whatever I'm dealing with on the ground.
5	I love looking at the moon. My friends have basically made it a meme because I always point out how big and beautiful the moon looks lol
3	Yes. It’s the best. ❤️
2	Ayeee.. Though I connect more with the night sky. Cliche. But I live on a island quite a bit away from major towns. So very little light pollution. So when the skies are clear. It's breath taking.\nJust makes you think what's up there in the beyond.\n\nPs.\n\nIts 4am. I'm doing it right now. I wanna stay like this forever. 
4	INFPs are more likely to be abstract artists while ISFPs are more likely to be good at realism	just an idea. any thoughts?
4	I’m an infp who does both, my realism is probably my strongest work because I’m so analytical and a huge perfectionist but I do enjoy abstract I just struggle to be sure in what I’m producing when I do it 
3	Can confirm. I very much enjoy painting abstract art. There is something deeply satisfying about creating meaning and beauty out of chaos. 
3	I think the connotations of "intuitive" and "sensor" can lead one to make these sorts of connections. You'll no doubt find plenty of evidence to back it up, but also plenty to prove it wrong.\n\nHere's my anecdotal 2 cents: I have come across plenty of [probable] isfps in fine and performing arts, and music. Plenty of [probable] infps in creative writing, philosophy, and humanities. Hella overlap as well. 
3	i mostly do abstract art and doodling as i find it calming and carefree, but i'll occasionally do some realism (though i'm not the best at it)
15	Honor yourself.	Life is meaningless... most people know this. Nonetheless, what’s even more meaningless is dwelling on the fact that life is meaningless. Even if life did have meaning, what would that even look like? Can you even begin to think of anything that’s more meaningful than life itself? If life has lost lost its luster, this means you have woken up. That right there is the real gift of life... to know that you will die one day, and to realize the extreme importance of your own romantic convictions. Your life is yours, and the only one holding you back is yourself.
9	"Life has no meaning. Each of us has meaning and we bring it to life. It is a waste to be asking the question when you are the answer." -Joseph Campbell
5	The meaning of life is to handle knowledge in the utmost preserved care and the ability to pass it on to the next generations of life. \n\nThe above in the most broad sense comprehensible.
2	There is no meaning of life, but there can be meaning to life. \n\nSave your post for posterity, OP. 
10	I could hug you people	So freakin adorable.
9	That sounds pleasant and uncomfortable in equal measure. So instead I offer an awkward high five.
7	Really?
6	i'll hug you!
4	u cute
6	Forced myself to go talk to a cute girl that works at the library today; want to get to know her, but not sure how best to approach it	For context, I’m a 20 year old guy at college, and I’m one of those people who just can’t study in their own home, I’ll inevitably turn my Xbox on or sit on Netflix for hours instead. Recently I’ve started going to my local library to force myself to do some fucking work. Today I managed to drag myself down there, and while I was studying one of the girls who works there walked by me.  And holy shit. It’s been a looooong time since I’ve done a double take like that after laying eyes on someone for the first time. Like obviously I notice when a girl is attractive and might even be a bit intimidated by them being good looking, but this was just insane. I’ve been spending like a year slowly getting over my best friend (whole other story). She was probably the first person I’ve properly ‘fallen in love’ with, and we’re still really great friends, but it’s been a massive struggle accepting it’s probably just not meant to be like that between us. I’ve had little flirtations with other people since I met her, but nobody else has really caught me eye.\n\nThat is until today. I felt like I was in fucking high school again trying to sneak little glances at some girl I was crushing on in my class. I honestly couldn’t keep my eyes off her. I sat there trying to study, but I really just couldn’t concentrate. Eventually I done something that is completely out of character for me; I forced myself to go talk to her. I basically never find an excuse to talk to a girl no matter how attracted I am to them, even on drunken nights out the only times I’ve really got anywhere with anyone they’ve approached me first. I just don’t have the confidence, even when blind drunk, to go up to some random girl and say hi. It fucking terrifies me. I can never do it.\n\nBut today something just kinda came over me. I just felt like I had to go at least try something, and it was just stupid not to. I stood up in the middle of writing an essay, started pretending to look through the books on the shelves, and picked one to loan out just so I had an excuse to go talk to her (it’s the first Dark Tower book which I’ve already read before lmfao, I was literally just looking for any excuse to go say hi). \n\nI’m not gonna sit and pretend I went up and asked her out or anything crazy like that; I feel like asking a girl out while she’s working is an insanely awkward situation for them, and either way I’d never have the balls to try that. We just done the usual ‘can I see your library card, you have like a month to bring it back, etc.’ polite talk, nothing special, I was so fucking nervous that I couldn’t think of literally anything else to say to her. I’ve not been like that around a girl in years.\n\nHonestly though, I’m proud of myself for pushing myself to go talk to her, even if it was such a simple conversation and I left like no impression on her. I’m there all the time to study so I’m sure I can come up with some other excuse to try break the ice. What would be the best way to approach this and try get to know her without seeming like a complete creep? I know when people are working the last thing they want is some random guy trying to hit on them, but at the same time I do really want to see if I can find a way to get to know her.
3	I'd start by asking her name. Then whenever she passes by start saying hi to her and/or how she is doing. Do that for a few days so she is familiar with you. And then when you do go up to her ask her things like what's her major, where is she from, favorite book, etc. At least that way you're less of a stranger to her. Then when she is more comfortable with you, ask her out. At least that's how i'd do it so I don't look like a creep coming out of nowhere asking her out. Oh and don't forget to smile or look friendly so you don't look intimidating, and look her in the eyes when you can. Exude confidence.
2	I am in the same situation with a library cute guy. Except we talked a bit more and he is nice all the time but I am just so nervous that I can’t have a long conversation XD
1	I don’t understand why guys are shy,I think I was a Don Juan in a past life,life is incredibly short I would just walk up to her and say have you met your soulmate yet? Would get an interesting discussion going.
1	I'm twenty too I know the way it feels.
1	Maybe comment on one of her displayed interests. A book, a laptop sticker, or a pin on her bag. As long as it's not disingenuous, it should get a conversation going. 
1	I suggest to ask her for book recommendations! A great way to get to know someone is through the literature they read
0	Asking this in a INFP sub isn’t really your best bet i guess haha \n\nBut the story you told us is for me really relatable, was a nice read :)\n\nFor advice I would go to another sub where people know more about this stuff tho 😁
9	Does anyone else find the ENFP girls the most attractive of all?	they are nice and mentally stimulating, also warm and talkative without loosing their individuality. they're the only extroverts with  whom i can watch a lot of series during a lot of time, even fights are fun and entertained. rainbows flow everywhere.
4	I do! ENFPs get me out of my shell without being pushy about it!

2	The ramblings of a fanboy. I dont know where else to go, someone here may appreciate this...	(I don't really know where else to go to share this and everyone here is cool so fuck it) I just found out that Dan Auerbach from the Black Keys worked with the growlers to produce my 2 favorite growlers albums... I just think it's insane that I've been in love with both The Black keys and the growlers forever and I'm just finding this out now. Thanks in advance for tolerating my rambling.
2	Thickfreakness was on heavy rotation for the longest time. I loved Brothers, and their El Camino was pretty top notch as well! I also adored Auerbach's solo project: When the Night Comes gives me all the feels!

3	How to breathe when your crush is talking to you	Guys seriously omg. We start talking and it’s fine and he is gorgeous and I melt when he smiles but my heart is all messed up and I can’t breathe properly XD\nIt’s very ridiculous and I hope it goes away as I get used to him talking to me and I laugh at myself so much as soon as he goes away, but it really seems I can’t help it. \nI am not used to having crushes so this is so new and funny but frustrating at the same time.  I am always so nervous omggg \nJust wanted to share.\nThought you guys might relate and laugh with me. Also I stuttered and wanted to die XD
4	I never got used to it. Probably the reason why it didn’t work out. So if you want it to work, perhaps don’t put him on a pedestal. He’s only human and definitely has flaws, even if you choose to ignore them at first. Don’t give him too much undeserved credit. He may get too comfortable and start taking you for granted. 
3	If you don't get used to that it's love...;) Have fun and hang in there it will be good.
3	This is so cute 😁 \n
3	This is nice to hear that even girls get nervous when talking to their crushes.

456	Does anybody else ever upvote things before even looking at what they are just because you want people to feel supported and validated?	Its a weird thing I do, and sometimes I don't even notice I'm doing it. I'll go back and actually read them after I've upvoted them, and if I really like them I'll leave a positive comment. If its something awful or mean, I'll take away the upvote. 
62	I do this. Consider yourself a nice person because of this comment. :) 
27	I normaly put a lot of thought into what i give upvotes, I give upvotes to nice/ well meaning posts though.
21	I just tend to not down vote. I up vote if like the content. I don't if I don't like it. The only down votes I give are rare and only for posts or comments that are truly malicious in nature. 
11	What was this post about?
12	I do this for any art or creative (game dev) posts. Because I want to support them. Perhaps because I know what it's like to not have confidence in the things you do. 
8	Sometimes if I see a comment is at 0 but is a reasonable thing/within the sub context I’ll rescue it and give the poster back their one karma. I can’t remember when I started doing that but now it’s a private habit while on Reddit. 
7	I especially do it in this subreddit, I've always been very self conscious about what I post online to the point where I almost never post anything anymore, it's nice to know that there's a lot of people in this subreddit who feel the same and want to make others know we're on on each other's side 
6	Have an upvote on a post about giving upvotes! Haha! Here ya go. And yes I do this too. (Enfp)
5	Get. Out. Of. My. Head.
5	I made a post about this about a month ago, haha! :)
4	yes lol
4	Sometimes i do this where I will sort by new, and look for posts people clearly put a little bit of time into but dont have many upvotes. I like to upvote and maybe comment to try and get their post movin :)
4	I used to upvote literally every post I came across for this reason. Kind stoped though... idk why
4	Fuck..  yup... you got my number... I just want people to know they are heard..
3	Yes
3	Have an upvote, don't know what you said, didn't finish it but I hope you feel supported!
3	> If its something awful or mean, I'll take away the upvote\n\nOkay, it makes much more sense this way.\n\nAt first I was like, "That's just chaotic neutral!"  :P
3	I did that to this post. I'm just now coming back a few minutes later to comment, and I still haven't read the post description.
3	i really should upvote more\n\nim too lazy to click the upvote button
2	Yeah I upvote nearly everything unless it’s downright offensive and wrong. In that case I tend to just leave it alone.
2	Oh my god, Yes I do it, specially with the ones that get 0 in the votes. I only downvote 3 people since I use reddit, i remember that I downvoted a guy that was insulting every man in the world because they are "disgusting" and "perverts", etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwith the 99.5% I upvote just to support the person. I can get mad when someone is saying something really unfair, but I usually understand people even when they are unfair.
2	Not exactly, but I do a similar thing that probably stems from INFP-ish traits: I'm mostly passive on Reddit in terms of voting, but when I upvote it's pretty much always to take comments from 0 to 1.
2	I only upvote content that is good to me. The way upvotes work popularizes good content which in turn spreads the most joy. Improving many lives over the one. \n\n(Btw FWIW I'm not an INFP)
2	Nope not at all haha. I swear I’m getting dangerously close to INTP territory...
2	No but I upvote rude jerky comments and downvote people calling them petty jerks.
5	I failed chem in the first semester at the Uni. Not sure how to deal with the feeling of being singled out.	All my friends who live with me passed (barely) but I failed. I acted as if I didn't care much but when I saw people calling home telling their families that they got good marks and stuff, I felt so terrible. I too wanted to call home like yes, I passed but now all I'm doing is trying to hide my sadness under the a fake smile that I don't care. Now I have to appear for the retest in December this year and prepare everything on my own. I don't know why I'm envious of everyone who's calling home and their friends saying how they passed. My GPA is super low and I'm afraid if I'll  be able to get into a better graduate program or will I be able to get an internship abroad. Above all I don't know how to deal the feeling of being the only one left behind. What do I do?\n\nFor contest, I'm Asian and studies matter a lot here.
2	Hey, one of my best friends is also studying chemistry and just failed one her exams. She also always doubts her abilities and such, and the only thing I'm telling her is to wait; it's only the first semester. You will get better over time and as you can see, you're definitely not alone, so don't put yourself down that much, it's not a big deal. I'm sure you'll do better the second time, after all you have the experience of the first :) \n\nJust don't procrastinate too much :D
49	This sub is toxic	Before you get mad let me explain. I have been following this sub for a while now and I’ve become deeply saddened by it. I got into MBTI a few years back during a huge depressive low point in my life.(like many others on this sub) When I first found out I was an INFP and found this subreddit it gave me meaning and an outlet like little else had before. I very quickly labeled myself as an INFP, I fit into every description of the type. I was the “special snowflake”, “the creative,” and  “the deeply introspective.” If someone were to ask me who I was, I’d say an INFP. I followed this thinking for a little over a year.\n\nDuring that year, I as a person did not progress, if anything I degressed. I became obsessed with my INFPness. I blamed everything I thought and did on being an INFP. I was no longer a complex multidimensional person, I was just an INFP. \nLuckily through good relationships outside of the sub I realized above all... people are people. As soon as you label yourself or someone as something other than a person you/they become closer to objects than people with infinite potential. This sub feeds heavily into dehumanizing people into types. YOU ARE NOT AN INFP. YOU ARE NOT BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE BECAUSE YOUR’E TYPE. YOU ARE NOT MORE SPECIAL THAN ANYONE ELSE BECAUSE YOUR TYPE, you are a complex amazing human being. This sub has a lot of outstanding qualities and it’s helped me a lot, I’ve met great people and have received great support but I implore you to learn from my mistakes, fix this sub, and realize you are not an infp, you’re something infinitely better(:\n\nWith much love,\nModernAbacuz\n
53	So let’s sound the horn again on MBTI:\n\nIf you use MBTI to base your identity in, **you’re doing it wrong.**\n\nMBTI is just a tool to help understand yourself better, not as a means of defining yourself with, inflating your ego with, or whatever.
49	Nah this sub is fine. Just because you romanticized this sub/being INFP, doesn't mean everyone else does too. 
17	Classic infp projecting their values onto other people lol.
15	yeah no, haven't seen anything "toxic" about this sub yet. Just because you based your entire identity around being an infp doesn't mean this sub is encouraging that. it's literally just a sub to share things which you think other people who *might* be like you will understand & relate too. \n\nIt's most definitely important to see yourself & others as people & to have important relationships with all kinds of ppl no matter their type. And i think most people on this sub understand that. \n\nIf nothing else, this sub provides a safe space for infps to share thoughts, art, opinions etc coz i think infps are naturally inclined to feel more safe amongst a smaller group who might be like minded. \n\nHaven't seen any elitism on this sub yet. 
29	You're right. However the mbti system just categorizes personality types, as long as we realize that that's all these labels are and don't try to personify them to the extent of losing ourselves, they can be quite useful as tools to find like-minded people. After all it's quite useful to be able to just say that I fit the INFP type pretty well than to have to explain every detail of my personality to someone in conversation. That's the purpose of labels after all; a general description that makes it easier to describe yourself to others. \n\nIt's the same with gender and sexuality; I describe myself as gay for instance, but in truth my attraction is much more complex than just being attracted to people of the same sex. I don't let the labels I choose to define my identity, define who I am and whom I wish to become. But that does not mean that they aren't useful to have. They also help us to sort out the mess that identity can be in our minds.\n\nSo to conclude; labels, like the mbti personality types, are useful when used correctly. They should not define our identity, they should be used to describe our identity to others. At least this is the conclusion I've come to after much introspective thought about it.
7	tl;dr - this sub is like Vegemite and should be enjoyed in small dabs, lest the saltiness overwhelm you\n\nAs many of the commenters here have already mentioned: if you're basing your entire existence on being an INFP, you're likely to be doing it wrong. The reason is because it's merely an *indicator,* a mark of what things you *prefer.* By all rights I should be a writer or artist or photographer yet I'm training to be in the hard sciences because I like doing that too. I actually did the (properly administered) test and this was the gist of my conversation with the person who administered it.\n\nThe MBTI is supposed to show you which things you're naturally attracted to, or which things you may be a bit uncomfortable with. It (psychological validity is another question entirely) tells you for example, how you're likely to behave in social situations, but that's not at all the same as how you *will* behave. Only you can determine that.\n\nNow you comment that the INFP sub has a lot of INFP-ness to it, which is a bit confusing to me because at face value that seems to be the entire *purpose* of the sub. For me, I see it as a place to examine those parts of your personality (and the results, i.e. poetry, prose, art!) that the MBTI throws up. But like pretty much like anything else taken to excess, if you stay around in here for too long, you focus on those aspects more - whether that's a good thing or not depends on context. In your case, I would argue that just because you find those aspects overwhelming is no reason to say the sub is toxic - simply that moderation in looking at those aspects of your personality is probably best.\n\nYou get a bit of a choice in what labels do and don't define you. If you find that the INFP label doesn't adequately define you - fantastic! It means you have room to grow and reach out, and explore, and try to get comfortable with different situations in life. Just because the mirror reflects (foggily) you at the moment is no reason to break the mirror, more a reason to think, 'is this who I really am?' And if not, why does it say that, in what situations do I need to improve, and in which areas do I need to be less harsh on my self? I find that personally seeing it as a tool for self-improvement is the best use of the MBTI and actually jibes with your interpretation somewhat.\n\nStay positive :)
15	Oh. It's that time of year again. Another post complaining about the sub. These kind of posts are so much more annoying than any other post on this sub.  \nPeople want their space to vent and chill. Just let it be what it is, stop trying to force your own agenda. 
6	It's a description of people, not a definition. I see people mixing the two up with every thing--astrological signs, sexuality, gender, mental conditions, MBTI, skin color, country of orgin, the list goes on. The trick is not to identify, but to use it as a tool to learn about your self, and describe your self if need be. But don't define your self with this. 
17	Count the I's in your text and then go shame yourself somewhere for trying to project your thoughts and feelings onto other people and let them think they are the same as you are.
6	Actually yes, I agree to an extent at least. I think the problem is much more widespread though. Just like any system that tries to categorize and label people, there is also always the danger of boxing people in and making that label become your identity. Whether it be the Enneagram, MBTI types, or any other kind of personality system its just that - a system. Sometimes it can feel really good to feel like you belong to something and to be able to make sense of yourself and the world through a certain lens but I like the metaphor of colors. I once heard the MBTI types described as colors: red, orange, yellow, green, etc. Obviously, there are only so many colors just as there are types but there is an infinite amount of shades and hues. Each person is unique and is there own mix within that color, if that makes sense. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that it doesn't take a subreddit to be toxic, but rather our own interpretations and what we do with the information. Don't mistake this as me blaming you or something like that but I see the problem everywhere, including within myself. I'm glad you were able to overcome it though! I don't think it has to be dehumanizing but certainly if you're feeling like that, it's important to take a step back and figure out why, as you did. Indeed we are all equal and also special in our own ways all at once and I suppose that's the beauty of it all. 
5	This is the danger with any group formed around a shared interest, unfortunately. I remember a similar dynamic becoming a problem with groups I was in in college and with Buddhist groups I used to be a part of.\n\nWhile I agree with your caution to people here not to become too invested to the point where they're closed-minded and see people only as letters, I don't think this specific group poses that risk any more than any other I've seen. 
3	Life is complex, labels allow you reduce complexity and make the ride less confusing.\n\nI don’t think many here believe being superior to other types. See the intj/infj for that :)\n\n\n
3	I understand what you mean and I agree MBTI definitely *can* be toxic depending on how one applies it.\n\nI think it's best to use MBTI to explain and understand people and **not** as an excuse for poor behavior. My INTP friend is generally intelligent, but she is very into MBTI and constantly uses her type as an excuse for her negative traits and outright selfish behavior. It's as if it would be impossible for her to improve herself because she is an INTP and that's 'how they are.'\n\nIt's important to remember that while certain types might be more prone to a certain behavior or way of thinking, both total jerks and wonderful people alike exist of every type and you should still strive to improve yourself. I think it's possible to use MBTI to better understand others, recognize where you yourself are lacking, and actually work on improving yourself. However, there are some people who use it to stunt their growth as a person and assume that any shortcoming that someone sees in them is exclusively *their problem* ***because that's just how \[x\] MBTI type is***. It's a really awful and easy mindset to fall into. You will push away those close to you who are confronting you because they care about you (and possibly your relationship with them) enough to do so.\n\nI've definitely been guilty of this myself in the past, but I'd like to think I've become a lot more self aware in the past couple of years. I know it sounds cliche and silly, but if you treat life as a journey in which you try to become the best you that you can be, it will not only benefit yourself, but those around you as well. That's what I've come to believe, anyway. And I'm far from perfect myself, so I don't mean to sound preachy. It's just something I've been trying to work towards and it feels relevant to this topic.\n\nIn any case, while I agree with your points, I wouldn't go as far as to call this subreddit toxic. As you've stated, many of the people in it are very well-meaning. Can someone use MBTI to excuse their own toxic behavior and develop a toxic mindset because of it? Yes. Anyone can. They could probably use other labels to do the same thing too, such as mental illnesses, sexuality, race, gender, etc. That being said, I don't really think you should single out INFPs, as other types (and their subs) are just as guilty as giving people that kind of mindset.\n\nI enjoyed reading your perspective and I do think this is an important issue to keep in mind. Thank you for sharing! Most of all, I'm really glad you managed to pull out of that hole you described -- it is not an easy realization to make!
3	I remember the first time I did the test and I read the description of the INFP. And I remember bawling my eyes out, because so much of it was so extremely recognisable. I didn’t feel ‘weird’, or ‘odd’, or ‘wrong’ like I’ve so often felt when I was younger because of other people’s comments. I felt like I did make some sense apparently! :D\n\nAnd the thought struck me that there are others who think and feel similarly. Not the same, but somewhere on the same frequency. That blew my mind. \n\nSo personally, I feel a place like this is amazing, as people can share some of that inner turmoil, creativity, crazy joy and random philosophical questioning, and open up on a lot of the things that are not always touched upon in daily life.\n\nI get your point, but I think it all boils down to the individual and their choice whether it confirms for them they can stay where they are or whether they can find empowerment and insight to grow. There’s a time and place for both. And this place offers encouragement either way. People figure out what it is they need exactly in their own pace :).
2	Oh. I just subscribed. Should I stick to the mbti forums? I was kinda hoping this was a little like infpgc from ye olden days. Ah well.
2	yup I agree, it's important to realise that all of us are very unique and special personalities so it's almost never 100% correct when it comes to "labeling"... \n\nFor me I would say I am about 70/80% INFP and that's okay, why is this quite useful for me is to realise what are my strengths and weaknesses and quite often to find out how other personalities my perceive my behaviour. \n\nI believe that extremes are the worst in basically everything, and unfortunately on reddit it quite often happens. I am a fan of Keto diet so I was on their sub, and basically posted my progress with a title like "thank you, it's time to quite.." where I basically was really grateful and thanked everyone for the support etc.... and basically they acted like butthurt babies bashing me and blaming me how terrible I am and Keto is the best and I will regret leaving... etc... it was literally like a religious cult or sect haha, and they did not even read the article, they just say words "I quite" in my "favourite subreddit" so automatically I am an asshole and I am angry and butthurt.... people are the worst sometimes and that sux because I really never want to be rude or not nice to anyone but I am just way to often labeled as an asshole. \n\nBut anyway I get your point stay strong and do whatever makes you happy, good luck have a great day!
2	It shouldn't be used to justify behavior. It should be used to understand yourself and help you work around your limitations.
3	That's because the one thing we all have in common is we are INFPs. If you want something else to relate to go to a different sub. And most INFPs use this sub to vent/rant about things in their lives, that's why you see more sad posts than happy posts. Also it's your fault for seeing yourself as an object not us, I have never seen myself as just an INFP, so that's your bad.
1	I used to be an infp and now Im an infj, but I still relate to some of the stuff that is posted here, just like I do in the infj sub and in a lot of other personality types in general. It's not like you HAVE to box yourself into this category, there are plenty of subs for dealing with depression and mental health that people can seek out if they want to. As long as someone doesn't take it too far, like you did, this sub is not toxic at all. It's a fun place to relate to others who MAY or MAY NOT have similar life experiences and values. Even though most people in this group ARE infp's, they're all still individuals and wildly different in many ways. I think it's healthy to try to understand yourself better by learning about your brain, and I think if there's a superiority complex there like you described, then that's an unrelated problem that needs solving. 
1	I'm an INTP cusp so I know I'm a lil insensitive, but how does your self-concept make this sub toxic? Get a grip..
1	Ty for posting this OP
1	This INFP begs to differ:\nhttps://reddit.app.link/vYimnraeKU\n\nIt's really a matter of perspective. Real talk: I tend to do the same thing you do (with romanitcizing the seemingly intangible) because I don't yet know who I am. And because I don't know where to start my journey and fear failure, I let four letters run my life and expect it to make me feel better when I do mess up. \n\nLearn from me and don't do this. It will save you from an unnecessary struggle. Put that struggle where it matters; relationships, self-improvement, being your best self/actualization, etc.
1	If you don't like it here, go find another sub. Don't waste your time, do what you like and love
1	Personally I’ve been dealing with depression and this sub helps me embrace my weirdness when some people have labeled me as the crazy one  for sharing a dream I had or being less interested into concrete works etc... It made me more humble too when I discovered that I was not this girl with an unique way of thinking because I was not alone... Maybe you really relied on it in an unhealthy way ? I hope you’ll get better either way :)
7	Dating advice for a clueless 28 year old infp— yes this is where I get most of my dating advice (back off!)	Hey guys,\n\nAs you might see from my posting history, I like to ask dating advice from other infps. Mainly cause y’all are squishy and respectful and also because I don’t have a gaggle of girlfriends to tell me what to do (which is why my life will never be a romantic comedy).\n\nSo broke up with an entj after six months because he turned kind of possessive, pushy, and generally low key scary. Guy had a traumatic childhood, and it was hard to leave, but a single mom can’t be introducing possessive men to her kid— no matter how all those paperback bodice rippers portray Jack the FBI agent. \n\nSo a month goes by, and I started seeing a guy (either infp or infj, but definitely a type four with a five wing on the enneagram). He’s punk in an agreeably grown up way, and he plays bass, but he also had a job. Anyway— he was really excited to meet me and warm initially. Then after we met, we had a pleasant date and he said he was definitely going to “date me” (I assume that was meant to ease my mind after we had sex, but I don’t know 🤷🏻‍♀️) and we started seeing each other pretty regularly. \n\nBut here’s the thing— his demeanor sort of changed. Still texted me often and in a timely fashion. Lots of gifs and funny stories. But he stopped flirting really. It felt more like a bromance. Also I started having to initiate times to hang out. Also those times started to turn into very casual hang outs— which is fine, but also sort of a bad sign if you’re wanting to actually build a relationship around more than diners, Netflix, and sex. \n\nSo I just straight up asked him if he was interested in a potential relationship or if we were just killing time. His response: \n\n“Honestly, I’m not entirely sure. And that’s awkward to say. Cause I like hanging out and you’re not boring at all and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with you, but at the same time my brain is...dumb. That’s kinda the only way I can put it. I have a tendency to do this. Where I like someone and their company and everything else involved, but I’m simultaneously distant. Does that make sense at all? Cause I really feel like a dick about it cause you’re super sweet and...I’m this. Haha.\n\nAs far as I can tell, I think the last relationship burned out a lot of receptors on me. And/or I take after my dad who legitimately doesn’t have or want friends and he just spends his time alone. Kinda always has, especially after the parents split. Or I’m just using it as an excuse.\n\nBut...I don’t want you to think there isn’t chemistry or a spark or anything. Cause I don’t want that to come off like you’re not “good enough” or anything like that. I can’t think of anything I don’t like about you. I’m just not entirely sure what I want out of anything with anyone, I guess.\n\nBut if you’d like to step back from the “romantic” portions of this, I’ll support that decision. Or if you wanna keep hanging out and do the same things, that’s fine too. I’m the worst.\n\nBut right before we met I was having a REAL bad depressive episode that took like 3 weeks to pass, but I figured it was about time I tried something. \n\nBut like I said, I can’t think of anything I don’t like about you. Or why I WOULDNT date you in a more serious way. You’re sweet, incredibly wholesome, nice to be around, and you put up with my dumb jokes on a consistent basis. But there’s just some block in me mentally that I can’t explain. Regardless, I’m gonna feel like a dick over it cause...there’s nothing wrong with you or us. But I’d LOVE to see you happy and steady and everything. Sincerely. Cause I really think you deserve that.\n\nAt some point in the very near future I’ll regret sabotaging myself like this, but I don’t want to hold up you being happier. We can be best friends, though. And still hang out and get foods. And...you’re crazy if you think these terrible jokes will change. And...I made myself sad already. Haha.”\n\nEnd texts.\n\nSo I had myself a little cry. And retained my dignity. And told him we could still be friends (just friends), but only if he made us friendship bracelets. Mine must say, “baddest bitch” and his, just “bitch”\n\nAnyway, so he is now sooo flirty and warm and constantly texting me and stuff. And his demeanor has completely changed again! \nThis is the part where I behave like a grown up and leave it be, right?? I have a feeling he might be on his way to taking back his earlier confusion, but I /don’t/ trust that, riiiight???\n\nHelp. \n
10	Yeah it sounds like he doesn't know what he wants. Which ends up with him playing games with your emotions. That is a red flag. Him having depression and possibly co-dependent issues is also a red flag. Also there is the possibility he is not over his ex? What do you think? Do you want to stay friends? It is okay to say goodbye too because you could start to see someone who does want to be with you. There are other fish in the sea.
8	Run for the hills. This guy likes to play games. 
5	In his replied text he acknowledges your love, but that he himself is not ready. Your question was plain and simple, and his reply with "we can still be friends" marks the end of your and his advances toward a serious, healthy and stable relationship. I would end it here and now, even let the "friendship bracelet idea" take a hike.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that he's texting you with more nonsense only describes what he mentioned earlier. He acknowledges his own behavior. I fear that if you would let him continue in this manner, and you falling for it, you in the end would be a victim of his suffering. \n\nI hope you're able to make the right choice for yourself. 
3	The dude wants sex, and isn't wanting to man up. Ugh I know these dudes 😑😑😑😑😑\n\nYou deserve a man who's like "DATE YOU??? FUCK YEAH I'LL DATE YOU!!! YOU'RE THE BEST!!" A man who loves your humor and quietness and zaniness and lovely heart and the way you smile. A man who NEEDS to know you more and more, who cant get enough.\n\nI'm serious. They're out there, and they will find you one day.\n\nLife is too short to waste on the ones who dont say "FUCK YEAH!" to the awesomeness and beauty that is YOU. \n\nIt sucks, when we really like them. But I promise you, the ones who are worth the heart, know you're worth it too. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
3	I would steer clear of this guy. You're an infp. You know he'll destroy you. 
3	Were you dating my ex? Seriously 😐 
39	Life’s been a little rough. Tried to draw how I feel.	
3	Damn this hits home in every way. Great job!
3	Oh, honey. (((hug)))
79	There’s a part of me that is so angry it feels numb, this is really different from my normal art, but was trying to show contempt and the heat of sadness and the chill of bitter anger, and how it all feels washed out because it’s so deeply buried in me now.	
2	Thank you for showing us a glimpse of how you feel, i know when we try to express ourselves the emotions are so multidimensional that we cant always put them together in a single image for others to see. The blank cavas around the images also speaks volumes about how much you wanted to put out but still couldn't...
2	Love it
1	I feel
1	Mom hugs for you right here.
1	This might be the best thing I have ever seen ever
1	👌sexy 💯

23	Better yet when it’s a thunderstorm with that low rumbling thunder. Cozy AF. 
15	Nestled in the cradle of time :)
6	You have no idea how that transported my very tired self from my desk right into my bed ❤
5	I listen to thunderstorms every Night on YouTube and if I wake up in the night I just don't look at the clock and assume I still have hours left. It's lowered my anxiety considerably
3	You were right.
2	One of the best feelings!
2	Yessss 😍😍😍
2	I wake up 45 minutes earlier than I need to each day in order to experience this. It's the best on weekends.
2	Then you wake up late for work. Aaaah
2	God, I love this subreddit.
1	If only I could sleep forever
1	Then your alarm wakes you up and you tell it to get fucked. 
1	Id love that sensation if I did not have any anxieties, worries and stuff going on on my mind. :( 
1	this!! but with the addition of my pups cuddling on my bed cuddling near me. it's complete bliss.
1	omg yes
6	Can you relate?	I recently found this community and am thoroughly enjoying it!\n\nI was curious to see if anyone on here as an INFP can relate to these or if it is just me:\n\nI have very vivid day dreams, sleep dreams and fantasies. I often don’t know if I dreamt something or if it really happened. I find myself imagining scenarios happening in my life, both good and bad. For example what would happen if I got into a car accident and was in the hospital or died. I’d come up with specific detail about how my husband would have conversations with my boss and family. I’d then “wake up” from my day dream and realize I didn’t pay attention to the last 30 mins of driving.\n\nI procrastinate everything. Everything! From waking up in the morning, to going to the bathroom, to waiting until very last minute before an appointment so I arrive RIGHT on time, to even going to sleep at night. I’ll literally lay there at night exhausted wth one eye open trying to finish going down a “recommended for you” YouTube rabbit hole of nothingness.\n\nI enjoy trying new ways to be creative and regularly draw, paint, cook, do pottery, make shirts, etc. but I feel like I am mediocre at all of it. I don’t have the drive to get really good at any of it and I tend to get bored of it quickly.\n\nI like having a lot of work projects on the go and would rather jump from project to project instead of finishing one thing before starting something new.\n\nI have a 9-5 type job as a graphic designer / marketing manager. I love my job as I get to be creative and enjoy the challenge of having goals/targets I need to meet. but I hate being bound to a traditional 9-5 job. The idea of climbing a corporate ladder doesn’t interest me and I hate the feeling of working away my life and spending so much wasted time doing nothing of “value”.\n\nI am very even tempered, quiet, reserved, inactive, soft spoken 90% of the time but I really enjoy doing high adrenaline adventures / activities like bungy jumping, sky diving, rappelling down buildings, cliff jumping, and I think it’s to balance out? I think I also like drinking alcohol because it gets me out of my shell and the “high” feeling.\n\n\nSo curious if anyone can relate to these and which ones!

3	Besides the job, I feel like I could have written that word for word. I work in a bakery and I hate it because  the pay and hours are terrible and it's not like everyone thinks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut yeah, I agree with you 100% on everything else. It's kind of creepy how accurate it is.

11	The quest for self	21 M American College student here and I wanna tell you that this specific Reddit thread right here pretty much saved my life. It gave me the inspiration power and drive to to one not kill myself two go out and find information that helped me figure out my dellimma and three helped me love and accept myself. We as info are made different from those that we surround ourselves with and sometimes it can be overwhelming but never give up because we are given this specific personality for a reason and its up to u to find it. This is my quest for self series I'm going to summarize my journey for the self and what events unfolded over the past eight months that put me in the spot I am in at this very moment.
3	Holy Hell....awesome to hear <3
1	20 M here from an American college. I want to hear your story
5	A Beatles cover I thought y’all might enjoy.	
19	We are the dreamers.	There's no one like us. When others can't see the way forward we don't pretend that we know what it is. But we know the things we've seen and we know things get better. It's in our nature I think as INFP's. I think my personality has changed a bit over the years but I'm really proud of being an INFP.\n\nI'm not perfect but I hope I practice what I preach, I hope that I'm just as hopeful as I tell everyone else to be. At the end of the day I try to put forth good energy into the world. I don't need anyone to remember my name. As long as I know I made a difference to at least one person, I think that's enough for me.\n\nThank you for this community :)
2	Amen
8	Does anybody else get small moments of loneliness?	Recently I’ve moved to the other side of the US because work I still talk to my old friends/family, and have a friend here however sometimes as night whenever I’m not talking to someone I feel alone. This is different as normally I enjoy the myself time with a bit of tea, but I’ve noticed it recently.
10	No, I’m lonely all the time.
1	I know what you mean. I recently visited a friend for 2 weeks that I don’t get to see very often, and when I came back home, it was almost like I left a piece of myself behind with him. I find loneliness is one of the hardest emotions to deal with, personally. \n\nI know it just means that I care and that I enjoy the company of other people, but it doesn’t help with sating the need for another persons presence.\n\nSome days are easier than others. Some days I may miss someone or want to hang out, but it doesn’t bother me if I can’t. Other days, i’m a sobbing mess from feeling isolated.\n\nIn the end, I just keep reminding myself that I will see them again and talk to them again, and that the emotions i’m feeling are very valid. I find telling them you miss them helps, and the other person tends to be touched that they are being missed.
1	Hey, if you feel lonely we have an INFP Telegram chat group where you can recharge a little from your loneliness. 
1	i get large amounts of loneliness all the time.

14	Dating ENFP	Please no negative stories. I know they're out there for every type pairing.\n\nI (infp, f) recently started dating an ENFP Male and.......WHERE HAS HE BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE.\n\nI was in a long term with my ex ISTJ. I loved him dearly, but a huge chunk of my soul went untouched.\n\nBut wowsers. Enfps, eh? What freaking gems.
6	i love ENFPs, they’re one of the only types that I feel understand me!
2	Those wacky sons of guns are so much fun. Also, that easy emotional intimacy is like catnip, eh? Other pluses includes the tangent hopping conversations, interspersed with dives into some abstract topics. Oh, and the willingness to try new things and go exploring is such a gift!\n\nThe pros make the cons tolerable
2	I have been with my ENFP boyfriend for 5 years and I honestly feel like he’s my other half, he’s my best friend and i can talk to him about anything! I’m an infp and I usually just listen when people talk to me and i don’t mind it, but i don’t feel comfortable sharing my thoughts and opinions with others that I’m not close with. But with my man I can rant for HOURS! He’s the only one who gives me a chance to speak and he actually listens to me, he’s a blessing 😌 
1	You’re one lucky lady LMAO. I’m crushing on an ENFP Male and although we feel the same way (I basically wrote an essay to him and he did the same djskskakkaak), we decided to just stay as friends because ya know.... we both are internet friends. Being far apart sucks so much :,)
1	For what it’s worth I love your sub way more than ours. I haven’t definitively met an INFP in real life but I imagine it to be like our hearts completely exposed. Fi is a beautiful thing.
41	I wrote a poem about losing my AirPods on the gym while sitting in philosophy today 😂

3	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 27	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
2	Nothing today? Alright
2	As an infp, I wondered if there are more people like me who likes to have friends, but your friends are for some reason everytime leaving you? Also I wondered if you guys are missing love around you?
10	I can’t pull myself out of depression because my real life will never live up to my expectations	Ate a sour bowl of reality cereal this morning as I was rejected from my dream job after months of interviewing and waiting. My whole life I felt sadness because I had such grandiose dreams of what I would become when I got older. Now as an adult i realize the things that prevent me from achieving that dream life are my own short comings that can’t be fixed. \n\nJust feeling down today, fellow infps. What’s up with you guys?   
8	Not much. Cried most of the night feeling sorry for myself. Getting too old to chase those dreams. Not sure if getting rich would make me happier. Fantasizing about killing myself but I still care too much about what others might think so I probably won’t do it. I don’t know, the usual stuff... too dark?
3	I’ve been overthinking all day, so i’ve decided to give myself a break from thinking and look at animals and nice things that make me happy :) I’ve realized today that I have trouble being empathetic to myself, so i’m trying to treat myself the same way I treat others
3	I feel it's helped my outlook on life to just not have expectations in general. Whatever happens, happens. I'm just along for the ride.
3	Accept the current situation for what it is. Accept yourself for who you are now.\n\nThis doesn't mean you languish in whatever slum you are in right now indefinitely or forever, but that you stop fighting what is and who you are right now. In other words, stop beating yourself up for beating yourself.\n\nWhen you are able to accept the right now situation and you, you can see clearer what and how things are. Then you can see what actions may be taken to improve some things.
2	Ay man, what do you by 'own short comings that CAN'T be fixed'? \n\nWe're all dynamic human beings, I highly doubt that the stuff you think is stopping you from achieving your dream life is unfixable. Unless ya'know, you dont reach the heigh limit to become a jet-pilot or whatever, lol.
2	When a person starts with I Cant... that turns into never.\n\nTry saying I can or I will.\n\nTreat you downer as you would if a person was physically holding you down,  are you going to just let them do it?  Then why do it to yourself? Hopefully that helped a bit.  Sorry if it seems but harsh. 
61	My son has a new puppy. I'm already heartbroken for him.	I may be emotionally compromised from lack of sleep, but seeing my son be so responsible and loving to his dog has me already grieving it's loss. \n\nMy son didn't connect with our current Pikachu (Pekingese Chihuahua mix), and has been sad about it. She growls at him (albeit softly) when he tries to show her affection. Typical of Chihuahuas, she is really attached to my wife and I. My son has shown signs that he LOVES dogs and that he really needs someone to show affection to. My son and wife have similar personalities and butt heads a lot. He doesn't go out if his way to show affection to anyone so we hoped this might bring him out of his shell a bit.\n\nWife decided that a puppy would be good for my 9 year old son, and after much deliberation, we decided to get him one. \n\nWe picked up a Doxle for free from a friend. My son picked the 4 month old runt of the litter, (which doesn't help my emotions, I would have done the same). She is literally 3 times smaller than her brothers and sisters. The dog is so small and fragile that I'm scared for it constantly.\n\nThe dog has such an amazing personality though. Unlike our other dog, she is inquisitive about anyone that comes into my son's room and wants to give them affection.\n\nWhat really opened the floodgates this morning though, was that I got up to get ready for work, looked out the window to the backyard, and saw my son outside, fully dressed, watching the dog and making sure she did her business outside.\n\nHe's the most responsible of our kids, but  not the eldest, and I didn't think he was THAT responsible. In that moment, watching him, I saw the next 12 -14 years flash by and thought about her final days. I thought that this will be his true best friend for the foreseeable future. It's too much. Even now, as I type this, I can't handle it and need to stop before I become a mess.\n\nThanks for letting me unload.
26	He’s still a kid. He’ll always love the dog, but you’ll have to expect that he’ll get stronger. He’ll be able to handle it better in 10 yrs, don’t worry.\n\nAnd even then (in 10 yrs) Kids tend to bounce back pretty quickly about death as well. They don’t philosophize about it the same as adults. He’ll be fine
8	I don't have kids but I think i know this feeling. Sometimes I just get this weird sadness thinking about dogs lives.. it's hard to explain. They just want to love and enjoy life and the lucky ones get to, but they are only here for a short time.. kinda like a microcosm of a person.
5	Aw man, we just lost our family dog this weekend. He was 14 years old and passed in his sleep. He was a gift for my little sister but then became more attached to my dad. He was my dad's baby after all us kids moved out. I'm just so sad for him now and I hate to see my own father cry.
5	This was very touching to read. I can completely understand why your thoughts would go in that direction. There is a book about a boy and his dog form every generation in our history, and the dog always dies. It is the bittersweet right of passage that a boy mush go through. I work with dogs at a daycare, and having the strong level of empathy, I'm always partly thinking about when it will be there time. I do so with my own pets as well. The one thing that helps me get through it is trying to make sure that the life the live, no matter the length, is as good as it can possibly be. I think your son is going to give his puppy a great life. 
3	Don't think about that puppy's final years. Instead enjoy watching your kid and that puppy grow up together and creating a very strong bond/friendship. There's no use worrying  about things that might happen. The most blissful things are happening before your eyes right now. 
2	I lost my dog of 16 years last year. It was one of the most heart-wrenching things I've had to endure in my 38 years on this planet.\n\n\nThat being said, I wouldn't give up the 16 years I had with her for anything. You've given your son a wonderful gift. It may come with grief in the future, but the good will far outweigh the bad.
3	Jeez chill out n let the kid enjoy his time with the dog. It’s gonna be heartbreaking losing any love but he’s happy with the dog now focus on that. 
643	Maybe you guys can understand.	
40	Everything will get better. Stay strong, Stay passionate and in Love. Love life, Love People, Love our differences and learn from what life offers. 
15	I feel this a lot. Thank you for sharing, my friend 
13	lol if i did one of these it would be a motor connected to gears with a binary display
10	i *heart* this :-P
8	You are really skilled at pen drawing! And I love the imagery. The interpretation I got is that you are made up of the things you love and it is them from which you will grow.
8	It’s the circle of liiiiiife~*
8	I feel dumb because my immediate thought process was\n\nMe: DNA is the heart of the soul\n\nAlso me: ... what
11	Love is the universal truth for growth and ascension. Its realization alone will make the unity of us and the universe clear shattering the illusory cycle of life and death. It starts by loving yourself!
6	this is really great. i don't know what i love so much about it, but i really love it
4	beautiful
5	I understand that I love your art <3
5	Let's try this. It's a tree of life that's growing out of the heart in the shape of DNA because our hearts declare our DNAs in the way that our personalities define our lives so this tree is unique for everyone since everyone has a different personality so this tree speaks a lot about your heart. I like your tree. It's beautiful. I hope you're having a great day ❤
4	I'm just a friendly ENFP spreading love to my INFP buddies, but seriously. This is amazing. You have enormous potential!!!! This is hands down the best thing I've seen here!!!! Chase your dreams! Love life!
5	I love this! I would happily have it framed in my house.

2	I love the shading; wish I could do that with a pen. Any tips for amateurs?
2	This is beautiful 
13	Any INFPs that are pro Palestine?	I’m curious is all really cause I am. Wanted to see if there was more.
7	Yup
6	I am as well
6	Yes and no. \n\nI still sort of lean no, because the way I think of it, is like if Canada had a terrorist organization operating within its borders launching missiles into the US, and Canada was just kinda like “sorry dude can’t do anything about it,” the US would have to do something. \n\nThe civilians obviously don’t deserve it, and there’s obviously war crimes being committed by lone factors, but what’s a guy to do when an organization is attacking their country with impunity from its country of origin. \n\n
8	I'm going to make a really dangerous assumption, but you really can't be an informed Infp and not empathize with the Palestinian cause, breaks my heart that many people are suffering just because some a**holes decided their land was not theirs anymore. #freePalestine \n\nAlso, it is really difficult to me to understand how being the oppressed one you become such a horrid oppressor, shouldnt the Jewish people be working towards a world without discrimination of any type, let alone occupation, incarceration, starvation and a really long list of human rights violations? 
3	Yup
3	I'm just pro self-determination and pro not hurting others.
1	Ya Germany should've given Jews their land not Palestinians 
1	Lean more towards israel. I use to research the topic a lot more a few years back but it's just one of those murky grey areas so I gave up. I just don't know. A lot of the really pro israel people always think israel is always right, even though they say no country is perfect. And I don't agree with that, even though I understand they are in a very difficult situation, and arguably are doing better than what other countries would do. They don't always do good.\n\nBut they face heavy scrutiny from the whole world, every move they make is watched and criticised. I saw the UN had the same amount of resolutions against Israel as they did Syria and North korea which is insane.\n\nTHEN AGAIN a lot of the supporters of israel are very right wing religious people. While I'm religious myself I disagree with a lot of right wing positions, and so I wonder if their support of israel is also from a corrupt standpoint. Not saying righties are bad people, just specific types of them bug me (anti climate change, against universal healthcare ect)
7	Remember more—more, more, weep more, it may cleanse the soul.	:)
1	All alone and no one to tell to? Huh?
1	Scientific studies say: not quite 
6	I like cats but afraid to play with them because I think that I might annoy them instead.	Anyone else? 
5	I suggest looking into cat body language :) they are very loving and caring animals, but they are fickle and need more space than a dog would. They give off a lot of signals to tell you how they feel, so if you are annoying them, they will let you know :3 I hope this helps!
23	When i find a song or a movie trailer that makes me cry, i hit that shit repeatedly like it’s a crack addiction... am i alone in this?	
4	You are not alone.
3	I was having a bad day a couple days ago and listened to the same depressing song on repeat for 45 minutes. Wtf is wrong with me 😂
5	Can you help me with my comic book title?	Hi everyone. I'm a latin american guy of 21 years. My mother language is spanish, so my english must be very bad for the most of you, sorry. I help myself with the Google translator. I did the MBTI test a couple of times and the result is always INFP. I feel strongly identified with this type, especially for the creative part. And now i writing a comic book about a girl who can talk with ghosts, and relates to them in different ways. I'm stuck with the title. I thought about calling it simply Ghost, but it does not finish convincing me. \nMaybe this is not the most appropriate site to post this, but as you are creative people, maybe can help me. Any idea? The central themes of the story are guilt, love, fear and human experience. Thanks for reading!
1	"La Infanta Phantasma" \n\nMake her heir to the kingdom for extra backstory and a cool rhyme. Maybe she doesn't know true love because of her high status and protective environment. I'm brainstorming here. \nSounds cool to say though!

3	Are there non-artistic/non-creative INFPs?	I'm an INFJ and I'm just beginning to understand INFPs.\n\nAre there some of you that fits most chracteristics of an INFP, except for being inclined to arts/creativity?
7	I think all INFP's have the opportunity to be artsy, but not everyone uses his potential. 
3	Not creative or naturally artistic 😳
2	Yeah, I’m a horrible artist and don’t have much interest in art.
1	I cannot decorate space, but I enjoy decorating time :)
6	Do you ever think this sub fits the stereotype too much?	I’m an ENTP, so I might be wrong. But I only recently started following this sub (bc my friend is an INFP and we like sharing mbti memes and articles and stuff). But do you guys sometimes think that this sub fits the whole mbti stereotype a little too much? \n\nDon’t come @ me but do you ever feel that maybe because you’re an INFP you *have* to try and fit into the stereotype? \n\nJust speculating, no tea, no shade
13	I've spent a lot of my time on here geared towards being supportive of people younger than me, since it seems like a lot of people here are kinda down in the dumps and need someone to be kind about who they are. I see what you mean, to a degree, but honestly I usually just skip over what doesn't resonate with me here and assume others do the same. Maybe people here just aren't as vocal about disagreement or "not getting" something.
6	Yes, I find it just a bit too stereotypical, sometimes even comically. \n\nNo, beware of labels that you put on yourself and others.
6	Lots of people here post when they are feeling down. Imo mentally healthier INFPs tend to lurk and not post as much. Since being an INFP is a very "emotional" type it kind of feeds into itself, creating some comically exaggerated posts sometimes. That said, I like checking this sub when I feel down as in a way its kind of like a safe haven to me.\n\nAs for your second question, I think we all subconciously do at some point. 
3	>But do you guys sometimes think that this sub fits the whole mbti stereotype a little too much? \n\nYeah, it does sometimes almost seem as if some of the people in this sub go out of their way to fit into the INFP stereotype just so they can get other INFPs to relate and empathize with them (I'll admit that I've done this a couple of times). It's good to see some art and have people vent every now and then, but you get bored of it eventually. \n\n>Don’t come @ me but do you ever feel that maybe because you’re an INFP you have to try and fit into the stereotype? \n\nNah, I don't like conforming to stereotypes, but I usually won't go out of my way to break them either. Although it's been at least a year since I've been into MBTI and already settled on my type, I still doubt my type at least 20% of the time lol
2	I'm an ENTP too, and have been visiting different MBTI subs out of curiosity, and that's what I've observed each time. People are often proud to be the MBTI type that they are, and want to feel like they're a part of a community, so they sometimes start acting like their MBTI's type caricature. It's also very true in the entp sub, where some entps feel the need to write stuff like "I'm too lazy to actually finish writing that down" or "I'm just more intelligent than everybody else" to show how true entps they are.
10	What if you didn’t run? This one time. What if you stayed, and let love overtake you?	
9	It would be hard to believe someone could love me back. If I were to stay by their side and they chose to stay by mine, I don’t think there’s much that could make me happier. I’d be happy just being beside them as a friend forever, I value their company and what they bring to my life no matter what :) 
4	I'd probably be taken advantage of again and used. But that's most of my life when it came to friends and the 1 girl I asked out. I truly don't know. But my fears of abandonment and being used are so strong, I feel like I'm choking when I try to overcome it now.
2	Fear of disappointment m8 I build stuff up to high that if they don't end up being as I had hoped the feeling hurts 
1	I was thinking about it last night and honestly, so far attempts at it have been heartwarming and taught me valuable matters.\n\nAlso reminded me of a quote:\n\n>"My therapist told me that anxious people have a tendency to only explore the scary 'what ifs' and challenged me to remember that there is also a flip side. What if you excel? What if it is one of the best experiences of your life? What if it changes you in a beautiful way?" — [twitter.com/\_\_bhb\_\_](https://twitter.com/__bhb__?fbclid=IwAR3MS1Sa9tiN3TfKCRNNKSYVHLqEydi1TO1imWU2FJxqF9T0hc1SzbVU--4)\n\n&#x200B;

2	How do people conceptualize this stuff? Like I would never think to put, what, a house, as a tit? And a little canal with a whirlpool or a galaxy for the inside of the head? Like, it's cool, I just don't know how people think of this stuff. I would definitely have to try to be pretentious to do something like this, cuz I just don't have tit houses circling around in my head. How do you make it up?
2	The detail and complexity of it is beautiful. Such gorgeous work. I would something inspired by what you felt during the process. Was it nothingness? Or the numb feeling? Something as simple as "Blank" would draw the attention and have that hidden meaning under it. The word or more so words I feel when I look at this is "Somber emptiness".

2	Here's another poem.	Read me the stars above and tell me which one's are a plane, \nMy idiosyncratic Naivety was all the more I couldn't contain;\nAfternoons labeled by playground skirmishes\nIn the Cold war fought with action figures and trading cards, \nEnding in stalemates with imaginations Avant-Garde.\nEchoes of coalescent conjectures emanating from her hurried mind, \nReaching where no father could find:\nThe husk of liveliness and fulfillment, \nIn the reckless abandon of circumstance.\nTorn from rationality and delved in understanding of blank disposition,\nBenevolence and well-being dwindle horrifically as tomorrow reigns supreme.\nI'll take my leave once yesterday gives away.
2	Beautiful 
27	Are you ashamed of your anger?	Just wondering how common it is for us INFPs to supress our anger, and possibly it being the reason most of us are a little "too" quiet and nice. More specifically, were you told it was wrong to express your anger when you were a child? And in the same vein, do you view expressing anger as childish? 
20	I suppress my anger because I am typically downright mean, hurtful, and cruel when angry. I try very hard to suppress my anger, because I have noticed that a gentle voice typically works better at getting a statement or point across, than an angry one.\n\nHowever, I do feel that there are times when you just have to get angry... just don’t be unkind in your anger, if that makes sense. 
10	I was a victim of sibling abuse as a small child. I grew up and unwittingly married a criminal psychopath. (Yes, he was diagnosed by a psychologist and has the same personality profile as Ted Bundy. Yes, really.) In our nearly ten-year relationship, all my emotions were used against me. I've heard pyschopathic abuse described as emotional murder, and I concur. My psyche nearly died.\n\nA few years after I escaped, I started having fits of uncontrollable anger. I threw things. I screamed. I was baffled and frightened, and I wondered if I was going crazy. It was all I could do to keep a lid on my emotions.\n\nA few years ago, I finally found a really good trauma therapist. One of the things she explained to me was that normal people have emotional boundaries, but victims of chronic abuse do not. She told me to embrace my anger, not to stifle it. The anger meant I was forming emotional boundaries, deciding what was okay and what was unacceptable. She told me that, in time, I would learn emotional regulation. \n\nAs I embraced my anger (without physically harming anyone, of course), I came to realize how I was changing for the better. For example, a member of my \[new\] husband's family had always seemed sweet and charming. Suddenly, he made my skin crawl. It took me a while to realize that this family member had narcissistic tendencies, and my new boundaries made me less likely to be victimized. I also realized my anger toward aggressive drivers came from a place of feeling disrespected and marginalized, as I had felt in my marriage. As I worked through it, I went from being extremely angry for days to being moderately angry for a few hours. I still have a long way to go, but I'm starting to self-regulate.\n\nThese days, I use the anger as a tool. It helps me dig deeper and see what the real issue is. Do I feel threatened? Do I feel unheard? Which boundary is being pushed? Thinking about the anger helps me calm down faster. No, it doesn't always work. My husband has learned that I need to rage sometimes, and bless his INTJ heart, but he just waits for me to finish and asks if I need a hug.\n\nI think we INFPs experience a lot of boundary-related anger, even those of us who were not abused. I think society runs right over our boundaries, and our desperate need to avoid confrontation compounds the problem. \n\nTo answer your question, I was not told it was wrong to express anger as a child, I just didn't express it often. (My parents were not afraid to openly argue, and  I grew up believing that you should stand up for yourself. I was punished for it by my abuser, which complicates things.)  I don't believe anger is childish.
7	I was often told I had a "big temper" and I was ashamed of that.  It took me many years to realize that, actually, my mother had a huge fear of anger because her father would scream and yell and spank her brothers. I think she wanted to make sure I never turned out like that. So, since childhood, my pattern has been to bottle my anger. Unfortunately, that gives it time to get mixed up with many other emotions and I wind up frustrated and discombobulated.    \n\n\nNow I do my best to stay present and look at the anger as a thing that's here for now rather than something I *am*. I try to acknowledge and talk about how I'm feeling rather than stamping it down or losing my shit. Not easy and I'm better at it some days than others. I've found meditation helpful. 
7	I used to get openly angry when I was younger. I would be made fun of which both hurt and angered me. My father came to me and told me when I allow myself to become angry by the ignorance of other people I allow them to control me. From then on any time I would get mad I would just tell myself "You'll  get over it." Just reminding myself that anger doesn't last forever helps me shed it. I wouldn't say I think feeling anger is wrong, I just dont think it's productive for the life I want to live.
6	I was always the calm, harmonious child in my family so I do feel the need to suppress my anger or I shake it off as being irrational, causing a buildup of anger later on. I definitely get surprised reactions when I do get angry since I am usually pretty chill. It's hard to not feel ashamed of getting angry or upset when everyone thinks you are a mild tempered person. Not all INFP's are calm and happy all the time! \n\nI'm definitely trying to work on not seeing my emotions as bad, but rather things that need to be expressed (in healthy ways of course). I suppress things way too often, and I've heard other INFP's saying they do that too.  
5	I had a hard challenge as a child I had to keep under control and I couldn't act out etc. My father had custody of me and if I were to do anything wrong he would take it out on my mother mostly and just say living with my mother may not be the best idea. So in respect for my mother I had to behave and stay seen and not heard. I also was married to someone that when I raised my voice it was taken as me yelling but I am very animated and I just do that naturally even when excited. I just never had the freedom to be myself and it has caused a lot of problems for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am just bubbly now and use escapism into the things I like so I don't have to think about things. I try to only cry when I am alone and sometimes my emotions are a bit chaotic but I just try to forget how i'm feeling.
6	I view it as extremely childish. And I’m really embarrassed by it. Especially because it goes from 0-100 and I feel like it exposes me as a bad communicator. Or I become “that guy with a stick up his ass”
6	I hate being angry. I feel out of control of myself, and worried that if I say something in anger, it will create conflict, which is one of my biggest fears in life (conflict w/another person makes me incredibly uncomfortable.) usually, I don’t get extremely angry. Whenever it does pop up, it presents itself as irritation and frustration. I’ll cry when I get so mad that I feel like I’m going to scream. \n\nIt happened about a week ago; some idiots who worked at Chipotle were being really rude, and I was feeling stressed out already. After we got our food, I started to get really upset. I think I was guilting myself, and that tipped me over the edge. I felt terrible, because my girlfriend was with me, and she was worried she did something to make me angry. She didn’t, but all I could say was “You didn’t do anything.” While still crying and looking pissed as hell, and mostly avoiding her. I tend to shut down and have trouble communicating when I’m that upset. She herself shut down because she was worried I was upset with her. Once I calmed down, we agreed that I needed to give her some kind of signal when I get like that to let her know it isn’t her fault. I don’t think I could ever get that angry at someone I love. 
5	Not only as a child. When i get things out my "friends" still reprove it.\n\nI usually try to look at the reason after the anger to say if it is childish or not
7	I noticed that people who know me dont expect me to get angry at anything, because I'm so laid back and quiet, so when it finally happens and the switch is flicked people act like I'm sorta crazy for showing anger juss because they haven't seen me get angry. We're also human beings and shouldn't apologize for our emotions juss because they dont come out that much you know.\n\nExpressing any emotion is not childish ( as long as u dont go crazy with it lol), emotions dont jump out the bus juss because you're an adult.
3	I always suppress it. When I'm angry, it's like a bomb has gone off, and I really hate that side of me. So, I hold it back whenever possible. I've actually only ever gotten angry externally about three or four times in my life, as a result. I aim to keep it that way. I just feel absolutely awful after I've exploded on someone, so I never want to feel that again.
3	As I get older, I am less and less ashamed. Doesn't have anything to do with whether or not the anger is "appropriate" or "irrational" or what have you--that's an entirely separate issue. \n\nEverybody gets angry. And people who say they don't are lying to themselves, and I say that as someone who used to do that. Pretending I don't get angry doesn't mean I'm not actually angry, and admitting it doesn't mean I get angrier more often. I'm just acknowledging what's already happening emotionally. I find it makes me less resentful because I permit myself to have my feelings, whatever they are.
3	I have an interpretation of the philosophy of the Roman Senator Seneca that works here. \n\nAnger, among the other emotions, is the force that demands change. When we can’t vent our anger(and therefore get angry), it means that there is something that we strongly desire to change, but cannot.\n\nI got pretty angry a lot around 10-14yrs, but I saw it as justifiable, because it was around that time that I started noticing a great deal of bullshit.\n\nMy main triggers were the fact that I hated homework, I hated other people for being popular for the wrong things, and I HATED that my mom, who has a great deal of pride, was “always right”, even when she wasn’t. \n\nIn all of my problems the solution to my ANGER is actually simple: don’t be so optimistic/HOPEFUL, just because your expectations have merit doesn’t mean they should nor will ever be real!\n\nIt puts too much pressure on our environment to lash out because the way in which it is received is not accurate or consistent across everyone. Because of this, no matter what noble cause lies at the heart of your anger, lashing out will likely not get the response you are looking for.\n\nANGER is the energy of HOPE without the KNOWLEDGE to guide it down a constructive path.\n\nEdit: my examples are likely not the greatest because I was quite immature, they are just the most applicable personal examples I have for anger.
2	I just feel like it doesn't produce any good results. For example I yelled at a cashier the other day for being a controlling little shit and not bagging my items like he was supposed to, among some other things he did, like trying to make me do his job for him. Didn't really solve anything, as I most likely have a bad rep now since I spazzed out in front of like 20 people, but at least I got to say what I wanted, and I got some anger out, even though the shitty masses won't understand. But now it seems like I just have more problems. This pattern has happened before with no visibly good results. I feel like I'm supposed to learn something here? But I don't know what. I guess I just have to deal with people's shitty stupid shit my whole life. There's probably a lot of anger in me. Like too much, with no outlet, most likely from suppressing it. Not saying shit when I should, or taking shit and beatings, verbal or otherwise, when I shouldn't. So what really would have been the right thing to do? Repeat the same pattern my whole life, or break out of it? I lose either way, but I think I gain a bit more personal growth this way, because some things just have to be done, defeated, and taken care of, and if all those things are gone, I would be happy. So I guess anger is not something to be ashamed of, but dealt with emotionally, and used. Who gives a shit what people say or think.
2	It's funny that you ask that now, because last week my therapist told me I had a problem not expressing my anger. So my "assignment" is to write in a notebook situations that made me angry.\n\nI had just told her about how my mother was surprised that my sister is afraid of looking fat. For me, it's not surprising because I was fat-shamed while growing up by my mother and her mother. So even if my sister is thin, she's obsessed about her weight and looks. Anyway, that's not the point here, but I was literally shivering while telling this to my therapist. Contained rage.\n\nI hate conflict and I think that's why I repress my anger. I also hate seeing other people get angry, it scares me sometimes.
2	What embarrasses me the most about displaying anger is that it demonstrates that I’m not in control. 
2	When I'm truly angry I am a force of nature. I can do incredible damage to my relationships in a matter of seconds. Ugh.
2	Yes... I was a rather aggressive child, but strangely enough nowadays, I've been told i'm passive. Sometimes when I get angry, I go overboard, so I often put myself into a worse situation by letting it out. For some reason, I cry while i'm angry, so it's weird. As I am now, I honestly don't know if i'm suppressing my anger. I get irritated a lot, but I barely go into a rage. I don't think letting it out benefits me, so I don't really let it out. I just don't think that nearly anything that happens to me is worth getting angry over.\n\nMaybe, I might have a different definition of anger then most people since I always have equated anger similarly to revenge. Don't you need something that causes anger? From what I know, Angry people tend to seek someplace to release it. Often, if it is released upon people, it's more like revenge. It is often caused by something. Sure, some people let it out onto any bystander, but for other angry people, some of the anger is directed specifically back to the source of the problem.\n\nIf it is at an object or task? It is nearly the same, but its even more pointless. After a while, I realized being angry at the door for being closed when I want to go through it doesn't help me at all, so that type of anger I don't need to express it. It may irritate me, but I don't think i'll blow up over it unless I am very unstable. I used to want revenge due to certain actions from people, but I realized what's the point? I'll destroy myself in the process. Do I think anger is childish? If my idea of it pertains to your question, kinda. There is no benefit. I think all emotions are fine, but I consider directing my emotions at others with hostile intent childish.
2	Growing up I would try to suppress my anger since it wasn't "good" and "good" people had hearts too big to feel anger in the first place. \n\nI developed strategies for dealing with it as I got olde. Denial->turned inwards-> minimizing own feelings -> avoidance\n\nI'd have the occasional blow-up, and feel like I failed myself afterwards. I still struggle to express it, honestly speaking. I no longer deny it to myself, turn it on myself, nor disregard myself. Instead I head out for a walk to disarm it by looking at things from different perspectives, taking a hike, exercising, that sorta thing. \n\nExpressing it in the moment still feels wrong. I don't trust that I won't do or say something that may end up changing things for the worse, permanently.\n\nI'm probably a 9 on the enneagram
2	If other people are guilty for current or past anger, I usually try to console them, saying that it's a normal emotion that everyone experiences from time to time. As long as you express it in a healthy way, I'll tell them, it's nothing to be ashamed about. \n\nHowever, that same logic seems unable to be applied to myself. I hate the feeling of being angry, as most people do. But I think for us, bc we're so concerned with not hurting others emotionally, we not only dislike the emotion of anger, but we view it as "wrong" in some way. \n\nSo long answer to a short question 😂 But yes, I supress my anger & try to cool down on my own without help or someone to talk to bc I'm ashamed.
2	I grew up with much anger, but I'm glad I sort of grew out of it. I am forever grateful.
2	Suppress your anger and it will only get stronger. Embrace your anger but don't allow it to rule over you. 
2	Awesome. It takes a lot of courage to trust again after abusive childhood experiences, congratulations on being a brave soul:):)
2	Idk, as I grew up, I actually became way more sensitive to people around me and how I affect things in the world. As a person I try to be the kindest person possible and only exist to help others. Currently anger issues come from 1. Being mad at myself for something. 2. I still have serious arguments with my mom sometimes. And 3. When I get actually angry (not just time to time arguments) I literally go off, not physically, but everything I never say about someone or all the horrible things I suppress about the 'target' of my anger. I just say it all, their past, their humanity, their flaws, criticizing them for what they are or might not be, all within a minute or 2 until I take a few deep breaths or they retaliate and it goes back and forth for awhile. It has only happened 2 times last year and both times I've written extensive mssges/apology letter to them formally because it made me feel so bad. I was also dealing with cutting during that time to deal with it. (not anymore). But yeah, as for anger issues, I try to think extremely hard about how the things I can say about others will affect them, because more than most times, it just makes them cry instead of get mad. Or you can look at the situation and say, did that really matter, what's it going to matter in like a week or month from now. I'm not ashamed of my anger to answer the question, but I am ashamed when I don't control it properly. Everyone gets angry sometimes,nothing to be ashamed of there. 
1	I just know how uncomfortable it is for me/other around when someone gets angry/upset so I do my best to not bother others
1	I grew up with a family who used my emotions against me and often teased me, so I learnt by about 15 that the easiest thing to do was just not be angry, don't feed the trolls....\n\nNow around, I do get angry, but I allow myself to do so, I just get scared of who I will hurt if I do get angry, I found myself not to hold back on the rude, cruel or (very often) harmful comments/insults if I am angry...\n\nSo I just avoid it. Not ashamed, but I avoid it 
1	...yeah ok so growing up it was always "oh you're angry about this? Well get a thicker skin kid" \n\nand \n\nnow I'm one of the ppl who kind of bottles it until it becomes a problem rip 
1	I’m finishing out high school in the next few months and my anger is sometimes insane and so confusing. I frustrate myself with my own anger and it’s a chain reaction. Maybe it’s because of the fighting and trauma in my household from my childhood up to recently but the more I try to accept and let it pass the easier it is. Usually fighting my anger only leads to me getting more upset that I can’t just make it go away
3	As an Infp myself, I have a crush on another infp (at least I think she is), but am hesitant	Because I know how incredibly difficult it can be to date me, and I'm not sure I can handle that in another person.... I like her a lot, but, idk, I guess I'm just afraid.  She isn't really the type I'd typically be attracted to, but we share a lot of interests and I think I may actually have a shot with her.  \n\n\nShe seems smart and funny and *not* self absorbed, which is damn hard to find in women these days... But if I get turned down, it'll be really awkward having to go to class with her for the next three months.\n\n\nI'm afraid that it'd be boring.  Domestic.  Because I am.  I feel like I need someone to get me out of my shell... And... If we dated it'd just be too people unable to come out their shells.  Lol.  It could be very awkward.  Two Squirtles bumping together and saying, muffled from inside their shells, 'no no I do like you, you'll just have to take my word for it!' \n\n\nIdk what I should do.  
3	I started dating an INFP two and one-half years ago. We were married last August and my life is more exciting than it ever has been. Keeping a relationship fun and alive is work from both parties no matter your MBTI type. If you feel the connection, go for it! 
21	Cant really be the only one who loves being like this.... right?	I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while and posting here and there, and I've noticed that alot of us are juss not happy with ourselves and our nature. \n\nI dont relate at all (atleast not anymore) and even thou I'm not 100% there with loving myself and i never will be because it's a journey not a destination, I reeeaaally appreciate the type of personality I have.\n\nWhat would life be without my nights alone, playing guitar in my room, or throwing up all my emotions onto a blank canvas and realizing how easy it is to create beauty, when I'm supposed to be sleeping , or the beautiful sunny days where before I go wherever for the day I take several minutes to lie on the grass taking in the beauty of nature & life all around me :) which reminds me, what is my life without my deep sensitivity to "small or trivial" things like rain, art, books, sunsets, sunrises, stars, the moon, trees etc. these things that apparently make me weird but most importantly make me sooo happy 🌈\n\nI also love my emotional lows that leave me crying all the time, the loneliness, because I know that life is not without suffering... there's always a dark side right next to the bright side , it's all one little package where u choose what to focus on.\n\nmy sensitivity is my superpower not my weakness, no matter what society tells me :') because we are the people that create beautiful art for everyone else to stare at and say "WOW" to.\n\nso again I ask.. I cant be the only one who loves being like this....right?
6	When I am in nature I feel a lot like you. I feel happy. It has been a hard winter though. Bitter cold, freezing rain, winter squall. I need to go for a walk and recharge but it is just so dreadful outside. I know in the summer it will get better though. I just hate being cooped up like this. I need my green grass, trees with actual leaves, and butterflies.
3	Of course not. 
3	Everything you explain is exactly just how i feel!
2	I totally agree with you. I don't always love myself the way I should, but I do love BEING myself. 
2	I loved reading that. INFPs are beautiful and pure to say the least <3
2	:) 
6	I feel all the powers of the universe whirling within me	Yes.
7	You should run to the bathroom.
2	I feel this a lot... definitely one of my favorite sensations
6	My INFP experience dating an INTJ	Hi there, I'm an INFP who recently dated an INTJ, which didn't really end very well.  I'm not entirely sure the point of this; I suppose I want to share my experience, ask for opinions as to where she or I went wrong, if this would be typical in other's experience with INTJs, whether the relationship is truly over, and maybe even get some closure from my fellow INFPs.  This is quite long FYI, but I appreciate anyone looking at this.  I also apologize if this doesn't follow some kind of particular guideline.\n\nWe were dating each other for about 8 months.  Things were great at first.  I've never dated another introvert before and I was thrilled that I had someone that I could do introvert things with, such as low key activities and us even doing our own thing while with each other.  I also appreciated her more rational views on situations and her overall orderliness, and I felt that we complimented each other very well.  Also she was very sexual, which I'm sorry, was pretty awesome.\n\nAs time went on I noticed a tendency for certain things to bother her.  What things?  Well its hard to say because she had a reluctance to bring it up or want to talk about whatever it was that was bothering her.  I would have to pry an insane amount to get any information, and even then there was times when she wouldn't give anything up.  In fact there was the expectation that I should know her enough to know without asking.  I pride myself with the typical INFP quality of putting myself in other people's shoes and understanding another's point of view, but I felt like she expected me to be psychic.  So there she'd be standoffish at times because she was upset about something, then me becoming frustrated that she wouldn't give me enough information to try to maintain harmony, which would make me standoffish, in which sometimes it would escalate into a silent prolonged conflict.  I've always tried promoting an open attitude, encouraged her to talk about problems, and mentioned multiple times that communication is key for any relationship.  I remember one time she mentioned that she felt like we didn't know each other that well enough, and that was affecting her communication, which too be honest I didn't know how to deal with.  We've talked about very intimate and deep details of our selves, and after she voiced her concern I've tried to spend energy to initiate more deep connections.  Maybe it wasn't enough for her?  I've never had someone say that before to me.\n\nThere also seemed to be the expectation that I be available at all times for her, which to me was a little peculiar.  One time I mentioned that I like to turn off my cell notifications off at night, which distressed her, and she asked 'well what if I need you?'.  This apparent dependency actually lead to our first major fight.  She apparently was being stalked one day buy some creepy guy she ran into a couple times, as in he was following her in his vehicle.  She phoned me a few times but I was outside shovelling snow.  When I got inside I heard a text notification go off about her being stalked.  I was concerned and I tried to phone her.  She hung up and said that she didn't want to talk to me, and said that she couldn't depend upon me.  She ended up going to her friends place to hide out from this guy because she couldn't get a hold of me.  But she was only 10 minutes away from my house, and she was suppose to come over anyways.  When asked why she didn't come over she said that she was afraid that I wasn't home.  She didn't think of phoning the police.  I understand that being stalked would be a terrifying experience for a women, and I could forgive her anger, but ultimately I feel that it was misplaced, and she never did apologize for any of it.\n\nHer not apologizing was a recurring theme in the relationship.  I got the sense that she blamed everything on me.  Maybe she didn't, but she never acknowledged once that something she said or did wasn't appropriate or wrong, and never once apologized about anything.  She seemed to be always the one that was right and everything that she thought was the way it actually was.  Meanwhile I like to think that everything that happens is an interaction between all personalities involved, and the specific situation.  Not to mention that theres a certain degree of confirmation bias on both of our sides, but at least I'm open to being/doing something wrong.\n\nAfter she said that she didn't want to talk, I tried to empathize with her, told her that I felt bad for her.  She didn't get back to me.  She was clearly mad at me, so I decided to give her some space, which I know that I need sometimes.  I waited a day and a half, and I was going to contact her on the following Sunday to she .  In the morning my friend texts me a screenshot of her profile on Tinder.  I was obviously like, 'WTF', and, I phoned her and tried to keep calm, but I eventually started raising my voice in which she immediately hung up and ignored my calls.  She thought it was appropriate behavior for her to go on Tinder without saying anything to me, and inappropriate for me to get disturbed by it.  The rest of the day was the situation escalating over text message into a full blown fight.  I probably should've phoned her sooner.\n\nThe rest of the next two days was walking a fine line of keeping cool (admittedly I didn't with the prior phone call but I think I handled the communication afterwards very well, at least in this regard), trying to maintain harmony, and not being taken advantage of for that.  The things she said though we're vicious and spiteful.  It wasn't necessarily name calling, although there was a little bit of that in there, but it was mostly her remembering and pointing out every single way that I've wronged her, or have done something incorrectly, or about some imperfect aspect of my life.  It was very thorough actually, and she put her orderliness to good use.  It was the opposite of constructive criticism; criticism meant to spite and put me down. She clearly was insanely upset, and it seemed that me not taking full responsibility for everything was making her even more upset.  I didn't attack her whatsoever, didn't call her names or anything like that, totally in contrast of what she was saying.  Things eventually died off and there was a stalemate for the night.\n\nAfter the first night she phoned me, surprisingly, to see how I was doing.  Her voice was shaken, and I can tell that she was still distressed.  I tried with the upmost diplomacy to keep the situation calm and everything blame neutral.  Due to the things that she said the day before I told her that if she wanted to talk that she'd have to apologize first.  She did, and so we started talking. It was very peculiar that whenever I spoke she'd interrupt me, try to finish my sentences, but totally twist what I was saying to something negative.  Always negative.  "I want you to be happy" turned into, "so you're saying that I can never be angry".  But I meant that I want for us to work together to get to a place where we can be happy.  Everything was misunderstood and twisted.  It was getting frustrating communicating with her, and I was trying to keep my cool.  I felt that it started to escalate a bit, and I politely started saying that 'Im sorry, I can't talk anymore right now', and before I finished she instantly hung up.\n\nI sat at the couch to reflect upon what had happened and to try to relax, and I started hearing multiple text messages.  She sent several full length text messages of the exact same kind of things she just apologized for.  After I read it I told her that this is straight up harassment and that I was going to block her number for the time being, because despite how angry she could be, it was unacceptable to relentlessly attack someone like that.  Whats particularly interesting is that SHES the one that said that I was the one saying hateful things.  'She'll never forget the things that I said about her', which to me is somewhat delusional, considering how diplomatic I was trying to be and how hateful she was being.  Maybe it was a way for her to rationalize or even forgive herself for what she said?\n\nI was worried about her.  I thought about her condition all day the next day, especially because she just started a new lucrative job.  I ended up phoning her that evening to see how she was.  She was much more calm when I talked to her, but as I talked to her it was still apparent that everything was still my fault.  Because I was the older one I should've known better, and I shouldn't have said this and that, etc.  And I was open to it.  I'm sure some things I could've handled better.  But when I suggested that we both had a part in what happened, she couldn't accept it.  The blame was solely on me.  I told her that I'd like for us to work through it, but she said things like that she couldn't live with herself if she did, along with other generally negative things about the relationship.  As sad as I was I accepted it and said goodbye.\n\nWhen I got home I realized that some of her stuff was there, and I wanting to get all of this wrapped up ASAP, I texted her and asked her if I could mail it to her.  She asked me to drop it off to her.  I told her that its best we didn't see each other and just moved on, and that I'd drop it off in her apartment entrance and grab it after I leave.  I scheduled a time a couple days later and she agreed.  30 minutes later she phoned to confirm, we then started talking calmly about this and that.  About how we felt, and our opinions, and it was kept fairly neutral and constructive.  I was actually so happy that we were able to be constructive in solving our problems.  This is EXACTLY what I wanted for the last few days.  It got to the point where we were talking even affectionately to each other, and we reconciled.  She told me that when I phoned her earlier I wasn't trying hard enough.  When I spent 30 or so minutes saying that I want to reconcile and work things out with her, a few different ways, i apparently wasn't trying hard enough?\n\nThings were ok for a couple weeks, but then more of the same happened.  We had a pleasant night, but something was bothering her, she wouldn't tell me, and I let it go.  The next day she left stand offish because I was hanging with my nieces, meanwhile I'm getting frustrated because she's keeping things to herself.  Didn't really talk the next couple days, and I got paranoid about this familiar pattern.  She asked to come by, and when she got there she was noticeably still stand offish, and so was I.  I was already frustrated about that, and something that was happening in my life that was unrelated (car issues), which escalated to her threatening to grab her stuff to leave, me telling her to go ahead and that I wasn't in the mood, and her leaving with neither of us saying goodbye.  I'll be honest, I went on Tinder that day to see if her account was active again, in which a previous match messaged me, and she saw, which escalated things.  I probably should've been more trusting, but I wanted to see where she was, and that was one way, considering she doesn't want to talk about things.  So she ended up blocking my number without us even discussing that, which was partly my fault because I didn't say goodbye when she offered.  I had the opportunity there, and it was my lack of my communication that was detrimental, to an extent.  The same thing might've happened anyways, and to be honest, I have the right to be upset as much as her.\n\nSo thats more or less where we are.  I tried to facebook her saying the motivation about tinder (and she blocked me) the next day, and then the day after that I emailed her telling her that message was a previous match before I knew her, that it wasn't me doing anything behind her back, and to essentially say goodbye, because I didn't when she left.  I wanted things to be 'complete', at least my part, if it was going to end.  Thats all I'm going to do, and I'm willing to let it go (again), but I can't help but think this is her being temporarily angry again, and that I'm just not trying hard enough again.  But that can't be the case, and I'm not going to contact her again.\n\nI know that she loved me.  I saw it in the way she adoringly gazed into my eyes at times.  She's even tried to get me to say it. I didn't though.  I told her multiple times that I want to take it slow, due to getting out of a long term relationship several months before her.  I told her after our first fight that I was falling in love with her.  I didn't want to say it afterwards, because things were so rocky, and I was starting to question it.  Maybe she wanted me to and was expecting it though at that point?  Maybe thats what contributed to the continued fighting.\n\nShe said that she never acted like this with previous boyfriends, which to be honest, is hard to believe.  She acted that way because she had a capacity to act that way.  it'd be part of her personality.  Again I'm not saying that I'm blameless, but I tend to get along with everyone, and am pretty damn agreeable.  Its hard to believe that I can cause such behavior.  Is this some kind of conflict between the INFP's agreeableness and the INTJs apparent trouble with communication (or so I've read and recently experienced)?  A conflict between the INFP's feeling decision making compared to the INTJs logical decision making?  She certainly did some unrational things (trying to objectively look at it along with opinons from others).  Or is it more because of gender differences?  Our biggest fight was during her period (I don't like saying this but I'm trying to consider all points).  Or even cultural differences?  She's Chinese, and I know that their culture can be traditional, even though she wasn't quite the traditional Chinese woman.  Maybe I wasn't being assertive enough.  Maybe I should've been more argumentative and confrontational?  For some reason it was ok for her to get into a mood and do/say whatever she wants, but when I do it, its not ok.  Does she have an emotional issue?  Her response seemed unproportionate.  She also left herself logged into her email account and I saw an email begging to talk to her ex-boyfriend (who lives with his GF) and that she might have to call the crisis hotline (yes I should've respected her privacy but I feel like I needed some closure.  I don't know.... the whole thing seemed to spiral out of control, so fast.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, its probably for the best, because there seems to be a fundamental difference between our expectations and how we both resolve conflict.  Its so sad because 95% of the time there is apparent total contentment.  Its also disappointing, again, because the result is an interaction of both of our behaviors, and not just mine, and she didn't seem to recognize that.  To blame everything exclusively on one person seems extreme, and quite frankly, seems immature (she is about 9 years younger).  I can't help but feel like I've been treated unfairly.\n\nCan I get some feedback?  Totally open to criticism, as long as it isn't the same kind that she used haha.  I'd like for this to also be a learning experience, and hopefully some third party INFPs can comment.  Was there part of my INFP that didn't handle things ideally?

2	She sounds like a depressed INFP. I acted similar in my most recent relationship with an INTJ/P which also lasted around 8 months. His coldness was bringing out the worst in me. He completely skipped the getting to know each other part and went straight for an established relationship. He wanted all the love and affection without having to give the same in return. A relationship without a deep emotional connection and intimacy just doesn’t do it for me.  And as much as I adored him, I had to end it to keep my sanity.
2	Doesn’t look like she’s an intj. If something bothers me, you can be sure I’ll bring it up in the next 10s, diplomatically of course. 
2	I don't know, I've dated an INTJ girl that is similar. And yours doesn't seem like an INFP.
1	This sounds eerily like a girl I just dated. Big red flags in your OP: never acknowledging any responsibility for contributing to fights; it was always *my* fault. I'm usually the one to "take one for the team" in a relationship, but when I suggested we moved on from arguments ("all is forgiven, no one is to blame"), she would talk in circles, lining me up for another attack. Like your experience, she didn't really do name-calling, but she could be really vicious in her messages. \n\nCommunication was also an issue, which in hindsight I'm surprised at, because she's one of the most intelligent people I've met, and very articulate. But like with your girl I felt like I was being set up for hidden "tests", where she already had an expectation of how she wanted me to react, but wouldn't communicate that.\n\nAs well: the love-bombing and then sudden silence. She was always very affectionate, told me she loved me, then at the drop of a hat blocked me on social media. I caved and broke no-contact to message her and she's threatened a couple of times to block my phone number, only to inexplicably message me the next day. She was the one who wanted to end things, and yet, tentatively trying to discuss it with her, it's again all my fault.
1	Might be dealing with an 'unhealthy' INTJ.  There was certainly a fair amount of 'I'm right and you're wrong', lack of listening, overly critical, arrogance, coldness:\n\n"Unhealthy INTJs tend to play ego-defensive survival games when their independence is threatened or their competence is called into question. During this phase they often shut out their emotions, using logical rationalizations to avoid situations that make them feel uncomfortable or inept. They become extremely task-focused and perfectionistic, feeling that their way is the only way to do something. Their listening skills deteriorate and they become impatient and critical with others. At times they may feel like misfits and that nobody understands them and that everyone else is “wrong” or ineffective."\n\n"The healthy INTJ lacks empathy. As a result, these INTJs often use their ability to use information harshly, their fear of relationship makes them act arrogant, and the other less flattering sides of an INTJ will be found on display. "
7	Why are most infps creative/artistic	and I’m not? :(
7	Maybe you havent found your outlet. Experiment.\n\nTry pottery, try glass blowing, try printmaking, keep trying stuff until you find your niche. For me I used to make Youtube videos. That was my creative field. As of now I am not very creative. But that's okay. I would rather spend my time doing other things.
5	*starts drawing/writing* \n\nMan, fuck, this is a waste of time, I gotta be more practical and make moves in life\n\n*proceeds to watch netflix for 4 hours*
3	Only you can answer that but all I can say is that if it’s bothering you, it’s because you have an itch. Otherwise you wouldn’t give a damn.\n\nSomething is holding you back from even trying to scratch that itch.\n\nBare in mind that not every INFP is destined to be GRRM or Kurt Cobain but those of us who do struggle to create have matured enough to accept it and stopped listening to the petrifying self judging voice.\n\nI do hope you’ll get out of this place in which you beat yourself to a pulp and then feel sorry for yourself for being so bitten and downtrodden. I’ve been there and still fall to this dynamic too often so don’t think I’m speaking from a patronizing place.\n\nGood luck!\n\n
4	Cuz you're the kind that wants to listen to music 24/7 in their room instead of developing a skill. Or is that just me?
2	I feel this and can definitely relate but I think its mainly because my idea of what creativity means is quite limited. When I think of artists I think of drawing, painting, sketching, making music, etc. but theres just so much more to it. I second the other comment that brought up the point of finding your own outlet.  
2	like chess or other strategy games, mastery (to the point where intuition creates the entire work) requires much time and dedication, and it is this dedication that has gotten me such a strong understanding of (guess what: ) bach fugues.
2	I think it is because the need for communication with the outside world is less extensive for an INFP than it would be for someone that needs an essential daily dose of social life to continue living, as it is for most extroverts.\n\nThe creativity in which words are assembled to form vocal ready sentences, has little meaning in the eyes of an INFP - simply because it's less relied upon to base an existence with - and that this creativity is used by other parts of the brain through the means of perception, fine motor skills, imagination and projection. \n\nAs a result, INFPs are more visually creative.\n\nEdit- didn't read the interior text, my bad.\n\nGive weight to your broad sense of interests and start collecting (second hand) books. Read into the subjects that interest you the most and, if applicable, learn the skills that are tied to the subject. In those skills you'll find your creativity.\nThis is your quest, good luck. 
1	What have you tried? And do you have a desire to be creative in any way? It's alright if you don't.
14	How has dating ESTPs turned out for you guys?	I had met this ESTP guy 25M (at the time) and things went super fast for us. It was funny because he was in a LDR with his gf and i know this says a lot about me but trust me i had tried often to put a break on this. He was controlling and would often try and kiss me and i would back off saying you have a gf but somehow it wouldnt affect his guilt at all, he still seemed to try and i gave in after a while because i was attracted to him. \n\nSo apparently his gf was also cheating on him and wanted to break up, suddenly he ran after her completely ignoring me (with a few messages once in a while) i will not lie that hurt like a bitch and felt like karma, also making out was a pretty big deal to me and he wasnt being clear at all about his intentions. He would occasionally hit me up and talk about her and i was so stupid and into him i completely stayed in the friendzone instead of leaving. \n\nAnyway he would talk and basically whine about how she cheated on him when he did so much for her and i couldnt believe how one can be so not self aware so i blurted ‘but you were cheating on her too!’ And then he exploded saying ‘how can I blame HIM when i was equally at fault’ then i was stunned and agreed that i was at fault too but that wasnt even the point? Besides i wasnt committed to her, he was.. \n\nAnyway in a few months we were in a proper relationship and tbh it was horrible, we would fight so often but when we would meet, we would engage in sexual activities that would still feel so empty. He would want to leave as soon as he was done and make me feel so used, i know i sound crazy to even stay and i feel crazier now that i am actually typing this out and doing much better mentally.. he would be so dominating during this causing me all sorts of pain. Me saying ‘no’ for some thing was a sign for him to do that even more.. \nhe would also speak so much crap omg i really dont know why i stayed, it’s just horrible remembering the stuff he would say and me not picking up those red flags.. \n\n\nThen we finally broke up in 6 months, i initiated it because i had left the country and just couldnt trust him and of course all the fights, funny enough when i went away i got the peace of mind to do it.. he would still contact me and i would too once in a while just to check up on the other. \nAnyway another fight a few months later where he asked me remove some guy from my insta and i told him he had no right to say that which hurt him and yeah that was pretty much the ‘its for sure over’ for me moment. \n\nHis cousin brother and i would play fortnite and got close and surprise surprise this guy tells me my ex had found someone few days after our break up (my ex only admitted to the part where this girl was in love with him, she got a permanent tattoo of his name on her hand but there was nothing from his side which seems a lot like bs) . The pain was horrible because all my doubts of being used by him came out to be true. Anyway the cousin brother had started liking me and was thinking of asking me out and he told this to my ex and thats when my ex came running back for me.. \n\nAnd yup i was stupid i took him back after a few days. He had gotten slightly better and so had i in informing him what actions of his hurt me and what used to hurt me. It was long distance but we were still trying, and i think it was more because of him than me because i had repeatedly told him i dont want him when he came running to me but he kept crying and acting hysterical..\nI admit i should have been stern with my decision disregarding his paranoid behaviour but i also thought since he was apologetic and everyone deserved a second chance.. also i wasnt really moving on either.\n\nAnyway this time too he was always around his friends and basically lived with them, he wouldnt give me time and our fights had started again.. so i ended it again after a few months. I didnt want my life to be like that at all and being with him again gave me clarity about what kind of a person he is. \n\nI honestly think he was narcissistic. Reading more about ESTP, a lot of stuff he did makes sense. The whole moving on so quick , the no emotional attachment during sexual activities, the whole always being out and about, the getting bored easily, the really being horrible at listening and constantly interrupting, the giving of advice when you are sharing something without really wanting advice, the whole being insensitive about comments and expecting no one to get hurt ugh. I cannot imagine being with another ESTP for the life of me. \n\nFor what it’s worth i am sure he was as unhealthy as can be in the form of ESTP and so was I as an INFP especially when we first started. \n\nTl;dr: So yeah i am sorry i went so long about this, but i would just basically like to know if anyone has success stories regarding INFP and ESTP?  \n\n
9	I think It gets horrible when estp loses interest in you. They are the sweetest and treat you like you’re the best person in the world when they are still interested but when they lose interests all of that is gone and you’re left with absolutely nothing. There is no in between.
6	In my book, most ESTPs are psychopaths or close to being one. I make sure to stay far away from them. 
6	ESFJ here. I’m married to a wonderful and supportive ESTP. I would never have dated most ESTPs, but there are gems out there.
5	They're sort of okayish for me, fun to hang around, but can't ever imagine getting any close to them, not even seriously being friends as the ones I met all were superficial (although I imagine not all are?)
3	Not an INFP but am I the only one who wants to murder ESTPs
3	I had a post about this, check my post history. Long story short I had a two year relationship with an ESTP dude and it was really toxic, a lot of things you mentioned. The narcissism was huge. Also the fact that he chased novelty so much I never felt stable, even after years.
3	I tried to be friends with one. Lol he's crazy. 
2	being an ESTP, this thread makes me sad\n\nI love INFPs they're so adorable and sweet 
3	Way to go everyone here. You're judging an entire type based on one person's experience. This was totally an unhealthy ESTP and/or person. Also how about considering that victims tend to exaggerate their abusers crime. Notice how her only flaws in the story were "returning to him".\n\nIdk what happened but I empathize with her experience and I'm sorry she went through that. \n\nHOWEVER. You jackasses should think for yourself before you start over generalizing and hating an entire goddamn group of people. \n\nChildren....

2	types of careers for INFPS	I am in a position where I have to chose between a job that I am passionate about but causes a ton of stress, for an easier but also less meaningful job. I have read that INFP's tend to not do well in positions that they don't care about, and need their work to be fulfilling. This concept is what has kept me in my current job for so long, but unfortunately I don't feel like I'm succeeding, despite my passion for it, and I am constantly sad while there because of how much I'm struggling. I have another career path in mind, but it takes some time to get into. I am considering taking a food service type position, but by doing so it sort of feels like I'm quitting and I have a strange sense of guilt.  It seems like a lot of my INFP traits are "flaws" in the work environment, and I would like to find a job where these can become strengths instead of weaknesses. Would love any insight from you all. What types of jobs worked for you, what type didn't, ect. 
1	I was in the food service industry when I was younger and hated it. I was too awkward to be a server. \n\nI’ve been a hairstylist for 9 years now and love it! I can be creative while only having to focus on one person at a time. People say you attract your clientele and I think its true. Most of my clients are quiet and sweet and dont feel the need to talk throughout their entire service which is perfect for me. I’m also my own boss and make my own schedule, it’s the best!
1	If me. I will take character game designer. Since I like to playing a game,passionate with game. Why not am I to create some game and characters?

2	Do I need an INFP in my life or an INTP?	Pros and cons to both?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am ENFJ.
3	Sorry to sound brash, but given you are on reddit asking this in an infp forum id say you definitley need INTP.
3	Supposedly ENFJ is one of the “best” matches. \n\nPersonally I have not known one. I am friends with a few INFJs and INTPs though. \n\nBasically my experience is N’s are always pretty decent around each other in one form or another. 
1	Gurl/boi/dood, you don't need no one but yourself.  Love yourself, reclaim your worth as the beautiful, complete soul you already  are and always will be. Live your life and those that celebrate your joys and companion you in your sorrows will find you.\n\n(Get yourself an entp)
2	More Whining. (how to deal with losing friends?)	It feels like my group of friends has been slowly cutting me off, and what they did today just broke my heart.\n\nExplaining stuff, used to live with two of them, one of them moved abroad and i came back to my hometown since i got no jobs. Whenever some big group event came up, i stayed at the house. The pepople who came in after i got away were also from our group of friends, and were chill with my crashing at their living room (we even had spare couches around so more friends could crash in)\n\nSince something like october last year, the ammount of get-togheters started diminishing, and this year i've been there only two times for birthdays.There is this big country-wide, full week party coming up, and the friend who moved abroad came in to party with us. first thing, they said i could not crash there cause the house would already be full. Some friends-of-friends with some grils who needed a place to crash at this big party would already be there.\n\nIn some ways i swallowed it since it is no longer my home, and i should have put more effort into having my own place.\n\nI can even go and stay at some family's house, but of course it is not the same thing. The thing that truly hurt me is that, when the abroad friend announced he was coming, i tried to hype them up about going to some waterfalls. Everybody was meh about it, saying we should just get drunk at the party. The friend already got here, and earlier today the abroad friend sends our im group a photo of him and other friends of ours in a car, really early. I already knew what they were up to, but only confirmed a few minutes ago when they posted stories of them on the waterfall.\n\nI feel betrayed, abandoned, and i know they don't want me around at parties cause i can get moody and shit. I've told them about the loneliness i've been dealing with, and they just they they've got me, but their actions just say the opposite.\n\nI really feel like just quitting the IM group and be on my own, but start getting anxious about wanting to get back and being rejected, or that i am just making a big drama about things. And fuck yeah i am jealous, i gave the idea, said i was dying to go on a waterfall roadtrip and they said no to it.\n\nIt already hurt a lot to not being able to go on the expensive stuff they do now that they's got good jobs (really know i can't blame them), but i feel so bad that they won't even try to keep me close.\n\nI know if i bring it up i'll be just signing my death sentence in the group\n\nHow would you guys react to it?  \n\n\n  \nedit ---- fuck i am not even a teenager anymore to be suffering about things like this, but i so failed at social stuff that these are my only friends left
1	I don't really have any solid advice, but just know that I truly feel for you.\n\nNot exactly the same, but I have a friend that seems to be pulling away from me more and more, especially to hang out with other people (whom she herself admits she is not close to). It makes me jealous, angry, depressed... And at the same time I know she could really care less and is probably feeling next to nothing for me. That might be the part that hurts the most. She is not hurting over this. She probably doesn't think about it with even close to the weight that I do. ...*If* she thinks about it.\n\nLike you alluded to with your friends, I think she finds me moody and tiring, but I just care about our relationship and really want/ed to work things out. Unfortunately she is not good at expressing herself, so it's difficult to understand what she wants or is feeling at any given time.\n\nUsually my advice would be to talk things out, maybe not to the entire group (that could be awkward for them), but to at least one person, and tell them how you feel. Not aggressively or accusingly, but just to get things out in the open and share that you've been hurt.\n\n...However, I did this with my friend and I wonder if I made things worse. I opened up to her and made myself very vulnerable, and I feel like she is now just using all of that as more reason to avoid me (in her mind). I still think it was the option that made the most sense at the time, but looking back I feel incredibly stupid for trying. And yet, although I know it's probably a bad idea, I have the strongest urge to try again.\n\nSorry that I don't have much words of encouragement, but your experience really resonated with my own situation and feelings. That sucks that your friends are treating you this way. Know that I'm wishing the best for you, and that I'm available if you want to talk more about this.
464	How I’ve been feeling lately.	
28	the first actually relatable thing on this board, thank you.
22	I've actually drawn almost the same image like 2 years ago, only I drew another image beside it of white hands breaking thru the shadow to reach me. At the time it was my own determination and realizing that I'm not truly alone, that helped me get out of that slump. Life will always give us challenges, you'll find your way.
14	Literally me rn. Had a breakdown yesterday 😕
13	I wish I could just hug y'all, offer you some tea and brownies (gluten/lactose free and vegan if needed). Anyway I'm with you guys
6	That's been me a lot of the time the last week or so.  Sometimes the sun shines through, but most time, not so much :(\n\nThat aside, nice job with the drawing.  Something so simple expresses a ton.
3	Same. That was me this morning. 
3	Reminds me of [Truth](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fma/images/e/e8/Truth.png/revision/latest?cb=20141129164933) from Full Metal Alchemist.
3	my girlfriend broke up with me thursday and i’ve broken down weeping and had panic attacks multiple times everyday since then. I really feel the exact same way as this picture looks.
3	I don't feel any better but I am here for you all, if you want to talk about anything or you need a friend please send me a dm\n\nhugs 🖤
3	I relate to this 
3	I love you, you beautiful human. I love you all. \n\nA beautiful drawing to express so much. I’ve felt like that, and I’m sure I feel there again. It will continue to ebb and flow. \n\nFor now, I will sit with you in the darkness, and offer you a hug.
2	Reminds me of the artwork for the AJJ album Can't Maintain.
2	Did you draw this?
2	Been feeling like this too! Smart drawing!
2	I’ve lately been really bothered by the fact that everyone I love will die. I don’t like how short life is. It’s upsetting. 
2	funny.... I made two sculptures in high school ...only two...and they were both in this position XD nice
2	Looks like we all really relate to the idea of a lonrly astronaut. I have been feeling like I would belong so much more in a spaceship all alone exploring the universe by myself than being in society and with people for so long...\n\nGreat artwork! Probably gonna SS it and use it as a wallpaper sometime soon. Always loved spacey stuff and this definitely fits
2	Listening to What He Wrote and literally sitting like this.\n: /
2	Overwhelmed
2	Someone saw my writing the other day and was able to pull out how lonely I was just based on my lingo. Crazy
2	It looks as though you are a being made in the stars. Surrounded by pointless chatter that fills the void as you wait. You wait to sense  something no one is resonating for aside of the few distant stars that know how to brighten the void. what you soul wishes to sense and resonate and give to the world is no different then the light that surrounds you no matter how dim and scarce those lights stars feel. you feel as though most of the world resonates as pointless empty chatter and space. It resonates a feeling of loneliness, and of hope. For you have placed yourself amongst the stars and shall soon resonate and learn to say that which the stars say. You are not alone, not anyone of you, we are just distant. This is changing though people are looking up and resonating more and more and soon the Void will be filled with thousands of thousands of stars all resonating with one another. Soon you will begin to find that which guides you to resonate with the the other stars. with time as you see others so to will they see you. as you feel others so too will they feel you. This world has drowned its self with a toxic level of words and not enough feelings and most of you are feeling this. The Mayans made a production that the world would “end” on some day May 2012. Most have mistaken what they meant. A world is what is made from that which is. The world was made of thoughts and words that can never express or resonate to our souls for it is not the words that connected us but the meanings and feelings that we had learned to associate with them. The world that which was made has already shifted and thus has ended just as the Mayans had said it would. They did not predict this with complaex worded science for they did not have the technology. but instead having learned too resonate with the stars the world and all things that flow As one. We are moving back to this capacity but more as one. for we have grown from the sciences and technology. We are privileged by that which is also causing the toxic pointlessness for it is giveing the opportunity for more of us to be connected in ways never available before. Too much of one thing really is indeed a bad thing but soon we will all be able to know and understand this. But the new world is like a child it needs time to grow. If you wish to help it grow, grow yourself. love yourself. For the world needs people to love it to grow strong and powerful not hate it. You can not love the world nor know what it needs without first knowing and loving yourself. The knowledge and people you feel you need are out there you just need to look. 
1	yes, and it comes and goes. but I’m hanging in there. :-) 
8	Heres a poem. (If you guys like them)	You think you may be a passerby,\nTo which I'll never understand why.\nTime takes a toll unfair and unjust, stripping my soul of trust.\nYou're the Enlightenment in the midst of postmodern chaos;\nYou're the understanding in words never spoken. \nDelicacy in your gaze, my will left in delightful daze.\nLonging takes me by hand but fails to grasp reality.\nMarble thoughts contest with laminate inferences inside the granite facilities of my mind;  echoes to be announced. \nIndifference isn't peace,\nNeither is longing. \nIt's not coming back, ever. \nMissing is too small of a statement;\nFill the void while you can,\nWho was I kidding?
2	This is beautiful! ♥️
2	"Indifference isn't peace, Neither is longing." Ouch, right in the truth.. Thank you for sharing.
3	How do you decide if you are successful in life?	I'd like to hear fellow INFPs thoughts on this topic.  
8	When i have obtained everything i have wanted, and feeling like i actually belong in this world 
4	I don't think life is as easy as saying you failed or succeeded. I think fulfilled is better way to put it, because there are varying degrees of success and failure throughout life, and as cheesy as it sounds, you have to go through a lot failure before you start seeing something success when you strive for something that's extremely meaningful to you. Fulfilled means you experienced those seemingly endless failures before you finally achieved your goal(s), and you spent your time trying your best to get closer to your ideal state, whether you ever find it or not. It's through that effort and time that you gain experiences, memories, and growth that shape you into a better and more capable person, and that better person goes on to inspire other people to become better and so on. I guess you're only successful in life if you truly give it your best shot, because even if you end up short of your dreams, you still don't have nothing, and it's your demonstration of character that goes on to influence other people to do great things they may have not done without you. 
2	I feel I am successful in life when I am proud of who I am inside and out. I know pride is supposed to be a sin, but honestly I know how good pride can feel. So that feeling of feeling proud, to me, is a feeling of success. Maybe because I am so hard on myself to actually feel proud feels like winning.
2	You set a goal, and if you accomplish it, you succeed. There's no real idea of success, so it's what you make of it. There are people who feel happy living in a van and I would agree that those people are successful. 
1	HAha! I am still alive! Eat it suckers. 
1	If the choices over the course of the last six months have similarities with most of the thought subjects that occur in the endless train of thoughts inside my head.
125	Thought you all might appreciate	
4	Ah, yes, the INFP anthem 😂
2	why infps generally gravitate toward me?
2	I’ve been attacked 😬
2	I loled\n
2	LOL
2	I’m happy!  ...... why? Will I be happy for long? Why do I fluctuate so often between happiness and sadness? Hahaha legit, the image is brilliant.
37	drew this a while back while i was in a really bad place emotionally. Just felt like sharing it with y'all and see if you can relate	
5	Looks like the cover of a Radiohead album. 
3	i've been doing a lot better recently, despite some anxiety and depression here and there, but i just wanted to share this with you guys, and see what you think.
2	This looks like the drawing from bird box 
2	Dread.  I like it.
1	youre an infp, just fly, its what you do best ;)\n\nalthough i find it a bit mind warping that the air is shattered, not just the ground
15	if we infps were a song	
6	John Frusciante  quote:\n\n>*Looking back at my life, I've always been most at home with art and with creativity. From another person's perspective it might look selfish or that I'm escaping from the real world, but for me, the world of art and music is the real world and the rest is a place that I don't really understand.*\n\n*(Source:* [*https://www.vice.com/en\_ca/article/ae87we/john-frusciante-foregrow-red-hot-chili-peppers-interview*](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/ae87we/john-frusciante-foregrow-red-hot-chili-peppers-interview)*)*\n\n&#x200B;
2	I really like this song, and dark necessities also
1	So it's not this?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4N3N1MlvVc4
38	Even though I’m a comic and really felt this, this applies to every profession and art form. Getting help will make you even better and I wish I could’ve seen this when I was younger. A healthy, determined INFP has unlimited potential!	
118	It’s been really sunny lately and that weather fills me with determination.	
5	Undertale! That game has got some fantastic music 
4	very pretty song, I'm also glad the sun is back,
5	Great piano playing! Kinda sounds like a nice uplifting song from an anime movie soundtrack 
3	Truly an uplifting piece and I also love the little fox in the bg ♡
3	I’ve defo heard this before (probs from an anime) so beautiful. I like your teddy in the background too. Great vid 
3	That was really nice, thank for sharing it
3	The lighting and filming angle are perfect!! 
3	you renditions of this song is just as rewarding as sending temmie to college
2	Dreamy 🧚🏻‍♂️
2	ooh undertale! cool
2	This is gorgeous! Loved the way you framed the shot too! ❤ 
2	Awesome! Loved it. I still  have to finish the game. About halfway through. 
2	undertale is such an infp game
2	A great cover from my favorite game! Great job. \n\n\nI wonder what type Toby is, I wouldn’t be surprised if he was an INxP...
1	Sounds just like the original!! Also sans undertale
1	What phone/camera did you shoot this with? The colors have this summer tinge to it which I like.
59	He called me his muse ❤	I'm an INFJ and for the past 6 months I've been romantically involved (idk how else to explain our complicated relationship) with my INFP best friend. I'm very forthright with my feelings for him, but I'm often left wondering how deep his feelings run for me because he can be kind of hot-and-cold. \n\nThe other day, while we were sitting in his workshop discussing his 1,000 in-progress projects and some new ideas I helped him come up with, he took my face into his hands and called me his muse before kissing me. It was one of the sweetest moments I've had with him and I've been thinking about it ever since. I can see how INFPs and INFJs might be a challenging combination, but I've never been so connected and drawn to a man as I am to him ❤
15	Very nice, we always upvote a good INFP relationship
11	My  wife is an INFJ and this post made me smile so much. It reminded me of us. Literally this morning she listened to me cry for like 3 hours about how my job sucks and how I want to start (another) new project. I've got about a million to finish lol. She is also my greatest muse. Without her my life would devoid of any real meaning or drive to live. If something happened to us I know for a fact I would simply retire from the workforce and become a vagrant. No reason to do anything else. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's an extremely difficult relationship, harder than any I've had save one. However it's been equally (even moreso) rewarding. The INFJ/INFP combo works because both understand eachother and have similar values. I am 100% codependent on my wife though, and her to me. We also can get in fights/arguments that are SO strong and sometimes not healthy. That said, we always work through them and share an equal amount of passion and joy for the good things in life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she was an ENFJ, I wouldn't be as happy as I am. Maybe I would be more active and a little less depressed but I also would feel much more anxiety and a constant desire for solitude and peace. To me, and for me, she is perfect. She is everything I need and then some. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur relationship was also very complicated at the start- and yet so rewarding. I proposed to her one random morning (the first time) naked in our bed after just 4 months of knowing her.  She said yes, but I decided to make it official later on with a ring and a proper proposal in front of our favorite Monet painting at the museum. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour relationship will have lots of tension if it's like mine, but in exactly the way you BOTH need to push forward. I don't anticipate an easy rosy life ahead of me with her but I do look forward to knowing that through the best and the worst, we are together. I look forward to being able to fully enjoy the good, because we fully understand the bad, together. Everything is together- and there's literally nobody else I could ever do this with. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for your post. : ) 
7	Ahw, that's so adorable (:
2	muse is an intriguingly difficult concept for me to grasp for some reason.\n\ngreek gods aside, every artistical idea that has come to me came from pure intuition completely uninfluenced by emotion, but with the purpose of driving/controlling emotion. in fact, emotions often clouded my musical clarity (i wrote about 12 bars of a slow prelude for the pipe organ, and looking back on it, it doesnt make nearly as much sense as when i actually wrote it). for this reason, most of my great ideas and clear thinking come when im half asleep (at night, not during the morning, unless its like 1 am).\n\nalso, that is probably the happiest thing ive ever heard of happening in such a long time. i wish you the greatest fortune and cooperation in your new relationship
1	That’s a really sweet story, I hope you two work out. Thank you for sharing, my friend 
1	I feel that is something I'd call someone to try to be sweet and they would take it as an insult. I mean doesn't muse mean "a thing to amuse you", basically?
13	I need help. Obsessed with someone maybe	I've been talking to this guy I met online 10mo ago and I feel like it's about to end. I think I've become too clingy and he is annoyed. Here is some background. \n\nWhen we first started messaging it was amazing. We talked everyday for hours it seemed. I felt my old loneliness melt away and I became really attached to him.   I went through some health issues last summer and he really helped me thru it. Even though we hadnt met, I fell hard in love. I still experience HUGE feelings of love/attachment to him. I just want to be close to him. He makes me feel safe.\n\nAs time went on I noticed we stopped talking as much. Now it's getting longer and longer it feels. I can't tell if I'm annoying him or if he is simply losing interest. I wonder if he pities me sometimes and doesn't want to hurt my feelings. I feel hurt and sad about it.\n\nI don't send him obsessive texts. I just check in sometimes and tell him I love him. When I don't get a reply I feel like it means he is trying to send me a hint. Our conversations are growing further and further apart. Am I doing something wrong? I feel like crying. I know you're not supposed to be this attached to a person, but when that person makes you feel safe and wanted for the first time in forever, you just want to hold onto them. I'm so scared to let him go. 
6	i'm going through the same thing with my best friend. not romantically though, just as a really close friend.
2	Ok so a few questions, were you dating? Or just friends? 
2	You definitely need to pump the brakes & realize there are other people out there than just this one guy. I promise destroying yourself over one person is never, ever worth it. As a guy that behavior would be slightly off putting especially if he hasn’t professed any love back. Guard your heart and be careful. This is coming from a fellow INFP whose been down this road when I was younger, it always ends in heartbreak if you are afraid of losing someone
2	I sorry that you are going through this.\n\n\nI can imagine the obsessive think  and the hurt this situation can bring.\n\nSeems that he is not butting in the effort. He probably isn't straight forward and saying things that maybe should be told. But you are also  playing a guessing game? In all honesty if you have that gut feeling telling he is pulling away you are probably right. This just the hardest thing let it go. Let him go because there isn't a way you could make him stay.  I am so sorry that this how things have gone. You deserve the same love you give. \n\nI wish you strength and sunshine. 
1	I know letting go of people is the hardest thing for us. But, sometimes its the absolute best thing that can happen. Have you ever met this guy in person? If no has he asked you to send him anything like gift cards? I've dealt with a lot of scam artists only as of late so my trust isn't there for online relationships these days.
1	What do you guys talk about? Is it mostly about your problems? If so that is taxing for someone else. It is nice for friends to open up and talk about their problems, but not all the time. Also, it sounds like he may feel that he is not getting enough from the relationship, which is why he is stepping away. Unfortunately you were communicating in texts instead of in person. In person you can visualize body language and so there are signs that show if someone is upset or frustrated. My gut is telling me that likely you were not paying enough attention to his needs. Focus on some extraverted feeling. It is tough for us but it is necessary.

1	According to Erikson's theory of human development at a certain age we focus our life onto bettering the world in some way. It is called "Generativity vs. Stagnation," and it happens between ages 40-65. For example, it may be volunteering for habitat for humanity or it may be advocating for clean drinking water in Africa. It is doing something not for the ego, but to serve others. Maybe it serves the ego slightly though because it can make the person feel good about themselves, but that isn't the main reason. For everyone else who doesn't find this inner purpose there can be stagnation.\n\nWe as humans have a desire to create, a desire to leave an impact on the world. Erikson calls this "ego integrity vs. despair". Schaie calls it the "legacy creating stage".
1	INFP more prone to health problems? More specifically, stomach problems?	I’m an INFP with terrible anxiety and stomach issues. I have IBS, possible gallbladder problems, terrible GERD and chronic gastritis. Also had two flares or diverticulitis and I’m only 23. I don’t handle stress well, and obviously I have so many problems with my stomach it’s like a chicken and egg question. I’ve had doctors tell me that I’m at fault for the pain because of anxiety, and likewise that the pain is at fault for my anxiety. There’s no way to know but the only way I’ve been able to stay sane through this is having some grasp on stress. \n\nI’m wondering if INFPs just don’t handle stress well, and because of that we’re prone to getting sick? Obviously all types get sick, but I wonder if there’s a frequency among our type for stomach problems specifically. I’ve noticed that a lot of creative types in movies and literature have overly romanticized health issues and I wonder if it’s rooted somewhere in real life. Sensitive people with sensitive guts? 
1	I have gerd. I have to be very careful with what I eat and I take medicine I am supposed to take daily but I probably only take 3x a week.\n\nSorry you are going through this. I was curious so I looked up stress and IBS and it says if you do stress reducing activities like deep breathing and meditation that it can reduce IBS symptoms. I thought that was kind of interesting.\n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/ibs/guide/stress-anxiety-ibs
1	As for not handling stress well. I do think stress for me can be overwhelming. I am terrible at multitasking so I can feel overwhelmed at work sometimes. Also I hate feeling judged negatively by other people so that can be stressful.\n\nBut I also think I can handle stress very well too. If someone is in trouble, I don't tend to panic and I do what I can to help them. I am actually an EMT so I spend a lot of time in high stress situations.
1	Interesting you should say that, because I have crohn's disease. My immune system just seems to like attacking my guts for no apparent reason. I'm currently taking medication for it everyday (Mesalamine) to try and keep it in remission. I'll most likely have to have surgery for it at some point though, since I'm not responding too well to various different treatments (Azathioprine gave me horrible side effects). They don't really know what exactly causes it. I know that I get stressed very easily, and I've been dealing with social anxiety and depression since I was a kid. All of that could have played a factor in it getting as bad as it has gotten.
1	I'm an INFP and I while I experience mild depression and anxiety I don't have any health problems related to it. However, I have an INFP friend who experiences more depression and anxiety and has a lot of digestive issues
3	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 26	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
3	How do you stay in shape?\n\nI am an INFP and I am naturally slim, but I am not naturally strong physically. Lately I have been focused on pushups and cycling as my main forms of exercise. What about you? What do you enjoy doing the most for exercise?
2	What is your take on wearing unusual clothing? Or having unusual hairstyle or clothes.\n\nNormally I prefer wearing rather plain looking clothes like a simple navy sweater with navy Dockers. But every once in awhile I feel the urge to wear unusual hats. Like I have a Tigger hat that is shaped like a Santa hat but is green with orange trim and has Tigger ears coming out. I may wear it out during the Xmas holidays. Or I have a Yeti hat. It is white and furry with black eyeballs and teeth.\n\nI wore the Yeti hat out in public on Saturday and it took a lot of courage for me because where I live only children wear silly hats. Adults only wear simple winter hats, maybe with a pompom at most. I was somewhat self-conscious but I just went with it. Of course I noticed stares, but I tried not to pay attention and just enjoy my day.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you feel drawn to unusual clothing? And if so or if not, I want to know why.
1	Ah, an empty classroom with the lights off. Nobody will come in until a class starts. I'm anxious about people coming in, but I will enjoy this peace until I'm not allowed to anymore.
1	Too many people today have been breaking me out of my BoltHole (the room where I like 90% of the time just zone out into my own world), just let me relax and make my own world spin
1	Any other INFPs feel really frustrated on the daily they can’t change the world into a happier, more logical, fair place? Real talk I’ve removed some social media just to stop debating / arguing with randoms over social and political issues. I also tend to stay away from news platforms because some articles have made me honestly depressed.
9	lonely	anyone down to chat? i'm lonely and sad and have no one to talk to
3	I'll chat with you!
48	I wonder how many times the people I think about think about me. I wonder who is thinking about me when I am not thinking about them.	
12	One of the ways I get the warmest of fuzzy feelings is getting a random text that goes something like "just saw/heard/read this and thought of you" 
11	ENFJ here, know I don't belong but I just had to sat I think about this incredibly often! We'll never know! 
3	This happens way too much to me. 
3	Just today I wondered how often do I show up in other people's dreams and what kind of roles do I have in them. Other people frequently show in my dreams, people I'm close to and people I don't know that well. They're never the main point of the dream but they're there and I wondered if I'm ever there in other people's dreams like that.
2	I think about this a lot.
1	the second is of greater importance to me, although both often cross my mind.\n\nthere are two different kinds of thinking in my opinion (based off of my experience)\n\n\- intuitiveish thinking\n\n\- sensorish thinking\n\nfor some reason many people fall under the sensorish thinking when they think about me. its annoying, and part of the reason good friends are hard to come by (for me)
15	Career Chat from a 30F INFP: It's okay if you don't know.	*tl;dr I didn't know what I wanted to do and fell into HR and did very well, which is now allowing me to explore other career options. It's okay to feel lost, because a successful career doesn't always mean you have to stick with it for life.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHi INFPs,\n\nI came here to understand more about career paths for INFPs and can relate to a lot of posts. I'm 30 and just now starting to figure out what I want to do when I grow up (haha), but after already having a successful career that has allowed me to explore my options. My current career has been successful by corporate ladder standards; unsuccessful because it still isn't my life passion and I'm going to burn out after a while as a result. If it helps any of you, here's what I've done so far:\n\nLike so many INFPs, I didn't know what I wanted to do when I grew up, which made high school and college difficult. I'm intelligent but was a terrible student because I just didn't care that much about traditional education. Still, I finished with whatever random degree would let me graduate (nothing useful in the real world) and randomly fell into recruiting, which was the best field I could've gotten into without much direction in what I wanted to do. \n\nI did well in recruiting because I wanted to help people find jobs (seasoned recruiters will agree this is a naive belief) but well-being wise, it was a terrible fit because it was too regimented with sales-like productivity quotas and requires a high level of energy when chatting to clients and candidates. The upside is that I was able to idealize it enough and did well, and as a result was hired by a large, well known tech company. I moved over to a programs role within human resources which has still been incredibly rewarding and better for well-being and energy, but still not creative enough to keep me satisfied.\n\nAt this point, 8 years later, I'm established enough in my career to look around, and I know my work style well enough to know that I want to pursue UX as I've always loved visuals and graphics since I was a kid, plus pondering data and analysis is fascinating to me. It's not going to be easy to make the transition, but from my first career I fully believe in two things: keep the faith and stay focused. It **will** pay off. \n\nI think as INFPs we love the idea of a lifelong passion as a career, but on the flip side, we are optimistic enough to know that going down one path is not the end all. It took me a while, but for you it may not. If I could do anything differently when I was younger, it would be to pay attention to what I spent my time doing (computers, graphics, etc) because it's exactly what I'm about embark on 8 years later. \n\nSo, what makes you happy? Is it yoga, video games, gardening, cooking? You can pursue those things :) But you've gotta give it your all. I hope this was in some way helpful for folks feeling lost - I know the feeling, but just know it all counts for something.\n\nGood luck!
5	29 and I still don't know what I want to do when I grow up.  I've been welding for 8 years, and I support myself finely, however I don't see it as a proper use of my time, so something else is in my future, what that is, is still a mystery. 
2	I'll partially disagree with the OP. It's wonderful that you've found and managed to do what you want. What happened to me in the last 2 - 4 years make me lean on the side that you should do the best possible thing that you're allowed or able to do.
44	When I close my eyes and think of old memories. Love being INFP.	
5	eighter you love or hate it

7	being alone	hey guys. so classes started and now I currently don't have any friends I can be crazy with in class, but I'm pretty sure that'll change once my bonding day starts this Friday. I'm kinda excited that I can bond, hopefully I'll be able to find a group of friends to hang out with and study with.\n\nbut in the meantime, the loneliness is getting to me. I seriously hate this, my friend (who's in another year) said to be emotionless and I'm trying to do that and not care, since I'm here to complete my education and get into university.\n\nany tips? I think I should be okay with eating alone and stuff, but I'll see about it. how do I deal with being alone? please help, it's killing me in a way 
2	By learning to accept your own company, your an introvert and like every single one of us you will always have a sense of loneliness but that just means we see the difference between us and others, what we more often then not fail to gauge is that us perpetually lonely species also have a tendency to bond  and connect on all levels but that will only come to fruition if we try and not beat ourselves up in failure, most people that we would meet in our lifetime wont mean shit to us and that's a universal truth. Introverts avoid social activity which simply puts less people in our paths and the high rejection rates of who will we get comfortable with doesn't help our odds either.  \n\nOnce we do form a group we feel warm with, the loneliness still remains, that's were the being comfortable with yourself part comes in. If you are not fine on your own you will automatically shut people out making them uncomfortable instead and distancing them.\n\nTry to chill out on the making friends part cause after your classes start you may find a group to hand out with right away but you will eventually get to know everyone in your class and over the course of your time there your initial group and all such others will end up jumbled anyway.\n
2	I've been in the same kind of place when I started my university (i just dropped out a month ago lol). Litteraly nobody that I knew followed the programme I did. But after a week or so, I managed to find people to talk with. A few months later I really got to know the people in my programme and I got some guys whom I had fun with as much as crying of laughter in class :)\n Just give it some time and at least try not to shy out, it will pay off
2	Anyone else cynical?	
1	What does it mean
1	Idk if I would say cynical but definitely pessimistic 
1	Extremely pessimistic 
1	I have a tendency to be but I consider it a character flaw and I’m working on it
48	How I envision the first convo with my future wife will go as an INFP	
2	Lol. 😂  Same but husband. 
1	This my wife and I EVERY day. 
1	What's this guy's name? I've seen him before on this subreddit and was interested in watching him but I can't find his videos 
3	Looking at the ground	So I saw a post about infp's always looking at the ground a couple of weeks ago. I didn't really pay much attention to it or think about it until the other day it popped in my mind. My friend asked me why I'm always looking at the ground instead of what's going on around me. I have no answer, I have no clue why I do that. Do you guys do that and why? Do you also find yourself being engaged in conversations with people without actually saying words? And why so people open up to me so much when I don't even offer much verbal feedback? Usually I am listening but sometimes I am not interested and people just keep going and going, it exhausts me.
5	I used to look at the ground constantly while walking. I think it was to avoid eye contact. But sometimes I will notice a leaf or a crack or a bug that I would never have noticed if I was not looking at the ground. I once found a dead bat. Another time I found a praying mantis in a parking lot. It amazes me that other people do not notice these things. But it probably amazes them that I do not notice everything else around me like the houses and such.\n\nAlso if you are curious why we don't look around, the theory is that INFPs have low extraverted sensing. So that part of us is weaker. We can still use extraverted sensing (which is observing the outside world) but we don't really value that part because we are tied to extraverted intuition (which is looking for deeper meaning in the outside world). What is the deeper meaning of the dark storm clouds ahead? Is it an omen? What does it mean to be an ant? Do they feel remorse? I think because our brain is focused on the deeper meaning it cannot spend as much time on the visuals. And perhaps looking at the ground is a way of reducing stimuli in order to focus more attention on our thoughts. I imagine looking at faces and our natural instinct is to look for the deeper meaning of their facial expressions and demeanor, which can be draining on us. A face is not just a face. It tells an entire story. So best to look at the ground to not go crazy all the time in deciphering every little facial expression. 
3	Yes to all the questions. \n\nI look at the ground, because it is so interesting. I think it probably started when I was younger and I did it to avoid being noticed; still do it to avoid eye contact sometimes. As an adult, I just like looking down, (and up and everywhere around me) because there are interesting/beautiful things. I rarely look to where I am going and that’s probably why I fall down more than the typical person.\n\nAlso yes, people open up to me all the time. I think it is because we are good listeners and empathizers.\n\n“They [INFPs] are known for being excellent listeners because they engage all brain regions that process voice, words, and volume. Unlike other personality types who may work out their response while someone else is speaking, INFPs use this holistic-listening pattern as long as possible so that they can try to get to the core of who someone is and what they’re saying.”\n\nhttps://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2017/08/10/use-brain-based-myers-briggs-personality-type/\n\n\nThese articles also mention our listening skills and other traits INFPs share:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/infpinsights.wordpress.com/2017/04/07/unique-characteristics-of-infps-ask-an-infp-3/amp/\n\nhttps://introvertdear.com/news/10-type-secrets-of-the-infp/
3	So I don't get distracted by visual stimuli while I'm thinking.
2	For me it's to avoid stepping on insects.
2	In my case, it's so I can avoid eye contact and to avoid falling (I don't walk properly).

46	Try to sit in the cringe, only way to move past it
41	I remember someone saying that if you find your past self cringey, it means you're growing as a person
12	Yup. Even things I’m pretty sure everyone else involved has forgotten.

Embrace that! Laugh at it! You're not the only one who played the fool and if you think you did, you're being too self-absorbed!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLiterally be Aang in this picture, use all of your past cringe not as a source of shame or embarrassment but instead wisdom and growth.

9	Struggling with Ugliness	I don’t know how to describe how much I hate being left out and neglected for being unattractive. I hear my family and people at my school discuss how unattractive they think I am all the time, and people tell me “maybe you’ll look better when you’re older.” It baffles me that the genes someone is given can make them happier, while the rest of us are left with ourselves.
10	I am so sorry they treat you that way! That is absolutely not okay. I’m 100% sure you’re gorgeous, and you sound really sweet to not stoop to their level. Taking the high road is sometimes really hard.\n\nI know from experience it can be really hard to hate the way you look. One time I cried in the fridge at my work because I was feeling so ugly and I needed a release...😅\n\nBut I’m telling you that, even though you’ve probably got this tattooed on your brain by this point, looks don’t really matter. What matters could be the way you smile when you walk in a room, the way you snort when you laugh, the way you cry when you’re too happy, the way you love and be loved, and everything about you that makes you yourself!\n\nIf you ever want to talk you can message me, I’ve been dealing with body issues and general insecurity for a long time but I’m steadily getting better and I’d be happy to help in any way!
3	Oh Lord! The ugly duckling story people love Soo much!!!!!!\n\nGuarantee you aren't ugly at all!\n\nI've seen picture perfect model types turn ugly as sin as soon as they open their mouths.\n\nI've seen people not considered modelesque (is that a word?) Turn into complete beauty by opening theirs.
3	Feel it too, bro.\n\nFeels sad to not be able to participate in "life's best time". All old people i know fondly remember their youths, but what will i have to remember beyond videogames?
2	Is it something in particular? A lot you can change. For example a nice haircut, some good fitting clothes with a color that compliments your skin tone. Also taking care of your skin. Making sure you use a moisturizer designed for faces. Or if you have acne or psoriasis they have certain medication for that.
1	Instead of saying oh no you’re beautiful anyways! I want to help you another way...\n\nWhat is/are the part(s) you think you’re ugly? Where are you really self conscious about? I mean, you can change certain stuff. I struggled with this a LOT (and still do lmao) and I know where you’re coming from so I can help you a lot.\nNowadays people say I’m handsome sometimes but I just don’t believe it cause it’s just melted in my brain..\n\n
16	I hope everyone is having a great day :)	Good vibes today y'all :) stay positive 
3	good day? whats that? lol \*laughs through tears\*
1	Thank you. I hope yours is pretty good too
4	My INFP boyfriend told me, ENTP, that he loves me and I've been feeling disconnected.	I need help. I'm dating this great INFP guy (30), but have always worried from the beginning about an underlying lack of compatibility that has only gotten worse lately. He is intelligent and mature but he keeps things light. He very rarely ever expresses his opinions, hardly ever his thoughts, and rarely discloses his feelings. I typically have to dig for his thoughts and feelings, and even when I dig sometimes I do not receive much.\n\nI'm pretty sure he is content to just lay around with me and "feel" without saying much of anything with real value. When I try to initiate a serious or intense conversation, involving deep thoughts, things drift back to a light mood where he is seemingly more comfortable. From where I'm sitting, he prefers light-hearted fun.\n\nThus ... I've been feeling really bored and disconnected from him. I'm losing momentum with having to pry for so much on his inner workings. I definitely don't connect just through proximity and cuddling. I connect through depth of who the person is (how their mind works, what their values are, what their thoughts are on everything) and engaging, intense conversation. I like fun, too ... but with a longterm partner I would need more. "Just fun" is reserved for friends, and not particularly close ones.\n\nI told him today that I've been thinking I'm not sure we're compatible. I kept it short and sweet and said, "I connect through intensity and you seem more frivolous or carefree. I do have a lot of fun with you though."\n\nAnd he looked bewildered then told me he's been searching for the right time to say it, but he loves me.\n\nWHAAATTT. Literally this guy seems so "whatever" all the time that I had no clue, absolutely no clue at all that he even liked me all that much. I have known him for almost a year (we were friends first, have been dating for 2 months) and sometimes he still feels like somewhat of a stranger.\n\nI would prefer things to work, but this incompatibility is not going to go away for me. I develop feelings through my head first and I'm not sure how to express this to him without saying "you need to change," because I know he's not doing anything wrong. We are just different. \n\nFrom an INFP's advice -- how do I approach this?\n\n\*\*tl;dr\*\* I told my INFP boyfriend I'm not sure we're compatible because I prefer intensity and is more carefree. And he, bewildered, told me that he loves me. I have no idea how to proceed with this issue and conversation now.
3	I had this problem with my last gf, we didn’t work out for different reasons but I can tell you that he probably cares very deeply for you. I remember thinking a lot about all the different things that I loved about her, but for some reason I seldom shared those thoughts with her. I’m sure that was a mistake. \n\nI also tend to be very hard to open up, I tell few people about my feelings because nearly every time it just gets me hurt. The closer I am to someone the bigger the risk. If he feels the same way I do then you just have to tell him straight up.\nTalking about thoughts and feelings is something that has to be done in a relationship. And if you want it to last you both have to be willing to share everything, regardless of the risk. \n\nOn the other end, you should try and look for the ways he shows you he loves you. If not always through words, then find what it is. Look at the way he smiles when he looks at you or the way he he breathes when you hug. Often, I internalize my feelings without thinking that I should share them out loud. \n\nHope this helped, and I hope you two work out :) 
3	I was somewhat in the same situation. I did a great effort to be more open and have serious conversations with my ex. However, she was not able to do the same.  She asked for deeper conversations but she was not able to share when it became deeper.  That could be for multiple of reasons in my case, (her depression and anxiety) but also that we INFPs often show affection and love through actions. If you do not notice those clues, can cause a misconception that we do not care, and you as a girlfriend do not trust us enough to open up. \n\nI think you should ask how he shows love towards you. Even though he do not need those deep conversations as often as you do. If he loves you and cares for you, he will fulfil those needs for you. You should also tell him you need deeper conversation, but at the same time show him how you would play that out. Meet him halfway? Show him the ropes, I know that it can be hard for an INFP start those conversations, but once we get going we can go on and on. I am sure that your boyfriend is a really loving and caring person. He is perfectly capable of having those conversations you are seeking.\n\nWhen you say carefree, what is carefree about? He doesn’t care about anything? If that is the case, tell him to voice his opinion more. That was a pitfall I fell into, I had a lot of opinion but I often chose not say them. If you make him tell his opinion more there will be less careless and you will definitely get more intensity.
2	IM SORRY BUT LOLLLL I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS W MY BOYFRIEND BUT HES ENTP AND IM INFP. i connect really well 1 on 1 so i want to talk about my feelings w him 🤷🏽‍♀️ 
1	Try an INFJ.\n\nI'm good for the dv lashing.
1	What do you mean by intensity?
1	It sounds like he is not meant for you. I too crave for connection. I am an INFP and I need to have deep moments with someone. I need them to be able to open up to me and share the dark side along with the light side. I also need them to be able to listen and understand me when I open up. For example, I opened up about my stepfather. It was telling my ex a story I recalled out if thr blur when my stepfather humiliated me and he felt ashamed of me for who I was. My boyfriend at the time did not say anything. He did not acknowledge my feelings at all. He asked a question about a fact, and then he made a joke. It was not what I was looking for. I wanted empathy and comfort. 
1	I know what you mean in a way, in that the ENTPs I’ve known tend to be far more talkative and open than I am. I guess sometimes I get complacent and just enjoy listening to them, that I forget that they want input. Also I tend to want to think through what I say, so I’m a bit slower, and they like to interrupt a lot and clearly zone out or rapidly change the subject, so I figure they’d rather I listen than get back to them like 5 minutes later.\n\nI think if you want it to work, you should give it a good faith effort and say, “I care about you too, but I need more feedback/input/dialogue/ in our relationship. I don’t like to be the only one talking and I get bored of just laying around; this is a relationship need for me” and maybe you can get more feedback on how he’s perceiving the relationship expectations. Because I like to talk, but I don’t always feel like me talking is what other people want. \n\nMaybe you can phrase it as: “I want to know you better first”\n\nBut I mean, I also see what you mean about an underlying incompatibility from the beginning, because usually that’s just something you should use as a filter, but I mean, at the very least, he understands what could become a consistent issue he might see throughout his relationships, if his internal nature is particularly extreme. Also relationships are compromise and articulating expectations; we can’t read each other’s minds, we only just try our best.
1	Just wanted to offer a slightly flip-side experience:\n\nI'm an ENFP chick, have been dating my 30 y/o INFP dude for like... 7 weeks? He is the same: proximity and cuddles *is* his connection. He just wants to lie in bed or on the couch, wrapped around me, kissing and talking and laughing and not much else. \n\nThis is everything I've ever wanted out of a relationship.\n\nWhen we go out, it's incredible and fun and energetic, but every moment wrapped up in one another in quiet bliss is the definition of happiness to me. We are completely and utterly matched in this regard. Touch and quality time is obviously both of our love languages. \n\nI'm a true extrovert. He doesn't drain me at all. He is a true introvert. He needs his alone time, but I don't drain him. I do need to get out and be with friends and be active. He joins me. Then we spend the rest of the weekend blissfully engaged in a whole lot of nothing. This is the perfect pace for me. Literally, everything I've ever wanted.\n\nAnd he told me loved me after just 1 month of dating. And it was fucking fireworks. He meant it completely and I meant it too and I think we were meant to be together. Our love is all that matters. It's the perfect union of energies and goals. 
51	im in austria in the mountains, says enough right?	
2	I was at a similar place yesterday 
1	Impressive, you got up there. How did you manage that? Did you go alone?
1	[deleted]
1	Wooow. I had one of the best times of my life on an Austria snowboarding trip. Looks like you are havin a blast, enjoy! 
1	yesss went snowboarding in austria last weekend :D amazing weather.\n\nsweating while snowboarding\nfreezing while taking the lift tho
3	Does anyone else think Freddie Mercury could have been an INFP?	I’ve seen interviews with him and he seems a lot more reserved and quiet in comparison to his stage persona. I’ve also read articles about him saying that he was very closed off to others that weren’t close to him. He has a lot of mannerisms that make me think he could be an INFP and I’m just wondering if others think so as well.
4	I personally think he was an ISFP. The musicians I know that are INFP have a reserved onstage presence as well, while the all the ISFP seem to come alive whenever they perform.
3	Mercury definitely had Fi but I don’t think he was an INFP. I type him as a ExFP maybe ISFP
6	Dating as an INFP	I'm just curious, what has been your experience dating outside of your own personality type?\n\nLooking back on it, the women I've dated have always been extroverts. I've had some great times with them but I tend to get exhausted with them over time. 
12	wish I knew how to do this... dating thing... sounds pretty cool 
3	I feel like extroverted persons have made it easier in the beginning. You kind of get served with the social part and can just listen or tag along with them 😊 But yeah, it gets exhausting after a while.
2	I’ve been with both, but the one extrovert that stands out in memory whipped up an extreme passion and excitement in me... but long term it might have been too much. I dunno though, I was crazy about that woman. \n\nMost of mine I think have been introverts, though. In fact recently I found out another new friend of mine was also an INFP... and I started to get a huge crush on her once I realized how nice it was having someone that actually understood a majority of the thoughts and feelings I have about everything. I’ve never dated another INFP before, but I’d definitely give this particular one a shot!
1	Extroverts are great !! They help he get out of my shell so much, most of my friends are extroverted. Dating other types is all about going out of your comfort zone and growing:) Also realising you can teach those extroverts how to calm down and connect with themselves. It's really beneficial for both of you if you know how to handle it.
1	The only issue for me with dating extroverts has been they don't understand the need for alone time and that we get exhausted socially easily.
3	Weird Feelings That I Don't Know How to Handle.	So, everyone I know (not infps) seem connected to their families, but also eager to have some freedom. (I'm in my 20s, so are most of my friends). I'm having great internal turmoil over this ideal, over this feeling. Because for me, I'm at a fork in the road. I have a family that I'm super connected to and love so much, I don't want to leave them and spread my wings. However, at the same time, I'm also burning up inside with this force of freedom, independence, finding myself. I feel like it's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. I want to run, run so far that nobody will ever catch up to me, I want to be free and express everything that I feel. However, I grew up in a very negative home, yet I still love my family. Strong emotions and creativity were a big no. Dreams were a big no, they were immediately crushed by one of my parents who is an INTJ. Despite this, I love my family so much, even though I know they're flawed. I want to pull away, but at the same time, I'm worried that if I do, I'll lose them. I know this is kind of stupid, but I have a pretty conservative family and they strongly discourage a "free-spirit" type of attitude. I would just rather look how they want me to look on the outside (with my outward actions) as opposed to starting conflict. Tug-of-War is being played with my heart right now. I don't know where to go or how to handle this feeling. Almost everyone I know (including one of my siblings) seem to not have any ties to home. They always get freaked out when I tell them that I love my family and don't really want to leave them behind, even if only for a little while. They think I'm the type of person who would run at the first chance I got. Obviously, everyone is different, but I'm wondering if this is a problem within the INFP community. Do you feel connected to your family but also connected to wanting to go live your life and dream? 
3	I’m very close to my family as well and had the same feelings that you’re talking about but I found that distancing myself from my family made me appreciate them even more. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. It can be tough at times but it’s kinda beautiful as well. In the long run I think it’s healthier to seek freedom and independence.
2	So why do you want to stay really? To do what they want you to do? Part of growing up is realising your parents are only humans and to see them as one as opposed to god you have keep on appeasing. Especially if you can't be yourself in front of them, it's not healthy to stay in such situation. You can't change who they are, but you can do something about it and take care of yourself. Always take care of yourself.
5	Whats the point??!?	Hey guys, 26/INFP(m) I wanted to reach out and see if anyone can relate or if anyone knows the feeling i'm going to attempt to describe and what the @#$%ing point of it is; This feeling has been around for a quite a few years, not sure when it came about as my memory is shit, but I only feel it when I am alone and in my head, usually in a reflective mood.(or busy listening to music) It only comes into play when I zoom out on "my life thus far" and start looking at it through the lenses of "how i feel now" , the feeling is so hard to replicate on the spot that i have to catch myself when i'm in it as writing about it has already caused it to fade, if I would compare it to other feelings, it tastes like a cocktail of some bitter sadness, mixed in with some worthlessness and dab of self pity, sprinkled with nostalgia on the rim. it makes me just want to put on some music and cry my heart out but nobody got time for that shit, I grow tired of running into the feeling from time to time and it leaves me feeling tinged with sorrow for myself and just overall dips my mood, I cant figure out how to go about identifying it and wanted to see what the fine pepople of this subreddit thought about it...\n\nTLDR: Mystry feeling has me being a sadpanda, want to identify it but at a loss of how to describe it given its a feeling.\n\nThanks for reading this and oh guess what its too late! I already sent some good vibes your way and there is nothing u can do about it! <3
6	Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're referring to the feeling that your life has had no meaning when you look back on everything you've done up to this point.\n\nI feel this from time to time as well, & it sends me into a sort of introspective, self-isolating "funk" I can't seem to get myself out of. Eventually, it always goes away, but there's nothing I've found that can help me bring myself out of it purposefully. This feeling, at least in my experience, will sometimes be short-lived, but can last days or even weeks. \n\n\nI think it stems from feeling as though you haven't made a positive, lasting impact on the world. There's a semi-cliché quote that's hanging in one of the halls at my highschool; it says something along the lines of "You can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone". It really helps me to think of my life in this mindset, and try to think of all the small things I have done / could do to make someone else's life just a little better. I think it's something all INFPs could really benefit from. Anyway, hope this helped at least a little bit!\n\n
4	ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ
3	Been going throught the same thing for a long time and most recent 'attack' was actually tonight. I feel it as a sadness to what is happening in general so to say and often start thinking about my past or about me as a person and what I'm worth in those moments. So far I haven't found any particular way of beating this feeling. I am starting to go along with it. I write, talk to someone, listen to music which I think is in that mood and just go through it. Especially by writing I try to make it something productive, something good in a way. And articulating it helps to tone it down to a more specific thing so e.g. instead of a hollow feeling I end up with a feeling of rejection which I then am more able to tackle since it's easier to grasp.\n\nHope this helps a bit. Hang in there - your feelings are strenghts, not weaknesses !
3	I am 32M and can relate to this. I think it is a combination of childhood ending and a fear of dying.
2	I tend to drift between these kind of feelings and distractions. A lot of my life lately has felt like I am just passing the time, where I once felt like a new tool with lots of purpose and the ability to create unique things. Lately I feel somewhat blunted and shelved, waiting to be discarded.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think for me, I have been a bit ruined by my environment, and my own bad habits. I have always had a bit of a depressive streak and it has always been easier to sit and scroll through websites for the nth time, than to give my mind the freedom to explore a bit. I was getting somewhat dependent on the news cycle surrounding politics over the last few years, and by association, news in general. But now I am feeling like I have utterly neglected my mind and sense of expression, where I used to feel like I had a colourful imagination. I struggle to come up with ideas to draw. Where I used to have stories to write about, I struggle to think about fantastical things. I kinda feel like I have allowed mindless distraction to make up so much of my life, that when I try to remove it, I am not really sure how much it left over.  Which in itself is utterly depressing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, lately I am sorta learning to find my creative streak once again. Partly by opening up on here, partly by making time to pursue creative hobbies (I am writing again and getting fairly excited to get back into it). So to bring it back to your original point, always try to provide yourself a creative outlet 😊
2	Do you know what is causing the pain? Maybe you have some issues you need to deal with. For me it was issues concerning my stepfather being an angry person most of my life.
2	I have this exact feeling more frequently than I would like, just out of the blue it will hit me and ruin the rest of my day. \nI was talking to a good friend of mine about this feeling one time, Though until I read your post I didn’t realize that that’s what was happening. I was telling her that my biggest fear in life is that I’ll die without making a difference, and that I think about that a lot. She told me something very cliche but I could tell she was genuine in saying it. So I’ll try and deliver it with the same twinkle in my eye and smile that she did when she told me.\n“You’ve already made a difference in the world, you mean more to the people around you than you think.”\nI think about that every time I get in that place now. It doesn’t make it go away. but at least I can smile knowing that, even if I haven’t changed the world, I’ve made a few people’s lives a little better. And really, isn’t that what it’s all about? \nI hope the words of my friend can help you as much as they have me. 
2	I've been going thru a similar funk myself. It's so hard to explain. I'm a generally upbeat personality, with lots of whimsical energy. Lately though, holy moly, I just can't shake this feeling that I would liken to driving down a straight road, cruise control is on, with a very loose grip on the wheel.
2	mystery feeling has been experienced by me\n\nand yes, human life is supposed to have no meaning (but to reproduce) outside of a human mind.\n\ni guess you kind of have to learn to accept the feeling of emptiness for what it is.\n\nmusic, for example, outside of a human mind should seem completely futile, but humans enjoy the sounds, so we do it.
1	Yes, I feel this way sometimes too.\n\nAlso don’t know if this will help, but when I’m feeling misunderstood or can’t find a word to describe how I’m feeling, I search for “words I never heard of” (there are so many good ones) or go to the dictionary of obscure sorrows- in hopes of finding the scratch to the itch, that is the feeling I can only vaguely describe.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=words+I+never+heard+of&client=safari&hl=en-us&prmd=vnsi&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiO3LSThtngAhUk0oMKHTJUAOQQ_AUoBHoECAwQBA&biw=414&bih=719\n\nhttp://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com\n\nHere are some good ones:\n\nNodus Tollens: the realization that the plot of your life doesn’t make sense to you any more\n\nLiberosis: the desire to care less about things\n\nAltschmerz: weariness with the same old issues \n\nMetanioa: the journey of changing one’s mind, heart, self, or way of life.\n\nNefelibata: “cloud-walker”one who lives in the clouds of their own imagination or dreams or one who doesn’t obey the conventions of society, literature, or art\n\nHiraeth: a homesickness for a home you can’t return to, a home which maybe never was; the nostalgia, the yearning, the grief for the lost places of your past.\n\nSonder: the realization that each passerby has a life as vivid and complex as your own.\n\nMeraki: to do something with soul, creativity, or love.

29	You all inspire me	You're so beautiful. You make me want to pursue my dream to buy an old RV and do art things while I live in the forest with my little dog.

2	Even smiling to hide your feelings can be hard sometimes tho
2	What if you smile because even though you are emotional about everything the world is still awesome and life is fun despite all the weird stuff? 
1	Me two hours ago at a job interview. I tried to look cheerful (or at least pleasant) for so long that my face started shaking...
42	Fresh out of a breakup and did some soul searching. This explains everything ._.	
23	Your infp friend has really ticked you off, but what you fail to understand is that an INFPs tendency to feel all that you feel and beat themselves up in silence for it withdrawing even more from you cause they think they hurt you. Ya INFPs are not perfect and hard to get through to but selfishness isn't in their trait. Instead of ranting out on Reddit try communicating the same to your friend with no filter, bear truth and you will see a side of them you never thought them capable of having. INFPs are nothing if not understanding and adjusting towards others.\n\nINFPs have a superpower of blaming themselves for anything that goes wrong around them and create distance because their overthinking would cause even more uncertainty and that with everyone they know. We can literally create a fear out of zero evidence and that's what causes your friend to withdraw from time to time. Being disappointed in them would not change that and would push them away even further.
15	Nobody's fucking perfect. Every person is a Asshole in their own special way 
4	Welcome to the world of introverted feeling. It’s our dominant function, so not entirely our fault. It’s our job to communicate what we are feeling to our significant other, hard as it may be. 
8	Damn, a lot of that rings true for me when I'm at my worst, tbh. I guess I only put so much stock in these personality types (depending on my mood I can get INFP or INTP, but maybe that initial caveat is important), but we're not doomed to these negative behaviors. \n\nA lot of these exact behaviors lead to the ending of what was, for a while, a really good friendship of mine, and almost lead to the end of a 5+ year romantic relationship around the same time. But I started going to group therapy, where I had to be honest to people, and I started doing more to build an emotional self-reliance. I'm still working on being more attentive to others and NOT ignoring communication because I fear the potential of conflict. It's only been about a year, and I also have a double whammy of ADHD and high functioning ASD, so I'm still making slow progress with that in particular, but you can kind of train yourself to do it, right?\n\nSelf improvement is a real thing, but it's a lot of fucking hard work. In the short term, it doesn't make me too happy, and can be really frustrating in the moment, but when I look back at where I was a year and a half ago, I realize that I am generally happier and less shitty to people around me. 
7	Ouch
3	This bullshit gets posted in every several months.
5	so true but so sad at the same time
4	It kind of hurts a little (a lot) that’s an ugly truth, but one that needs to be faced in order to be worked on. 
2	Joke's on the poster. No one can call me and I can ignore no one's phone calls when I finally get rid of my current main line and switch to a feature phone just for my immediate family to contact me in case of emergency.

2	I'm sorry, I'm an INFP who broke up with an ESFP because this is exactly what he did to me. He really disliked conflict and wouldn't give me clear answers on anything I ask him. Not unless I have to press on something. At the beginning AND the end of our relationship, he was very in-and-out. Can't make up his mind whether he was into me or not. He hated whenever I was depressed. Would only communicate intimately with me when I would be 'happy'. But he claimed that he was in love with me for a long time in the middle. He was also very deflective and disliked being truthfully criticized. Sometimes he'll turn the blame on someone else. He doesn't think far ahead, so he's always going with the flow and doesn't make solid plans and that explains his indecisiveness in future planning. I kept feeling used by him by the end of it all. For security, for free meals, for materialistic desires (for god's sake, he got his dream car because of me). He made it seem like he was somewhat reciprocating back to me but they all came down to nothing and nowhere as much as what I gave him, which was pretty much almost everything.\n\nTherefore, I don't think one definitive type would explain this behavior that well. It really comes down to maturity, not exactly type. In fact, I really try to let people know that I'll get back to them or am busy/feeling drained and will be more available some time in the future and I would let them know when because I want to keep a good relationship with people around me. The most accurate you can get with this post is probably xxxP or xxFP, not just INFP. And even then, having a P wouldn't mean that you're always so indecisive or ignoring people like this. It depends on the person.
2	Ugh I do all of this
3	Feeling extremely hurt and confused by an INFP, I wish I could tell him these words, I wish he could get out of his shell and also feel my deep pain coated in social-butterfly-ness too. Hurt by his random lack of communication and insensitiveness one day and super warmth and caring behavior on the other day and dragging me into this unhealthy contact, but I decided not to share these feelings with him anymore instead writing them and send them to myself because he might randomly either just care or not even bother reading them. :) 
2	Biggest oof
1	I just got out of a relationship about a month ago and I still think about it everyday because it was an extremely confusing time. I think we are both INFP's, I know I am, but she basically did all this shit, and I have severe confidence issues and abandonment issues so it really bothered me throughout our time together. But, honestly after reading this I feel like I do this to my friends a lot and it kind of makes me feel bad, I hope I don't cause harm to them like what I just went through recently.
1	Looking at my chat-logs in group messages, I realized how rarely I ever messaged my friends. How am I still in any relationships...Reading this post made my heart ache.
1	I see so much truth in there, don't actually realise that I'm being so selfish usually, but I appreciate it so much when People point things out to me, which is another selfish thing because I should be able to realise what I'm doing myself!!! Argh! 
1	Thank you for this one! I am 4 months in a breakup, and these negative aspects is what I believe, from my part, made the BU happen. I've been trying to reflect, it got way easier reading this even tho it hurt a bit. I wonder how to fix :|
1	This definitely stings but I do genuinely think I'm overbearing and such when it comes to people I care about. I want to be involved and help and do what I can and I suppose that's me trying to inject myself into their lives when they are their own person. But I also just want the other person to be happy and my indecisiveness tends to stem less from just not knowing what to do but more so just really wanting to do whatever makes that other person have the most fun and enjoyment and not knowing that sucks. I don't care so much about my own feelings because I'm going to be happy just spending time with someone I care about. But I totally get how it's frustrating and I've been realizing I need to do my best to fix it and not focus so much on myself and just be less selfish in general and consider other peoples feelings just the same. I know what I want to happen, I know who I want and I know how I want them to feel about me but these things are two way streets and I know I can't force anything so I figure the best thing to do is take a deep breath and just try to live in the present. This is probably just a rant and I don't even know if it makes sense but I think, at least for me, I think it's a matter of finding someone you care about and want to better yourself for because if you better things just for yourself you're only focused on yourself and other people's feelings and how things affect them don't really come into your mind at all.
0	I needed this reminder... I'm doing better, but this was me a few years ago. I think the problem was that my receiving love language is Quality Time, and you can't expect your SO to be around 24/7, especially if you're not actually doing anything.\n\nAs for the calling and texting though, I can't relate, I NEED to respond to my friends and family ASAP or tell them that I need to recharge. I didn't realize until recently how hard it is for me to admit to people that I'm feeling overwhelmed but it's important to communicate so I'm working on it
8	Discussion - Got high for the first time - what were your experiences?	I went to Amsterdam and tried weed for the first time. It was a fun experience but I really don’t like high me. I was soooo needy and emotional; a big mess really. I laughed until I cried and then the tears made me feel sad so I was actually crying. I feel like all the emotions that I try to hide away were released. Apparently I talk a lot when I’m high and my friends said they learnt a lot about me. I don’t think I said anything too embarrassing or super personal but I still feel really embarrassed for letting my internal thoughts free. (I’m hoping they can’t remember what I said because I sure as hell can’t remember a lot of what happened.)  Either way, deep down I don’t care too much because the friends I went with would never judge me. \n\nAnyway, the point of this post is: what’s the high you like? I’m wondering if it’s completely different for every person or if your personality affects how you react.
9	I am quiet when I am high. I don't really talk and prefer to listen. I pay attention to my senses more when listening to music or tasting food, which is a common occurence for cannabis.
3	I mostly found any negative experiences with weed were more being anxious and hyper self aware. I became a fan of it by just getting high and diving into video games and zoning in for a few hours.
4	Sounds like you got a little too high. I've done that a few times. It's on the same level as someone having one too many drinks and they start telling you they love you and all that.\n\nHigh me varies depending on what strain and how much. Usually I'm very smiley, not terribly anxious, creative, and interested in everything. The more sedating types have me locked in the couch trying to follow the storyline on a show.
2	For me it varies each time, but I have been known to cry because the chocolate milkshake had run out (I felt sorry for the milk because it didn't exist anymore) I've also cried because my boyfriend was making faces and it terrified me. Definitely makes me even more needy and sensitive, but as a previous comment said, I also found that zoning in on something like a video game just made me feel really chill and forget about all the other "sad" stuff
1	I'll tell you when I find out. Drunk me is talkative to the point of talking over and for people.\n\n🤦‍♂️
1	I jumped on a cigarette automat, that was my first experience. Nothing to add to that

8	Spent an year getting accustomed to my seat at work. When I finally felt “at home” in my seat and the people around me, today my boss decided to change everyone’s seats. Fml	I’m so mad I have tears in my eyes. I was moved so now instead of being next to the one person in my department I get along with, I’m next to one woman whom I really don’t get along with. And it’s not because I’m shy either, I just really don’t get along with the women in my department - they are bitchy, and gossipy and just not like me at all. \n\nI was pretty close to the department with the people I work with the most, people whom over the last year I’ve become friends with. Now I’m far from them as well. I feel isolated. \n\nI’m waiting for my boss to get out of a meeting to talk to him so I can change back to my old seat, but I’m so upset I’m afraid I’ll start crying and lose my credibility. 
1	This same thing happened to me at my job... Im mot 10 so seriously, why.
1	what job is this, that is domineered by extroverted sensors? that doesnt seem to be the healthiest place for an isolated introverted intuitive (see the movie matrix)
1	That's bizarre. You're normally supposed to sit with your department. Your whole department might get moved, but it makes no sense to just switch individuals and mix them all up. 
42	As much as some people think they aren't very adept at dating or the social scene because they're INFP, I think we actually get away with a lot do to a kind of unassuming "soft" charm	I've been thinking about this the past few days and it reminded me of something a friend told me in high school.\n\nShe told me if I got into selling drugs no one would ever suspect me, and another friend said the same thing about stealing from a store. I had no inclination to do either, but still.\n\nEven when I'm in an incredibly craptastic mood, people don't really seem to pick up on it. Unless I'm openly crying, people don't seem to have a great gauge for fluctuations in my mood so they just assume I'm chilled out or happy. I've been called "adorable" or "so nice" a lot in my lifetime for pretty much nothing. I never really had to prove that I was friendly, just kinda be there and act however. People do seem to trust me as having good intentions and being earnest very fast (which, to be fair, I do 99% of the time). I also seem to attract a lot of "protecting" motherly types as friends. \n\nHas anyone else noticed this? Thoughts? Disagreements?
20	I think I get what you mean. I’m aware and self-conscious about the way I present myself that subconsciously I act a certain way to not piss people off or to avoid confrontations. Like I’ll talk to people and have long conversations just because I know they NEED to talk, and I’ll oblige but deep down I dgaf what they are saying, I’m just being nice. I try not to be a shady person and I guess people see that and think I’m nice, even though I kind of hate most people, I just don’t show it.
9	Speak for yourself. I’m just awkward and uncomfortable.
4	Yeah, I attract a lot of older people at work. Some are that Protective type and others feel that I'm just someone they can trust. No one around me can ever seem to sense my actual mood because I never really show it outwardly. I find that I can get more information about someone if I don't talk to them. They just spill their entire life story to me without me saying a single thing to them. All their secrets and fears and dreams come rushing out at me and all I said was hello. 
5	I get that too! But I can also be very spicy and cheeky as well as sullen and blunt (when my inner intj is activated). Unassuming charm is very true :) I don't think I am that likeable though. \n\nI'm very soft at heart, but my Te is like a devilish porcupine. It mostly comes out in my writing style. It's really quite amazing how reserved and soft I am, but how sharp and terse my "communication" can be. That Fi-Te dualism in me, is quite bewildering.
3	My team leader at work recently said this about me. She said "he let's me know when I'm wrong but in a careful and nice way. Isn't he sweet?" I found it kind of weird tbh, especially because it was in front of others. I'm always unsure if people are genuine when say stuff like this, cause I don't see it. I once told her I wanted to do my best to make our project succeed, and she said I've definitely shown that, which I also don't believe. I hadn't done jack shit at that point. \n\nI think I and many others have issues seeing the good in how we portray ourselves and what we do, and even though I know I have that problem I still don't believe people when they say good things about me. Unless it's a very close friend. 
3	A couple of weeks ago, we were playing a board game called Resistence. In this game, there's players that are secretly infiltrating agents from the gouvernment trying to stop the actual resistence from succeeding their ops and I was one of them.\nOut team won and no one ever suspected that I could be a traitor. When I asked why, one person said that I look too nice for that.\n\nLol
2	I get this all of the time in work. Everyone calling me 'cute' and 'the innocent one'. I find it kind of funny cause I don't see myself in that way at all. They genuinely couldn't believe it when they discovered I smoked weed, they seriously thought I was joking. I have to say I do enjoy surprising people like that though lol 
2	My bf & friends will tell me that I'm the sweetest person they know, for doing next to nothing. I think most people just have a good sense of other's intentions, & we radiate good intentions. \n\nAlso, expanding on your comment about people trusting you w/in a short period of time, I feel like that all the time! People open up to us a lot sooner than we will to them, at least in my experience. I've had people that I barely know tell me huge details or issues in their lives. A few examples: Last year, a girl in my class randomlt confessed she starved herself after knowing me all of about two weeks. We only spoke during labs, but after that we talked during class a lot more. When my bf and I started dating, he told me about a significant negative event in his best friend's life within a couple of weeks. So yeah, I think we just have auras of good intentions 😂
10	[Recomendation] Moanin'	
1	Oh heck yes 😉😉
1	Never actually listened to the whole thing... but if you want a Japanese movie that's basically a tribute to this song and the jazz genre in general, I highly recommend this movie, [Kids on the Slope](https://kissasian.sh/Drama/Kids-on-the-Slope/Movie?id=39897). Not only did the two male leads actually train in their respective musical instruments, but the female lead is also among my personal favorite Japanese actresses.
2	How do you cope with loss?	I have had two brothers pass away. My brother Jason in November 2014 unexpectedly from an enlarged heart and my brother Sean in December 2018 from cancer. I know time heals most pain, but it's still pain. I have gone to music to help. I've tried to direct the pain of loosing them towards motivating myself to accomplish my goals I know they would be proud of. \n\nI don't think I will ever heal from these losses and I am afraid of loosing more of my loved ones (my hedgehog, Nigel, passed away two weeks ago of a tumor). \n\nHow do you guys cope with loss? Is it normal to not be able to actually let it go? What works for you? How do you deal with the anxiety/depression felt, if you feel it? \n\nAlso, if you have any music suggestions let me know.
3	I’m so sorry, I can imagine it has been really painful. It’s perfectly natural to still be in pain, grieving takes the time it takes and that’s usually more slow than we’d wish :).\n\nI remember vividly talking to an acquaintance about my father, a few years after he had passed away. She said to me: it takes seven years to deal with a loss like that. And strangely enough, her words turned out to be true. It got less painful throughout the years before that, but after those seven years I felt at peace and as if I had truly processed it all. \n\nI still miss him at times obviously, but it doesn’t feel like a dagger to the heart every time I think of him anymore. The bottomline of it all is, these are some great losses. And you’ll need time to heal and find acceptance and peace. Noone can dictate the pace for you, not even you yourself. \n\nTake your time. Cry when you need/want to. Miss them. Accept the holes it left in your life and that that hurts. Accept that other losses trigger all this pain, it’s normal and ok. If you feel you’re truly stuck, get some help. And trust the process, even if it hurts like hell you’re still moving :). \n\nA big hug.
2	Ruminate it until it doesn't feel that bad anymore. Might take years, though. :( But that was when I was younger.
2	For me talking to them can help. I sometimes write them private messages on Facebook. Who knows if they get the messages? Maybe there is some online computer in heaven that they can access them. But if not, simply the act of writing the messages can relieve some of the emotions.\n\nHonoring them can help too. Like my grandmother loved to garden, so I planted a pot with flowers in honor of her.
2	Time
2	It’s difficult. My dad died suddenly when I was 18. I’m now 31 and it’s still hard. It gets easier to cope with the day to day, but it never really goes away. \n\nSomething that strangely helped me was working with the elderly. I’ve lost so many amazing people, but I am grateful for the time I’ve had with them and I’m honored I got to be there with them, to support them, at the end of their lives. Working with seniors, I’ve realized how short and fragile our lives are. We all assume we have tomorrow.\n\nI’m trying to live each day to it’s fullest and appreciating the time I’m given, because even 90 year olds say that their life happened in a blink of an eye. To hear that 90 years flies by too fast, I want to live each day like it is my last.\n\n“There are only 2 days a year when nothing can be done. One is called yesterday and one is called tomorrow, so today is the right day to love, believe, do and mostly, live.”- Dalai Lama 
5	Goodbye wonderful INFP's.	I thought my BF was an INFP, so I've been hanging out here a while trying to get to know his personality.\n\nJust got him to take the test and turns out he is an INTP 😭\nOff to the other side... \n\nBut my bro in law is an INFP and must I say, you guys are the sweetest souls ever.\n\nIll always have a place in my ENFP heart for you. 
5	Those test results can vary depending on time taken so not all hope is lost yet.
2	Yea bro enfps belong to intps we don’t match good 
1	How did he found out he was an INTP?
1	I believe that I'm a sort of IN(T/F)P.\n\nI dunno, sometimes there are certain situations that needs me being more T than F and vice versa.\n\nThat's also why I'm on both reddit boards.\n\nYour boyfriend might be the same.
1	I know this is basically not related, but I'm curious. I'm an INFP and I have a sibling who is an ENFP and we get into arguments so easily. I was just wondering what your experience was like with a brother-in-law who is an INFP. Do you guys get along or have there been some rocky patches? Any tips would be appreciated. \n\n&#x200B;
1	intps are attracted (or at least this is just me) to the NFP types, so if you give him a chance, he could become pretty attached to you (assuming he finds meaning in being with you)
1	If that's what he relates to..... it's probably the case. I'm solid INFJ..... except when going through stress, such as depression or some other event deemed by me as traumatic. At that time if I take a test it cycles, INFJ/INFP. \n\nIn my normal state, it's always INFJ. Because I'm thinking clearly and spend more time about how and why I think.\n\nEmotional...Lord!!!!! INFP all the way! Really, in that state being here with the INFPs is a treat!!!!\n\nTry not to get too caught up in MBTI for your relationship. It's cool though you are taking that much time to understand him! That's an amazing quality in itself.
1	i need some advice	I have a lot of anxiety, and even though i have clear signs that the people around me love me, i still feel like i'm a burden, and everyone hates me. I don't know what to do to make myself feel better. help
1	It’s great that you can see that your anxieties aren’t grounded in reality. It seems like you could benefit from therapy. There are often affordable sliding scale options.\n\nFor now, you can also try WoeBot, the free CBT robot, who can help introduce you to some of CBT techniques: https://woebot.io\n\nI’ve been chatting with him through Facebook messenger and it’s been pretty fun so far!
1	Things that helped for me:\n\n* Take time to get to know myself better. What characteristics do I loathe about myself and more importantly: why? On the other hand, what do I enjoy about my own company? Once you have a rudimentary idea, you can consciously start shifting your mindset bit by bit.\n* Talk with your beloved ones about it. It will be hard, I know but more often than not it will lead to some heartwarming and eye-opening moments. To quote something my friend told me after I opened up: "I think it's really important at some point to come to a feeling of maybe *you* don't believe that you are good enough, but many others around you do, and so many others can't be wrong about something fundamental."\n* Find an emotional outlet if you don't have one already. Be it taking walks, dabbling in paint or some meditation.\n* Remind yourself to distinguish between situational and dispositional attribution. For instance, your friend might be having a stressful day (situational) which doesn't mean they stopped loving you (dispositional).\n\nObviously this list is not exhaustive but hopefully this helps!

3	Set up my future build machine as a Steam OS machine temporarily for the holidays. Installed Ultimate Horse Chicken, and it was kinda a success during the holiday visit by relatives. However, I realise that the kids who are too young are unable to play it. Being a major procrastinator, I didn't have the time to search for and QC child-friendly games. Felt like a bad host.\n\nChanged the liquid soap dispenser to a foam soap dispenser, because I like the foam and I feel it's overall more environmentally-friendly as less soap is used. Someone with arm difficulty tried to dispense soap, but finding the strength required too high and probably assuming it (dispenser) to be damaged, gave up and just used water. It was then I realised that my change, while well-intentioned, may not have been well thought of. How about kids and people with hand strength difficulties? Granted there's actually a soap bar beside the liquid soap though.
3	Not looking forward to work today. The people there are so toxic, I've been so run down dealing with all of the negative energy. Two days is not enough time to repair and heal from it all, just to go back and do it all over again. I'm only typing here as a way to procrastinate from going in.\n\nI want to find a new job but I feel like I'm stuck as I don't know what I want to do, or where I want to move, or do I even want to move at all? I'm feeling very lost.

1	Well. My anxiety is the worst it's ever been. But my meds still keep my depression at Bay? So that's good? I guess?\n\nWhelp. Back to pot and videogames.\n\n(I realize certain strains of pot can make anxiety worse, if I smoke one of those I don't touch the rest of that batch, that's not the cause of my anxiety spike)\n\n\nBut I'm torn. I hate my job and working. But I hate living with my parents. I feel like life is an all lose situation. We either give up our freedom to a job we lose our life to. In order to live. Or we can have the time to live and lose our lives.\n\nSo I don't know what to pursue anymore.\nThinking about going back to college to go into therapy after taking a year ofd 
1	Ever since I started college a few days ago I've felt really inadequate with how socially awkward and slow I tend to be in group conversation. Most of the time I just seem to hang out with a group and stare in silence as they talk and it all makes me feel incredibly out of place. At the same time, however, I find myaelf in the need to be with someone as all of my close friends are in other universities and I feel kind of alone tbh.\n\nI try to be warm with people and smile as much as I can, stand up straight and all that jazz but getting to meet someone and gain enough trust to not be a social potato takes time and I just haven't had that much time with anyone to really say I feel close.\n\nAt the same time, I have been feeling a bit too closed off from people, which I fear will really limit my chances romantically. Since my last relation ended last year I feel like I have somewhat improved the way I dress and express myself, but I dont feel I can be as outgoing or expressive on the spit as a lot of people around me. I was never all too god with girls to begin with, so sometime the feeling that I will just stay alone forever creeps in and I have to remind myself that my time will come and that everyone is alone at the end of the day.\n\nThe whole college experience is pretty fun once you look at it. Im doing fairly decently in my classes and I have a group of people I hang out with, but I do feel more "by myself" in college, which is a mix of good and bad I feel. It's only been little over a month but I do feel like I have been rather closed off lately.
11	Saw that some of you guys share your art so after a lot of overthinking, I thought I’d share some of my music	
1	Woah this is really good! These are some great hooks. I especially like rock bottom.
249	May the universe be kinder and softer to us	:)
27	Thats a dream come true.  I am resilient as heck but so long for that and "her."
22	Reminds me of a quote from 'Night in the Woods':\n\n"I believe in a universe that doesn't care and people who do."
15	I prefer may we make the universe kinder and softer
8	Amen
7	Word
6	The universe just is...
6	And may you never stop being gentle and kind
6	“It’s chaos. It’s all random. And it’s horrifying. And if you want to try to reduce the horror and reduce the chaos, be kind, that’s all you can do. \n\nIt’s chaos. Be kind.”\n\n
4	May the universe be kinder and softer to each other.
6	I think you mean, "may you be kinder and softer to yourself" : p
4	Blessed be.
5	That starts with us being kinder to each other. We all have to make selfish choices but try not to destroy each others feelings. 
3	Lost best friend to brain cancer and dad appears to be approaching the end of his life now. Despite me doing all the “right” things lately. It’s such an odd feeling to be powerless while still taking action. It sucks.
2	One can only hope, sometimes the thoughts run away and it beats me down. I can only hope things work out in the end.
2	As an INTJ, I’d like that too.. 
2	May you be kinder and softer to yourself.
2	Can you still be considered an INFP if you feel like the universe should stay how it is or be tougher? I feel like humans/society are becoming too soft and fragile.

1	What keeps me going :)
16	I've been subbed for a while but just kinda lurked and am always in awe of the beautiful work everyone puts here so I figured I'll add something I wrote one evening in regards to a friend of mine going through a hard time (Its very stream of consciousness so any advice to make it better is welcome!)	We stand here at an intersection\n\nWill we keep walking down the tracks and travel down the path to prosperity; will we be able to get up and keep moving if we get hit by a car, or will we lie there and allow ourselves to collapse?\n\nOr will we pause and stagnate in iniquity with a feeling of satisfaction that nothing has been lost; at the \n\nPerhaps we could take a turn and drown ourselves in the river of possibility and fight to rise above the current in order to do what no person has dared to do before.\n\nThere is also the option of turning the other direction into the city, and allow ourselves to be like everyone else and suffer in the rejection we feel, just to satisfy the appetite of those who care for us. \n\nRegardless of the direction we take, it is essential to never lose sight of who we truly are, else our mission will be compromised and any chance of success with either be brought down by the evils that lurk on the path, or we will cause the end of ourselves with a distorted perception of grandeur.
1	Hey there, I like your writing. Very much reminds me of my own, especially when helping friends pass through tough times. \n\nSome of the themes you touched on have even made their way into my writings. I'm no expert, so don't really feel comfortable giving advice apart from this - keep it up! The more you write, the better. Even if it's just for you and your friends .
1	What do you guys think of Artificial Intelligence filling in for the void?	
4	I think of it this way: \n\nHumans have souls. AI does not. \n\nCould AI replace the human-human interaction? Of course. We already fill many things as substitutes. But they will never truly be the same as the deep connection that can be felt between two souls. \n\n
1	our job as intps are dead pretty much
1	As we shift our lives to be more and more online, the more false representations of humans can replace real interaction. It is easy to imagine we all become part of some tight loop with an AI where we train our AI conversation partner to be what we need to hear at that point in time. If these interactions are seductive enough we could suspend our disbelief because of that feeling of being understood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen we begin to shed our physical appearances with digital overlays when we all use an augmented version of reality like our current one, we can all look like others desire us to look like. Interaction itself could become a giant app which is overlayed on top of reality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFortunately for us now - we have a few good years left of humanity. Where AI may be able to generative and patterns and temporal sequences of said patterns, but it still cannot understand subtlety of emotion and thought. Once this happens - I weep most for the scientists and computer programmers. The people who wanted to solve problems to be curious - whose only solace will be an endless entertainment loop from Netflix 5.0 - bathing their consciousness in neural Novacain .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe ultimate sadness is knowing this is all an inevitable consequence of such mundane factors, it has been predicted since the beginning of human thought. That the moment a tool is created which reduces work required to accomplish a task, eventually a collection of those tools in concert will produce a tool which can with minimal constraints actualize a human thought and be replicated effortlessly (a computer program). The ostensible goal of those who seek efficiency is apparently to work towards giving themselves and their ancestors a virtual reality where they themselves can be the protagonist in their own lonely, solipsistic galaxy... remote and forgotten - a meandering herd of stars all part of some everything - expanding at an accelerating rate - toward nothing really at all.
14	Do you ever feel like you won't reach your potential?	I don't know if this is a common feeling among other infp's, but I can't help but feel like I will never really do everything I am supposed to do. I feel like there is so much more for me but it will always be a little farther ahead. I don't want to settle and be content if there is something more, but I don't think I will ever be able to reach it. I feel like I am capable of doing some big, amazing thing but its just out of reach and I'll never get there, so why bother trying? This may sound like a bunch of gibberish but I thought of all the communities on reddit, maybe someone on this one can relate? 
5	10 years from now, the time will pass. In between these 10 years, you can choose to do actions to achieve some of your goals or to not. But the 10 years will still go by.
5	I totally will not do near the things that i thought i would do.  Time has a way of getting away.  It does not help that the "way the world works" is like the nemisis lurking in the corner, blocking your chances of completing or doing those things you've thought you would.  I too have always felt that i was here for something "big."  That thought has never been been at the "delushions of grandeur" level.  It is that I simply wanted to leave a mark more significant than "the guy who served as a sacrificial lamb to many."   It would be the greatest if I could accomplish something that helped people treat one another better beyond being a good example.  Whatever this life is all about, i aim to love my kids and be here as long as i can.  Its odd how time accelerates as we age.  If we dont use our experiences they get squandered before we know it.  Life is so strange...full of roadblocks, detours, and conundrums.  Im rambling but maybe thats what life is, just a ramble that seems like it takes forever then its gone and everyone is like "what was that for?" In the end (does it matter?).
2	Unfortunately, yes. I have made some steps that I'm proud of, but nowhere near the potential I would have wanted
2	INFPs or the idealists always seek perfection!!!!! So much so that we often forget to gauge our own strengths and mis- estimate how much we can accomplish.\n\nIts not that we cant reach all that we dream of but more often then not we forget to take a closer look at ourselves plus the overthinking and anxiety don't help either.\n\nWe can and many of us do make good on our aims, its just that we give up too easy cause we have a perception of how things would go and if the journey does not match our imaginative expectations we drift away from the path.\n\nI believe that out of all mbti types infps have an amazing ability of imagination and a sense if the bigger things in life that we never quite conquer and feel that we would never live up to our own unbelievably high expectations. This world including us is not so perfect and our dreams and aspirations are never adjusted for this factor hence the conundrum of to be or not to be.
1	let go of how you thought your life should be, and embrace the life that is trying to work its way into your conciousness.\n- caroline myss
1	I can relate 100%. It helps me personally to remember that life isn't a competition.
5	Does anyone else relate this to dominant Fi?	[Why you feel what you feel - Alana Watkins - TEDxOxford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-rRgpPbR5w)\n\nBeing aware of your own feelings, and from that gaining the ability to control and shape your inner emotional landscape.

2	What do you think?	u/thechessgoddess and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in XNFPs. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count moral obligations out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded. This is a place to express yourself, after all. 
2	Murder is logically wrong because you do not have to kill someone or something to survive. Also on an emotional level, I have the opinion that no one has the right to decide about someone else life. 
1	intp: im responding because this looks interesting\n\n1. murdering for material goods wouldnt work, because other people could murder you; murdering for morality wouldnt work under the situation, because there is no morality in this situation; murdering for food? seems like one solution to the overpopulation problem; for government, requires moral justification to (somewhat) avoid war\n2. the easiest question ever-everybody kills everyone, boom, no world left to conquer.
1	1. Murder is logically fine if:   \n\- An assessment of the situation in question determines that murder is an appropriate response.  \n\- The assessment should be translatable against a external benchmark. Any action can be rationalized in a system without externally verifiable standards given enough motivation and incentive to do so. \n\n2. Murder is logically wrong if, after assessing the situation, it is determined that murder is not an appropriate response.
1	Introverted feeling (Fi)	Does Fi make infps self centred ? If so how do we change something so innate? 
2	Fi can make someone self-centered, but it can also make someone not self centered too. It all depends.\n\nFi-dominant users often know what they like, and so they might not want to do things they don't like. For example, say there is a group of 5 people and 4 of them want to go to a Mexican restaurant and the Fi-dom user doesn't. The Fi-dom user might tell the group, "I don't like Mexican food. Is there somewhere else we can go?" An Fe-dom user might go along with the group. The Fe-dom user might even change their mind on Mexican food, thinking, "Hey everyone else likes Mexican food, I should like Mexican food too." The Fi-dom user is less likely to change their feelings towards what they like or don't like.\n\nSome people might think this is self-centered of the Fi-dom user. Fi-dom users need to realize they need to make concessions and they need to do things they might not want to do. Otherwise, they may lose friends for only doing what they want to do.\n\nAlso it is important to realize that this all depends. An Fi-dom user may decide to eat Mexican food even though they don't like it and an Fe-dom user may decide they don't want Mexican food even though the group wants it. What matters more is where the thoughts stem from. The Fi-dom user's thought might be, "I don't like Mexican food, but maybe I should eat it this one time to make my friends happy." The Fe-dom user's thought might be, "Everyone wants Mexican food and normally I would go along with that, but maybe I should not have Mexican food because I need to do what I want for a change."\n\nI think this can make it hard to type people. You have to look at what is going on underneath it all. Is the person naturally predisposed to do what they want or are they naturally predisposed to do what the group wants? What they do does not matter so much as what their natural instinct to do is.\n\nI hope that makes sense. And please if anyone has any differing opinions please share. I would love to hear what you think.
1	I think Fi makes you reason from the inside. That doesn’t necessarily equate to being selfish, it just means you take your own thoughts and feelings seriously the way I see it. In essence I think, if you can tolerate and fully accept that people differ and your reasoning doesn’t mean truth, it can even make less selfish because it’ll lead to respecting others as they are and the needs they have. And to find a decent balance in understanding yourself and the other, and the different needs you’ll both have. \n\nAs a therapist I find that most people have learnt that to pay attention to your thoughts, feelings and needs is selfish, so in that sense I easily understand why others might find INFP’s rather selfcentred. We do that quite naturally. In my mind that’s a bit odd tho, as for me it seems mostly motivated by understanding these parts of ourselves fully, and embracing them. In my work I’ve found it extremely useful, once people figure out it’s ok to self reflect and listen to themselves, they usually grow more whole and healthy. \n\nIt’s a two edged sword, as everything is. Too much focus on yourself is unhealthy, as is too little. 
13	Rant, I feel like I'm overreacting	So... I should probably preface this by saying, this Is my first time posting here, and I'm kind of anxious about it.\n\nSo... my problem is... something of which most would say, "you just haven't met the right people yet!" But... I'm 20 by now, and... everybody I ever met, with the exception of my girlfriend, used me and then left me.\n\nI needed to find a place for working experience, I went to about 20 places, and got rejected by all of them. Meanwhile, my girlfriend got accepted by the first once she applied to, it was even a very difficult place to get into. Eventually I got accepted by someone who felt sorry for me, but... people seem to dislike me without knowing me. \n\nMy girlfriend has noticed it too. It's ridiculous, I know I'm not pretty, I'm not smart, I'm not strong, and I'm most certainly not a social butterfly. But I even noticed it in my parents, they're really quick to anger, and lash out with nasty words. I'm... just not what they'd want me to be. \n\nAnd I know I shouldn't care, but on some level I do. I do care, I pretend to myself not to care, and most of the time it works.\n\nBut today... I got in a fight with my mother, she called me lazy, she said she always had to say everything I had to do. The thing is though, I walk on eggshells every day. Careful not to upset either of them by forgetting anything. I'm a good girl, I despise drinking, I dislike parties and as such... never go to any, I'm content with a book and music.\n\nI don't know why people seem to automatically dislike me, maybe it's my tendency to be negative, maybe it's my looks, maybe it's my social awkwardness, maybe it's the fact that my only big interests are anime, games, and anything that has to do with fantasy. I dislike sports, I don't want a part time job because that means interacting with people, and I feel nauseous even thinking about it. \n\nI feel like a nobody, like I have no worth. My girlfriend is... everything I'm not. She's no extrovert, but she's always better, always ahead of me. A higher level of education, more hobbies than one can count, a tendency to be capable of doing anything she puts her mind to. She's beautiful, kind, smart, talented, and meanwhile I'm everything but. I'm terrible because I wish to be like her, so positive, so happy, so strong, so, so dazzling. I guess you could say that I'm jealous of her, and I hate this. I shouldn't be jealous, she has her own troubles. And... I get this, but... I sometimes just can't help it...\n\nI know comparing Is the road to the evilest ways but... I try hard not to. Sometimes though... I just find myself cursing my luck, to be born so unattractive, to be such a scaredy cat, to be so disinterested in everything about real life, to live in my own world.\n\nTdlr; I feel like I'm worthless and can't help but wonder why everybody always seems to hate me without knowing me. 
4	I tend to agree.  As an infp when I was younger a lot of people didn’t like me, they said so 😁.  People can be rude and cruel.  You do you.   I tend to think infp and nfs in general are underrepresented in the population and as such are often misunderstood.   That’s kind of on them.  Trust me as you get older NO ONE cares.    I would try to work on school if you can, it’s usually worth the effort.  Perhaps look up some study skills and such.  Those things can help a lot.  Also prayer and quiet time.  If I don’t get some of both I can, over time, begin to get overwhelmed.    Try not to get jealous.  Be happy for others who are doing well.  Your time will come too.  Forgive those who hurt you (being bitter only hurts you in the long haul).. Try to find something your grateful for every day.    Keep being nice and charitable and you will find others who are also nice and charitable...   volunteering can be great ways to build good self esteem, and meet awesome people too!   In regards to looks..... meh.  Seriously I would go out with a woman who is cool and nice over someone who is good looking any day.  Good looks MAY get you a first date but good character gets you a great life.    Anyone who puts looks first probably honestly isn’t in a place themself to be worth dating anyway.   \nI also completely agree with the above poster, try not to be so hard on yourself!  Praying for you. Hope that helps a little!
2	I relate a whole lot to how you're feeling, except that my mom is constantly pushing me but won't let me talk badly about myself (even a little bit) or do it herself which I'm really grateful for. I also don't have an amazing SO to compare myself to, which sounds pretty hard :|\n\nIf you'd like a suggestion, even though I know you mostly need to vent, accomplish something small for yourself! I consider myself an artist but I rarely create anything and it's embarrassing to feel like I'm not really passionate about anything. So, I went to the store by myself and bought some art supplies. I still haven't used any of it, but it was a little victory because I hate leaving the house so much. Accomplishing something small might help your self-esteem :)\n\nI've been looking for seasonal work recently and it hasn't been going well. I love animals and would much rather work with them than people, so I'm getting experience volunteering at an animal shelter so I can do something that feels worthwhile and could help me find a career in the future, even if it won't make me any money right now.\n\nI hope this helps. I love you friend!
7	INFP Crowd Surf	This might be a bit of a long post so I’ll put a TLDR at the end.\nFor the past year or so I’ve been trying to try new things, say yes to things I would normally say no to. Yesterday I was really put to the test, my brother invited me to a metal/hard rock concert. Neither of us like that kind of music but he thought it would be fun so he invited me and I decided to go. \nI was actually pretty nervous going into it because I don’t like parties or large crowds or being touched, also your traditional metal/hard rock concert goers are a little scary looking sometimes haha. Anyway to the point of the post.\nIt was amazing, I moshed crazy hard just for the hell of it and got covered in beer and sweat. at one point I was even lifted into a crowd surf and passed around. On top of that everyone there was super nice, I got knocked down once and they stopped to help me back up then we all kept moshing again. Everyone was just there to have a good time and hit each other really hard and as much as I didn’t think I would enjoy it I really did.\nShoutout to all the cool people at concerts who like hitting each other and being friendly and helping each other up. A special shoutout to the guy who kept me from hitting my head on the floor when I got dropped out of the crowd surf. \n\nTLDR: I try to do new things that I normally wouldn’t, my brother invited me to a metal/hard rock concert and it was actually really awesome and everyone was super friendly. Go out and try something new friends :) \n\nAlso the band’s name was “DAUGHTERS” 
3	Bro hooold Tf on you went to a metal concert for the first time and got CRIWD SURFED??damn this story got hella fire 🔥 in the middle.Bro that’s dope as hell
2	I love metal/rock concerts for the same reasons, everyone is super nice and the experience is amazing !!
7	Have any fellow infp’s read Madeline Millers book “Circe”? Thoughts?	I just finished it and..wow. Don’t think I’ve ever felt this way about a book before. Curious what  fellow infps think of it. \nAlso, would be great to hear of any other books that really resonated with some of you. \n\nOne of my favorite quotes from the book:\n“a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. Such a constellation was he to me.”\n
8	Any INFPs in the Birmingham (UK) area? We should do a meetup!	Any INFs around the Brum area? Would be really cool to make a meetup. 
1	Oh yeah, finally someone !! Send me a PM:)
1	Send me a message too. I'm also from Birmingham! I'd be down to meet up somewhere.
6	What's your ONE belief/value that's non-negotiable?	We're all INFPs here-- what's the one thing that you knowingly get much too anal about, to the annoyance/detriment of the people in your life? I know you all have one.\n\nFor me, I can't stand drugs in any shape or form, nor can I stand being anywhere near them. I'm against the criminalization of marijuana, but I still can NOT stand presence or acknowledgment of it. This has put a real wedge today between me and the people I was friends with in high school.  
10	That once someone cheats I can almost never trust them at the same level again. Be it my own significant other, a friend / relative's S.O., or a friend / relative themself. You can argue human nature, mammalian nature, psychology, or the history of polygamy, I won't budge.\n\nLuckily I have never been cheated on (as far as I know). However, my brother's marriage fell apart when his wife cheated. Seeing the effect it had on him solidified this belief. If there are problems, talk about them. If you feel like you can't, discuss the fact that you feel like you can't. If you are afraid of violence by bringing up problems, talk to family and friends or a therapist (and if it's a legitimate fear get the fuck out immediately). But seeking comfort in someone else's bed before you've taken care of your current relationship is always the wrong course of action.
9	For me its something along the lines of if I call you a friend I expect you to do the same for me. And I would do anything to help my friends so i guess its just really treating people the same as i would want to be treated.
9	My one thing is animals. If you exclusively view and treat animals like things/objects/possessions instead of the feeling and sentient beings that they are, then I will have a hard time respecting you. Having said that, I was vegan at once and failed. So I am not a militant PETA worshipper or anything like that. I just believe that animals have a soul and deserve our love and respect.
8	Nobody should be forced to do anything (and coercion is force)
5	I hate pointless arguments or senseless violence (towards animals, children or other innocents especially), and I also can't stand people with huge egos or those who brag constantly. I had a crush on a guy on my team on & off for a few years, but when he changed into more of an egotistical / braggy person due to his good performance, I stopped liking and even talking to him. We had been close friends, but I just couldn't be around it
9	I actually have the exact opposite thing that I'm steady in my ways about. I think drugs of all forms should be legal. Who's to decide what we can and can't put in our OWN bodies. Do you feel the same way about alcohol? I highly doubt it though it's possible, and props to you if you do. I don't do drugs because it's my choice, but making things illegal that aren't going to drastically harm people isn't the way to go about personal choices. It helps addicts 0% if they feel like they can't speak up because they're going to be shamed about partaking in "illegal" activities. As far as the weed thing goes, the use of marijuana does not define a person, so choosing to not associate with another person due to their personal choice doesn't seem like a very nice thing to do. Unless they're peer pressuring you into smoking with them, I really don't notice the issue. Friends go out to a bar together, why can't they smoke? Again I don't do drugs but it's because I myself decided this, not our society that's told us not to because it will turn our brains into scrambled eggs.
3	my infp friend has a thing about never hurting anybody (whether intentionally or not, necessary or not)\n\nalthough there is a bit of irony is that its not really far sighted, which is why id probably get along better with an infj\n\n&#x200B;\n\nas for me, drugs (yes, because doing them might be fun but is actually dumbass when not needed)\n\nnot being completely true (either by direct lie or omission of facts)\n\nand dodging the topic in conversations (even emotions, as they stray from the truth)
3	I hate watching people be mean for no reason. It makes me so angry to see people who are just mean to be mean. I think this is best summarized by John Coffey in The Green Mile when he says “.... Mostly I’m tired of people being ugly to each other...”  
3	I'm one of the religious INFP's I guess. Specifically I'm a Catholic. Been through some nasty spiritual stuff in my life but this saved me right here. Definitely my non-negotiable.
5	Yeah as someone that works in health care I have a problem with your belief, sorry. Drugs like medicine can save people. I understand hating recreational drugs. But you said drugs of any form.\n\nMy thing is don’t tell me what to fucking do. I’m not your fucking slave I control myself. And you piss me off if you try to tell me what to do and how to do it. I’ll do it if makes sense to me, but at least give me time to determine that for myself. But you can’t push me around like a puppet. This ties into your belief, you can’t tell me I can’t use drugs just because you said no or it’s bad. I will do it just out of spite. It’s my life, I get to do what I want. Otherwise I get to tell you things in your life that I hate that you shouldn’t do. We all have our own vices, just because it ruined someone’s life doesn’t mean it will do the same for another. It’s not the drugs that is the problem it’s the person that is choosing to abuse them that is the problem.
1	Wrong and right are perspectives
1	Kids. Absolutely non-negotiable.\n\nI can't stand the idea of parents (or any other care provider) doing irreversible things to their kids (aside from medically necessary treatments). From one-year olds getting ears pierced to genetically editing a kid to be more obedient, I am extremely not chill. I would easily give up a friendship over this issue.
1	The notion of bodily debt - that one owes society or an organization/field some fee for having an animal body that’s easily subject to injuries and distress. I believe societies which will not institute universal healthcare systems are guilty of an act that is evil - though I do believe the acceptance and advocation of bodily debt is generally driven by ignorance and self loathing. \n\nAlso, marijuana legalization. It’s a medicine for too many and for me, it’s saved my life and sanity on numerous occasions. So, I take it personally and am not able to have very many “civil” conversations regarding this. It being legal for medicinal use isn’t enough as that is still too restrictive for many to gain access. I feel similarly about psychedelics, but I can understand why people might be more cautious about their availability. They can be paradigm shifting in a way that some simply cannot handle, but imprisonment for putting something into one’s body is an egregious policy. 
160	Why is urban dictionary so accurate? 👌	
27	I have a friend who is the most introvert, socially awkward person I know but at the same time has colourful rainbow hair and makes outrageous comments. The time I'm thinking of is, we got a taxi and sat in awkward taxi silence till our destination. Once I'd just handed the money over she shouted in a deep voice "blowjob ten dollars" and got out the car. Leaving me speechless.\n\nAfter reading this post I feel like she may be an INFP?
14	I love you INFPs for that kind of shit.\n\nSincerely,\nyour crazy ENFP bubblegum bitch
12	OMG that persons name is meeee INFPs even like the same cereallllllll
7	I feel so understood 😂
6	“They absolutely fucking loathe meeting new people” can confirm, majority of the time. 
7	This trait only fucks me over when I have to meet new people amongst my close friend group. It just makes me appear to be some stuck up ass who won’t reach out to the newbie while I act silly with my close friends. 
3	It's just too accurate. Lyrics all day, errrrryday.
2	Lmao, me
2	I have no doubt this was written by an INFP about INFPs. They know too much.  Plus it's just nuts.  Crazy. :D
2	Maybe that’s why I like The Stranger by Billy Joel. It’s all about putting on appearances, but not showing what you’re really like. I tend to do that around most people including friends.
2	Cringe
1	<< oh..I thought a good portion of people did this because were comfortable and cant afford to give a damn. Neat I learned something today.
1	Yep, I'm a socially awkward ass, but I did develop a "mode" for speaking to strangers.
1	I feel like this sub... understands me. Haha.
1	omg that's so me I'm such an individualistic infp because i am just like these other infps, wow...
1	Why the fuck did I upvote this?
10	Betamanlet is ashamed to admit that he finds songs, books and videos more immersing when he pretends that they were created by him.	I haven't resonated with anything as much as the works I have created by myself. It's mediocre, but it's mine. The works of others often are boring in comparison: I know nothing of the artist, his thoughts, his life, his sentiments. There is nothing to connect with, other than the piece itself. If I pretend the piece I'm experiencing is made by me, suddenly it becomes alive. I discover nuances that I had previously ignored. I see meaning where previously none existed. I grow attached to the piece. But if I don't do this, I couldn't care less about the piece.
4	I know what you mean, especially the part about discovering previously ignored nuances always surprises me. 
971	😉	
85	Stop that hurts.
47	I think it’s the other way around. Logic will tell me A, but Emotion will be like, “well u-um... I think B sounds nice...” Logic will proceed to glare at Emotion, but Emotion will win anyway. 
14	This is literally the exact scenario when I have a stressful day and im contemplating whether or not to go “impulse buy” a tub of ice cream to eat in one sitting.\n\nI have been practicing a lot though in using logic to override the emotion driven impulses. I wish it wasn’t such hard work 😂
25	Although i am trying to go with logic nowadays.  How you guys doing? 
11	Why is this so freaking true 🤔
16	This is why I don't trust myself when I'm in distress .\_.
7	This was my dilemma last night when deciding wether or not to order pizza. $50 or food that would be extremely satisfying for someone that's sick. I decided against ordering the pizza.
3	HAHAHAHA look at the face of emotion in the last drawing lol
2	There aren’t too many things here I agree with - but this is dead on! 😂😭
2	emotions serve my logic\n\nunless logic cant solve the problem, in which logic serves emotion
2	Emotion rules my life and that is why I’m a poet and not a dull accountant who noone will remember.
1	When i need to make a decision in life there is no logic 🙄 I wonder how I can fight with my emotions and use some logic 🤔
1	Love it
1	The best lol!
1	Why you gotta call me out like this?
1	If you drew this, I recommend you to start an Instagram account to post these comics. It will gain a lot of popularity. It will also help people figure out their minds. You *know* these ideas will come more often. That’s just how our brains are wired. 
1	I feel called out
30	Things I've learned in the last year	Hope this helps some fellow INFPs avoid the PAINFUL mistakes I've made. Not exhaustive and just a start but here goes:\n\n\nHALT (stop if Hungry Angry Lonely Tired) exists for a reason. Follow it. \n\nKeep my mouth shut and my ears open until I have something worthwhile to say \n\nMake sure I know myself \n\nKnow my intention \n\nBe direct and concise \n\nKnow my audience \n\nPut myself in their shoes \n\nUse as few words as possible to say what I mean \n\nDamn well mean what I say \n\nActions are important \n\nMake decisions \n\nDon't let time slip by \n\nBe proactive \n\nProcrastination leads to missed opportunities \n\nIf I'm given a second chance. Take it \n\nRegret is a bitch \n\nLearn from mistakes \n\nDon't repeat the most devastating mistakes twice \n\nIf everyone close to me leaves me, something is wrong with me. Figure it out and fix it. \n\nDo what I say I will do \n\nI'm not alone. But I will be if I don't change \n\nFigure out what is broken and fix it. Fix it. Fix it. Fix it. \n\nLearn to love myself. If I don't then would I truly be in a place to be in a loving relationship with another human? No. So learn to love myself. \n\nBe vulnerable. With the right people. \n\nApologize and say I'm sorry from my heart and sincerely.  \n\nTake criticism and see how I can grow. \n\nFigure out how to truly love other people. \n\nWatch what I eat and exercise regularly. \n\nGet out into nature often.  \n\nBe vulnerable. Yes, I need to hear that again. \n\nAsk other people for help. \n\nHelp other people. \n\nLove people in the way they need to be loved, not what I think is best. \n\nLearn how to be a good friend. \n\nListen. Listen. Hear. Hear. Clarify. Listen. Did I mention listen? \n\nDon't assume. \n\nClear up misunderstandings SOON. \n\nI'm wrong often. That's okay. Just admit it and figure out what's correct. \n\nBe vulnerable. See a theme? Even superman was vulnerable. \n\nEvery moment is a new opportunity to be a better and healthier human. \n\nIf I'm scared, say I'm scared. If I'm fearful then admit it. Just don't let fear define me. Yes, stuffing fear can define me. So don't do it. Face my fears. \n\nLastly, to say again, love myself. Have compassion for myself. Be vulnerable. Grow. Learn. \n
4	I want to have this printed under my eyelids lol. \n\nYou helped me get through some down feelings/ communication problems today, thank you! So many of these points I needed to hear. 
7	books for INFPs?	hey y’all, i’ve been a reader all my life, but i’ve never really considered books that are “compatible” with my personality.\n\ndo you guys have any suggestions? any genre is fine (including nonfiction), i’m just looking for something that an INFP is guaranteed to love!
7	The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is my favourite book of all time. When I was younger I also enjoyed the Gone series by Michael Grant. 
7	1984 by George Orwell. Orwell himself was an INFP
5	Cloud Atlas was a good one. I also recommend Jungs works.
4	“The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck”- by Mark Manson. Seriously though, It’s a good one.
3	"The Riddle-Master of Hed" and the rest of this trilogy by Patricia McKillip is the most INFP fantasy I've ever read.  It's by turns intellectual and mysterious and startling and passionate and terrible and unnerving and subtle and terrifying and then it's on to book 2. I will never forgive or stop thanking my sister for introducing me to this series.\n\nFor modern fantasy, The People novels by Zenna Henderson collect her short stories within a compelling frame story:\n\n>...humanoid beings from a faraway planet who are forced to emigrate to Earth when their home world is destroyed by a natural disaster. Scattered mostly throughout the American Southwest [mostly Arizona and New Mexico] during their landing before 1900, they are set apart by their desire to preserve their home culture, including their religious and spiritual beliefs. Their unusual abilities include telepathy, telekinesis, prophecy, and healing, which they call the "Signs and Persuasions". The People suppress their unusual abilities as they attempt to integrate into human life. The stories describe groups of The People, as well as lonely isolated individuals, most often as they attempt to find communities and remain distinct in a world that does not understand them. - Wikipedia\n\nIt's a kind of INFP version of the gregarious Callahan's Crosstime Saloon series by Spider Robinson.
3	Into the Wild
2	The poet and the lunatics by Gilbert K. Chesterton. Joy in every single page.
2	We are Okay by Nina LaCour. Short bio from goodreads "*You go through life thinking there’s so much you need…Until you leave with only your phone, your wallet, and a picture of your mother."*
1	Looking for Alaska by John Green
1	House of the Mosque is one of the most beautiful books I’ve ever read. It’s got this amazing fairytale vibe about it while it describes the time period in Iran before and during Khomeini. I’ve reread it several times throughout the years and it both touches me with its amazing portraits of the characters and the author’s use of language.
1	Extraordinary Adventures by Daniel Wallace.
1	- Madeline Dare series by Cornelia Read  \n- How to Talk to a Widower by Jonathan Tropper  \n- Beach Music by Pat Conroy  \n- Love Will Tear Us Apart by Sarah Rainone  \n- So Much for That by Lionel Shriver  \n- Spin by Catherine McKenzie  \n- Stupid and Contagious by Caprice Crane  \n- What If by Rebecca Donovan
1	The outsider, Colin Wilson
1	I have 3 fantasy trilogies to recommend :D\n\n**Graceling - Fire - Bitterblue**\n\nBy **Kristen Cashore**. All are narrated by different (and beautifully distinct) women. A lot of light examination on how we hurt ourselves/each other with our emotions and self imposed limits. A lot of internal debate on autonomy and personal responsibility. (and really fun romance <3) This series is vibrant, easily digested but surprisingly deep. Honestly thinking of it, I'm convinced Kristen Cashore *is* an INFP.\n\nPersonal favourite - Fire\n\n**Finniken of the Rock - Froi of the Exiles - Quintana of Charyn**\n\nBy **Melina Marchetta** (I found this because it was the favourite series of the author above) This is a celebration of deep and beautiful sadness. (there are joys as well) The stories cut to the soul, are a little drier than the others on the list and are emotionally challenging/cathartic.\n\nPersonal favourite - Quintana\n\n**Grave Mercy - Dark Triumph - Mortal Heart**\n\nBy **Robin Lafevers**. I have the least to say on this one, only that they are again all three from the perspective of different and amusingly distinct women in the same overall story. The romance and main characters feel real, the setting and conflict may be guilty of being forgettable.\n\nPersonal favourite - Dark Triumph\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll three trilogies are well realized fantasy worlds, I think all 3 are considered YA (though Marchetta's really shouldn't be) Cashore's series is a deeply personal examination of one character in a bright, elaborate world - while Marchetta's series speaks more to the universal and emotive truths that connect all people in a muted and ash-covered world. Lafevers hits a tonal middle ground and is great for anyone who liked the others, but nothing about it screams INFP at me.\n\nIf anyone is looking for more/similar fantasy recommendations I'd be happy to dive into my old Goodreads reviews for a few more :)
1	I’ve always loved Jane Eyre, The Little Prince, & The Great Gatsby. These are the pretty basic “dreamer” books haha\n\nAlso Sylvia Plath is very good but I can’t read too much of her at a time because I can get way too sad
7	I don’t know how to love myself...	
2	...
2	You could start by thinking about how you love others...how you show love to others. Like your friends and family. What do you do to show them love? After you figure that out try to do the same things for yourself; \n\nAre you talking about self care or rather something like self esteem? 
2	I sometimes forget to love myself too, especially when I’m lonely. I find that talking to new people (in a one-on-one situation, online or irl), helps remind me what I like about myself. Getting to share some of my better stories and having new and exciting conversations with people makes me happy. And when you really click with somebody, and you’re just overcome with all these stories you want to tell, building off each other’s similar experiences.... it’s nice to connect to others. 
1	if you cant love yourself, love someone else and (if they are a genuine person) will love you back. this will probably help
6	My intuition life points are on 100?	Hey guys, happy Sunday ❤️\n\nLately I have been experiencing a ton of synchronicities and my dreams have been very very vivid, I can't stress how vivid they have become.\n\nA couple weeks back I started dating this girl. I had a dream and in said dream the girl I was seeing said, "I'm not the one for you" and I woke up like what the hell. \nSure enough in waking life she made a whole 180 and the thing we had fell apart.\n\nIs my intuition on a level as to where my dreams can warn me of not so good characters in my waking life ? Anything like this happened to you?
4	Yes I have this happen to me. A sort of plain Jane example I can remember is when I dreamt the boy behind me in school would borrow a blue pencil, and we would walk to the office together to go drop something off and sure enough the next day it happened exactly as I saw it. I've got loads of examples but yes, I experience déjà vu quite frequently with my "fortune teller" dreams. 
3	i used to dream a lot about things that would happen the next day, especially when I was younger. i just searched a bit, they’re called precognitive dreams
2	I have dreams and they're about certain people that I wake up and end thinking about them a lot the next day, like they're really important to me or something. Like i had dreams about girls and was sure that I was in love with them and then I had some lunch or something and it went away.
98	This is way too relatable	
16	yep, one moment I'm in tears then the next moment my smile stretches from ear-to-ear
13	I'm really easily influenced by music 
2	I usually like listening to my music in order. That means I always know which song is next. 
1	haha :D 
60	A message to the small amount of us who dislike the INFP personality and its weaknesses	I admit I do on occasion as well. Sometimes I wish I could settle for being a mid level engineer or accountant or that I could glide through life without considering the meaning and identity of my every action without regretting anything.\n\nBut then I wouldnt want to be a reknowned author capable of inspiring or benefiting thousands or even millions, a philosophical blogger or youtuber, a psychologist or psychiatrist who is helping people to heal themselves from the great struggles within their mind. Yes, that is where my interests lie and where I can be a champion not just for myself, but for the world, a world so much in need of more compassion, feeling, and understanding. \n\nUnderstand that your idealism is a pair of wings, not an anchor to a miserable life. It is certainly harder for us to fly than to drown, but the day that we do fly we will truly be living a life we could have never imagined. Even if your hopeless idealism has been beaten by the world and been chided by those who just want you to survive and make a living, dont let go of it.\n\nI think Tyrion Lannister said it best. Never forget who you are, INFPs. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you. 
14	I really needed this today. Thanks k you so much
10	Beautifully written. Thank you.
4	Currently trying to find my place in the world.\n\nI try to remember things like this when I think I've been given an unfair hand in life.\n\nI think I'm just not trying hard enough.
4	I can relate to this. I'm trying to break into a career field that I know won't fulfill all of my artistic yearnings. I'm 25, and most of my friends have either shunned careers, working retail; or they only care about money and settling down.\n\nI feel like society is waiting for me to "choose" a side to be on. It's tempting to give up and build some overcompensatory, art-driven persona out of abject poverty. Why don't I just work retail, scrap by, and be punk rock?\n\nI don't know. I don't fall into any one particular subculture, and I can't take my other goals and interests for granted.\n\nBut I hate hate *hate* the idea that this means I'll be lumped in with the cold, money-driven, career types. It's not that I want to be a champion of the working class so much as I just don't want to be misunderstood and misinterpreted as one of them. I'm hoping eventually I can find a balance between an enjoyable job and enjoyable artistic pursuits, but it's so hard to do both at the same time. Who knew being an adult could be so difficult...
2	Well said. Thanks for taking the time to write this.
2	Thank you, OP. This is timely!
1	So do you actually do any of those things?
1	I love this! Thanks. Very timely. Even if you aren’t doing any of those things, you posted an inspiration for many folks  who needed to read it!
1	I am a web developer for a financial company at the moment and tbh, it feels so unfulfilling at times. I kinda like it a lot of the time when its busy, since I can build web pages which feels at least a bit satisfying, and I can chill out with music at the same time. But it's often pretty quiet and I want to be anywhere else. The work I do doesn't exactly contribute much to society.
1	Thank you. Unbelievable how much I can relate to your words.
71	any other infps feeling the same lately?	
8	Every time I use a metaphor with my friends I get a blank stare and "uhhh...sure". 
3	Weird but sometimes I'm ruining the dream myself by trying to apply logic to vivid thoughts
3	One time I described life as a series of motifs and repetitions, only the outward "shape" we perceive them as to be changing, and of interest - akin to the contours of a Greek vase.\n\nOne friend was super into it. The rest were just like "oh."
2	Sometimes my metaphors and similes are not understood because the aspects which I am using relate to how I feel about those things though, which is subjective. When probed and if I try harder, I could explain. Yeah, I could do with more practice unwrapping my interpretation. I don't know what I'm saying.
1	oh god this... so much this... 
1	I hate when someone uses metaphors on me.
9	Lets talk about John Brown. Fi-Ni hero of the Civil War.	
6	John Brown was definitely an INFP.  You could see in his writings how he thought Fi-Ne.\n\nIf you don't know who he is, Read up on him. He basically [Martyr'd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown_(abolitionist)) himself to end slavery in the civil war.\n\nDuring the final days of his execution, he just sat around reading the bible, Didn't even want to speak to the priest for being pro-slavery, Didn't want to speak to anyone till the time of his execution. He wrote in his journals detailing his final thoughts. The first one.\n\n\["I am gaining in health slowly, and am quite cheerful in view of my approaching end, — being fully persuaded that I am worth inconceivably more to hang than any other purpose" - In his diary days prior to being hanged. Fi-Ni is all about thinking with feelings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not painting INFP's unrealistic during that time, of course most probably fell under the diseases of culture of the time to fit in, or maybe not. I'm not even arguing he was nessecary sane. Although he grew up as an Abolitionist, He didn't need to fight his parents for his beliefs, His father fought also.\n\n\["I bring you one of the best and bravest persons on this continent — General Tubman as we call her." - John Brown on Harriet Tubman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next two quotes. Obvious of his insane thinking and him being an xNFx user. Although filling in the blanks above. He does link back to being an INFP.\n\n\["I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land can never be purged away but with blood." - His final speech\]\n\n\[ “**When I strike**, the bees will begin to swarm, and I want you to help hive them.” Hey weird metaphors!\n\nWith all his quotes and actions. I can conclude that he has to be an INFP, Hell even his downfall could be explained by Si Trickster/Fi Demon. (Cognitive weaknesses). I have an ENFP brother and best friend. I would look up what an Si Trickster/Ti Demon is. So while he could be depicted an Extroverted. I highly doubt so, But his father could of been. He charged in with 22 men when he planned for 200 when he raided Harper's Ferry. If thats not a Fi-Ne loop move. I don't know what is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*But you know how INFP's are.*
2	So, I literally just created an account so I could comment on this post to say that this person looks exactly like an INFP I know. It's uncanny. (He's 37 and lives in the Upper Midwest, USA.) I've been studying MBTI for more than six years now (even went as far as getting certified as a practitioner) and have found noticeable trends in physical characteristics and mannerisms according to one's type, at least among NFs, which I have the easiest time identifying.  
9	Any gun owners here?	Any other gun owners here? Just curious please don’t shoot me ;)\n\nGetting downvoted. Thought infps were open minded. I live on a farm where we need them as a tool. Does that offend some people?
10	And I swear that I don't have a gun. No, I don't have a gun.
3	Enjoyer of firearms here. I am not sure that any personality type is more or less likely to be a gun enthusiast, but it would be neat to see some stats. In my experience talking with others, it's always been about how you were raised or where you grew up. I grew up in a rural area and was taught firearm safety and respect. 
2	I've got a few. I don't shoot them as much as I would like to but it's an enjoyable experience to me. I enjoy seeing how they function and getting hands on. "Building" is fun and I have a few dream projects I want to put together. \n\nA little backstory, never grew up with guns. My wife comes from a family where gun were a regular part of life (farming, hunting, etc.). Took the plunge after college and got my first rifle. Learned lots about gun safety, hunting, hunters safety, animal restoration efforts and more. Learned about optics, cartridges, reloading, shooting techniques. There's too much to list. Gave me a view into an aspect of life I was ignorant about and I'm glad for it. \n\nGives me something to talk to certain people about. Since I've spent countless hours learning, I can give good input on calibers, pros and cons of certain things and why 10mm is best mm. I shut down unrealistic expectations/knowledge of guns and try to to inform people with strong one sided views to open up more on both sides of an arguement.
4	do nerf guns count
1	I have 2 and they don't require ammo.
-3	[deleted]
10	I want to stop being so needy and clingy	I have always been so needy and clingy to my exes and guys I get attached to, and it's just bottomless. I literally want no space, and I want to be in touch constantly although it sounds unlikely for INFPs...\n\nI have friends and parents who I can talk with and support me, but I just can't stop acting that way, and of course it has not been good for my relationships...I have no time for hobby for now because I have been preparing for a big and important exam. How can I stop being this way and become more independent?
6	Develop interests that you can commit to when you are alone. 
5	Probably just takes time. I'm a dude and am mostly the same even though I suppress those feelings, because I know I won't get a positive response. On the one hand it's balance, on the other it's eating me from the inside. You need to find yourself a clingy person, just like I do :D
4	I think, regardless of MBTI, if there are attachment issues/insecurity, then there's likely things in your life that need resolving.  Likely from childhood.  I hope that doesn't come off cold, and hopefully it would be comforting to know that it's probably not really about them specifically, nor is it a "fault" on your part.  Researching things like people pleasing, attachment styles, the inner critic and emotional flashbacks, those all really helped me get insight.  Richard Grannon is a good person to look up on youtube, he's got lots of great videos. 
4	Lol, or I’ve had some good co-dependent friendships with people or the same issue. It feels more healthy because they can understand you, they want to spend lots of time with you, you don’t obsess over them because you’re not in love with them, and the things you do together become a distraction of any person you may be obsessing over. I found myself in these friendships, never sought them out per se but 🤷🏽‍♀️😂
3	Perhaps, get an affectionate pet like a dog. Then you could direct all that attention to a loving animal.
3	I have the same problem. And I do think it’s mostly just related to where I’m at in life, rather than my personality type. And yes, even some issues from my childhood that as much as I think don’t affect me, they clearly still do. \n\nI have a boyfriend and often I do feel like absolutely HORRIBLE for wanting so much from him. More time, more affection, more attention, more texts.... And it just takes conversations and growth. I have issues with ruminating and so I’m trying to find things that clear my mind. And he’s trying to empathize with me. We’re trying to find a healthy balance together. \n\nHowever, if these are ex-boyfriends or crushes... And I have been there too... Just find a way to cut it out. It’s unhealthy to obsess over unrequited love. I have dealt with the games and I know sometimes you have this hope, but honestly it’s hopeless. Focus on your studies. If you don’t have time for time consuming hobbies, find something to replace those thoughts of loneliness, obsessiveness, clinginess, neediness, whatever! Listen to podcasts or audiobooks, meditate, clear your mind! 
2	Have been facing this problem lately. I enforced “time for me only (phone notifications off)” and “time dedicated to him”. It could be hard at first, but rediscovering the peace in solitude is priceless. 💛
2	i feel that. I've been pushed away by friends before for being too clingy, and i don't know how to stop. 
8	Any other INFPs have experience dating other INFPs?	Things kinda run their course with my last partner who I was with for 6 months, with her I never really felt comfortable to be myself, and in a way felt like I couldn't have the kinda random discussions about what I am passionate about with her. On the other side of it though I felt like I had a much clearer idea of what sort of person would be right for me. I figured maybe another INFP or similar type would be a better fit, so I was wondering if anyone else has had any success with this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I started being a bit more open and honest about myself, and somewhat selective with the people I message now. I messaged someone on a dating site who had an amazing bio which was just really funny, interesting and quirky, she was an INFP as well so I figured I'd open up a bit more than usual in the first message. Which turned into a bit of a random ramble, some of it about my what I mentioned above. Around a week later she liked me and replied with her own random ramble haha, I sorta messaged her in the first place because her bio painted such full picture of her, which is better than most peoples "hey I like pizza and naps", and then her message seemed to affirm this. Anyway I replied that day with another long message (I can waffle on for a while and like to reply to all things she brought up), then a few days go by and she replies to that with another longer message, which I get a really good vibe from, she was indulging my own quirkiness and sorta opening up a lot more herself. Anyway I replied to that and just had radio silence since. At the time I sorta replied to her long message with lots of little ones, and only the first couple showed as read so I am not really sure what to make of it. She hasn't unmatched me, or blocked me, so I am not really sure what to make of it 🤷‍♂️\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI partly think I am probably getting invested in someone way too early, but at the same time I feel like I have gotten more from her bio and our few exchanged messages, that I had in my last relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBlah this shit is difficult.
6	I am INFP (F-31) and my boyfriend is also an INFP (M-33). We met on a dating app and he had on his bio he was an INFP and he brought up me taking the Myers Briggs test to see what personality I have so I did and my results were INFP-T. We went on our first date 6 months ago and as corny as this sounds it was love at first sight for both of us and we hadn’t even spoken at that point lol. I can’t sit here and say that I wasn’t a little nervous when we got to our table cause I was but within the first few sentences my fears went away. We had so much in common, we were both divorced from narcissists and had a very similar upbringing (he’s literally the mirror image of me). In our minds we have the perfect relationship but being with another INFP can be work. I don’t mean that in a bad way at all but as INFPs we’re kind of codependent so when it comes to taking initiative and it can be a little hard. Me and boyfriend are aware of our INFP traits so we talk about it and come together for a solution. I think the best thing about dating another INFP is you have the same goals and outlook on life and it’s nice to finally have someone who understands you. I think having healthy communication is a big key to a relationship and being so comfortable to talk with someone is awesome, I never had that in my marriage. We never argue, but if we disagree we hear each other out on what we are both feeling and why. Also though just because we are both INFP we bring a lot of different things to the table as well. My boyfriend is more of an entrepreneur mindset as where I’m a creator, he has an idea and wants to act on it and I like to have all my ducks in a row to prevent failure, but having someone who’s core is the same as yours but offers different things to the relationship is very valuable. \n\nBut when all is said and done I don’t think personality tests matter in who is better suited for you. If I could go back and tell my younger self prior to getting married what to look for in a partner that would be to find someone who has the same core value as you, someone who will uplift you at all times, someone who understands its Us Against the World...your teammate. Finding your partner is no rush! Your soulmate will find you and it will be at the time it is suppose to happen. Good luck 👍🏽
2	I'm an INFP-T and my last bf was an INFP-T, and we are still quite close (I would say that I regret that our friendship turned romantic, but I think it was inevitable.)\n\nThe biggest issue I find was that he is more strongly INFP than I am, so he brings out the TJ in me. I have to reach out to him, I have to make decisions, and I have to offer constant emotional support, even though I need someone to do that for me.\n\nThis isn't to say that it can't work; INFPs often feel misunderstood and there's something magic about a person that GETS you, 100%. I think that male INFPs especially tend to favor INFP/INFP pairings because they're so used to feeling different or even feeling like an imposter and like the people who like them don't really know them. The key is to find someone with the same goals and expectations (and the willingness to achieve them) that you have.\n\nAs an INFP girl, I have very limited energy for most people. I'd say that my INFP ex is the only person I have unlimited energy for, even when he gets on my nerves. If this INFP you're talking to isn't responding, it doesn't automatically mean that she is disinterested, but she's probably not INTERESTED, if you get what I mean. If possible, meet IRL and see if you click!
2	Idk I think infp and infp would feed off each other in a negative way, I’m with an esfj who keeps me grounded and positive and he’s very sweet. But I don’t think you can judge a whole potential relationship on mbti personality types, there’s positives and negatives to any combination but it’s down to how the people make it work. 
1	Just to update this thread, but she ended up replying to me :) thanks for the comments so far.
3	My entj doesn’t know how to validate my feelings. Should I feel upset?	I’ve had a roller coaster of ups and downs these past 8 months. It involves major life trajectory change, two very expensive surgical procedures, financial instability because of such, and now we learned our landlord is taking back the house we live in and we need to find a new place to live.  \n\nWhile I was at work the 3 other roommates (his college best friends) went out to look at houses- without mentioning anything to me.  I returned only for one of them to passively mention it to me.  I asked questions and asked them to let me know next time.   I was hurt at first but controlled my emotions and sought out explanation and clarity.  I then asked if we could all process this together. They said- “ hank texted bill and since we’re all home tonight together for the first time in awhile we can all talk.”  We confirmed what time my entj would be home.   \n\nMy partner (entj) was out of town on a business trip.  I texted him to ask him if he knew about his friends looking together (without us) for a new rental.   He said no, but he had admitted to texting one of them.  \n\nI spoke with my partner, and we sat in the community room. I waiting around, no house meeting was ajurned, so I went to bed to get snoozy.   An hour later I went to pee and noticed they were all in one room discussing their thoughts on this whole situation. \n\nMy entj came back into my room and I told him ( in a calm rational way- as I’ve been practicing) how it felt to be left out of this.  I felt hurt.  He became upset and yelled at me and said I was living in a distorted reality.   \n\nHow would y’all feel?  Am I fucking nuts?   I don’t know how much longer I can handle all of this.      Anyone else in an entj relationship?  Do they validate your feelings or understand the importance?  
4	Dated an ENTJ and he was the most giant asshole ever. No empathy, everything had to be his way, some major gaslighting because I was "crazy and emotional" whenever I stood my ground. \n\nI casually dated a few more and each time they were too bossy for me, and we always clashed when I stood my ground. \n\nYou do you boo, but I dont think you're crazy.\n\nSome people just dont understand empathy .\n\nTypes aside *because I truly believe that any type can work with any type*, it's necessary that you are being heard and validated in your relationships. If you are not, and if your partner refuses to try, that's sad. :( \n\nCommunication is key, so I wish you the best and that he does listen and shows how much he cares for you. ❤❤
3	I had ENTJ's. They are amongst the lowest empathy types. Bosses too, try to run everything. You don't say anything about your past, are there abuses in your past? Are you doing repetition?
2	I've been dating a Female ENTJ for the past year or so (If you have questions about our relationship, don't hesitate to msg me)  and I'll definitely say this, an ENTJ has issues with validating their own feelings, let alone yours. Patience is a near mandatory requirement on both ends of the relationship because the prioritizations on how you think are nearly flipped upside down. What you consider most important is likely what he considers the least important and vice versa.\n\nThat being said, how you should feel about it is ultimately up to you, but I can tell you that being upset is probably the least effective way to get him to cooperate with you (he will likely consider that "proof" that he is "right", whether it's actually true or not.)
2	Not all ENTJs are developed and even if they aren't, to an INFP they can all sound bossy and harsh, but they aren't always really. If you can be confident about yourself and believe in what you're saying and can keep to the logic side of it, then the ENTJ will listen. It's not that your feelings aren't valid, it's not about your feelings at all really, it's about finding a solution to a problem (looking for new apartment the way I see it) and emotions can be dealt with later, unless they form a logical part of your problem (do they?). For me communication with ENTJ works, because he listens to what I say, values my input and I won't bring my emotions to the problem-solving discussion, but rather keep them for another discussion (when you do/say...it makes me feel...). It's really difficult to figure out from your comment who's in the wrong, but it sounds like your ENTJ is just very frustrated with the situation he found himself in and in that mode he feels threatened and will try to regain control of his life as a reaponse, which he does by shutting out his emotions until the danger has passed (my ENTJ calls it cleaning the wound, which is painful, but useful as opposed to putting plaster on it which won't solve the problem but would make you feel better short-term (as I imagine is how you feel)).
43	I’m great with one-on-one conversation, but awful in groups.	Do any of you guys have that problem? Any tips to help? 
12	After many years of terrible group interactions, I've come to the conclusion that, especially with newer groups, it's better to relax and just react to the conversation until I have something to contribute with authenticity, than trying to artificially force it.\n\nYes, people sometimes comment that I'm quiet or whatever, and I'll just say that that's who I am and I tend to talk more as time goes on. That may take a long time, depending on the group and topic, and that's ok too. If they are people worth spending time with, they'll respect that's who you are and value what you do say.\n\nI've also come to value that 1-on-1 conversation is often where our "empathic superpowers" can fully engage, so it shouldn't be overlooked. And in my opinion it's a far better use of time than shallow group conversations.
10	im the opposite, @ least if im comfortable with the group... one on one i have to put more effort and push the conversation forward in group people push it forward 
4	Same. I am completely lost when I'm in a group of people. With one person it's easy - I can ask questions, find out what he/she likes. With a group I'm confused, I feel awkward and I'm getting tired very fast. I cannot comprehend of their needs, so I'm sitting silent. I am not taking initiative, so I feel like I'm invisible or I'm just distracting others.\n\nI have no other tip, than taking a break/ leaving the group after some time. Even if there's one person in a group I can relate to, I'm still confused, because I don't feel secure enough to talk about whatever I want around "others".
2	I'm still better one-on-one but what usually helps for me is getting to know group members individually so I get a better grasp on who they are and how to deal with the group dynamics. Obviously this only works for friend groups which do not change much and not so much for groups that get formed out of sheer coincidence. \n\n&#x200B;
2	I think if you get one-on-one conversation with at least one person in the group, it helps throw you into conversation. Sometimes it puts me at ease and I feel free to engage with the others. Sometimes I feel secure if this person is similar to the group that I can figure what type of conversation I can bring to the group. And other times its a straight up crutch and if I talk to them, others can join into our conversation themselves. I dunno. Find an ally. Or just don’t force it, as someone else mentioned. Don’t be ashamed that you don’t feel like you have anything to contribute. If you do, just speak up! If they don’t like you, who cares!
1	Me too but as ive aged,  i have improved alot .  Given the choice though one on one is preferred because it seems to lead to a more genuine and meaningful discussion.  It will come in time.
1	Wow i'm bad with both
1	I am with you. I feel like most of the group conversations are like they’re plotting something against someone or a group bitching or gossip session. No wonder we have Fe as a nemesis function.
1	I’m the same! Don’t even get me started on group texts. 
1	yes\n\njust trust your gut and things will probably work out\n\nif it doesnt, remember you can always leave until it fixes itself
2	Use the compassion we have for others on ourselves	Yesterday I woke up with a cold and had to cancel a museum trip with friends and my workout at the gym. Almost immediately after I notified them I felt that familiar sense of guilt/melancholy/loneliness. Worse still I had to call my trainer to cancel and he told me to "Have fun playing video games!" which only reinforced the negative feelings I have for myself. I wallowed in my self-loathing (i.e. having a "early" lunch even though I wasn't hungry) for awhile before the medicine took over and I went back to bed, starting my day again at 2 pm. Blergh.\n\nEventually, I forced myself to go for a walk and had another imaginary conversation with myself. Having gone through depression before and still reading some amazing self-help books, I knew I had to stop this downhill train of thought. I tried to take on the perspective of my trainer, who probably meant well and even remembered that I liked video games, which I had told him in our first meeting over a week ago. I knew I was going to see again today for a different gathering, but I also decided to call up one of my other friends and chatted briefly with him on the phone. I went back to this pastry shop near where I used to work at and got lunch. I started yesterday feeling like shit, and ended it feeling pretty good.\n\nThat's my story, I guess. I think we are so often dreaming of our ideal world we forget that we are in control of creating it too.
1	Give your love language to yourself:)
9	Are these problems common for INFP's people? Please give me some insights on how to solve or live with it.	Hi guys,\n\nI'm struggling with myself for a long time with some of my characteristics which make me really stressful and frustrating lately. I actually took some MBTI test long before but just have stumbled upon this subreddit today. Since I don't have any experience with INFP's traits, I hope someone can give more insight into my problems, are those common for INFPs? How can I solve or live with it?\n\n**1. Uninterested with anything that doesn't have anything related to of affected to my life.**\n\nWhen having conversations with my friends, I recognize that people care too much about what doesn't related to them. Like I don't like to read the news because I don't see the purpose of it. When I'm in a conversation with anyone, if the topic is unrelated to any of us (about some things happen around or 3rd person), I just feel uninterested and it's actually like 80~85% of all the conversations. So I just find a lot of people boring, have nothing to say and stay silent in a lot of cases.\n\nThis in return makes me a "boring" one, which never says anything in the conversation. It's not like I dislike or like, disagree or agree. I just don't care about those things. \n\n**2. Don't keep contact regularly with people**\n\nI enjoy time being alone a lot and feel kinda lazy when it comes to keeping contact with the others. When people ask me to go out, my instant answer is likely denying (even I may go eventually). So gradually, people less likely to ask me again. I don't feel like It has anything to do with my emotions toward them, I even feel comfortable spending time with them. It just I have a weird habit when it comes to keeping relationships.\n\nLately, these 2 problems are bringing a lot of negative impacts on my personal life. I feel like I can't socialize normal anymore. I'm lack of confident when talking with others and a lot of negative thoughts arouses in my mind.\n\nAs long as I want to go to the therapist, my country is not that developed about psychology. So I hope someone has been through similar periods can share your experience on how to deal with or live with these problems.\n\nThanks a lot.\n\n**TLDR:** I have some problems (1 & 2) that have negative impacts on my life. Hope someone can shed some light and share your experience.\n
5	1. I'm usually very quiet too when I'm in group settings. I'll just listen to what other people talk about and observe them or zone out completely. Only when I'm asked something or a topic sparks my interest *or* I have knowledge on it, I speak up. \n\nI guess part of the solution for me has been to just accept that this is the way I am. Because our Fi (introverted feeling = authencity) is so strong it's sometimes hard to find motivation in just pleasing other people. For me at least the motivation has to come from within, otherwise it feels a bit meaningless and phony. But I've still attempted to learn some basic things about some basic things just to be able to keep up in conversations.\n\nAnyway, there are tons of different people all around you. Surely there are some that you could not shut up around because they compliment you so well and you both like similar things. For us, they just might be harder to find. :/\n\n2. I also have a problem staying in touch with friends and family. I'm very, very introverted and don't mind staying isolated from others for long periods of time. I kind of suck at text messages (I think about my wordings too much and then stress about having been writing a four word sentence for five minutes) and have a growing dislike for phone calls. I only have one friend who still sticks around and that's partly because she's as much of a loner as I am. I like going out but more often would rather stay in the comfort of my home. If you don't want to go, why force yourself? If you really wanted to spend time with those people, you would. \n\nStill, you feel like something must be wrong with you because you just don't fit in and that makes you second guess yourself. The fault must be in **you** because no one else seems to be struggling the same way... *But it is not your fault.* It's nobody's fault.\n\nI don't know if you compare yourself to other people a lot, but I know I have, still do sometimes, and creating my own standards *for myself* has helped. Instead of trying to "fit in", I just do what comes as a natural response. If I can't find the words, I shrug it off and/or admit I don't know enough of the topic. If I find a conversation boring, I allow myself to find it boring. If I find I've forgotten to stay in touch with someone, I ask myself, "well, do I care enough of this person to keep them around?" and if the answer is no, I let it be. The people who know me and the people who matter to me know this way that I am and accept it. But I do try harder for them.\n\nI guess it's just all about accepting yourself, quirks and struggles and all. If you want to change, that's possible too. I don't think anyone is the same person they were the day before, wehther it's good or bad. When you start accepting yourself you'll feel more like yourself everyday and that's a wonderful feeling. It can be a slow process but in time makes all the difference. \n\nHave you yet read about the cognitive funtions? They really cleared a lot of things up for me, knowing that you are the way you are for a reason and it's okay, even if the world tells you otherwise. I would recommend looking it up. Sorry if I went on for too long. I hope this answered at least some of your questions. 
3	Im 17 and have both of these problems as well, \nFirst of all try meditating, realize that being quiet is not wrong, find hobbies and similar people to enjoy those hobbies with, try introducing interesting topics to a group of people talking about useless things, youll be rejected some times but the times people accept your ideas will feel rewarding and people will love you for broadening their perspectives.
19	INFP and Passive Aggression	Dealing with my own passive aggressive nature as an infp. I really dislike this kind of defence mechanism  I have. Just wondering if anyone else tends to take the passive aggressive route when feeling negative emotions towards others?\n\nIf anyone has techniques they use to minimise their own mood swings and passive aggression id love to hear.
14	All the time. It usually comes out as sarcasm.
9	I wonder whether this is because as infps, we’re sensitive to social cues, so we expect other people to pick up on our passive aggression and understand 
8	Have you looked into Mindfulness?  When you can bring to attention how you are feeling, you can more easily catch the passive aggressiveness before you've verbalized it or acted upon it, take a moment to think about where it's coming from and why, and then deal with it in a more constructive manner.  I find that Mindfulness takes a lot of practice and I'll still often not catch my feelings till later on when I get some emotional distance and think about it, but that delay is getting smaller as I exercise it.\n\nEdit: forgot to say, I hate being passive aggressive because that's my mum's way of handling situations when her emotions get out of her control (doesnt happen very often, shes usually very rational) and I've seen how much it hurts my dad, so I do my very best not to have the same reaction.
6	I hate it. If I'm being honest I'm pretty damn passive aggressive and it makes me feel like a child and I cringe when I think about it.\n\nJust gotta work to constantly improve communication.
3	I do this way too often..passive aggressiveness is just my default reaction to anything negative. I'm trying to work on taking a step back and evaluating why I feel the need to be passive aggressive after the feeling has passed (usually a few hrs later or the next day). I can usually deduce that I was wanting someone to realize I was feeling frustrated with them, but my fear of confrontation keeps me from being straightforward, resulting in passive aggressiveness. The best way, in my experience, to not react this way is to make a conscious effort to identify what you want and how to best communicate that. Hope this helps :) 
2	I get very passive aggresive, as you stated, mostly as a defense mechanism. Typically when someone says something I percieve as "targetting" me or something that I'm hurt by.\n\n This can obviously be a problem, as most of the time I think we percieve that others are trying to hurt us MUCH more that they are in reality. Because this is almost a defensive reflex of sorts, simply trying to calmly tell yourself that they didn't mean their words the way you percieved might not help. \n\nMy advise would be, if the person is someone you're close to / feel completely comfortable with, tell them what's going on. Apologize for the passive aggressiveness you displayed, and then explain WHY. Do so in a way that doesn't come across as making excuses or blaming them, but rather let them know you did it out of defense and not in trying to attack them. \n\nIf you're not close to the person, I honestly don't know. Still trying to figure that one out myself 😂 Even if you are close, it can be incredibly difficult to be that vulnerable. So with someone you don't fully trust, it can be near impossible. 
3	Why job do you have and/or want?	I'm a community support worker,  in school to become a counsellor/therapist...\n\nJust wondering how many of us went the helping route, or the creative route,(as these are the common listed ones for our type) or if there were other avenues of success...\n\n:) 
10	I wanna be a super famous rockstar, do lots of drugs and then kill myself at the height of my fame
6	im still undecided... im not interested in anything & everything sounds mundane & pointless /:
4	I would like to be some sort of teacher. But not like an actual classroom teacher because I think that would be way too tressful dealing with 25-30 kids.\n\nMy ideal job is to run an after school program that teaches kids personal finance, how to cook, grow fruits/vegetables, give homework help, teach meditation. Stuff like that.
5	I'm a high school student who can't bear the thought of working
4	I'ma piano teacher. Best job ever. :) 
4	I think I'd like to work at or start a Cat Cafe. I never really thought about a career because I just wanted to be a stay at home mom, but I need another person to make that happen! It seems like worthwhile work and I can imagine enjoying my life
2	Going to school in the fall with the intention of becoming a school counselor 
2	I'm in highschool, and I wouldnt mind being a musician but I'm a horrible singer but I like math which ik is odd for infps but so ima be an accountant get enough money just to have an ok life and do what I want after 5 and on the weekends
2	I'm currently a psychology major. I don't really find any field extremely interesting, but I like the idea of helping people. Probably become a clinical psychologist or counselor/open my own practice. Teaching sounds cool though too so not too sure. 
2	I hope to be a writer and teacher after I get out of grad school. It's creative. It helps others learn. What's not to love? I'm teaching part time now, and I have to say the main downsides are I'm too mentally exhausted from being in front of a group of people, and I need to work on not being so conflict adverse (the wonders of introversion). \n\nWhat got you interested in being a counselor?
2	I went the helping route. Became a social worker. But after doing it for a while I realized that I couldn't "cut it". I think more of a function of me being a highly sensitive person, but I was bad at keeping boundaries (to protect myself, always professional with clients) so I was really affected by secondary trauma. It triggered my PTSD and I started having symptoms that I had never had before (awful night terrors and sweats, panic attacks, hypervigilance, etc). \n\nSo I quit and worked in an office for a while. That sucked the soul out of me so much that I ended up in an inpatient psych ward.\n\nNow I work with animals (dogs) and I'm the happiest I have ever been in my work. Who knew cleaning up poop and puke would be so rewarding?
2	I did the stay at home mom thing, now my kids are growing up and I have to figure out what is next. I think I'd like to work in a library or museum and continue working on my painting/art on the side.  I don't see myself in a full time career or anything.
8	INFP Looking for lasting love	Hello! Im a F 23 INFP and I’ve never been in a relationship. Part of the reason has been that for the last 5 years of my life I’ve been moving every 3 to 5 months (school, family and religious reasons) so yeah, makes it hard to get into a relationship. Now that I’m more settled, I really want a relationship but have had no success. There are guys that I like, but I doubt they would like me, and guys that like me, but I’m not interested in them. When I find out a guy likes me it freaks me out and I avoid them at all costs. I have tried dating apps, but I don’t like it because I feel like they want to jump in a relationship when I want to start off as friends and get to know them. I think my problem is that I’m too idealistic, but people tell me being picky is good, and not to lower my standards. Any advice? How have you found a good strong relationship? Can you share your gender and age as well? Thank you! 
7	29M, the only real relationship i've been in was with a girl I started out friends with. I wasn't interested at first but the more we hung out the more I liked her. To me that's how i'd like my next relationship to go as well. Because i'm not too good with conventional dating, going up to a girl, flirt, ask her out, start dating, etc. I'm just too weird and awkward for that. I'd like us to get to know each other slowly. And if there is something there we'd take it to the next level. Ultimately dating should lead to marriage or someone you want to spend the rest of your life with. And you want to be with someone who is like your best friend. At least that's how I want my SO to be. You shouldn't really seek out someone to be your boyfriend/girlfriend. Find someone you are compatible with that you actually enjoy being around. That's why it's okay to be picky. You don't want to lower your standards just to be with someone. Sorry if that wasn't good advice, just my two cents.
3	I am an INFP and a cancer. I am a 29 male. I feel your pain very much. The best thing you can do is stay true to your idealist values and be patient. \n\nI don't know how emotional you are, but ideals and emotions can make a person crazy. \n\nGoodluck in college. Becareful for bad people. 
2	20 infp m. No advice here just the same way for me. I just started focusing on my own life and success and if a gf comes along later oh well
2	20M infp. I have the exact same problem as you when it comes to evading girls who like me, it just makes me feel uncomfortable around them, especially when I give a person a chance and she gets too clingy. I have found that it is all about experience. Dating can be fun and a great way to gain experience. I believe we must overcome our urge to run away as soon as intimacy shows because what happens next can be truly wonderful. \n\nThe thing is that expecting every single love to be long lasting is too much of a fairy tale. Relationships have ups and downs. Take fighting or arguing for example, it's never about not doing it, but knowing how to do it and ending it. Again, things like this come with experience, so don't be afraid to put yourself out there. Awkward moments pass so expect them, trust me when I say you'll stop paying too much attention to them. \n\nAnd one last little tip, when trying to bond with someone, don't try to connect on every single level at once (I found out that's what made me feel anxious and uncomfortable), instead find one common passion and see how it goes from there. I wish you the best of luck!
1	14M but i have an infp friend whos 18F\n\nwhat kind of guys like you?\n\njust from my personal experience (as an intp) i got many esfj girls that liked me (but i took no interest in them), so i just casually dismissed them\n\nmy infp friend actually had most of the people she liked liking her back (mainly of the enfp personality type)\n\nso what youre getting and what youre looking for would definitely be useful\n\nand dont lower your standards, find the jewel in the shit that is the extroverted sensing world
1	I don’t know their personality type. Normally more introverted and needy? I also get a few extroverted but I really like guys who are more outgoing (doesn’t matter if they are intro or extervoteld). I guess their personality type does not really matter, I just want to find someone I can admire, is fun and I can share a deep connection and bond with him. 
1	(I'm a 22F INFP)\n\nOh man I feel ya!\n\nI've been in two relationships, one was with an INTP in high school (nightmare) and an INFP who started out as a FWB (stagnant), so I don't think I'm in a position to give advice but I can definitely relate. And I'm gonna give advice anyway!\n\nMy advice is to first figure out what you're looking for. Most people do that through casual dating, but doing some research online helps too. I like to read up on the relationship dynamics of MBTI types and also enneagram types to see the pros and cons of different pairings. Even though I've never met one in real life (as far as I know), I think I'd be most compatible with an ENFJ-A who is an enneagram type 3.\n\nOnce you know what good things you want and problem areas you think you could work through, it's time to track a fellow down! Try to find out where that kind of person is likely to be or what shared interest you might have. I love animals, and ENFJs are frequently known to do volunteer work, so if I volunteered at an animal shelter I'd have a greater chance of running into an ENFJ than if I stayed at home! \n\nI agree that you shouldn't lower your standards but do be self reflective about them. Relationships are work, so no person will be the perfect partner, but they need to be someone you WANT to work with and who wants to do the same for you!
46	I made this picture while I was flying above Iran. It’s a huge salt lake. It reminds me of a beautiful painting 🎨	
3	Awesome!
2	INFP, originally from Iran. I hope one day I can go back to my country.\n\nThanks for sharing!
81	Any INFPs here feel like they’re just not built for studying?	It’s just not me, I can’t bring myself to sit at a desk, open a book, make notes, do past papers etc, I despise it, I feel like this is a severe handicap in today’s world, it’s like I’d be reading a book on Criminal Law and I would hate every moment of forcing myself to read at a desk and make notes, whereas I would enjoy participating in a class discussion, taking part in a debate and especially participating in a mock trial sort of thing.\n\nI’m more practical that way, and I feel like me not wanting to actually study because I find the task so incredibly mundane clamps my wings for my future.\n\nAnyone else feel the same?\n\nEdit: In reflection, please comment how to battle this, us NFs need to stick together.
26	Big mood right please help lol
19	Maybe it has to do with what you are studying. Do you feel the same way about subjects you find fascinating?
12	I struggle with this too. Here’s what works for me. First, I keep my phone out of reach. Then, I *actively* participate in what I’m studying. Some people can just use a highlighter on their books, but I found that’s not enough to keep my attention. I have to go full-on mechanical learning. Typing out notes, making graphs, diagrams, whatever will organize and personalize the info in my mind.\n\nSome people also use the pomodoro technique, which I think is something like 50 minutes studying, 10 minutes break, then repeat. I haven’t quite mastered that, but I hear it works\n\nHope this helps!
11	I love learning and studying things, but never for school. School sucks the fun out of even topics I genuinely like
9	I'm not sure I'd say I'm not "built for studying", but here's a trick that worked for me (and I only wish I had discovered it sooner). \n\nWhen I was in grad school, study groups were encouraged in one of my core classes. I discovered that as an INFP, I was pretty good at bringing people together, and because the study groups helped everybody to thrive, it wasn't long before many people wanted to be part of my study groups.\n\nIn most study groups, we would divvy up the reading and write short summaries of the subject matter. We also divided up the class schedule and took turns taking notes. Before too long, I had discovered that some people are built for reading and summarizing, others are really good note takers (which I'm terrible at). My particular strength (that I've seen in a lot of INFPs) was an ability to understand concepts and explain them well (often better than the instructors). \n\nSo after the first year, I became known as the "study group coordinator" (which was challenging, I'm still an introvert, but totally worth sending a few emails and making a few calls). Besides organizing the group, I'd often moderate our study sessions, but as far as 'studying', most of it was done for me. After the 1st year, I only read books I was interested, never took notes, but still had everything given to me. Even better, even though I completely relied on my friends' *good* study habits, when I graduated, there were more than a dozen people who credited me with getting them through grad school. \n\nSo if you can do study groups without violating rules, I highly recommend it as a great way to get all your studying done in a way that leverages your strengths as an INFP. \n\n
5	I felt like that until the reality set in that I'd have to shovel shit and burgers for life if I didn't go back to school
5	Have you ever been tested for ADHD? I thought for a long time that being an INFP was the reason, but I think many INFP suffer from adult ADHD, I certainly do. 
4	Yeah sometimes I feel like this is the ADHD personality type
3	I like finding an animated YouTube video to make it come more to life, or at least see the big picture. With the visual I can then dive back into whatever dry materials and imagine it’s more interestinf
2	Exactly. That’s why I’m going into music. 😛
2	I feel that so hard. Especially when it’s nice outside. I’ll study for like 10 minutes before I just want to die, then I’ll usually stand up and announce that I hate studying/doing homework and go longboard 
2	I'm easily distracted and my mind wanders too much for me to sit there and read any book.
2	Yes..I never learned much in school with the ways they taught. I learn much better through experience and love working with my hands.
2	I struggled with this SO MUCH in college. It finally just came down to: do I want my degree or not? If I want it, I have to do the work whether it makes me want to crawl in my skin or not.\n\nThe best thing for me was to get out of my house and have a specific environment that was the "place to study". Home has too many distractions and opportunities to procrastinate. So I would schedule time to go to the local library. I would set myself up there and spend maybe 2 hours or so a day studying. \n\nWhen it got tough I just had to mind over matter and remind myself of my goal. I also think it was "easier" for me because I was a college dropout, and when I went back it felt like it was my "last chance" to get things right. I was more mature and SO ready to get my stinking degree at that point. No matter what. I would get angry at the homework. Like: "Who do you think you are to try to stand in my way? I'm getting my degree!" Lol There were lots of tears but it was worth it.\n\nWhen I got my degree my brother told me something that still makes me get choked up. He said: "Congrats sis! You did it! You've worked hard to earned something amazing all on your own. It is a part of you now and it will always be a part of you. No one can ever take that away from you."\n\nGood luck!
1	I love to study, but my infp husband does not.
1	Yeah I do also.\nThat is one of the main reasons I found university so hard.
1	I spent my college years doing everything but my work and leaving it for the last minute. There is just something about deadlines that rubs me the wrong way, but I managed to finish somehow in spite of the stress, but I don't recommend it, maybe focusing on what your end goal is can get you to be more productive as well as bringing more reason into it all. 
1	I have no problem reading a textbook for a class I like(probably not what a lot of people would consider studying), but literally anything more than that (taking notes, making flash cards, etc.) I have trouble doing without procrastinating. 
1	I have always been good at studying. But I think, noting what you say about class discussion and wanting to debate, you might like to try getting a study partner from your class. Some peolle work better with others, I do. It helps me think outloud and discuss with the other person.\n\nAlso, I don't like reading silently much anymore. I like to resd out loud when I am studying alone, like thinks such as biology and psychology, and it makes it easier for me to understand and get my thoughts outloud.\n\nTry to find the best method of studying for you. 
1	I always feel like I have to try twice as hard to study but when it clicks I’m a god. 
1	And i feel like that is the only thing i am good at. After graduating it's bwen a hell to find a nice job and i am seriously thinking about trying a master's
1	Hey I totally feel you on this. I record my textbooks and listen to them whilst walking in a park or round a forest. Something about the auditory route and kinaesthetic learning helps it go in effortlessly. 
1	Are you a 1L? It gets more interesting after your first year when you can choose electives. Also, I had mediocre grades at best in law school as I too could not chain myself to a desk. Yet I became pretty successful in my field. I feel like some of our characteristics like reading people well, being good mediators and possessing common sense are real assets in the law field.
1	I love studying, but only when something that interests me and excites me. So I hate studying for school but I have a broad base of knowledge in various subjects outside of hard academic areas.
1	If you’re still in school, try looking into learning a trade.. make good money while getting to build things 
1	Absolutely. After about an hour of sitting down with my textbook and notes, I realize that I was was daydreaming about my next sewing project the whole time... if I can combat the procrastination enough to actually even start.  I have no interest in academic subjects at all. The only class I ever had an interest in was a Christianity and culture class, and the professor was a really humorous and authentic guy, he never even gave us a test or quiz and focused more on reflective based learning and discussions. 
1	Yes totally. I’m fine paying attention in class but can’t seem to sit still when I’m on my own. I have a friend who will spend an entire day studying and I’m like how 🙄 I can maybe manage 20 minutes of looking over my notes
1	I'm just writing my dissertation now and I loathe it. I enjoyed all the active part of my outdoor ed course but this dissertation is kicking my butt. I had to take 2 weeks off work to get it finished and I'm literally waking up, writing, going to bed, repeat. But I know if I dont get this finished I have no future. I just want to be outside. Argh! I'll be glad when its over. Today I'm gonna go sit in my friends house and do it just for a change of scenery. I know I'll probably get distracted but I'm  going insane at home...
1	When I was at the first year in the college I was feeling very bad about learning "useless crap". Luckily, in the next year I joined to student research group, so I had plenty of practical work to do. I'm very happy that I did that, because I can at least write something on my CV, lol.
1	I've never been able to study like a normal person. I've underachieved my whole life and my stress levels have to be extremely high for me to study lol. I consider myself quite bright, but I've had to compensate in other areas to make it this far in life. I can write a 6 page paper in one night, but that's because that's the only time I feel like doing it. That being said, there are times where I'll find myself researching the most random topic for hours, I just can never do this for my school. I'm an infp and I have convergence insufficiency (an eye problem), and both seem to be contributing factors to having an ADHD brain. So yeah, Im being treated for inattentive type ADHD and it seems to be helping.
1	Studying sucks, I don't even try.
1	I'm unique in that I learn best from listening. It helps me a lot less than the average person to sit down and just study no matter what the subject. Even subjects that I love I very rarely study for and have studied only a handful of times in my life. I do fine in school, It's just not how I learn. If you're like me in that you learn best this way, listen to lectures intently, no distractions. I do read my text books just because I feel like I need to at least do something other than just go to class. You can take quizzes online that lead you towards your best learning style. ie: [http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml](http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml)
1	YES
1	If you're hyper sensitive, maybe you are more likely to be in tune with your higher self. If you are even remotely in tune with your higher self, this reality is going to feel very unnatural (it is, by design). These feelings will manifest, potentially, as disgust with the world because this world essentially requires that we go against our higher self in order to establish security.
1	Yeah, it's freaking horrible. One thing I'm realizing later than it would have been helpful though  is that it's not about what you like or not,  it's about discipline. All of us INFPS suck at discipline (Te) and that's why we suffer so much. We just need study because we have no other option. I know that probably sounds dreadfully boring to another INFP like me but there's no other solution. It's the bitter medicine we need to take. We must discipline ourself to push through the material whether we like it or not. I'm still trying (here I am procrastinating 😂) 
1	No really. In school and uni I did the bare minimum of study, I procrastinated and left everything last minute (literally writing essays the night/morning before they were due). I only ever did ‘homework’ the night before. But as long as I had good music on, and a peaceful space, I’d actually enjoy it and could do it for hours. I can imagine that law is very dry, which would be hard. I studied history and philosophy, which can also be dry but I avoided cold facts and loved delving into theories/ideas and making connections between things. \n\nYou just need to make it a positive experience. Have your favourite hot beverage and put some music on. I like study because it’s an excuse just to nestle yourself away and be alone with your thoughts lol. \n\nI would find it very hard to focus my mind though. Something about study makes me feel panicky, so I’d end up googling/watching  random things to feel better. But that’s okay, just don’t do it too much! Don’t be too hard on yourself, you sound like you’re good at the actually scary stuff like debate etc. 
1	am i an infp?	💰here is one of my playlists💰\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwripFCiEgkw4ySklOBd_aSefdhstr4_C
6	I don’t think music preference has anything to do with personality type 
2	please listen to it and determine if i'm an infp or not 
2	if you can't determine if i'm an infp, then can you let me know if my musical tastes are infp-ish?
1	To me, this doesn’t sound INFPish at all. It’s pretty extroverted music imo. rap and gangster shizzle is not really something for INFP’s imo.
3	Did/do you cheat on exams/test at school?	I've always been the lazy one to study at home and instead somehow figure a clever way to get above average grades. 
5	Never. I usually just studied frantically the night before and got nice grades because of my good short-term memory. But all that knowledge poured out of my brain as I wrote it down on the paper so I wish I'd been wiser back then to be more knowledgeable now. 
2	Yeah, now that I do cyberschool. It's like, who cares?
2	I did like most of my classmates. This year I haven't done it any time because I enjoy the subjects I've got so I don't really have much trouble studying for them. \n\nIf what you want is advice pm and I'll try to help!
1	No way, I would've been too afraid to get caught. I got alright grades without too much effort anyway so it would've felt a bit stupid to cheat just to get an A instead of a B or something. The best thing about getting an A is being able to feel proud of yourself imo but I might just be a lame nerd lol.
1	I got caught in the 6th grade and cried so much lol
1	My INFP Battle Song

4	Life feels like a never-ending uphill climb for me. Never really feeling all that great, just continuing on in the hopes of something good coming out of it. I can't tell if that's what everyone does or if I'm doing something seriously wrong here.
2	I saw Alita: Battle Angel last night. Better than I thought it would be. Hope there'll be a sequel.
1	What about the stereotype that all INFP's need to feel special? 
1	I think we gotta change from procrastinator and dreamer to doer and the one who actually makes change. 
1	I started creating (not writing down yet) my own universe again. This time the focus is on making a story that’s reminscent of Flash Gordon, Star Wars etc. The story itself is about a mercenary who kills a hero and takes his place; eventually running into all of the previous hero’s villains. The most interesting villain that I’ve created is probably Zygothe. Who is basically a space dictator that wants to absorb the universe and recreate it in his image. There’s also three brothers who I wanted to initially make into villains, but made them more sympathetic. Their names are Protheus, Matheus, and Daveus. And their backstory is that they usurped control from the leaders that were in charge of their planet. They eventually took the reigns and in fighting began causing them to split the planet into three separate planets. 
1	what does it mean when an infp suddenly withdraws
651	My perfect day: drawing under the influence of tea, good weather, and music.	
15	Looks great! 
9	You did this?!
8	This is supposed to be a commission for Valentine's Day. Sadly, I'm not as motivated to draw when I'm at home, but it's more reason to get out of bed and go outside more often. Today is the perfect day to get shit done and I'm reveling in my freedom to do this.  \n  \nI'm posting live progress on my Instagram, @pinkpalkia. 
2	Great picture. Definitely have talent. 
2	the skill is overwhelming \*-\*
3	That's so sweet! Looks great, I'm happy when others are able to find inspiration and have a good drawing day, it's so rare when that finally happens y'know? 😊
1	Omg do you post your work on insta?oh just saw your insta!
1	oh my lord, this is precious
1	lovely <3
1	Adorable!
1	That's amazing!!
1	I know this shit always happens to me when I say I hate some shit I turn out to be like them In near future but I fucking hate tea people,please Jesus don’t let me be a tea people
1	The drawing is flawless
1	Feels like home..😊 thanks for sharing!!
1	Ahhhhh that’s so awesome!! Good vibes 
1	I really like your art style!!! Great job on the colouring.\nI've always loved Pokemon since I was little, the whole world just seemed magical. A place where kids were encouraged to be independent, explore, friendship and bonds between you and your Pokemon makes you stronger... \nWhat keeps you interested in the Pokemon world?
1	Wow, great drawing! I'm an ENFJ and that's pretty much a description of my perfect day, too (no, to be honest, there needs to be at least one hour of human interaction after the drawing has been completed ; ) ). Right now trying out the two sets of Promarker skin tones :)
1	Oh wow! That's beautiful :O Have you considered posting to r/pokemon I have a feeling they'd like that.
1	Is this an ice tea? 
1	This is soooo amazing!!!
1	wow, teach me to be this great at drawing what is your secret?
1	This is awesome!! 
1	You draw really well
1	I use the same pen, I love your drawing and I respect your love for bubble tea. Can i say that i like you already? 
1	Oh my god I love this so much. Amazing work do more I love it
117	It's so true, I've started limiting how much I'm using social media, already deleted Facebook and Twitter. Since then, I am really seeing a positive difference in my energy levels and sleeping pattern.	
9	i currently only have snapchat my mental health has improved so much 
9	I agree. There is so much superficial and negative shit on social media. I limit myself to positive sites and things that interest me, podcasts etc.. 
6	I made up a rule to go by for social media: if it doesnt entertain, motivate, inspire or relate to you. You dont need to see it on your feed. 
3	How are people just realizing this though? Two weeks after I made my fb account, in 2012, I felt the energy being sucked out of me. I started judging my worth by how many friends I had on my friends list, craving for validation in likes and comments, comparing the cons of my life to the amazing glamarous pros popular people would throw onto their timelines. Deleted it those 6 years ago and never used anything outside of messaging services.
3	Snapchat and twitter were the first to go for me back in 2016. Finally deleted Instagram and Facebook this past December and now I’m only addicted to YouTube and Reddit!\n\nIt’s crazy realizing how much time they take up when you stop using them. I’m currently in the middle of 4 or 5 different books and have been trying to create a better habit around making music with all my found time and I’m so much happier :o)
3	Does reddit count? 
3	I quit watching YouTube and to fill in the time was reading the Bhagavad Gita a couple of nights ago. I was using YouTube to watch Rachel Maddow and getting depressed as F$@K.\nWhat a difference to do something spiritually uplifting in exchange.\nI haven't used FB and Twitter for months and it's the best thing ever too:)\n
2	True, i quit all social media a few months ago and it feels good
3	*speaks in Donald Trump*\nW R O N G !
1	I quit everything except Reddit and Discord. Both if which I'd argue are a completely different flavor than more personal and persona based endeavors like Twitter or FB. I quit not because of FOMO- I quit because I was fully disturbed and disappointed in the quality of thought my circle has. I found myself at first unfollowing relatives that I felt were anathema to my existence. Then I felt like that was a waste of time might as well delete them. Then I decided that everything involving FB mostly is complete crap. It's all a form of bait that made me sickened. I was always a light user but seeing tons of people I know babble TMI and patting themselves on the back or talking crap or vague booking or being terrible was too much negativity for me. 
2	Getting yelled at, at work	I've always been a irresponsible little child, living a privileged life. I'm forgetful, extremely idealistic, \n\nToday was my reality check. I work as a cashier, my inabilty to read fucking calendars lead me to miss an entire day of work. It's my third day in, I'm barely getting the hang of using the computer. And I fuck up the bags, I mix all these items that aren't supposed to go together, and hold up the entire line. The guy waiting ends up screaming at me. My manager has a talk with me about giving a guy 0 bags when he had like 10. Because I missed work in a 90 day training period, I am at risk of an automatic termination. \n\nI feel like a disabled fucking monkey when I work, I'm slow, incompetent, shit at listening, and have zero social skills, I'm failing school. I'm so ashamed, this entire post feels and sounds like an instagram sob story. \n\nReality is fucking harsh. I'm a fucking child, please tell me how I can cope all of this, it has hit a nerve on me, and I can't stop thinking about it like I have ptsd.
3	You've only been there for 3 days. You're new. Cut yourself some slack.\n\nThere are plenty of cashier jobs. If you lose this one, there will be another that you can apply for.
1	I'm sorry for the posts I make here honestly. Everytime I look back on them, I just think of how much I waste peoples time. 
1	Don’t beat yourself up too bad. Everybody makes mistakes, but it’s important to learn from them. Instead of wasting too much energy being upset spend that energy learning how to do better. I have faith in you!
1	If you're not making mistakes then you're not learning.\n\nChill out a bit. Relax. Its all confusing for now but after awhile you'll get the hang of it and understand the job better. It'l feel less like unknown and more like familiar. \n\nIf they lay ya' off this early or expect too much of you this soon then you probs shouldn't be working there anyways. Plenty of other jobs around that would treat you better. In reality they should have some pro with you to watch over and aid you while you do it after they've done it several times and you just simply watched.
1	Mate,  I'm in the same boat. I was raise very privileged and was a horrible shit of a child as well. I learned things at 18 that I should have learned at 8. I slept in my parents bed and room till I was 14 or so. My dad cut my food for me till I was 12.  I was born 24 weeks premature. Very small baby lol. That's what led to everything. It still handicaps me today. I have issues being too slow, I am a klutz, and I have a really shitty attention span. I know how it is to feel bad when you have friends over, because you are worried they will think you're a rich asshole. You aren't alone, man. I have a pretty good idea of what you're going through. And you are actually better than I am right now.. you actually have a job!!! Lol
4	Question	I’m an ISFP with INTP thrown into the mix. My best friend is an INFP. Just would like to ask you other INFP’s. \n\nIf you have a problem or have something clearly bugging you, would you prefer if we ask you about it or would you rather us do nothing and just wait until you decide to talk to us about it? 
4	Me personally, if you didn't ask, I would probably never tell you until it exploded...\n\nI don't really like releasing negativity or talking about myself in a vulnerable way, but I value the people who pay attention and notice these things. So you should ask!
2	Well for me its tricky. I would like someone to talk to me about it but i also wouldn't actively seek them out. I would bottle it up until the right person comes around and then I would finally talk. 
1	I wouldn't tell you on my own, and I might have a tough shell to crack until I am honest.... however I also need to feel like my problems are not bothering you because somehow I have a feeling that I have to go through everything alone and as soon as I have a feeling I am annoying someone with my problems I might shut them off completely...

64	As an INFP Child	I used to give emotions to inanimate objects. If I picked one thing over another, I thought it made the thing sad, so I would choose the other the next time. \n\nI also thought stuffed animals could talk, but they didn’t around humans so I’d tell them “it’s okay, you can talk around me, I won’t tell anyone.”\nI felt like I could connect more with them than any person.\nI was a weird child. Anyone else?
12	i relate to the first part and i'm definitely ENTP lol\n\noveractive imaginations
8	Yes, yes, yes! Thank you for reminding me!\n\nAs a kid I loved to play in the woods, or in the barn with my best friend. \nWe built different camps or villages for each tribe (Inspired from AoE II, if some of you know what that is) - and there was always this large enemy that we had to defend the other tribes from.\n\nWe defended always the weakest tribe. And when we had given them aid and restored their village, we rushed back to the other tribes. Because there was their turn to get help.\n\nAhh, I would give anything to relive one day of my childhood! Happiness, safety and no worries! 
5	The first one, yes, and I still do that all the time. :D But after the moment is gone I usually kind of forget all about it. I remember an occasion not even long ago when I started crying over a drying pen because I convinced myself it was "dying". So now I have a retirement home for pens because a cemetery seemed too, well, dead. 
3	I recognise both. I still do tbh. I talk to my plants and my favorite tea cups, I cuddle neglected stuffed animals of my daughter’s before returning them to her bedroom, I try to make sure my house doesn’t feel too neglected... I don’t mind it, it gives a sense of loving connection to everything in my life even if I know ‘it’s just in my head’. 
3	I like my soft toys so much I still sleep with them.
3	Did that too. My dad talked aloud a lot when I was little, so as to help me learn/expand my vocabulary. And then I was just lonely a lot of the time so I talked to inanimate objects, often ascribing emotions to them or feeling bad for them.
3	Its a huge motivator for me to feel or understand other peoples emotional past (thats what I call it).  Even if I imagine it in my head, even with inanimate objects, it brings a sense of life to the object and it gives my emotional mind something to connect with or imagine. I don't really have a lot of people I can talk deeply with or who treat me well (at least where I am right now in school), so doing this has been getting me back to my old self bit by bit. I have a few close people, but theyre just far away right now.\n\nI like imagining the object's past, and what it's been through so far. Just like with a persons emotions, when you have context of their past you can begin to imagine how they used to feel, how they feel now or how they could feel. You can imagine what came before, and what could happen. You can even pick up on how they dealt with issues in the past, and see what kind of person they are. If theyre emotionally honest to themselves or not..\n\nIt's far more important than I realized.
3	i am a 17 years old infj and im still doing this lol
2	Having to chose one thing from another was agony, because I assigned feelings to everything. 
2	I genuinely never thought anyone else felt the same way! I’m so glad I found out I was an infp and can finally relate to someone 
2	Me too! I have always had a hard time making decisions. I thought that an item would feel bad if I picked the other one. I remember one time at youth group, the activity was that we were supposed to throw our newly carved jack-o-lanterns off the balcony and I almost started crying. I was the only one who didn’t do it, and I hid my pumpkin under my coat until my mom picked me up so we could take it home. Honestly, I still think that way a little bit. I hate when people destroy things for no reason, and I have always loved dolls and stuffed animals because the characters that I invent in my head become so real to me.
1	Brave Little Toaster fucked me up. I couldn't throw out anything for the longest time. 
1	There's a term for this phenomena but I can't remember it. But yeah, I do this too. I still talk to toys I collect so they don't feel ignored.
1	yes\n\ndoes food want or not want to be eaten? anyone?
20	[Lighthearted post] Does anyone else get angry at car commercials?	Specifically the ones where people who "definitely aren't actors" act overly shocked and surprised about a car because they thought it was a Ford not a Toyota or whatever. Bad acting and you're not convincing. Or when they pick up the kids from school in this new mystery car and the kids are all like, "This has so much cargo space, can we keep it mom??". It's all so blatantly fake and scripted. And for the commercial makers to assume that we, the consumer, wouldn't be able to tell leaves me feeling offended and insulted. I despise inauthenticity!
3	Have you seen the commercial where the lady in the coffee shop would have knocked the kid over if she wasn't a Qashqai driver?\n\n[https://vimeo.com/274420271](https://vimeo.com/274420271)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEOGrkhDp0\n\nI wish I had a tiny Bill Hicks on my shoulder reminding me of how bullshit everything is. I'd feel so much better ha ha!
1	I don't get angry. I dont know why but I have this weird sense of reality that they are not scripted actors. Like my brain just automatically assumes that the people are real people.\n\nI got in an argument with friends when I tried to tell them that people on reality shows are actually like that. They think that they are just acting that way and making up conflict. And I think they really are mean and rude and crazy like that. Then they called me naive and said it was all fake.
1	Argh!!! I despise all advertisements and marketing in general!! Don't tell me how to think! I can smell your manipulation miles away sneaky marketers.\n\nHah. I like to be dramatic sometimes, but this isn't far off from my feelings on the matter. Freedom from advertisements was one of the primary reasons I discontinued cable TV service and switched to Netflix over 10 years ago. I have no time for unsolicited advertising interruptions in my life. 😁
1	I get angry at all marketing of all types.
1	I get annoyed w 90% of commercials and ads tbh
1	lol same\n\ni get annoyed at commercials in general. i want to explicitly be told how this car performs better than all the others for its pricing. stupid suvs, stopping my global cooling
6	What would you do if you had 100K and only 100 days to live?	...
5	I would take my band. buy a bus and go on a 100 day tour. I would stop in all the cites my family members live in and pick them up and take them with me along the way. We would do as many new things as possible film the whole thing and after I die I would want them to release a documentary about the whole thing
4	Give all the money to family and people in need.  I certainly wouldn't need it on day 101, so no sense trying to waste it doing things I should have been doing beforehand.
3	The most infp thing to do: give all the money to people who need it. 
3	I would spend it all on video games food field trips traveling and maybe give the rest to my sisters or take them with me traveling. \n\nHonestly as much as my heart wants to give it to people who need it - I only have 100 days to live and would love experiences that would nourishment and feed my spirit mental and emotional development. \n\nMy heart cares about others but my heart also wants to be happy and fulfilled. So yeah there you go. 
3	Spend 1K a day.
2	The most infp thing to do: give all the money to people who need it. 
2	A jetpack is like $300,000 last I checked so not that lol. I would take my parents on a 100 day vacation around Europe, dying in the Louvre. Also I would save like $1000 for a sick custom tombstone.
2	I'd give some of the money to my family, some to a good cause. Then i'd use the rest to go travel, drugs and hookers. I'd spend about a month or two traveling to different places i've always wanted to go to. Then live like a high roller, banging hookers and getting high. Then when I get all that out of my system i'd go home and spend the remaining few weeks with my family.
1	Visit family and pay things off for them, fund a small trust for my niece, maybe try to see another country.  
1	Be a decent human being, die slowly and bored and give all the money away, what I'm trying to do currently will take way more than 100 more days to accomplish so I'd have to give it up if i knew i only had 100 days.
1	thats literally nothing to work with.\n\nanyway yeah id donate the lot\n\nprobably to antibiotics research, as its way underfunded
1	I'll probably be a little less stingy on myself.
1	Two chicks at the same time.\n\n\nNo, but really, I'd binge the last few books, movies, and games that I've been putting off, do a tiny bit of traveling with my wife, stuff myself on birria burritos, track down someone who hurt me deeply to give him the single biggest suckerpunch of his life, then...Help set my wife up with plans and the leftover money so she can take some time to herself after I'm gone.
1	How much do y'all like reading comic books?	I've always been interested in comics, although I've seen others attach the interest to functional Se. Thoughts? 
2	dont really like them, ive recently got into anime (dont shit on me) and started reading tokyo ghoul manga idk if thay counts... but i prefer real books
1	Not a big fan, prefer regular books. I just prefer imagining it all
1	I read manga because linear storytelling and dont like comics because repetitive storytelling. The art is much more appealing and genuine in manga, i recommend reading Berserk, Pluto or Monster
1	I enjoy the idea of voraciously devouring a stack of comic books but the event has not actually come to pass. I tend to stick to book books. At least if I don't like the art there it's usually only on the cover.
18	There is something magical in life.	I was at a dead end. I had to prepare for a job interview. I also had to work at my current job. I could handle one of these well. Combined, they became an insurmountable task. I was getting stressed out, anxious, and paranoid.\n\nI decided the job interview was more important. I decided to quit my current job. \n\nI have a Tarot card application on my phone. It lets me choose a card every day for insight. That day, the card was the Queen of Cups, a mermaid holding a cup. \n\nThe description was \n\n>A figure in your life that is nurturing, compassionate, and able to instinctively understand the emotions of others. Because of this, they are usually generous and kind-hearted.\n\nI thought, “Bullshit.” There was no one like that in my life. I went to work and asked to talk to the HR manager.\n\nShe was a very caring person. She listened to me and related to my feelings. She said she knows such a situation can be very stressing and it is understandable that I felt like I could do nothing properly. Then she offered to give me a day off to better prepare for my interview. She told me to forget about this job completely until the interview is done, then to come back to this job with a clean mind.\n\nLast night, I had only three hours of sleep because I hung out with my friends. I get a bit cranky when I don’t sleep properly. Today’s card is reversed Six of Swords. \n\n>It is becoming easy for you to become worked up over the smallest reasons. Everything that comes along makes you nervous, sending you into a spiral of negativity. Take a step back and get a clear perspective.\n\nLogical people call this a confirmation bias or superstition. But to me, there is a flow in this world. Sometimes, you can touch it.
6	That's incredible. I used the I Ching in college to declare my freaking major, and it pretty much completely altered my life.\n\nI consider it flow as well. People that are able to think skeptically about divination and serendipity, but not able to look past it, are really missing out on a lot of sweetness in the world.
4	Isn't that awesome!\nI'm glad to see I'm not the only one using divination to soothe my anxiety.\nI consider myself a pretty rational individual from a very rational country. But I've always loved magic, divination and the supernatural. I wouldn't say I believe strongly in any of these things but I like to explore them and if I'm being honest I can be superstitious at times. \n\nI really like runes when it comes to divination.\n\nDo you experience a lot of synchronicities and coincidences?
2	theres a reason that the wise prophet in movies is never wrong\n\nits perspective, and the "logical" people youre thinking of are just the close minded people
1	There is a flow in this world, but you're also just reading vague affirmations of the human condition. Cool if it works for ya, though.
4	Hi fellow INFPs, Made a video on us and LOVE. What do you think?	
12	Realizing I live in reality	I just got back my exam results (equivalent of SATs) and am starting to see what universities I can apply for.\n\nFor once I feel like I cannot live in a dream world anymore where there is an exciting future waiting for me. I have to face the fact that I'm just gonna go to university, get my degree then become a worker like everybody else. Just another nobody. My cousin (another infp) and I were talking, we agreed that we want to live in our imaginary worlds so much that, in comparison, real life becomes meaningless and boring. \n\nTo put it poetically, for once in my life I feel like I'm just side character in my own life story. :(\n\n(sorry for the not so positive post just needed to get it out) 
3	That's just what school is all about. They've succeeded in making you feel like a cog in the machine. Then, corporations and bad bosses keep the tradition alive afterwards.\n\nIt's all an illusion. \n\nAsk yourself this : What changed? Certainly not who you are. Your dreams and convictions are still there. Why would you abandon them all of a sudden? Why do you feel you'll become a nobody? If you think that "what you do" is what "what you are" then sure, everyone is just an accountant, a street sweeper, a lawyer, an engineer, a nobody... But that's not what defines you and you know this.\n\nOr maybe what you plan on studying isn't what you'd like to study. This can also cause a lot of mental dissonance.\n\nIn the end, whatever makes you you is always under your control. And it's unique. You won't be a nobody if you cherish this.
2	yeah... i dont want to die a boring life, i dont want to live a mediocre life just like everyone else. I often think i’ll end up becoming a drug addict because reality isnt enough for me, but i guess im okay with that
2	Honestly I'd rather have a normal enough life hoping for more than reject what I do have. But I very much get where you are coming from
2	Here's the thing... you'll be lucky if that plan goes through, add a partner and that's pretty close to a fantasy from my perspective. It can be seen as average but it really isn't, similar to how snowflakes are different from each other when seen under the magnifying lenses. \n\nI can relate to the idea of making a change and finding your purpose. Perhaps that's only one of the trials that idealists need to face, how to ground ourselves and find peace with what it is. It's not easy and perhaps even soul breaking at times, however I do feel that closing ourselves in the dream world or however else distancing from the reality isn't going to solve anything. \n\nWhat to do? Honestly, just do what you can as much as you're capable of. There are things that you can influence and have control over. 
2	just remember that after every day at work you get to return to your own world
5	INFP Discord for those who just want to vent or have someone to talk to.	
2	Would u mind dming me the link to the server, this one isn't working.
3	Does anyone else feel like they can’t do the things they want to? I don’t know why... but I have trouble going out into the world and doing projects I want to do... like photography, for example.	
1	I feel you! Lack of motivation? Kind of having a hard time finding a valid reason for doing the stuff that you "just *like* to do"? \n\nI don't know if this applies, but I watched this today and it was freaking inspiring (it was posted here on r/INFP): https://youtu.be/iCvmsMzlF7o
1	Yeah I had the motivation and courage to pursue my career further. I've been comfortable with the job I have now. Part of me is a little scared of change, and part of me just doesn't want to make a mistake.
1	Thanks all of you. Really. I do feel like I find it pointless to do my hobbies. I know I’m not like a pro photographer, or pro artist or pro whatever else I wanna do. But I know that I used to enjoy doing these things just to get out and do them. But sometimes it makes me feel lonely or uncomfortable to go out and explore places by myself. But I also never liked to do any artistic tings in front of people, out of fear of judgment even though I knew I was just doing it for\nmy own amusement. I guess I just don’t know :/ I think I was depressed and now I don’t know how to get back out there and do things just for fun. I was content to waste away in bed all hours of the day for months....
5	How can I tell if an INFP guy is interested?	I recently rekindled things with an INFP guy from my past. We’d gone on a few dates years ago and then I ended things with him. \n\nI’d really liked him, but he was so passive and indecisive that I didn’t think he was interested. He left all the date planning up to me, every time, and then I wouldn’t hear from him again for several days after each date. Imagine my surprise when I gently ended things with him and... he burst out crying. Huh?\n\nMore info in a previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/apccjg/i_rejected_him_four_years_ago_help/\n\nI am now about to see him again for the first time in four years, but NOTHING HAS CHANGED. I hardly hear from him. He takes ages to reply to texts. He has “no ideas” for our date and wants me to choose the time and place. Sigh.\n\nIf he were a more assertive type, I’d assume he just wasn’t interested. I almost feel like I’m bothering him by trying to see him (which is exactly how I felt in our past interactions). \n\nDo INFP’s just hate to do any of the proactive work in dating? Do they want the other person to direct everything?
9	This sounds cheesy and may not be the case for your friend. But when I find a girl I like, I say I don’t care what we do because I honestly don’t. I’m just happy to spend time with her. 
8	Yes, unhealthy or immature INFPs are planning SLOTHS. Healthy and mature ones are at least a bit better but still more forgetful/derpy about it at times. Thing is: have you told him how you feel about all this? Sometimes we know we're well aware of our pitfalls but as long as no one brings it up/complains we might think the other side is content. Sometimes we just need others to give us a kickstart in the ass to get moving.
3	To be really honest, I’ve never minded shy guys (I actually really like them) but personally I do feel it should come from both sides. Even if he’s into you, would you be happy if he remained so indecisive and unclear? \n\nI’m shy and reserved myself but I have always been quick to answer texts from guys I liked, I didn’t want to make them feel insecure about my intentions. And even if they were shy, they’d do the same for me. Without that, you’re just letting someone guess and that seems hardly fair when it comes to romance imho :). 
3	What did he say when he cried to you? Did he say he like you?\n\nI don't think this is an INFP thing, this guy just doesn't know what he wants or what he is doing. Personally if I liked a girl i'd try to at least contact her, just enough to seem interested. But I also need the girl to show a little interest in me. It shouldn't just be one person doing the initiating. If she shows no interest then i'd take it as a sign that she doesn't like me. If you are doing all the initiating he either doesn't like you or like you enough to do anything about it. And that is someone you don't want to be with regardless of their personality type.
1	Also, I apologize, but is he the same hot guy you just want to sleep with? Because that would make sense as to why you would be confused by his attitude.
1	> Do INFP’s just hate to do any of the proactive work in dating?\n\nNO!  That has more to do with knowing oneself and being assertive.  If he is immature or just unwilling to better himself, he might just sit around waiting for other people to live his life for him.  Do you really want to waste your time with that?  You saw what he was like four years ago - he is still like that today, which tells you clearly that he is not about to grow out of it.  If he is too indecisive about what to do, he does not know what he wants.  Why pour your energy into someone who can't be buggered to know himself?  People like that also have plenty of good qualities and can be enjoyable and such - but until they decide to start living life, the stagnation you describe will remain.
1	I've been passive my entire life, always going along with what others wanted to do, instead of showing up. One day he'll get sick of it and remember that he's important too and realize that his input matters too.
64	Found this on google image, so I drew it down and gave it to the barista I see every day :>	
9	That is so cute! You’re awesome :)
2	Aaaaaa this is so cute I caaaan't X) 
2	nice one xoxo
2	This is so cute lol
2	That is SO INFP honestly lol
7	Can collecting many experiences improve your life in general?	I've always felt trapped and alone in life, especially during summer vacations as a kid when my parents wouldn't let me do anything socially. Now that I'm 20, I want to try new things out and find more lifelong friends. I'm considering going to a bunch of local events and seeing what happens. I know I could join some random club at school but none of them interest me and I find singular events exciting (even if it does cost money). What do you guys think? Could I potentially find a meaningful, exciting life doing this? Anyone else try this before and how did it go?
4	That's the thing : you can't know beforehand. I'm no MBTI expert but it's seems to me that, even though INFP are very introspective, they sometimes stay stuck in their own world. \n\nSo what you're doing is very healthy. Do it with an explorer mindset, sometimes it won't work, sometimes it will but you'll learn things everytime. \nKeep an open mind and you'll be OK!
2	I personally believe that it might not be for literally everyone, but for INFPs in general, this is a huge factor in improving quality of life.
1	I too am doing this, though I'm still young and can't drive. \n\nI made a pact with myself to experience as much as I can and well, it's been very fun. I'm more outgoing and now I'm more incline to go out more. Each experience is special and teaches many things if you look deep enough so it never gets too boring. I'm also much more of a risk taker. Not life threatening things but things that would normally cause a lot of anxiety. Like actually being myself, even if it bothers other people. \n\nThat being said, I do still stay in my a lot. Just less so now. 
57	Anybody else want to stop existing sometimes	Like not commit suicide, just not want to live. Just to end painfulness? 
11	yes
10	I wish there was a pause button, I could sleep for a month then... un-pause. Ideal
3	Yes, its the easy way out. But do you do it?
3	All the time. Constantly.
3	Yes. Nothingness sounds peaceful, and what is even the difference between being nothing and being everything?
3	Almost all the time, I imagine a switch and it is gone.  But not killing myself, not right now... that would cause too much hassle for others to deal with
3	If by sometimes you mean all the time, then yes, yes I do
3	>Mama, oh oh (anyway the wind blows)  \nI don't want to die  \nSometimes wish I'd never been born at all\n\n&#x200B;
4	I know it’s cheesy and cliche, but just talk to someone close to you. The words of the people I care about give me joy. Even if I never accomplish anything, knowing that there are people out there who love me just because I’m me is a truly wonderful feeling. 
2	Yes. I’ve always wanted to take a break from life, not in a dying way, but to just stop existing until I’m ready to return.
2	yes I think about this a lot. Sometimes I even want a break from breaks (do I make sense?) 
2	Sometimes, I wish I could disappear at certain moments.
2	sometimes, but then i wonder, how are some people happy when im not?\n\nusually the problems me
1	Seems kinda like suicide to me. Yeah, but you never know what your true potential can be if you just end it all.
1	Occasionally.\n\nI confront the fear of my own inadequacy and mortality by constantly striving to improve myself.\n\nI really hope one day I really become someone worth hearing about. It's what helps keep me going.
1	Definitely. I often wanna just find a way to get out of where I live.
1	I wouldn't mind phasing myself out of this reality every once in a while. The thing is I don't know where I would end up and whether I will like that place or not.
1	yes, it happens.  \nsee a therapist if you can.
1	In this [old science fiction book](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_World_Out_of_Time), a man time travels to a far future earth to find the planet inhabited by an immortal race of humans who have the wisdom of millenia but childlike bodies. after a few thousand years or so of living in their tribe, some of the immortal children sometimes have a craving to split off from the group and wander the planet alone just to enjoy solitude and be silent with their thoughts. sometimes they return to the group. sometimes they dont. sometimes i wish more than anything that i could do that too.

1	How do tertiary and inferior functions play into your dominant and auxiliary?	So, in my experience, my tertiary and inferior functions are at the core of my being. My tertiary function, Fi, is what dictates my beliefs and values (my principles). These guide where my Ni and Te spend their energy. My inferior function, Se, is basically the ultimate goal of my life. Se is experience, so, knowing my time here is limited, I desire to have a fulfilling, meaningful experience while I'm here. From there, Fi defines what that means and creates my values, e.g. connection, authenticity, freedom, learning, being important, making a difference, making an impact. These are things that add meaning and fulfillment to life. My Ni and Te conspire to achieve those goals.\n\nI was wondering, how does it work for INFPs (and other types for that matter)? How do your Te and Si guide your Ne and Fi?
1	uhhh not everyones functions have the same strength as the stack says they should be\n\nive got my Fi stronger than Fe and Si is my weakest

5	What do you love about yourself? (Also, what do you like about INFPs lurkers)	Stealing from a similar post in r/ESFJ. \n\nWe can be incredibly hard on ourselves, especially when going through some tough times. What's something you love about yourself and would never change? Lurkers, what's something you love about INFPs and would never change?
10	I like how weird and quirky I can be and how most of the time, I'm not afraid to be different
8	I like how I can read people and think of/anticipate their feelings. Sometimes others seem so rude but I truly think they don't realize other's feelings.
7	I love that I love learning more about myself if that makes sense. I consider myself self-smart.
6	I love being moved by seemingly simple or everyday things. The ability to see beauty or depth in something most people take for granted or don't notice. 
6	my values maybe
4	I love that I am not making the same choices my mentally ill dad did and am actively trying to be and improve my best for others. I love that I see things differently, as lonesome as it gets. I love that I can give compassion where others give cruelty. I love my ability to create. I love that I have found things to love and keep loving.
2	I love how passionate can I be about some ideas and turning them into reality... and also that when I really want something and focus on something one way or another I have always achieved my goals... except love life... I suck so hard with relationships... but everything else is great :D 
2	Survey on personality and flirting	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
1	That was fun. I wasn’t sure if on one of the questions you really meant, “gave them a message” or if it was supposed to be, “gave them a massage”, but either way I had the same answer! 
23	Anyone else feel intense emotion when they see others express the same?	I was watching David Lynch's "The Elephant Man" today, and I wasn't too bothered until one particular scene. The titular character talked to a friend about wishing he could have known his mother, lightly crying during the whole thing. I teared up initially, but as soon as the she started crying in empathy for him, I lost it. It seems like seeing other people react to something sad (or happy, for that matter) amplifies the emotion for me. Anyone else experience this?
3	Ya all the damn time lol. I hate it but I don't 
3	I feel both strong emotions, and a sense of relief when I see others responding strongly to something emotional. I guess because it validates my own emotional responses in a way, and gives me a sense of peace knowing someone responded ‘as they should’ (according to my own moral compass :D). Not entirely sure, have never before considered it. Interesting question. It’s a happy feeling tho, and that is enough in itself to make me tear up! Haha
2	I feel intense emotion whenever anyone (regardless of it's the person feeling it, or another person reacting to it) has a strong emotion. I usually automatically cry when I see someone else cry (or when animals 'cry'), even if I don't know why they are crying in the first place. This includes sad and happy crying!
16	when a bear drinks beer it becomes unbeerable.	 You’re just too distant for my arms. Maybe you’re too far for my hugs. Could my imagination be as long to reach you somewhere and taste you? I don’t know what I really feel. I wonder what you think about me, if you're cold enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wake up at night and cry fucked up. I'm still afraid of the dark. Gosh i’d do anything to have some flan now. but I'm very scared that something grabs me from under the bed if I put one foot on the floor. why you far flan?
4	This is a true INFP. So beautiful.

21	Saying your goals/plans out loud giving you a false sense of accomplishment	Anyone have this thing where they don’t like saying goals out loud because when you do, you feel like you’ve kind of already accomplished it and you’re no longer as productive as you should be with it? 
2	Yes, there is actually science behind this, it has to do w some chemical in your brain and stuff. Although it is important to get feedback at some points, depending on what you're doing. So my rule is I don't share something for feedback until I have actually achieved something decent, and don't excessively share for any other reason.
1	That has happened to me. These days I say my goals anyway because I have many people (including the one I want to impress the most) watching me so I have to hold myself accountable to them. 
9	What podcasts are my INFPeers into?	
3	The Tim Ferriss Show - in love with his work in general, mostly human optimization and habits of successful people accompanied with a wide variety of topics, but he really dives nerdily deep into the topics and people he's interviewing, episodes are usually 1-2h long\n\nAlso the School of Greatness and Aubrey Marcus podcast but noone can beat Tim in my humble opinion :)
3	The pro crastinators but im sure other infps probably wont like it if they dont like anime
3	Russell Brand!!!
2	Welcome to Night Vale, for sure.  It's based on a fictitious community, and is super wacky and awesome.
2	WTF, Philosophy of the World, Talkhouse, PBS NewsHour (on Fridays) Droid Life Show, Android Police, CS Joseph
2	The blind boy podcast!!! Really popular Irish podcaster, talks about everything from art history to mental health. Highly recommend!
2	Sam Harris, Joe Rogan, Dan Carlin, Barbell Logic, Human Circus, Philosophize This!...just to name a few
2	Used to love Joe Rogan when I was smoking weed but now I feel I’m a little bored of Joes views. He’s a strong headed guy tho. I also enjoy watching the H3 podcast, Ethan and Hila are just pleasant personalities to listen too. I’ll find episodes on other podcasts with specific guests that I like but the H3 podcast is probs my fav rn. 
1	Mysterious Universe, Conan O'Brien needs a friend, Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard, radiolab...
1	JRE, earbiscuits, Duncan Trussell family hour, TigerBelly. Needless to say I'm more of a comedy fan myself.
1	Women of Marvel podcast, Comic Conspiracy, and Harry Potter and the Sacred Text. Also, Imprint (an old Twilight podcast) was fun. I liked the Gilmore Guys too. 
1	Last podcast on the left is sooooo good if you’re fascinated by serial killers 😊 It’s informative, but also hilarious.
1	Another Round!! Available On Spotify 
11	For all of my fellow metalheads, I feel as if there is no better band that captures our spirit than Nightwish. They always give me a sense of feeling and hope. So I presenf fo you: Nightwish-Wish I had an Angel	
869	How I tell a story:	
86	This is why we make good novelists. Especially for fantasy. 
31	This is amazing 😂
22	It's been brought to my notice that this pic I found is an altered version of art designed to explain how ADHD works. \n\nLink to original post:\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/danidonovan/status/1073078457830129664\n\nIMO, this isn't exclusive to people with ADHD or to people belonging to a particular MBTI. Its just more relatable to some people than others. In no way is this an attempt to take away the original artist's credit or undermine the struggles faced by people with ADHD. 
41	Do you guys think it's because we think in so much detail and we have a hard time editing before words leave our mouths? I always feel like an ass when I realize other people just don't care about the details like I do lol.\n\nMy friends are pretty blunt about telling me to get to the point. Notoriously bad story teller, never connected it to being INFP.
20	Damn it why is this so true
13	This is how intuitives tell stories. My INFJ and  ENFP friends do that, too. I, an ENFJ, am guilty of it, also.
5	Lol just did this to my wife yesterday after work. Phew good to know its universal.
5	Fuck man, too brutal stop harassing me
3	HEY. CONTEXT IS IMPORTANT. lol\n\nFriends always cut me off before I get to my point though. I think I string together an unexpected number stuff to a listener to make a point.
3	As an Irish person, we're supposed to be good story tellers, but this is me for sure. Haha
3	So me, though usually when I'm in the middle of telling a story I think about how the person who listens probably doesn't care and/or what they might think about it, which distracts me and then I'm lost and wrap it up quickly
3	ENFP here... Think its a common thing b/w xNFPs
2	This describes me perfectly to the very fucking letter... Lol
2	I either do this, or worry about doing this and instead rush so the story makes zero sense and people think I’m crazy. I end up doing the latter more, usually. :(
2	Aaaaaaaah what a relief, I'm not the only one phew
2	I’m sorry, do you know me?!
2	Dont even bother anymore
2	I feel attacked 
2	Add an accumulated 10 minutes of stuttering and "uhh"s and you got a good chart for storytelling when inebriated. 
2	Lmao this is basically a roadmap of my brain.
1	Too true. *sadly shakes head*
1	I thought it was only me!
1	Lol this is just metal gear solid games in a nutshell. If you can pull it off, then you’ve struck gold!
1	Wow, hits too close to home.
1	Cant relate, i am always worried i am speaking for too long so my long stories always become real short and i speak too fast so i miss out on details and later regret it.\n
1	I've actually gotten better at not doing this as I've grown older.  As long as I'm not overexcited or in a rush, I tend to choose my words more carefully now.\n\nIt's funny, now when someone else does it, it drives me up the wall (especially when they start referencing people I don't know and will never meet that aren't even part of the story)!  There are two older ladies I know who do this constantly and I just have to grit my teeth through it.  A long monologue is fine if it all fits together, but if you throw in too many details that literally mean nothing to the story or to me, my eyes will start to glass over.
1	OhMahGawd. I relate to this on a spiritual level. 
1	The apology at the end really gets me 
1	everytime my istp friend tells a story i have to interuppt him because he skips details i would have mentioned. so he gets so triggert at me..\n\n haha\n\n&#x200B;
1	In my case, most of the time, I don't think I manage to get to the point. XD
1	That simple, huh. 
1	spot on
1	Why is this SO ACCURATE
1	Same.
1	Can't relate. 
1	Just saw this on INTP reddit
1	This is also an r/adhd mood as well😂😂😂
1	I love this! It brings me so much peace and a feeling of acceptance seeing this! I am totally cracking up! I feel I should make this into a business card I hand out to people before talking to them lol!
1	....oh, and I have ADD and am an INFP.....
1	This is so accurate, I didn't know it was an infp trait!
1	This is correct.
1	Okay, that is just way too accurate. 
1	Same here.
1	I relate to this so much 😆
1	I'm an entp and it true
1	This is also how I tell a story.  As they are with the normal-person story, both the first and last block of our stories are integral to the storytelling process.
1	for an intp this is very readable (im used to this stuff because thats literally exactly how we think)
1	Checking to see if it's my cake day
1	My personal fiction started as a prompt for a "relay novel" between my friends and I (we each write a page, one after another) which never got past the first page. Since then, I spent a few years building on my entry's characters and their back stories and well as doing research. Now it's scaled to be the lifetime of an entire universe Tolkien style and the original story is just an important part of the larger story. I also want to make side stories to add depth to the 15 or so characters (started with 2 and a monster) I made so far and their relationships with each other. I love it so much.  \n 
1	I never get to speak my mind... People tend to think that I'm rambling when in fact I'm composing a beautiful story based on real life experiences. But I digress... I'm tired man.
1	What's wrong?\n\n○ This post uses deragatory / innapropriate\n     language\n\n○ This post contains / promotes cyberbullying\n\n○ Material in this post was stolen from another\n     user / platform / individual\n\n● I'm in this post and I don't like it\n\n\n\n\n(Btw this is a joke; I definitely upvoted 😂)
1	no im bad at story telling :(\n\ni have the most crazy shit happen to me, accidentally (unknowingly) breaking into camps, injuring back of head after falling 2 meters backwards while drunk trying to climb a fence while running from security, ending up in hospital but escaping out of the window (doc says to cut something out of my head, me thinking they will take my brains), running home in underwear and a bandage arround my head...\nand other stuff.\nwhen i tell it to somebody, its just straight what happened... they are just like „woah thats crazy“ and thats it. instantly talking about a new topic.\n\nand when others tell storys, just normal stuff, how they dropped a toast this morning and had to make a new one, they talk for minutes and everyone goes like „OMFG No WAY!!? dude...“ and so on. make 100 references to his story and talk about it for the whole day..\n\nwhats wrong with my story telling :D
0	That's the same pic used for ADHD people not Infp's but ok 😏

60	Am I the only one?	Have you ever gotten so into a daydream that you forgot it wasn't real, and when you did, it made you really sulky and miserable out of disappointment?
7	Yep, had that moment some times but mostly it was after a (night)dream in the morning. Daydreams don't make me miserable but just make me miss some things that were going on while I was daydreaming.
5	This happens to me pretty frequently actually. 
5	i feel like everyone in this sub is the same person and its insane
4	Every chance I get. 
3	Yeah, happened while I was on vacation hoping for something I realized wasn’t going to happen. I was so worried I ruined the evening and last day honestly. That and there was an actual sleep dream I had that felt super real and I woke up to my heart pounding I was so excited at just the way it happened in my head, and that it happened at all, and just got hit by “oh it was just a dream” so hard.
3	Not with day dreams, but I frequently have happy dreams that are soul crushing when I wake up and realize it was just a dream. I'd rather just have a nightmare.
3	its sleep dreams for me\n\nlike when my brain just made such a cool looking place and its gone and im like fuck and try to build it in minecraft but realize it wont work because im not sensing and cant organize details
2	No daydreams when I had them always left me happy.
2	I get into that stage everytime I listen to a new piece of music I discovered and am thinking about a scenario that I just invented, together they make for an alternate reality.
2	Yep, tbh it happens almost every I nap or have a good sleep/dream.
2	Jeezus YES. I just daydream all these cool stories and I’m just so lost in them and planning out all this intricate backstory when oh this character isn’t ever going to be real... *sigh* ;~;
1	Yes
1	Literally everyday.
1	Not really, reality is just disappointments, in daydreams one can be happy.
2	Im so conflicted	My ex broke up with me a three months ago. I'll remember the day: December 16th, 2018 at around 10:30 pm. She was my first girlfriend. She meant so much to me. We're good friends now and that's alright. I'm over her and I've been trying to get to know some girl I've crushed on since freshmen year (trust me, this isn't a coping mechanism.) But yesterday I was sitting with her in class and I don't know, I wanted so badly to hug her tightly. One last time. I missed those hugs she'd give me. I feel like she threw everything away so easily without thinking of the consequences. But we've talked and she  broke up with me because she was anxious and felt pressured to be in the relationship. Mainly because her older sister, who also goes to the same school as us would talk to her a lot about her and I. Don't get me wrong, her sister supported the relationship wholeheartedly and she was so happy to see everything. I am over it. I just don't get why this went through my head. I didn't give her much mind on other days but yesterday when she sat by me she looked gorgeous. She radiated. This wasn't expected, this came out of nowhere. Another reason why she broke up with me was that she has many complications in her life, the poor girl. Plenty of screwed up things happened to her and it's showing. She didn't want to hurt me or put me through hearing about all the things that happened to her.  She's depressed and doesn't seem okay time to time.  She still talks to me the way we talked when we were together, we laugh, we talk. She still vents to me. Ya know, how we INFPs get it. She trusts me. I hope. She worries for me and she cares about me, she's told me that. I can't help but remember that night at the Halloween lock in: she held me. I held her back. I never knew what love felt like. For once, all in the universe felt right. For two months and four days we were together and by God, it was like we were meant for each other. Like she told me: "it's like you're a clone of me." I remember our first date at the movies. Well my parents knew nothing of it, because it was a school trip to the movies on the weekend. Those were good memories. But I'm over it. I am over it all. This was just yesterday. We all know that we have a sort of insecurity and distrust for tomorrow. I just need to grow some balls and talk to that other girl. I've made a move though, sent her a Valentine's day "secret admirer" note and I think she suspects me. Please pray for me, my dudes.  Thank you for listening for now. I hope I didn't sound like a jerk or anything. I hope I'm not wrong for doing anything. I also want to say that my friends all told me as well as all people who know my ex said that I deserved better and that she wasn't ready for a relationship. I guess that is the case. Like how we all do: I worry for her and everyone around me. Way. Too. Much. 
2	Breakups are tough. It sounds like you're doing ok though, and moving on. She will always hold a special place in your heart and that's how it should be. I think it's good that you still somewhat care for her in your own heart and mind because it's not healthy for anyone to harbor ill feelings towards an ex. It's important to remember the good times you had with her. You should feel proud for how you survived your first real breakup and that you are doing ok now. Kudos to you. Take care. 
11	Train documentaries	I just love watching trains. Or documentaries that show train travel. Any recommendations?
6	This is such a wholesome post inside I'm weeping xD I also want to know what people say because being on a long train journey is one of my favourite things to do.  Only tip I have is typing Orient Express or Royal Orient Express into Youtube and you get videos like [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnJ\_1OWWH3M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnJ_1OWWH3M) where it shows the passenger's travel experience inside the train.  I don't know if it's the inside or outside you like watching?  But yea, Orient Express is one of my goal holidays one day.

49	Taking every small interaction personally	I think this could be an INFP thing—I was crossing the street at a crosswalk, and this asshat comes barreling down the road, honks at me, and speeds off. The interaction was over in 5 seconds, but I felt quite hurt and a bit like crying afterwards. I’m so sensitive to every unpleasant interaction, I always feel like I’ve done something horrible afterwards! Even if the clerk at the post office is a bit grumpy, I’ll think it must’ve been something I did. Does anyone know some ways to take things less personally? 
17	learn the art of not giving a fuck, its a skill that needs to be trained just like driving a car, IMO
8	I'm like this too, but sometimes I just minimize it and move on. I also think of it this way: I'm not so important that every single thing that I do has an impact, so it can't be all about me. That's just pure narcism. Once I realize that, I cut it out and it helps me forget all about it. \n\nI definitely get where you're coming from though, to think that you're responsible for things, and wanting to fix them up afterwards. 
5	I am the same way to an extent, but I've learned to just shrug it off. In that case it's obviously their fault as pedestrians have the right of way, so thinking in a logical context it wouldn't make sense to be offended by such a thing. It's just something you have to practice and be mindful about.
5	it probably is, as an intp (with a strong Fi) i know both how to empathize AND be an asshole simultaneously\n\nand your reaction is most likely Fi (yes i feel that i usually dont show it though)
4	I use to feel like that, but I realized it not usually my fault so I just brush it off. As the other gent said, master the art of not giving an eff 
4	I'm learning that it's related to self esteem. How to raise that self esteem has been more successful recently. 
4	Shift your perspective. De-center your ego. Feels bad, at first. You might even feel trivial. But I can vouch you gain a clarity that is actually quite liberating.
3	Been prone to that myself. Not a good feeling.\n\nSame with being a little embarrassed or slightly humiliated, it's like the feeling gets amplified in my mind and I feel dreadful for at least an hour afterwards.\n\nYou can save yourself a lot of pain by training yourself to try not to take things personally. Some people react pretty much the same way to everyone in general; even if they didn't it wouldn't be something you should have to beat yourself up over.
3	OMG this is me. I do this all the time. I think it’s why I have a lot of anxiety of going into the world and interacting with people. When I worked in retail and someone yelled at me because of something I took it so personally and wanted to cry.\n\nALSO on the other hand- iI do something, it probably is intentional and personal toward another person and they don’t even notice or care lol.  Like I sincerely hope you have a good day. Or if I honk at you, I sincerely hope you can learn to drive better 😂

17	Shopping/Out in Public	Okay. So I totally hate being a "regular" somewhere, simply because I don't want to be recognized by employees or at the very least don't want them to acknowledge the fact that I shop at their establishment frequently. It's not because I don't like them or that they're not friendly, it's just that I get embarrassed the "spotlight" being shined on me. If I go somewhere, I try to go once a week if I can help it just because of this, and I skip around so I'm not confined to one spot. It's pretty irrational, but yeah I'd rather deal with it this way than be "singled out". 
9	If you're going out of your way to alter your schedule in order to avoid what you perceive to be uncomfortable interactions while knowing full-well that they are perfectly normal interactions, it's worth considering that this is possibly a manifestation of social anxiety and not simply introversion.
3	I'm the exact same. Even my local corner shop, I refuse to go into it more than once a day, if I've forgot something I'll take the car to another shop. 
2	I like to do the exact opposite specially in food establishments because if I go there more than like 4 times and order the same thing (which I like to do) then I don't have to talk to anyone the next time. They just see me and get me what I always get and that saves a lot of awkwardness from my side. It's always easier for me to buy things in the same places exactly because they'll know who I am already.
1	Same, but at the same time wanting the staff at restaurants to ask "the usual?" so I don't have to talk.
1	omg yes! 
1	Hahah this is something I would do too. Also it’s probably a good thing to mix up your schedule so that a serial killer can’t stalk you 😊

17	I've read this poem by Cavafy today. It's sad, beautifull and very INFP.	
6	Perhaps I misinterpreted, but I disagree. As an INFP, the sense of child-like wonder makes any slight change in environment wonderful and thus exploring completely new places so therapeutic it never gets old. I come home invigorated with new ideas and hopeful.\n
3	I like Cavafy's poems, they are dark/sad but kind of inspiring to me. I remember when we did "As much as you can" in literature class. It basically says to (as much as you can) respect yourself and not loose your identity. (Some lines may seem to say "don't socialise" but I think he trully means "don't loose yourself while trying to fit in")

16	Would you rather be a big fish in a small pond, or a small fish in a big pond?	I'm not talking about actual fish. I'm making big decisions in my life and I wanted to ask fellow INFPs what your perspective is on this. This isn't a permanent thing, there is a chance I could eventually move to a different pond so to speak.\n\nTLDR: Would you rather be a big fish in a small pond, or a small fish in a big pond? And what has been your experience with this in your life in which ever context you want to put it?
15	Umm... rather a small fish in a big pond :). I love to learn and discover and be challenged and inspired, even if it’s scary at times. \n\nBut in a way neither. I am my own fish, regardless of the pond :D.
12	there's so much to explore as a small fish in a big pond, so i guess that one
10	I would rather be a big fish in a small pond. I think anyone would agree with me. It's easier and builds your ego. If you want to actually develop yourself, you have to be a small fish in a big pond, so you can become the big fish. Just taking challenges and going against your instincts would be the context. 
6	small fish in a big pond, so much opportunity
5	No room to grow in a small pond. Stagnant.\n\n I always chose the big  pond. Never stayed small  for very long.  \n\nWent back to visit the small ponds a few times. Meh.
2	I tend to be an invisible fish in a small pond that all the other fish come to for getting things done. 
2	I think it kinda depends on what you're aiming for. Being a big fish in a small pond is nice, but then again, there's only so much space left for you to grow. Meanwhile, being a small fish in a big pond might make you feel quite inadequate because there will always be bigger fishes and thus make you feel like you have to grow into something larger, but perhaps all of that pressure might end up being beneficial for you. Just my two cents :-))
1	If we’re speaking from a biased point of view and from personal opinion, I’d rather be a bigger fish in a small pond. As of right now, I’m considered a small fish in a big pond. \n\nThere’s ups and downs to either choice, but obviously being a smaller fish would prove to give you obstacles. Being a bigger fish kinda gives you somewhat of a status, but this also varies depending on if it was an achieved or ascribed status. \n\nI guess it all comes down to how you’re born and what you achieve. 
1	Um I do not understand the metaphor. Please explain to this INTP invader. 
1	I understand people wanting room to grow. But you're also seen as lower quality compared to the big fish. Why would anyone want the small fish when they could have the bigger fish compared to you. This could be damaging to some people and not beneficial.
1	There’s this part of me that finds the small pond empty and futile - like big deal if I’m important in a situation that counts for nothing. Small empires seem to be craved by many but seem worthless to me. I’d rather be nobody in the big open pond, and if I want it enough, work my butt off to become important in that pond because that would signify that I’d really made it if I can impress over and above all the competition. But yeah that’s just my take, I ultimately prefer to be invisible in a big pond and live quietly observing the world and quietly helping and loving people from the sidelines. I quitelike being nobody 😂

1	I am bad at it, but I think it’s something people perfect over years. I think artists would be offended that you think it’s a natural talent. I recently remembered how badly I loved art class as a child but I never put in the time and effort. 
1	just can't seem to make any real friends in college. I'm progressing but very slowly. I miss my dog back home; it's been too long since I've seen her.
0	My way or the highway	So I started wondering whether it is common for INFPs (or perhaps high Fi-users) to sometimes become really fussy about doing things their way or the "right" way. I never thought I was like this until yesterday when I was playing Scrabble with some family members and turned into a full-blown ISTJ basically, scolding everyone for playing the game entirely wrong, highlighting every little fine print in the rule sheet and feeling very very veeery frustrated (**but they were building the words in a big pile of hot stinking disorganization and confusion without leaving any space in between, making it impossible to create anything good!!**).\n\nThen I thought about my childhood and how I would get irritated by my friends when they didn't play by my rules. A friend would decide that Barbie 1 becomes a mermaid but I had already had a vision about Barbie 1 and Barbie 2 being evil witches, so for having her own mind I would punch my friend in the face. I was a monster. One time I even got annoyed about someone liking hot shower water more than cold shower water and yeah, what the fuck (they were kind of disrespecting my point of view though. Lol notice how I'm still always defending myself).\n\nAnyway, I didn't know I'd be one to obsess over such small things but retrospectively I can see that I in fact do. I no longer punch my friends though, not that I have any of those now, ha ha. (Karma?) I have developed self control now, which is nice. But idk, can any INFPs relate or is it just me and my shameful bad temperament?
2	As an infp I can relate so much. \nI’d make up these games and if people didn’t follow my rules I’d get mad. Idk why I did this considering INFP’s are not even that strict on policy. Probably more so on our own policies. \n\nIt’s most definitely an Fi thing, we are imaginative people after all, we have certain visions for things that need to live up to our ideals. At least, that’s what I think.
2	i'm seeing a (probable) infp and they definitely like to be in control of the broad strokes of the day -- broad enough to cover their entire lack of ability to keep to a schedule XD
17	The Power of Vulnerability (everybody should watch this)	
3	I did take this from the ask Reddit thread about Ted talks, but I honestly think everybody (INFP, specifically) should watch this video.  It can be kind of eye opening for many.
1	I read her book (Daring Greatly) a couple months back. This video is more or less an outline of that so if you liked that I’d recommend the book. 
1	This was freaking great! So truthful! Thanks for sharing, kind of gave me some hope again. :)
1	This was in our Starbucks training recently 🙂
8	Absolutely disgusted by algebra but love statistics?	This is my first year in college and enrolling into a statistics class. I thought this was going to be the death of me as an INFP. I've always hated math, or at least I thought I did. Statistics comes naturally to me and I'm extremely surprised as I've failed math classes and I thrive better in the humanities arena. Have any other people had a similar experience or a completely opposite experience? I'm interested at why this might be the case.
7	INFP math major here!\n\nI'm a fan of statistics myself, at least the fundamentals of it. I think I like it because it's very easy to apply to daily life. With algebra (which I also enjoy), one may understand how to manipulate equations and solve for unknowns but finding legitimately interesting ways to apply that knowledge might be difficult without exploring more advanced algebra.
2	[deleted]
2	Personally I'm fascinated with popsci number theory and math and such. Took 2 semesters of calculus in college, but I haven't worked actual problems for years. 
2	Nah, it's the opposite for me. I hate stats but love calculus and algebra. I'm still a humanities major though technically (Archaeology and Linguistics)
2	calculus where my fun is at\n\ni love bending the rules of math to their limit (haha, get it?)
2	I'm the opposite, I did well in all my math classes (whatever was required for engineering majors) except for the two statistics/probability classes I took. It never quite clicked for me. When I say I didn't do well in it, I mean I got an A- or B+ instead of a solid A lol 
1	No, everything has its place. Depending on the work you're trying to do. Can't blame the tools, if the master doesn't know how to use them. 
7	does any of you feel trapped in their timeline too	After months of support and personal development, I've come to a point where I feel satisfied with where I've brought myself, but it's finally like I'm stuck in purgatory bc it's as if all that was happening in my life suddenly got paused. My thoughts are stuck in loops, I have no drive to read/watch things/reach out to others so I can feed my brain with new material, my friends and family have p much gone silent, I just don't know how time is passing. I miss feeling alive and Out There but I don't know what that means anymore. I don't feel depressed, it's more like coming across a ditch in the road when you were least expecting it and now you don't really know what to do about it. I'm bewildered at most, not devastated,which would be more like depression for me. Anyone else feeling this way?? If so, is there any way you've pulled yourself out of this? 
6	I've come to think of myself as a survivor. For better or worse as horrible and petty as the world is, even as friendships drift apart, I'm still out here experiencing things and rebounding and creating artwork.\n\nIt's just so different from the utopian view of the world I thought I was moving towards when I was younger. Where I thought all my friends would never leave me, my parents wouldn't get old and sick, and I would just live in some kind of amazing, artistically and intellectually enriching, pansexual commune.
2	i feel constantly stucked mentally, as if i ve achieved the maximum and i dont need to feed my mind any longer. That sometimes makes me feel as a lifeless drifting soul in the world. \n\nUnfortunately i don't know how to get out yet, i just try to keep focusing on something so i don't lose resolution
2	get drunk on a free night, and keep close track of what crosses your mind. whatever comes is a good starting point
1	Yeah, I am also trapped in this body of homo sapiens.
78	Decided to paint one of my doodles from my art journal. It's a work in progress ..kinda like me 🤓	
5	Now that’s some shit
4	 Good work, I envy your art skills! All I’m good for is looking at art. Like the colors you chose for this work.
3	love it 
3	That's amazing, I'm not good enough to get past the doodle stage, this is brilliant!!
16	When I was a 4 years old, I used think that I had already grown up and the life I'm living right now is a dream I'm seeing in my sleep. As a kept growing, this feeling kept fading and merged with the reality.	 
6	I feel you on that. I know exactly what you mean. 
3	I used to stare out the window in long car rides as a kid, peering out but not physically seeing anything. I would just think of the future, whatever that meant to a young child with no realistic idea of what it entailed. Yet somehow, I *did*. Like I felt how little of the world I understood. \n\nIt was the only time I truly felt small. I’m only 18 but I miss those moments. They weren’t very long, but I can never feel that way again. I’m sure there is so much to learn out there still, that I can’t even comprehend, but just knowing the fact doesn’t replicate that feeling. I wonder if I lost my imagination? I hope not, because reality is a bitch.\n\nSorry this post isn’t exactly what you meant OP, but it made me remember those moments. Thank you.
3	I used to imagine the same thing as a child--but with more anxiety, as if I was flawed for reliving all of this (present) and should hopefully wake up.  
2	That's because this life is a dream, a temporary phase before coming back to our real life.
2	legit one of my biggest fears is that this life is a big dream and that ill wake up and lose everything ive cared about (ill have learned multivariate calculus though, as well as piano and trumpet, so thatll be cool, if they even exist when i wake up)
4	GODZILLA 2 Trailer Holy Shit I'm pumped	
3	Oh man, happy to see another movie buff here! Maybe we should start a favorite movies thread soon.\n\nI'm most pumped for Guillermo Del Toro's version of "Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"
1	Another INFP godzilla fan?! Oh hell yeah, my dude! I am so excited about this film! Giant kaiju fights for days! 
0	What does this have to do with INFP?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere are the mods? 
6	Does Weed suppresses anyone's Fi and make them more extroverted?	So I noticed that a little bit of weed for me personally suppresses some of the more stormy parts of my Fi and allows me to be more carefree, spontaneous, easy-going, and overall much more of a jovial person in general.  It feels like rediscovering my Ne again and giving it a little bit of an extroverted charge. Again, the key for me is just a little bit, not too much. My moods aren't as stormy and I found it easier to open up to new individuals. I know weed reacts differently with different people, so I'm wondering that your guy's experience with weed is like in terms of making your more extroverted
8	No. My introversion stays the same but I become anxious (more than usual, rather). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot weed related, and forgive me for veering off topic a bit, but a friend warned me that I should never try psychedelics; I'm too nervy and over-imaginative 
3	Depends on the strain and how much I smoke. If I smoke just a tiny bit of some high quality hybrid it just makes me more relaxed and positive. But it does not make me more outgoing by any means. In fact, I’d rather avoid meeting new people or running into someone I know because I’d be too paranoid about how I look and act while high.\n\nI’ve actually stopped smoking for a few months and I find that I’ve become more mentally stable and outgoing. Yes, I’ve had to face some dark thoughts that I ignored before but it’s a part of spiritual growth anyway. Weed is good when enjoyed responsibly on rare occasions, for me anyway. I still like it better than alcohol, especially edibles, but I don’t think that INFPs need extra help escaping reality and being less productive 😄
2	Not at first, but after I developed a tolerance it made me love talking to people, stranger or friend...
2	works that way for my friend
1	It does to an extent, but my social anxiety is really exacerbated. In situations where I have to meet new or unfamiliar people, I start to build up varying amounts of anxiety.  Apart from that, once I feel comfortable and not as paranoid, self-conscious, etc., I really do sometimes make great observations, analysis, and coming to conclusions.
1	Yes! everyone around me becomes quieter and more chill, while I start to talk more and more out loud, not really looking for their responses. just stuff about my day or what's been on my mind. which I never do really when sober lol
1	It can make you more introverted depending on what kind it is and how much you smoke, \nThere were times it made me so stuck in my own head with anxious thoughts that I just felt glued to a sofa for hours unable to speak a word.
1	Smoking basically enables me to speak period. I can count the number of people I can actually talk to out loud on one hand, but when I smoke everything comes easier. I just...Stop caring and go for it. Makes me ramble sometimes, but my wife seems to love when I go on a tear about the random shit going through my mind instead of me being mostly silent.
551	My extrovert friends trying to get me out of my shell	
19	good thing i dont have friends, i guess
16	No friends no problems 🌱
9	That looks like it hurts. 
6	I can feels the cats imaginary bubble of isolation crack, all the beautiful thoughts framed in front of his eyes the book of conundrums in his hand and the warm air inside, all blown away or shattered while he is dragged into a quicksand of eyes, attention and baseless expectation that he would sway to the beats of the herd like a common peasant. It's getting dark, too dark to see....... 😣 and I can already feel them sucking his energy away
6	Haha I'm so thankful for my friend who does this. He's good at knowing when to pull me out or leave me be lol
5	This just sounds like social anxiety, not introversion. Introverts aren’t devoid of a need for people and social stimulation.
2	Yup
1	Nope nope nope haha
45	I am grieving.	My aunt passed away unexpectedly today at 53 years old. I was the closest with her of all my aunts and uncles, and she to I amongst all her nieces and nephews. Her personality lit up the room. She was goofy, kindhearted, caring, and an overall amazing person. \n\nWhen I was 11 or 12 she gave me a beat up gold ring that scratched my face whenever I rubbed my nose or something. But I still wore it. She told me we’d get it fixed up. A year or so went on and I asked her about it - she ended up taking a silver ring from her finger and put it on mine. I’ve worn it everyday since. \n\nMy grandma has lost her third child of seven.  My uncle (my late aunt’s twin brother) passed away a week from Christmas Day in 2006. My aunt passed a few weeks after the 2012 New Year. My grandma is the most resilient human being I have ever known. \n\nI last saw my aunt a few weeks ago. She asked me to pick her up a slurpee and a pack of smokes. I did. She gave me a big hug and a kiss and I went on my way. That’s the last time I saw her. \n\nI can’t even look at pictures of her right now because it hurts too much to see her. It doesn’t feel real. \n\nEvery year on my birthday she’d call me and cheerfully sing happy birthday to me with my nickname. I won’t receive that call on Monday. I have a voicemail from my 21st birthday from her. I just played it and I’m crying all over again. My heart is in shambles.  \n\nIdk I just needed to lament a little bit. \n\nTell your friends and family you love them. Tomorrow truly is promised to no one. \n\nI love all of you. \nThank you for reading. 
6	I don't know what you believe. I don't know what to believe myself. But I do know that when we talk to those we've lost - even if they can't hear us - it keeps part of them alive. Perhaps that's even the most important part of a person - those pieces we leave behind.  The memories and impressions we leave on other people ... our lingering mark on the universe.\n\nKeep talking to her. Maybe she can hear you? But even if she can't, you'll be keeping that love alive. I'm sorry you're hurting. 
4	Thanks for sharing a bit of her with us. She sounded like a fabulous aunt. Hugs. 
5	A big hug for you. At some point it’ll warm your heart to have so many great memories of that lovely person who was in your life for so long, but I know how raw it feels right now. Take your time, and I hope you have people around you with whom you can share how you feel.
2	My birthday is Monday, too.\n\nWhen my maternal grandma died, I was given her watch. I took very good care of it for a good while, but I eventually left it in a bathroom when washing my hands. (I did the same thing to two very important rings as well). While I haven't had it for about 25 years I still think of it sometimes. I even have my own watch now, that the leather broke and the battery recently died.\n\nI think for my birthday, I'll go get the band and battery fixed. Thank you for that, and I am sorry for your loss.
2	My condolences.\n\nI'm not sure how voicemails work, and I'm just generally afraid that you'll somehow lose it. Perhaps you want to record it somehow as an mp3 which you can back up.
1	ok, the fastest step forward without causing more pain is probably to get a friend to help you, then therapy if you still have problems. that aside, stay alive, im sure therell be people who take interest in your personality, and remember; youve still got your life to live, even if you cant live all of it with the people you care and love. ❤
1	She sounds like a wonderful lady. I’m so sorry for your loss! Big hugs.
21	How do you guys handle anger after being scolded/humiliated?	Do you guys lash it out at them or just be silent? Or do you have your own way of handling this problem? I'm always frustrated whenever I'm being scolded by my friend for no reason in front of other people. She always do that because I always said nothing back because I'm trying not to lash my anger out in front of other people. I end up feel inferior sometimes. P/s: sorry if my english is poor.
17	I try to walk away because otherwise I will lash out.
7	So, is that a friend?
7	I'm sorry but no friend should treat you that way.  I have been in similar situations with getting yelled at, and she seems like the type of person that gets a kick out of scolding you in public, and she knows that you won't say nothing back. There's people that are cruel that way and enjoy screaming at shy, mild-mannered people.\n\n&#x200B;
5	I would ask to have a private conversation. This can help you avoid public humiliation and might be easier with less of an audience. You could acknowledge this problem like you did here, asking her why she keeps doing it. But at first you'd have to be sure of whether you play any part in this (you might have done something in the past or kept repeating a mistake that's annoying her. In this case you could ask her to please be patient with you). If you're sure you're just being disrespected then like I said just ask her why she keeps doing that and try to resolve the issue.
6	I know this isn’t healthy but I get very defensive and usually cry :(
1	sometimes i do get away from it. 
1	My advice is to just lough, always keep a smile on your face - even when sad, angry or offended. After a while the smile will copy (a least some of it) from the face to the hearth. Also the offender will be the one who feels bad, they will see they can't hurth you and eventually stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to cut a long story short smile a them, humiliate them in your head (as we all here know we can do very good) and translate that inner satisfaction to your face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this will help you and excuse my english (not my lingua franca)
1	Most of the time I'm able to keep silent and just stare blankly back at them. Rarely when I can't take it anymore I completely lose myself and I cry uncontrollably.\n\nShe doesn't sound like a true friend that understands you well, maybe talk to her in private?
1	confront your friend 1 on 1, as difficult as it may be. if they cant accept that theyre hurting you, then why are they your friend?\n\ni remain silent when being scolded or humiliated, but my anger is under control because i know deep down that the people who resort to such crude measures without absolute necessity are below me anyway. (i rarely get scolded/humiliated now, but thats just because ive out-assholed all of the assholes when they tried to asshole me)
1	Draw it out. Pull out paper and get all those heavy words on to paper. Maybe, perhaps, that's where they belong. I write them in a way nobody could read or comprehend. I can't even read it and that's my intent because I know that pain will come back with utter voraciousness, worse than before. This doesn't mean I still am torn to shreds in the inside, but I get release my frustration somehow. 
1	Just disconnect one's emotions from outside reality and detach oneself from one's inner emotions, too. One will barely feel anything.
5	Is there any tested method that helps our kind develop consistent habits?	
3	If you're into games, try out the app named Habitica. Pursuing goals and habits gives you xp and cool rewards. It really does work for me! Logging my achievements before sleep has genuinely become the best part of my day! 
2	I don't know if it's tested or not, but having a close friend or family member go along with the habit (for accountability) works for me. Usually one of us can trigger the other to go along to the gym at least a few times a week. \n\nHonestly, there aren't many habits that I really want to have. At least consistently. 
28	I'm pursuing my dreams, even though it's unrealistic in other people's eyes	\- Warning, part of my post deals with some dark, mental health topics. -\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk. Hello!\n\nI just turned 23. After struggling for the past few years with severe depression, anxiety, isolation, alcohol dependence, family issues, financial issues, dropping in and out of college, and a few failed suicide attempts...\n\nI realized that life is too short not to follow my dreams. I have always been creative, wanting to express myself and my life  experiences and make them into a work of art. To not only make myself happy but to also inspire others and lift people up. In the past I had zero self-confidence to pursue it. But after everything that I've been through, I finally feel like I have the courage to do it.\n\nI want to pursue Youtube/Social Media, and make content that is creative, entertaining, but also inspires others to be their authentic selves. I want to work hard at it, and finally move out of this town that I've been stuck in my whole life and go to LA. I want to experiment with different kinds of art, fashion. I want to travel and live life on my own terms. I want to be my own boss. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like a pipe dream. But it is MY dream. And after facing death and looking into it's eyes, and coming back from that on the other side... I'm ready.  Many people (I feel like a lot of INFPs understand) tell me that I need to be practical. Go to school. Get a respectable career. Follow society's checklist of things to do. I have tried that and wanted to rip my hair out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know, I'm rambling haha :) just wanted to express myself to my fellow infps. I want to pursue this while I still have the fire in me.
12	I relate to you a lot on this one, pave your own lane and make your dreams your life.
10	Damn right homie. Go and get it. Fvck the haters. It takes more guts to go against the norm than to follow what is "normal".\n\nBTW if you haven't started YouTube yet, I can give you a few pointers if you're interested. I aint got a huge audience but I have some of the technical aspects down and 2 years of experience under my belt. DM me sometime if you want to have a conversation about it. I won't be much help on the SEO/Marketing side of things though, but if you haven't already found them, there are many helpful YT channels I could recommend for YT tips. Nick Nimmin, Pat Flynn, Video Creators, Video Influencers, and Roberto Blake to name a few.
4	Go for it. What's the worst that could happen? You can go get a boring job whenever. 
6	Follow your dreams! \n\nBut I'm gonna tell you what I told my best (ENFP) friend who has a similar idea. It's great to follow your dreams, but always have some sort of backup plan. If you're currently in school, don't drop out. If you're unemployed, get a job first!  You say you want to be a Youtuber - well, all of the famous YTers worked 9-to-5 jobs until they became famous. You need to pay rent somehow, and you need to have some sort of job experience, because in that sort of business, no one lasts forever, and people 'retire' very young. \n\nI hope I didn't come off as too preachy, I really do wish you all the best! But take the advice that every INFP needs to  hear: don't forget about the reality while you're chasing your dreams, because reality won't forget about you. 
4	Yes! Go for it, I’m rooting for you 👏🏻
2	Good for you :) I totally understand how you feel, it’s hard for us who want to pursue a career in the arts because even if you don’t care what others think you have a voice inside you telling you that it’s too hard. I also have an “unrealistic” dream career and it’s hard to even know where to start. I hope we all can achieve our dreams. Just try to remember that those jobs exist and *someone* has to do them.
1	Sure, it might be a dumb move, you might be risking a lot, but if you don't see another path, if you truly feel dead otherwise, what's there to lose?\n\nThis INFP youtuber, Lilypichu, is very inspiring to me. And she comes from a harsh background as well.\n\nJohn Green is also INFP, if you're interested. He's primarily a writer, though, but has also been through a lot.\n\nYou INFPs can truly be balls of pure sunshine. I hope the best for you.
1	When you start up your YT channel message me. I'd love to watch.
3	Cycling through relationships	do any of you find yourselves cycling through relationships and hopping between people? If so why does this happen
1	Maybe. You’re probably unsure of what you want. Different companions can lead you on the path of completely different lives.
75	My boyfriend told me my bookmark belonged here.	
5	I HAVE THAT EXACT SAME BOOKMARK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
4	What book is this?
3	Love it
2	Very cool!
2	this subreddit is a very interesting place\n\neverything that is said here just puts a picture of\n\nrainbow
2	I absolutely love it and wish I had one. This brightens my mood in a magical way
2	Are books good because you don’t see add pop ups?
2	WHY IS LOLITA THE HOME FOR THAT WONDERFUL BOOKMARK??? 
14	A couplet	I came across a couplet in my mother tounge. It hit me hard. I am giving you a rough translation of it:\n\nBeware of defeat in victory,\nHappiness a kind of sorrow itself\n\nThere is no such crown in the world,\nThat has no weight at all.\n\nIt's very apt for us. We value authenticity most and we idealize everything. We may end up being sad even after a success if it is not in line with our values.\n\nWhat do you think?\n
41	Reminder for those who need it: Everything's Gonna be OK	It may not seem like it right this second, but it'll all be ok. Breath, and know that everything passes with time. Things have a way of working themselves out, and you're strong enough to get through rough times. Lots of love to you! 
7	Hey, thanks for this! I've been super anxious because I need to have a procedure done in a few days and I've never been put under before. The thought of the anesthesia and losing control just doesn't sit well at all. INFP problem? My anxiety has nearly convinced me that I'm walking into my own death.  
3	Thank you, I needed this today. Hope you're doing well too <3
3	Thanks, I needed this. Still having a hard time getting over my ex (4 months).
2	Just saw this and can’t tell you how much I needed to hear this. Thank you <3
2	Thank you! I know I'm freaking stupid when it comes to bad times. Over and over again I've found that I made a big thing out of something small. Perspective is everything!
3	The Neverending Story (Book)	I decided to read the original novel that one of my favorite childhood movies is based on (except that Artax scene), and it's eerie how similar I was to Bastian (the main character) when I was a kid, even down to the way of thinking.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Yea same here buddy.  Best movie for infps growing up.
1	Oh my god I looove that movie. Haven't read the book, can you update me on if it's good? 
1	I’m gonna find it and read it, thanks for the pointer!
18	hawaiian wedding song- from a 1950s hawaiian music record i found in a goodwill. very peaceful(:	
2	LOVE this! What are the details? I want to see if I can find it anywhere. 
1	If you know the name of this, I'd love to hear it!
9	Evening / night energy levels	Why is my brain and body most energetic in the evening / night? Anyone else experience this? 
10	Yes, probably because it tends to be quieter at night and most ppl are asleep therefore I don't get overstimulated therefore get a large burst of energy
5	Yeah.. In the evening my mind gets more active most of the time, but in a 'relaxed active' kinda way, not in a stressful way. \nPhisically I always get the urge to go for a walk or run. But I have no idea why.. Maybe the calmness of the night? Or the dark? Idk.\n\nAnyway, yea. Relatable. 
3	Yup. It’s late and I have an 8 am class tomorrow, but I just can’t stop thinking
3	It's because we feed off people's dreams.
3	I've never known what to make of this because I'm a real morning person too, I wake up fast and easily, adore the sunrise and the crisp air of a new day...\n\nBut after 11pm I'm up for almost *anything*. Bf fell asleep on the couch one night early december, when he woke up at 3 am I had the entire house decorated for christmas.\n\nLuckily I managed to get better with shutting down the sleep-interrupting-anxiety that often comes with it, and like another poster I just really want to go for a wander outside or get some to-do items off the list.
3	I'm always more productive in the afternoon and tend to work until late in the evening.
2	yep, 1am = homework / creative time
2	Yep! For me it’s because everyone’s asleep and I can get in my creative zone without interruptions. I do all my writing from about 11pm- 4 am. 
2	my brain literally clouds over from the hours between 1pm-6pm... then at night it breathes a huge sigh of relief and kicks into gear lol. I think it's because of reduced stimulus as well as positive associations to the evening in the past. I used to hate school, and my brain would come alive to hobbies at night.\n\nI genuinely think that is the reason for me haha
1	It’s 3am, I took a sleeping pill two hours ago. I am so awake at night. I’ve always been like this. Night is my creative time to draw, sew, clean, reorganize, read, write, stretch, and so on. I’m not sure how I can channel my creative energy into a morning routine so I can get a real job. 
1	I just turned into the skid and landed a night job. Sometimes people will call in "sorry to wake you." Ha, don't you worry.
41	I'm a selfish INFP	I used to come in to work on my days off, hand out money (I gave a complete stranger $300 when she lost everything in a house fire), and a million other little things to make others happy. And do you know what? I never got any decent rewards for helping, and it left me drained. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt took me some years, but I realized that I can't set myself on fire to keep others warm, so I decided to become selfish. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n"But being selfish is mean!" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't have to be. It doesn't mean you have to dick people over – in fact, you can still help others – it means that you're putting yourself first, and making sure you're not bleeding before you use your bandages on someone else. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt can be a hard lesson, especially for INFPs, but I hope we can all realize this and become happier people. 
13	Baby, I don't want to set the world on fire. I just wanna set a fire in your heart.
11	This sounds like a pretty healthy mindset to me. Good for you. 
9	Yep, same here. My rule of thumb: be kind, help when you can, but always put yourself first. Because no one else will. It's not selfish, it's common sense if you ask me. 
6	Thank you for posting that. I was that person too, spending money on Christmas presents, or on a bunch of souvenirs during a trip like crazy and never got anything back.\n
4	I spent a large part of my life helping other people out, to never get anything back for it.\n\nIf anything, this will cause what I've heard others call "the doorslam", it's made me switch off people, stop friendships and stop many other things.\n\nPlease put yourself first, and while this is my own point of view,  if you don't see your own investment in someone else, paying off. then it's okay to walk. Always help where you can, but don't continue if they don't help you back, life is a two way street
3	One of our weaknesses, according to the 16 Personalities website, is being "too altruistic". Basically, INFPs will see ourselves as selfish bc we want to give so much. We think we're being selfish by doing simple things others consider taking care of yourself. So I don't think you're a selfish INFP, I think you're an enlightened one 
2	Learning to put self-care first was a huge turning point for me. I’ve realized that when I used to be overly “giving” it was often due to my codependent fear of people disliking me, which is selfish in a different way. Now that I’m not a doormat, most of my relationships are a lot healthier and more reciprocal. 
1	This makes me question my type.
1	yeah uhhhh\n\nseems pretty infj to me
3	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 22	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
6	So last night I was in a discord call with a (online) buddy of mine, we usually just play video games and don't have 'real conversations,' but he's kinda going through a rough time right now.  So I wanted to make sure everything was good with him.  We end up talking and having a one of the most real conversations that I've had in a long time.  \n\nFunnily enough, from the way he was speaking and describing things I had a feeling hes an INFP, so I quickly asked him to take the test on 16personalies.com.  and I know it's not the best way to determine a person's type, but I didn't want to dwell too long on it.  And it turns out he is an INFP, which I think is kinda cool.  A lot of my friends online I've discovered are INFP, and I seem to gravitate towards them.\n\nBut at the end of the call, (we talked until 3am), he said we should have real conversations more often.  And that I remind him of one of his closest friends (that he considers his brother), and I gotta say, that feels so good.  To hear somebody say that they actually want to talk more and that they value your conversations.
3	im not an infp but whatever\n\nhow often do you get those kinds of dreams where youre in the "real" world but somethings not quite right\n\nfor me its the lighting (like in the matrix movies) or in the sky, like how at 5 am the sky is eerily black, or at 4 pm the sky is a monotonous gray, but is darker than usual
1	[deleted]
51	Does anyone ever get so worn out by obligations and people that you just want to cry?	Like you just want to fall apart and hide from the world under the blankets until you're strong again?
23	Yes, I find people's expectations of me to be very suffocating often. I think that's why I often feel so worn out at the end of the day and need to put so much effort into recharging. 
13	God forbid I try\n\nTo do too much (socialize).\n\nI come crashing down.
5	Yeah, I love my family very much and I think I know I'm doing the right thing by sticking around (my dad is very ill). I know I'll regret it if I bail now.\n\nBut I also have moments where it's just like, "wow, why can't I just practice music for 5 hours straight and not have to talk to anybody? Then my real life can begin. This is so unfair."
5	A lot of the time this happens to me, often my housemates wonder why I don't talk to them, or avoid seeing them at all...\n\nIt's not their fault, but I just don't have it in me at the end of the day
2	You described it so perfectly that there's nothing more for me to say.
3	The last few weeks I was wondering why I was so drained. I realised that almost every day, I had things I was committed to like school, work, helping out with party planning, agreeing to go for work out classes, doctor’s appts, parties, meetings, etc... \n\nI know that it is very normal to do those things. Like no one else would bat an eyelid. Some may even say I’m being over dramatic but I believe that the reason I was so drained was because between those things I barely had any “me time”. \n\nYesterday was the last straw. So I called in sick today and feel so much more re-charged and being home alone feels amazing. I never actually ever truly believed I was very introverted (just shy and maybe ambiverted) but reflecting back, I definitely belong in this sub, introvertedness and all.
3	Strip your life down into necessities. Does something you do make you generally happy or unhappy? If it makes you unhappy get rid of it. Life's too short to embrace stuff that isn't good. Don't want to go to a gathering and want to stay home and read? Do it. Who cares if it changes your friend group or who counts on you? 
2	Yep. But I have to say this only happens nowadays if I’ve been pushing myself too much for too long. I’ve learnt to schedule in ‘me time’, setting boundaries, taking my needed solitude and rest without apologizing, and generally regularly checking how I feel and what I want/need. \n\nI’m great at putting others first, I feel selfish waaaay before I actually am. Understanding that has helped me feel ok when I hit the brakes and take care of myself.
2	I took on way too much this year and I don't want to put my relationships on the backburner because my friends are amazing people ahhh
11	I wrote a poem about Introversion. What do you guys think?	
19	My amazing ENFP friend	I invited a few friends to my house to talk and play some poker and I feel genuine happy againn, we had some great conversation at the my 3 friends left but my other friend stayed for a bit longer, he’s an ENFP but extremely extrovert, he can be so stupid and outrageous sometimes but now I had such a great conversation, i talked with him about life and about the one girl I like and I could spill out my emotions and thoughts in a long time, I listened a lot to what he had to say and I feel so grateful.\n\nSorry had to post this cause yeah. I’m pretty absent lately cause of my anxiety which leads to depression a lot and the fact that I’m INFP doesn’t make it any better but I worship these moments. These little moments. Everytime I see  a good friend of my it just lights me up. I have 5 good friends and one of them is my best friend cause I’ve known him for 15 years.\n\nOther people easily depress me cause they are so phony and maybe the reason why I enjoy being alone.\n\nSorry for the message, \nHave a nice evening :)\n
4	Yep, my best friend is ENFP too. It's like our types were made to be friends.
2	My two best friends are enfp I love them sooo much. They’re amazing friends for us :)
2	I'm an infp and I live with my brother who is an enfp. it's nice that we can tell each other everything and really be honest. the xNFP connection is strong
22	Did the test 3-4 times in different periods of my life.	I always was INFP.\n\nIdk who to tell other than y'all guys lol
3	Early 20s I got ENFP, now at 30 it's INFP. Wasn't surprised. I don't know if I'm glad of the change though. 
5	I was infj through high school and when I started college. I took the test again, 4 year since i last did, and I'm infp. A lot has happened. I lost my grandfather, was raped, was in an abusive relationship, until I moved across the country twice, and met my prince charming. I've learned i dont believe there is a god and do believe religion is the best government to control the most people while also being a great way of life for a few, and used weed for the first time. I discovered so many thought processes into psychology, philosophy, existentialism, and human origin and destiny. I learned happiness trumps capability, and happiness is my new life's pursuit.  Edit: my pursuit of happiness is through artistic endeavors and writing, esp. poetry but novels, too. 
2	Same. I think my first test was way more than 10 years ago and I was probably in primary school or something (I'm in college now). I re-did the test today. Always got INFP. I thought I had become somewhat more extroverted in the past few months, but I guess not that much! Love being an INFP, though. :) 
14	INFP anomaly	I’m an INFP that doesn’t really like books (more into visual story telling) or art museums. I’m mainly into music. Anyone else? 
4	Funny you mention it: I have a hard time getting into most fiction unless its short stories or possibly poems. Just hard for me to invest that much time/brainpower. It improves a little with books-on-tape. 
5	Art galleries are literally my favorite places to be on earth and I’m INFP
3	I’ve never been an avid reader. I do however watch way too much TV. 
3	It's cyclical for me. I like to explore new music but if my life is too hectic and goal-oriented, I think my senses do better with art and writing. Need a certain amount of idleness for good music to creep in.
3	Omg same. I’m more into music and films. I do love reading scripts though. But music is the one thing that allows my mind to run wild while also staying fully focused. Can’t get that feeling while reading fiction... I either get bored or I get lost too quickly in the story and start imagining things too different from it.
3	yes. but i don't subscribe to the whole peer group identity thing. do what you want and don't feel you need to belong because you don't need to. you might not even be INFP in the future let alone the next few hours.
2	im the same
2	Yeah I can't for the life of me stay focused while reading fiction, my mind just wanders. Graphic novels might be cool to get into, need those pictures :)
2	My friend is like you. He doesn't read at all unless required.
2	I cannot stand reading, movies and music for life. The other thing that always makes me laugh in the INFP description is being good at learning languages. I failed out of Spanish, dropped German and am currently struggling through Greek haha 
3	Anyone done the questionnaire about what Schemas you have?	Like apparently I don’t hate socialising because of just being introverted but because of all my other crazy which my psychologist is showing me through schema therapy and understanding the core beliefs I have had playing since I was a child (not good enough, a terrible person, don’t belong ect) and my coping mechanism is avoidance so when I can’t avoid somthing as per my preferred coping method it is very taxing emotionally and I’m so exhausted afterwards. \n\nApparently it’s somthing that can improve with therapy so I’m interested to see how things change if at all over the next year or so as I tackle this. 
1	Yes I have done it! And I've also done a little bit of schema therapy 
1	Which schemes did you get on the questionnaire? 
7	Anyone else experience this?	I have had a friend for close to 10 years, she was my closest confident and I trusted her more than anyone. Recently, she told me that we were never actually friends and that it was all fake. She has shown me many ways that she hates since this happened and now won't even talk to me. I fell like I'm missing my other half, and it hurts. \nI have started to feel empty. I don't act the same, I am barely keeping up with enough stuff to survive. I've stopped feeling. I just sit and feel empty. IDK why it hurts so much and I was wondering if any other infp friends have gone through this, how they felt and how to fix the situation or at least fix myself? I know you all have more experience in healing oneself than I do. 
5	I don't know why anyone would carry on a fake friendship for 10 years with enough authenticity to mean that much to you. You're either dealing with an absolutely insane level of personality disorder in this person or they did care for the friendship, but it somehow soured with time.\n\nEither way, you can't blame yourself for believing in it.\n\nI did have a long friendship sour and end very abruptly not long ago. And it did seem to trigger a personality shift. But I wasn't hurting as much as you seem to be, this friend wasn't a very good one, in the end.\n\nWhat got me past it was reaching out to a particular friend and exchanging a series of emails discussing every aspect of it. You can pm me for this if you like, but it would work better with someone who knows you.\n\nBest of luck and try to remember, she's spoiled a lot of joy from your last 10 years, you *must* find a way to stop her from spoiling any more.
2	[deleted]
1	 I’m so sorry. That is terrible. Remember that you deserve better and that we are here for you. I have not had this happen to me, but I know I would feel just like you do. Honestly whoever did this to you is a total jerk. Let me know if I can do anything to help you.
1	How did you not see that she/he was phony? I can see through fake people real easily and I always avoid them cause they depress me.
1	Friend breakups are really hard. That is very odd her her part. There must be more to that story.\n\nIf she is negative like that, maybe it was a good time to separate anyway because you don’t want someone toxic like that in your life. You will grow better now
908	Too relatable..	
64	This might be the most relatable image I’ve ever seen
52	That, or you make casual conversation with them and get a little bit crushed internally when they realistically don't immediately become your best friend that you hoped. \n\n(not saying you won't eventually become good friends after a lot of talking and getting to know each other, just that there's no telepathic, soulmate wavelength between you two. And maybe sometimes they drift away or don't have room for another friend in their life and you have to learn to be ok with that and try not to cry for days)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUgh, sometimes I wish it wasn't so much work and time to become close friends with someone you like, lol
33	Friend crushes r more painful than real crushes
23	True. I don't even know how i've got any friends in the first place, it's not like i have that many, but the thing is that sometimes, it just sorta happens and a bond is formed; and suddenly here i am talking and laughing with an unknown person, that later can most likely become a friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the wierd part is that i usually don't start a conversation with anyone (at least i try not to, unless of course, it's necesary) my main problem is that i don't want to bother anyone, because that's what i feel i'm doing by making contact with any person (which i know it isn't so, it's just an stupid idea). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point is that i can't seem to remember how i started to get along with someone, because of how i am. it's like my brain does this fast-forward kind of thing to the part when i already made a friend. Does this happen to anyone else??
10	At least I’ll have my crippling fear of rejection to always keep me company 💁‍♀️
7	Hit too close to home
6	This belongs on r/2infp4meirl
7	You just keep thinking that this is the most relatable post, but then other day one more relatable post comes up. 
6	I'll be anyone's friend! Just message me!!! 
6	I cringe at some of the few times I mustered the courage reach out to other artists I admired, it basically came out like PLZZZ BE MY FRIENNNDD
4	Yes!! I understand that I'm part of the problem I'm trying to deal with: I am afraid of interacting with other artists, hiding in my corner looking for fans to attract with my "style" and "skill." Reaching out is so difficult and many of them are too busy developing their craft anyway. I cannot help but lament on what I'm missing so badly and on the uncertainty that this feeling is felt by other artists. 
3	I’m in awe 
2	One time I was in a train and an artist was sitting in front of me. She took out her new sketchbook and started drawing and it took me, like, 15 minutes to come up with an idea on how to approach her. In the end, I just asked her if it's okay for her to show me the picture she's been drawing. She showed it to me and said it wasn't finished. We didn't really get into a conversation and I've been overthinking on how things could have gone different.
1	Was this planned? It looks as legitimate as it feels, but I am super sentimental about relatable situations.
1	Yesss!!!! But after that initial awkward phase, I think we would sync well. But the thing is I've never went past that phase.
1	Yes.
1	That’s my old history class lol
1	My life, right here
1	It did turn out well...shame that it's ONLY in MY HEAD
1	2 relatable 4 me
1	Get rid of the artists and people with similar interests and that's probably me.
1	just because I want to see the best in others and see the best in others doesn't mean I am seeing correctly. \n\nGiven human custom to disregard sentience, for instance in not caring about loss of millions of farmed animals' lives in disaster areas, if a relationship with a new person does not present an obvious advantage it would seem to be  a disadvantage.\n\nSo while some people may be cool and share some similar interests improving your relationship with them may not necessarily be an advantage for them...\n\nunfortunately, inclusion by community is not necessarily a high priority.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nit can be interesting how the dynamics work... how can we be so clueless, or lack the words and frame of reference to understand fundamental elements of social situations and dynamics.... widespread mental illness gets neglects for lack of popular expression and vocab... etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\na few celebs get worshiped while much of the world gets neglected... cult of personality is very much alive...
1	I reached out to one. Best decision of my life.
1	Omfg 
1	Shyness has nothing to do with introversion. I get that this is a joke and I'm being a fun hater, but it actually pisses me off a little. There are non-shy introverts and shy extroverts. \n\n
6	LAST POST REGARDING THE INFP	Okay; this is the 3rd (and hopefully) last post about an INFP I'm (16M ENFP) interested in. Here are the other 2 posts (if ur interested): [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/akuorw/tips_to_get_close_to_an_infp/) and [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/aqrv8k/help_with_an_infp/). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's what happened so far:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've begun falling for an INFP (16F). We've been friends for roughly 3 months rn, and I adore her. She's the nicest human I've ever met (no joking, me and one of our mutual friends joke around saying shes an angel). Im still unsure if she feels the same for me. We've know each other for 3 months and share music and comics a lot. She sometimes stares at me and we both often smile and wave at each other. But I didnt wanna scare her off\n\nI originally asked around this subreddit for advice, and the overwhelming response was; ur as ready as you'll ever be, just go and ask\n\n.\n\n(19/02/19) So a few days later (hey! guy needs to muster some courage!). I met her on the pretext of giving her the 'song sheet' (We usually share music and song names on pieces of paper, christened the 'song sheet'). Was supposed to confess to her face to face, and the direction of the conversation was going in the right direction... until her friends showed up and didnt leave :/ (Honestly, they REALLY dont get the message when you try and tell 'em to leave via glaring at them). Didnt want to make a scene in front of 'em (she hates that kinda shit) so I just backed away.\n\nThere was a saving grace tho; in the song sheet I wrote a lil poem in a code which we both know (Originally she was supposed to read it AFTER the confession, but to hell with that i guess.) It wasnt terribly original (Sarcasm 100), and certainly not my best work, but here it goes:\n\n>Roses are red,  \nViolets are blue.  \nIf I wasn't obvious enough:  \nI like you.\n\nAfter this I decided I'd confess to her, face-to-face, the first time I had a chance tomorrow. I didnt even know if she'd actually read the poem; we had a test the next day and I was sure she had better stuff to do than decode a cryptic poem.\n\n.\n\n(20/02/19) First met her during the small recess we had. Nothing was outta the blue, no red flags. She was with a friend, but smiles the moment we see each other. We talk a bit abt the test we had, and then ask her if we could meet up in the library at lunch. She readily agreed (to my surprise), but unfortunatly a teacher called us; she had something to discuss.\n\nTurns out we have a program to be scheduled on March 1st, and she wanted us, and a bunch of others to organize it, so we met up in the afternoon with the others. It was bog standard, but she kept glancing at me (idk if thats my imagination or not). At the end, and she approaches me. Turns out, she did read the poem. She didnt seem pissed or freaked out; she seemed more flattered than anything. We talked a bit more, she says dosnt know what to do, and then we leave (more detailed update on that day [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/aqrv8k/help_with_an_infp/))\n\n.\n\n(21/02/19) We couldnt really meet each other for most of the whole day; I had a bunch of exams and we both were busy organizing the whole thing. We did meet in the evening tho, albeit for a short while. She says she didnt know what she felt and thus we agreed to stay friends till then. She kept asking me "what did i expect from this?" (not in a condescending manner, she seemed shy and if my biased views to be trusted; she blushed). And what i told her was the truth "idk cuz honestly, my brain didnt think we'd get this far and is like "Now what?" ".\n\n.\n\nSo, now that we're all caught up, I ask ye: what do I do? Like I know what I want; I want to be in a relationship with her (Disclaimer: Not the stereotypical kind; my idea of a relationship is more intellectual, but Id take 2000 more words just to explain that), but how do I tell her that without making it sound like she has an obligation or something? I dont want to put her into an uncomfortable spot.
3	She already knows you dig her. Ask her on a date and full send your thoughts and ask her about hers. Good luck my man 
4	High school romance. Something I never had when I was a teenager.
53	Do you give off a serious, unemotional, and/or "robotic" vibe?	It seems that way for me on the outside, but I have a rich, vivid emotional world inside.  One person even asked half-jokingly: "did you ever cry at all?"...if only they knew my inner world
21	Yes.  I guess I just don't express my feelings.  I've been called a robot in the past...but I'm a writer, a poet, and a deep "feeler."  I guess none of that comes across, or I hide it.\n\nThe ironic thing is that when that person called me a robot, it hurt my feelings deeply and I almost cried on the spot.
11	Yep. Combined with resting bitch face. A lot of people tell me that they thought I hated them at first.
6	Yep. It's fun to say off the wall and creepy things to see how people react. 
6	That's a hard oof from me dawg.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWho else here tends to almost soley provide emotional support to others but when pressed for details on your emotional state you provide them with a blank stare and some lint?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe amount of insight into my emotional state that I've provided friends and family over the past year is less than what some people provide in an hour.
6	[deleted]
5	Yep, a lot. I know for a fact that many INFPs are confused with INTPs at first glance.
3	Good people who I’ve become friends with due to mutual interests, common values, and closer to my mbti type have said they got a good vibe from me when first meeting and wanted to pursue a friendship. Others such as work colleagues who are on another level and completely different mbti types have told me I seem autistic due to my monotone voice and lack of expression, I know I’m very apathetic but could be slightly autistic too. I don’t believe thats the case though, I just don’t have much interest in mundane topics like celebrities and Instagram “influencers” which is a ridiculously common topic in the office i work at, I think most people just really don’t “get us”
2	yeah get that alot but i think its due to my schizoid personality disorder 
2	I used to be appear more robotic before I got on antidepressants. Now, I can go from stoic expression to laughing like a maniac under 5 seconds, but it depends on the situation that is being presented at the moment.
2	Serious, arrogant, mysterious, impossible to read. I got those a lot when I was younger. Esp arrogant always cracked me up and wounded me at the same time, I was perfectly aware of all my insecurities and lack of self esteem. And if someone bothered to ask, I’d usually give a sincere and open answer. I didn’t feel like an enigma.\n\nNowadays people describe me as warm, kind, considerate and outgoing. When I say I’m an introvert these days people think I’m joking. It simply makes social interaction easier, and I’m less reserved and shy about sharing who I am within. \n\nIn that sense it all seems a bit like a trick. And in the end most people still don’t bother with what’s underneath. That’s fine tho, I have a few who do and I love figuring it out in others :). A lot of me still flies under the radar. Which is kind of peaceful, even if a bit lonely at times.
2	Work people and acquaintances likely find me remote and dry witted. I definitely chat a little but tend to stay on the fringe more often than not.\n\nI know some people like my family see me as...dour and self-serious? It brings out a teasing side I don't enjoy, I think I must have repressed a lot of my emotional reactions growing up with them.\n\nBut my closest friends know me as someone more vibrant and remarkable than I'd have ever dreamed. My boyfriend told me he most associates me with joy and wonder which is so lovely I could cry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for emotions and all that - I've never had a hard time crying over just about everything but mostly only a few people get to be in on that. I joke a lot and like to make just about everyone laugh.\n\nBut rage and frustration just gets pushed down to build up. Reacting to something with anger feels like being naked. I'll go to every length to avoid whatever is causing it. The really twisted part is that I only know how to be recognizably mad at people I'm most comfortable with because I'm not afraid to be that kind of naked with them and am motivated not to go the avoidance route. 
2	Oh absolutely. I've been told so many times that I'm cold or that it looks like I'm going to murder someone. I might if they keep telling me that. I'm kidding. Or maybe not. I'm kidding.\nAnyway, those who go past that usually realize that I open up a little more after a while and that it's just a facade. 
2	I feel I am much more cold, shallow, stupid, and loud than people think. In a way, it must be nice to give the impression you're a robot. You get to surprise people with a depth of feeling and a poet's heart.
1	I have had people telling me that I seem intense and serious. But that was rather a more professional setting. Not sure why that should be a problem. \n\nBut my friends from college have told me that I’m an intense person. I perceive myself as trying to figure life out and passionate/serious about what I pursue, etc. although I have chilled out more though, or at least I hope. 
1	i give off a pothead vibe, so I've been told.
1	A lot of people think I'm logical, but I'm pretty sure that's just a facade that I put up, I don't really give thought to other people's feelings if they were originally complaining about their situation, I don't care about your life if you complain often.\n\nbut if you come to me one on one and just casually talk about it, I will be more empathic about it.\n\nI most certainly have feelings but I often feel that people aren't on a strong enough emotional "level" for me to talk about it with them, and as such, I only tell my most trusted friends about my true feelings and thoughts, for fear that the trust will be betrayed if I don't have enough of that emotional "level"
1	Yes! According to Socionics, introverted thinking is the function INFPs use as a mask to interact with the world. This is why we seem a lot like INTPs especially to people who don't know us well
1	Yes, but not so much for closer friends. An exception was when I went to a concert with some closer friends and they asked me if I was really enjoying it because I wasn't really moving to the music but in fact I was crying for some parts of it 
11	The summer haze, beach balls, bouncy puppies, melting ice pops, sandal slaps, damp towels, moist decks, sweltering sands, bucket castles, tan babes, megaphone birds, roller coaster lines, chilli cheese fries, hookah nights, 4 head cyphs, and the classic nathan's hotdogs! Oh how I miss summer!	
1	A sense of wonder. Contemplation on Infinity, Eclecticism and Self-realization.	This is a short animation of a casual conversation between two friends where both get a moment of rapture. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4Dd55N\_mg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4Dd55N_mg0)
36	I love this place.	I used to be a depressed, shut-in teenager. Online communities once made up all of my socializing. Then I got better. Online communities lost their charm. I started hating them because they reminded me of my dark days.\n\nNow I see clear. Online communities have their virtues. In real life, it is not possible for like-minded people to share their minds in this way.\n\nThe Internet shouldn’t be all of your interaction with humans but it is beautiful that we will always have a place like this. It feels like a secret shelter. \n\nLet’s be excellent to each other.
6	Well said :)
5	I got some awesome responses when I last posted... here is a funny video I (INFP) made with my friend (ENFP), hope you like it! :)	
0	This was great! 
4	Anyone else have friends/family who are surprised that you are INFP?	Whenever I mention to folks who know about the MBTI that I am INFP, they are always so surprised. I come off as quite friendly and extroverted when you meet me; I have no trouble public speaking in front of large crowds (I'm talking 6,000+ audience) or making conversation; I'm charismatic; and I have held a lot of leadership positions where I managed teams of people in my undergrad & professional career.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe way I see it is this: making friends isn't hard for me -- but I just don't particularly have an interest in doing it that much. *Especially* if it's a situation where there are 10+ people in a room. Give me 2 people to have a solid and meaningful conversation with and I'm completely extroverted and engaged in the convo.... But if you put any more than 4 people, I freeze up and pretty much don't talk for the rest of the night. I enjoy going to parties on occasion but if had the choice to be alone, I'd gladly do that instead. I can have a good time at the pub with friends but the best part of my night (or at least, the part I look forward to) is walking home alone, listening to music and jamming with myself. I enjoy spending time with my friends and I'll entertain what they have to say or the dumb jokes they make, but I'm mostly very introspective and think very deeply and intensely about life when I'm alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess I'm asking because I see a lot of posts about INFPs being really shy and needing to be coerced into meeting others/having a good time/letting loose. I'm wondering if there are any INFPs on this forum who don't really fit into that category and their friends have reacted with surprise that you are INFP?
2	My mom is a true believer that I am an extrovert. I think it's a common misunderstanding among people around me, actually. I'm great at presentations, I like to perform (not alone but as a group), I don't mind speaking up in class, and I'm great with meeting new people (those who I'm probably never going to see again). But. I hate small talk and group chats - both online and offline. I just can't handle multiple ideas and jokes flying around! I get really lost, especially in group convos. And I desperately need time to recharge after whenever I've met anyone who's not me. So people mistaken me as an extrovert until they see me in a group of other people. Then they go, "Ohhhh you are an introvert". 
1	Yeah haha, my mom said I should retake the test because she “doesn’t see it” then after I did she just went “hmmm” 
15	I want to take a bath in lotion. Just a big fuckin tub full of lotion heated to an acceptable temperature. That’s all.	
6	sounds nice 
3	When will you do it?
1	It puts the lotion on it's skin..
1	http://www.bulkskincare.com has lotion for $26 a gallon. Or get bulk mineral oil ( 12-15$ a gallon) and mix it about 5 parts water to 4 parts oil, with some surfactant (maybe 5$ for a gallon). Assuming you can get it mixed, you're talking about 300$. That still sounds high. 
34	The only place i can feel to fit in is here in this group ❤ Thank you!	
9	Im loosing my patience and my interest in people. (I wasnt like this before)	Since the beggining of the new year i noticed that i keep loosing my need to meet people, and human contact in general. I have never been a very outgoing person, but i liked to hang out with my friends, and liked people in general.\n\nNow if someone speaks unnecessarily, i try to escape the situation as fast as i can, cause i feel like this meaningless shit is eating me alive.\n\nToday i sent best friend home from my house. (He always spoke a lot, and always been in my ass - he wants to meet at least 2-3 times a week - but now i just cant take it. You cant have a menaingful coversation if you meet avary fucking minute so mostly he speaks and i try to listen)\n\nThan my gradparents came, and they kept asking me to tell them whats going on with me. I almost lost my shit. I go to work, come home, and sleep. Thats whats up. What should i tell them? Im a smalltalk master really, but with people on the street it is just a few minutes, than i dissapear, but with my loved ones I just cant get involved in smalltalk anymore. They get angry or upset if i leave the coversation. (I just realized how much a smalltalk it is what we try to call meaningfull coversation)\n\nI need a cabin in a small town near the see, with no tourists, locals only, a fishing boat and thats all. Id fish and write my music all day. Would never return.\n\nSorry for the spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.
6	Hey bro, I think you just need to recharge yourself. A quick trip to the beach or the mountains probably will help you :D
2	Im almost the same way. Sometimes I just cant continuously talk/actively listen to close ones and I would feel annoyed/exhausted if I try to force myself, even to loved ones. I find it easier to be in a group of friends/family so they could talk amongst each other and have alot of the social burden lifted off of me. \n\nI would also have moments where I could not stand people talking to me whatsoever, and go into my "hermit" mode where I dont talk to anyone unless absolutely necessary. It usually subsides after a few weeks, and I feel energized to socialize again. Just take some time to yourself and charge your batteries!
1	holy shit this is me, and only since a couple of months just like you. Lately, even talking to people online or text is boring to me now, I'm just sick of people and their lives. 
1	Yup. Same here. I'm realizing more and more that I don't want to be around people. I work full time, but outside of that- it's all me time. And it's beautiful :)
10	Dealing with emotions? I can't be the only one who'll think about things so much it ruins my day. Or showing too much emotion towards someone who needs space?	So I rambled a bit yesterday or the day before, I dunno, days just kinda blend together. But I suppose what I really wanted to know is how you guys deal with this kind of stuff. I don't do it super often but there's times where I'll just assume the worst, like in my previous post that I was boring and not entertaining on this vacation and it'd feel like the other person had wasted their time spending it with me. Like I care about her a lot, I'd say my feelings are definitely far past just *liking* the person and could be bordering on another L word but I'm still unsure. Not that it really matters, she knows how I feel and that while I'd be thrilled if something happened she's been a great friend and has helped me deal with a lot of things since we've met, and it's funny because one of my other friends said "I like her cause she's made you a better person." Anyway that's not even kind of the point I don't think. I just know I worry so much about actually talking to them about things that bother me or why I assumed that because I don't want them to be upset. So what do you guys do about this, do you go distract yourself with something? Do you have some specific thing you do to clear your head? What about if you can't and it gets to you while you're at work or something and can't really get away to find some place to clear your head?\n\nThe second part I guess is, I think I'm either not emotional or too emotional, there doesn't really seem to be an inbetween. I come off as an asshole or as someone who'll do anything for you and in all honesty I like I think it's mostly the former but I'm certain it's probably more the second. I think one of the first things she told me was I sounded just like a big teddy bear, or one of those caramel M&Ms, hard on the outside but gooey on the inside and I think that fits. But I have trouble giving space, because I worry a lot and when I care about someone knowing they hurt feels awful and I end up repeating myself saying I'm there or whatever if things are needed at all. So, I guess it kinda ties back into the first thing and how do you keep your thoughts from running away with you? \n\nAlthough, it could just be worrying that things are being kept and pent up because I don't know how to deal with them myself very well and figure an outlet for them would be good or maybe that's dumb. I dunno. If any of you lovely people have any words of wisdom I'd love to hear them because I'm worried I'll just keep doing this same dumb stuff and push this person I care so much about away entirely.
2	i can't offer you any advice but i saw no one replied and i felt bad. so just wanted to say i read your post and i can relate very strongly. i hope things get better for you soon.
48	Happiness = Twosome	When alone (1): 😴🙄🙁\nIn a group (3+): 🤐😒😤\nWith someone (2): 😀🤗😇\n\nIf there's one thing I've understood as a 26yo INFP male, it's this - nothing makes my mind more relaxed as being in a "twosome" (1+1=2).\n\nIt can be me and my parent, friend, teacher, colleague etc. as long as he/she is the only one.\nOnce there's a 3rd party (2+X=group), it gets competitive and the conversations are no longer deep. It's like everyone suddenly has a social mask on.\n\nWhen I understood this, I began looking for such opportunities everywhere. \n\nHere are some examples:\n\n- instead of going to a crowded gym, I invite a friend for a 10km walk;\n- instead of asking questions during a lecture, I schedule a private meeting with the professor;\n- instead of joining the team at work, I look for a colleague who's usually eating lunch alone and ask if I can join him/her today.\n\nIt works like a charm. It's better than games, food, books, movies, alcohol or any other eacapism substance/method. \n\nThere's only one thing to remember - ask & listen more than talk.\n\nYou'll be surprised how many people crave someone who's willing to listen to their thoughts and stories. If you do so, you'll make the day better for someone else and, as a result, you'll feel meaningful (translation for INFPs: happy).\n\nIn short, I truly believe "a twosome a day keeps the sadness away". Maybe you should give it a try too 🙂
7	I also love the opportunity for deep, meaningful conversation 1 on 1. \n\nBut, I hate being trapped with a person I didn’t choose. Which seems to happen to me regularly. 
3	Nah. I agree but the “twosome” for me also includes three and foursome 🤪. When it gets bigger than a small group it I have the same as you\nBut with 2/3 friends I can also have meaningful conversations etc
3	Honestly, yes. I really like just 1-on-1 socialization. It's the easiest for me to do, and the most rewarding, imo.
2	This is pretty accurate to what I do subconsciously - especially the work lunches. I can remember being as young as 10 and hating having a third friend invited for playdates because it always made me jealous that they seemed to like each other more when really I was just losing the thread of conversation on that level. \n\nThat said I think we infp's have great capacity to work well in small groups of people with connection and/or shared interest but...maybe not to that same level of relaxed-mind as in a good duo. \n\nAnd just thinking back now to some of the better two-person hang outs I've had recently .. those turned into really great, energetic days :O I cleaned, answered texts, and was generally a more functional-than-usual kind of human.  \n\nGreat post, I'm going to make more of a point of this now. 
1	So true. 
1	out of interest, are there any personality types you feel you particulary bond well with in a twosome? if not, then intro/extrovert preference?
7	DAE find it difficult to downvote?	I notice that whenever I go to downvote poor content, I immediately scroll down for about 2 seconds before rushing to scroll back up and un-downvote. I justify to myself that they won't get my upvote for their content, but I can't feel comfortable with leaving my downvote there.\n\nI often imagine them being someone I know, who might not be internet savvy and may not know it's a repost, and I imagine them excited to share with other people - I often imagine them as my Dad or something, and feel guilty about making them feel negative about sharing.\n\nAnyone else?
5	I almost always post earnestly, and get hurt when downvoted especially when there's no explanation, so I never downvote.
3	I only downvote when someone is terrible. Like if they’re racist or rude. So in that case, I don’t feel bad, they know what they did. 
1	A lot of them are bots.
0	no I'm a reddit user, it's in my DNA to downvote for no reason and with little care how the original poster might feel!
113	Man, this resonates.	
3	Yesssss!
2	I should be good at that then
2	Persona.
6	Just got rejected	My first time to ask a girl, my first rejection.\n\nIt was polite, civil, and calm. But still painful and hard.\n\nShe's a coworker, I want to move my desk for a while so that I don't see her and get feelings again.
15	Bro you should be proud of yourself, you had the guts and the bravery to ask her; now your mind is in peace.
3	It doesn’t have to be awkward. Be proud of yourself! You actually said something, and that’s a good thing!! 
3	Relish in the negative. 
3	You now know that you will be okay after rejection. So you will have more confidence in the future. Good luck. :)\n
2	 Awesome job finding the courage to do that. I’m sure you will feel better about the rejection soon. You’re a champion just for trying. 
2	Proud of you for sending it. But the meme is real, sometimes it be like that. 
2	I'm proud of you, you had the guts to find out. I have no worries for your future, you can take risks when it's worth it and somehow it will pay off, don't ever blame yourself for "failing". High five !
1	It's fine. In fact, I've been to the same situation. I've been hurting for months (probably until now). I've realized when she turned me down, I already lost the idea of us and then things get slowly back to normal. She even uses the situation that she knew that someone can support her emotionally and now I'm giving advices to her like nothing happened. 
152	I had a Viking burial for this little bumble bee I named Boderik, it was a majestic farewell 🌻🐝	
13	R.I.P Boderik\nMay his soul rest in peace in heaven
5	Did you set him on fire and push him out onto the water?
4	R.I.P. Brave Boderick fuzzy fellow, I'm cry. I'm also the 69th upvote. 👍
4	pOor ItTlE bUmBlE wHy DiD yOu LeAvE sO sOoN? tHe WoRlD nEeDs MoRe BuMbLeS.

1	Its not in the water tho
7	I am thinking of sending this message to my best friend who is upset at me but I’m not sure if I come off crazy	Please give me your honest thoughts. Is this too long winded and intense? My best friend is upset at me due to complicate reasons. We were long distance but had somewhat of an intimate component to our ‘friendship’ that felt romantic at times. However my main motive is just for him to feel comfortable being my best friend again because he truly was mine. \n\nAlso if it helps, I think he is an ENTJ.\n\nThe message is as follows:\n\nNo matter how physically far you were, you always felt so close. Human emotions are volatile, but human bonds are hard to break. We are more than our emotional reactions. I don’t want to lose something I know is real to such fleeting forces. \n\nI know I hurt you and it has become ingrained in my soul’s purpose never to hurt you again, nor to expend energy on those who don’t deserve it. I’m hurting because I’m afraid I’ve lost my best friend. Lately I’ve been looking at the bigger picture. We are so much more than two physical bodies, a brief fling, or a complicated friendship. We are souls that are here to learn from each other, grow, and heal the world through our inner healing. We have both helped each other in different ways and I know we can continue being that for each other despite this hiccup. I know this isn’t a comfortable discussion but no growth can occur from a place of comfort. We can get past this. I just need you to believe in me like I believe in us. 
6	Lol this sounds exactly like something I would write. I say send it! Don’t hide how you genuinely feel. I know I’ve made that mistake before. I used to be afraid of coming off too intense, but then I realized, where’s the shame in feeling so deeply? :) You got this.
4	It's beautiful. If he loves you for your true self he won't read it as crazy or dramatic. Send it.
4	Trying to figure out a career I would like.	Hi, I'm and INFP and kinda just stuck right now in life. Everyone's like "ohhhhh, you'll be fine, you have plenty of time to decide your career" but I don't really want to have to wait any longer. I wanna figure it out. Therefore, I am enlisting you guys to help me out. I'm not really artsy like most INFP's and can't sing, draw, or play instruments. I like playing video games, animals, and baking. Strangely enough, I love working with a small amount of co-workers that I'm close enough to be social too. I've always wanted to help people, although sometimes I see people being mean to each other and all the hate in the world and I kinda wonder if I can even do anything. I'm kinda worn out of helping people lately though, because I usually get used, drained, or something goes wrong. I keep looking at all these jobs and nothing catches my attention. I used to want to join the military and work my way towards being an 18 delta but I'm just too sensitive and not "together" enough for that. I miss knowing what to do, and having a purpose though. Right now I just feel almost empty inside. In conclusion, what do you guys think I would like, what do you guys do that you like, and do you guys have any advice. Thanks a lot! All advice welcome!
3	Nobody can tell you what to like. \n\nDo what you’re interested in. Get good at what you’re doing. If you don’t see it working out for you in the future, then pursue another interest and repeat. Choosing one career path is not necessarily a must. \n\nI’ve been an audio engineer, videographer, photographer, coffee roaster and now pursuing a degree in psychology and teaching myself programming.  I’m Literally jumping around all over the board. But I’m following my interest and allowing it to take me to wherever it takes me. \n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: I also wanted to join the military but I knew I would be too rebellious to survive in that environment. 
2	Why not work in a bakery? Usually small # of employees, helping people by bringing the temporary joy of eating desserts to every customer changing their day from bad to good, and you already enjoy it.
1	Take a holland career code test. You'll get a 3 letter code with applicable jobs :)
2	School Never Ceases to Kill my Productivity (somewhat of a rant)	Even just doing 2 college courses currently and that's it... Whenever I have to do school work it drains my energy way faster than working on my own projects. 4 hours of school work in a day will leave me with no energy and no motivation while when I work on things I actually care about and WANT to do I can go for 10+ hours a day no problem. (At least I have my bff named caffiene LMAO) My issue is since I am only doing 2 classes at a time it'll take me 2ish more years to graduate. If i did full time I could make it out in 1. But to do that, I would have to give up on every dream I've been working toward making reality, but fvck that I'd rather go through 2 years of something I hate and that absolutely drains me and be able to somewhat keep working towards my dreams than give up everything I am to be able to get a piece of paper in one year. Not gonna give up or give in for anything time to fvcking do this 💪 Not gonna let a few unsupportive people in my life hold me back no more, I don't need anyones permission to go make the world a better place. And to anyone who doesn't have anyone or very many people supporting them... I am here and this subreddit of likeminded people are here. Go do your thing!\n\nP.S wow my purpose of writing this completely morphed halfway thru xD It is nice to let my thoughts and feelings out sometimes and this subreddit is one of my fav places for this :)
2	I feel your pain, only I can't blame college alone because I had so much going on when I started.  Too long of a story for now and my phone is not cooperating. .  . .but I do need to share some similar frustration in hopes of some good feedback.\n\n
6	Communication and conflict	Hi r/INFP! INFJ here, looking for some advice/insight. My long-distance boyfriend of 2 years usually classifies himself as an INFP/INFJ. For the most part, we get along fantastically. One wa in which we differ is how to communicate when we are upset. I understand that people may need time to process their feelings/thoughts after a relationally significant event (I hesitate to say fight because we don't fight or even argue in the traditional sense; if I express even the slightest bit of hurt/anger/annoyance towards him, I get silence.) Afterwards, I usually take anywhere from an hour to a day or so to process my feelings/thoughts before I'm ready to talk about the issue and move on. My boyfriend processes differently - he takes days, sometimes an entire week, before he's ready to talk to me again. He ignores any attempt I have to contact him (1-2 phone calls or texts/day), even if I'm the one apologizing. As we are in a long-distance relationship, a week of silence, especially when I'm not ready or anticipating it, is bordering on ridiculous. I feel like a single person in a relationship and it's really draining and hurtful. But I can't express that, or else he'll just hide from me again.\n\nI know that MBTI can only help so much in a situation like this. I guess what I'm trying to ask is how to approach talking about topics of conflict with INFPs. Thus far, any time I've tried to engage with him with open-ended questions, I'm met with "I don't know" or stonewalling. (I've sent him a couple articles on stonewalling before and he agreed that we needed couples therapy or mentoring of some sort but nothing on that has moved.) I have a rule that once I break up with someone, I will never again get into a relationship with that person. I'm trying to avoid taking such drastic measures with him, but the lack of communication is really stressing me out. \n\nThanks for listening and for any advice you might have.
1	This really helped me understand my INFJ husband. https://youtu.be/08tc-PMhZMY\n\nSorry if the link doesn't work, I'm on mobile. 
1	I'll be the first to say that this is me to a T\n\nif my SO ever shouts or anything like that, I'll simply just be quiet, I don't really know how to respond or even how to make sense, like it makes sense, but I always feel like something has been lost in translation or perhaps something that I have misunderstood, and I'm always scared to ask if there was something if I misunderstood, because often the SO will be angrier that I misunderstood. \n\nSo he may be viewing it like that, my default thing to do if a personal issue is to occur is that I will bury my head in the sand (metaphorically) and ignore the situation until I feel I have gathered enough mental & emotional energy to deal with the situation.\n\nThe "I don't know" is definitely him trying to give you a response, but he isn't ready to deal with the issue yet.\n\nIn this situation, I would still care about my SO, but me saying "I don't know" and not replying much, is a call to be left alone to think and process (without actually saying that).\n\nI hope I have helped\n\n
1	Hi there. INFP male here. In my previous relationship, we got the same issue. I tend to avoid the issue like not talking to her for days. I feel like dealing the issue in the moment would just make it worse. It also doesn't help when I starting to throwing that doesn't make sense to her and sometimes I could overwhelm her with all of the problems I can bring up from the pst. After everything had settled down, I'll be back and apologize for whatever reason it was. 
7	Serial Experiments Lain	I just finished this anime and holy crap is it good. I remember seeing a few episodes 20 years ago and loved it - finally hunted down the rest of them. It hits all the right notes for me. It's on YT and Funimation. It also has the best opening track.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9kYAEyVjEY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9kYAEyVjEY)
5	No matter where you go, everyones connected.
5	Yeah, Lain OP is quite good. Lets all love Lain
374	Here we go..	
7	This is pretty true :) INFPs should stick together and guide each other through :)
3	Ok I actually lol'd at this one :D
3	This is my reaction whenever I see a person struggling. Most accurate, well memed sir or madam. 
2	 not really; i just freak out a lot
1	Hahahaha.. this one got me.
1	Are you me?
1	So far it's been every winter in college for me, we'll see where it goes from here. 
1	Everyday of my life bruh
4	Empathic frequencies, follow and read news with caution	Reading Google news and now I'm over overwhelmed with sadness, despair, and low energy...its as if the disgusting within the stpries shared by the news media has rubbed onto me. I dont read the news or watch news often becausr of this.a\nAnyone, experience Hi- Fi over the written word?
2	I've very carefully curated my front page here on Reddit for this very reason. Some subs seem to thrive on tragedy and horror. I get infected with it so quickly.
38	Went on a date with another INFP	We went for coffee during a huge snow storm and it felt so cozy, just being around her was warmth enough for me. \nWe ended up talking for what felt like hours, but it was only about 45mins.\n\nI invited her to my work, which is a cocktail bar.\nI had to do a photoshoot for my coworker, and after a few drinks we ended up kissing and getting more in depth about our interests and what she was most looking forward to if this progresses.\nThe future is bright.\n\nAll I have to say about tonight is that it was worth the leap of faith I took. Being so vulnerable yet so comfortable.\nI know it’s a rare feeling with our types but the fact we felt so passionate about one another made me incredibly hopeful for a new and meaningful relationship.\n
8	Wish I had the balls you have.. been in love with this girl but don’t know how to ask her and where and what.. 
7	I’ve been involved a little over a month with a girl now who tested as INFP on the free tests. The more time I’m with her the more certain I am that she is INFP. we’re incredible together. We’re thinking the same weird and cute things all the time, have so many things we both really enjoy doing and we’re so comfortable in each other’s presence that all insecurities disappear and we can just feel each other without words. It’s magic. I’ve wanted to find another INFP for a while and kind of lucked out with her.\n\nYou have to be diligent with communication though. Because it’s instinct for both of you to bottle things up and not say what’s on your mind. Don’t do this. Address things quickly, you’ll both understand. And if you feel it say it. You’ll fall for each other fast.
584	Aahhhh...	
33	This is me right now actually 
31	*when you take the headphones out and the music starts playing out of the speaker and you have a panic attack thinking people will hear it and silently judge you*
16	Just know the grimy "reality" is mostly the vibe of the place and the emotions of the people around you - what you can call the matrix. As a sensitive person you can be in a public restroom, look in the mirror, and feel like shit, thinking it's all you... when it's more the reflection of the limitations mainstream society is steeped in.\n\nIt's not about escaping reality, but realizing what most consider reality is actually a limited and incomplete version - and not buy into it. So put your headphones on if necessary, and learn to derive your sense of self, the "reality", from within. \n
8	TOO REAL. I also almost feel the same way when I see intimate moments ^(that fuel if not restore my hope/faith in the world/humanity) in some of my favorite TV shows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n^(P.S. I cracked at this when I saw at at 2:32 am where I'm from. Reminds me of why I love this sub so much. Thank you, fellow INFPs! :))
7	Fucking ouch........Though at the same time this is why this sub is so great.
6	Oh dang, there are others? Maybe I'm not such an oddling.
5	I relate to this so much. I constantly wear headphones when I’m out in public because I can’t deal with it, I need to be in my own head. 
3	Thought I was in r/emo for a sec 
3	how can I upvote this more??

2	Hello yes I love it mann
2	This is the fuking truth!!!! 
2	Me on the bus during my last acid comedown
1	Are INFPs just naturally inclined to being maladaptive daydreamers?! 
1	 ✅  I'm in this photo and I don't like it.
1	Can INFP and INFJ relationship really work?	I am an INFP female but super analyze things which probably made my SO --- INFJ male confused. He's probably the greatest person I've met in years but we're both avoidant in nature I presume. \n\nIf you'd had any experience with one, would love to hear your take on it and what can be improved for future conflicts.\n\n
3	I’ve been married to an infp, ai’m and infj, almost 15 years so i think that just that proves this i can work.
5	Any artists here who have successfully sold work?	I could use some advice/tips. I'm in my 30's and I do oil paintings, I have been told I have talent and could make money by selling. However, I'm very introverted, I'm not business minded and I absolutely hate hustling/being a salesperson. \n\nIs there any hope for me? How do I even get started?
5	start an instagram for your art, go to trade shows 
3	I’m an INFP and I started a little art/woodworking shop on Etsy! It’s a nice little side gig I started after graduating high school. I know absolutely nothing business related or marketing related, but Etsy does all the work for you! You should definitely look into it.
2	IxTP here and I really enjoy surreal pencil sketching. I got involved with my local EDM community on fb and started posting some of my work to my personal page. One of the DJ's of the community contacted me one day and asked if I could do a piece of his children. That was my very first commission, and I've now done a few other commissions since then :)
2	I met someone who organizes expositions a few years ago (I actively looked for it), we clicked (because I pissed her off and she liked that) and she had me expose my art. I didn't need to be here and she did the selling, so that was great. And it was free for me since I was a "new talent" as she put it. Amazing woman!\n\nNow I'm a graphic designer and I launched my website last month. My clients count has skyrocketed, just by having people share the link on facebook (I didn't even ask for it, which is great). \n\nSo yeah, post your art online, personal website, instagram or both (I would go for a website) and share the link! \n\nQuick tip since you're not a salesperson, think about your prices beforehand (don't undersale!!) and stick to it. 
1	Singed Horns	I burn and burn\n\nToss and turning\n\nI've had to much think.\n\nTyping to my therapist, better solutions\n\nBut here we are eating hepatocytes\n\nI'll give you something to cry about,\n\nYou never tell me to smile!\n\nI'm just reaching for the next plateau\n\nCharred crystals kissing ashes flying off\n\nSoulless and inebriated\n\nYou might have convinced me yet,\n\nRed, undead and seductive as ever.\n\nThey may have been fooled but, me I'm sure\n\nOtherwise here he has died and goodbye\n\nAs real as time, you don't exist.
1	>I"ve had too much to think.\n\nPriceless. 
3	INFP Themed Story	Surrealism I wrote for creative writing 2. Its supposed to be a reference to the darker aspects of an INFP when things go wrong for them. Lmk what y'all think!\n\n\n                                    The Cell\n      Awaking once more, the man noted what he's known his life to be. The name tag on his shirt, though faded and nearly unintelligible after all the years spent in this cell, read Seamus. Seamus felt this name to be disused and tasteless though. He only truly knew himself as the jumble of characters “INFP-013”. This was what he had been christened by the facility, as the characters were neatly engraved into his door. He assumed they were engraved on the outside too, as the guards referred to him this way as well. “INFP-013”. Just another set of data in the system, of no particular importance. He lost his name, not just his name, but himself during this eternity. This eternity spent in an endless cycle. Waking, breathing, sleeping. Blinking the exhaustion from his eyes, he drew in a long breath, tasting the heavy, stale, metallic air. The mornings were his favorite. At least, what he thought was morning. They were the only time when he was too senseless and deaf to the constant screams of madness, the dull thuds of heavy guard boots upon hard concrete. He studied his surrounding, as is routine. He examined the padded walls, the drawings upon them which he was creator of, and yet tortured him more than anything the others could do to him. He drew out everything he longed for, hoping that the images alone could distract him from his misery. All of the images meant something to him, but none more than the radiant sun. Oh, how he longed for the light to grace his life. "They're only pictures." He said, turning away. "The world is not such a beatiful place." As he turned, he noticed, today is not like other days. Today is different. \n\n      The two foot iron door started to slowly open, with a drawn out creak, like an old gate opening to unwelcome guests. Stepping forward tentatively, he pushed it lightly, this gate, widening the aperture to an unknown world. However, he was fearful. He hasn't been outside his cage in this life he's living over and over again. He was fearful of the screams of the others, the dull thuds of the heavy guard boots upon hard concrete. His cage means safety, comfort. However, mustering all his will and courage, he stepped outside. \n\n      As soon as he cleared the door, the fault in this masterful trap, it slammed shut with a thunderous boom. He left his comfort for curiosity, and in doing so took away his chance to stay in. Away from whatever awaits him outside. At the sound of the door slamming shut, the screams started again. Oh God, the screams. They pierced the very air, quickly growing louder and more constant as others exponentially joined the maddening chorus until they were just a jumble of high pitched notes, searing into the mans very soul. His breathing grew rapid, and he collapsed to the ground, rolling into a ball, covering his ears, anything to block out the dreadful noise. Why did he step out of his safety, his comfort? If he hadn't stepped out, this wouldn't be happening! He should've just stayed inside, where he knew what's meant to be, and what his life consists of... Listening to the screams, but not being a part of them... Hearing, but not feeling, or engaging, just listening... Standing up, he yelled into the echoing hall, "Shut up! Shut up, God damn it! Just let me be myself and do what I want!" Hearing his voice echo through the lengthy tunnel, he was pleased when the screams ceased all together, leaving him alone with the silence. He traveled on.\n\n      Walking down the sterile hallway, he noted the blankness of it all. It wasn't the colorful, sunny world he thought was outside his cell. It was a sterile smelling tunnel, white everywhere with tiled ceilings and floors. The only light was emitted by flickering yellow ceiling lights, hanging from the ceiling, each ten feet apart from the last, leaving the hall light, but also dark. Doors led to worlds of other men, trapped with themselves like he was. He wanted to help them out, but knew that even if they wanted to come out because he thought it was good for them, he still wouldn't be able to. He didn't know how to open the door to their worlds. \n\n      His surroundings began to change. Finally, he was almost out of the daunting hallway. He saw a larger room ahead of him. However, just as he opened the door to this new land, alarms sounded. Others knew that he was starting to come out of the shell he made for himself. Thinking fast, he threw himself into what looked like a broom closet. This new world he created, where only he exists, and only he matters. No ones else needs to know him, and thats how he wants it to be. He doesn't want the others to see him, to interrogate him again. Listening, he heard the heavy guard boots upon hard concrete rush past the closet, and stepping out of the shell he created once more,INFP-013 opened up the door.\n\n      Walking through the door to the great room, he noted how much nicer it looks than his old world. It had flowers, beautiful pictures lining the walls, the beauty an assault on his sight, and he reveled in it. At that moment however, his eyes began to burn. As they adjusted, he saw what he always wanted. Sunlight. The sheer, beautiful, sunlight, offering it's warmth and protection in exchange for his love. As he stumbled to the exit of his nightmare, he began to realize it was worth it, leaving his shell. The screams couldn't harm him, the men in their cells had to find themselves their own ways out, and the guards couldn't lock him up again. He was free. Stumbling through the light, he cried at the beauty in front of him. However, it was too much for him to handle. Too bright. The sheer pressure of being out in the open like that crushed Seamus, and he crumpled to the ground. His tears of happiness turned to tears of fear as he was hit by the anxiety of being outside. After what felt like hours, though it most likely was only a couple minutes, his consciousness fled. \n\n      Once more, he awoke in his cell. He knew he hadn't dreamt the light though. The light was just as real as the pain of it's rejection. He knew the light could never truly love him, for he was never truly free. He built his cell, and only he can free himself from his cell. This shell he made inside himself, around his heart. This heart that felt so much pain, that it couldn't have anymore. So, it locked itself away from the others. They, who hurt it over and over, unrelentlessly. He couldn't trust them. He could only keep his heart away from them, not letting them see who he is, how much he hurts, how much he longs for love without pain. This, this is the cell INFP made for himself. The cell he stays in so he doesn't have to feel love or friendship. This is the cell he locked himself away in, longing for the key he hid from himself.\n

2	I love it! The attention to detail is superb. 
2	Beautiful

17	Wanting to fly away	Never liked the idea of being confined to generally one area, and spending the rest of my life with an S.O / corporate job / house. Never have I moved *once* in my entire life, and neither have I traveled around extensively, though, I believe my chance to fly will present itself in the near future.\n\nI'm feeling like a bird with it's wings having been removed from birth; cursed to waddle around. To only imagine what it might be like to soar through the free skies.\n\nAfter I regrow my wings, and set out for adventure, I don't plan on settling down...... at least until I'm physically unable to do so.  I will not volitionally return to that place of mud and muck (stagnation).\n\nThe next frontier is outer space, and sadly,  I'm not sure we'll live to see the day where spaceships or comparable vehicular machines will be issued out like cars are to this day. If that were the case..... I would be long gone from here; probably hopping from planet to planet until I die or until the spaceship breaks down.\n\nThere's so many mysteries to be solved, many questions to be answered, many areas to be seen, but it just doesn't seem very accessible; at least currently. The only thing I can do here is daydream about such adventures, or visualize how I might go about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
4	I like how you think. I always daydream about what it would feel like to walk on mars or the moon. Be so cool to see earth getting smaller and smaller as the space ship goes deeper out into outer space. And just leave all my worries and fears on earth
2	Damn, this reads like something that I could have written! \n\nAnyways, regarding moving around: I highly recommend it! I caught the travel bug after I enlisted, and have been moving fairly regularly for almost a decade now, even moreso after my contract ended. It's now rare for me to be somewhere for more than six months, and I've seen basically all of the US at this point (still need to get the Great Lakes, though). \n\nThe best way I've found to keep moving is through seasonal work by using sites like Coolworks and just applying like crazy until someone bites. I'll be returning to Alaska this summer to an entirely new place running day-long tours. There's all kinds of work too, whether you want to try being a ranch hand, tour guide, cook, deckhand on a cruise ship, receptionist, office assistant, pilot, whatever—it's all out there! Hopefully after this guide season I'll be getting an English teaching certificate so I can teach overseas and start bouncing from country to country, or at least move to different schools within the same country so I can see more parts of wherever I have my Visa for.\n\nKinda got long, but I hope this helps! Feel free to shoot me a message if you have specific questions :)

7	I jouska very often then lol
4	the dictionary of obscure sorrows\n\n[http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/](http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/)
4	Lachesism. I often think about that.
3	Sonder is the most common for me.
2	Oh cool. I only know altschmerz, came across the word years ago and related to it so much.
2	Altschmerz everyday.
2	Ah german is just the best language for describing feelings. Mauerbauertraurigkeit (litetally: wall builder sadness) und Altschmerz (old pain) 
1	I'm so confused. 
1	Wow I finally have a word for these things. Sonder, opia, kenopsia, jouska, ellipsism, onism, altschmerz I can relate to the most.
1	Ahh exulansis! Sadly that’s the one I identify with a while lot. I’m also working on my altschmerz. Nice post :)
1	I have a really bad case of mauerbauertraurigkeit. It's been months, and I'm still not able to answer to a friend.
1	Sonder be hitting hard 
1	J O U S K A
1	Ugh this makes me feel so many things
16	Mixing up dreams and reality?	Anyone else have dreams (day dream or sleep dream) and when you come back think it's totally real or like you had a conversation and bring it up later but it turns out it was just one of your dreams and then there's like a shattering moment where reality hits you\n???
3	There are very many experiences and memories I’ve had in my life where I can’t figure out if they were dreams or not. Mostly when I was a kid for sure, everything is really hazy. 
2	This definitely happened a lot more in high school for me!  That “waking up” moment was so surreal and awful. I remember feeling like I was somehow lying to myself. And conversations with friends would get all jumbled up. I still have really vivid dreams, but I’m not confusing it nearly as much with reality. 
1	I have that from my childhood, not sure if some memories are dreams and vise versa. Also on rare occasion I will wake up from a dreadful dream (where I killed someone for example) and be so grateful that it was just a dream, because it felt so so real. 
8	Day job	I know, I know, another job related post, lol. \nRight now I am at job hunting. Kinda.\nI apply and  .... hope they won't choose me, what a sick mind pattern is that 😂\nHated every single job I had and don't quite fit in corporate world, but you know, I have to eat something.\n\nHow did you find yours and how you guys get by?
3	Hate it. Yesterday my boss tried to coerce me into something by threatening to fire me if I didn’t. I’ve been daydreaming about making him deliver on his promise ever since.

5	Who would you guys consider the "God Father" of the INFP personality type?	I have heard the two being either Mr. Rogers or Kurt Cobain? Those two seem so different, but off stage do you thing they probably acted similar? What even are the true personality type of Mr. Rogers and Kurt Cobain?
7	J.R.R. Tolkien 
2	I'm gonna throw Bjork in. Seems like she full on embraced the "weirdness".

42	Infp playlist!	Hi guys! I made a post asking y’all to list some of your favorite songs. Only a few people replied but I wanted to make another post because I made a Spotify playlist. Here’s the link: https://open.spotify.com/user/1216342918/playlist/2hqX1JLgGGIFu8VnE6sbkk?si=Lm1todzhQaawwIj4JZvrQw\n\nI added everyone’s songs who replied, but I made it collaborative so if anyone has Spotify and wants to listen/add a few of their own favorites go for it! All I ask is that you don’t make it to where it’s alllllll your songs. \n\nSo far it’s really random and interesting to hear for me :)\n\nThese are my contributions:\nLady lamb-Crane your neck\nThe shins- caring is creepy\nFleet foxes- blue spotted tail\nJohnny cash- Sunday morning coming down\nModest mouse- bankrupt on selling \nLed Zeppelin- no quarter\nPink Floyd-shine on you crazy diamond \nMr. Gnome- vampires\nNeutral milk hotel- gardenhead/leave me alone\nPortugal. The man- waiter\nCocoRosie- lemonade\n\nHappy listening ❤️\n\nEdit: guys I got off work and there so many songs added :) thank you so much for contributing! I listened on my drive home and haven’t stopped and I am freaking loving it. I’m getting soo much new music! We have good taste ;) this will be my go to playlist for a while 
5	Added some beach house songs, hope y’all like them
4	Really cool idea, hope you like the songs I added!
3	Added a couple a little while ago!
2	Awesome, I added a couple of songs too. :D
2	Added a song by Bear's Den and another by CHVRCHES
1	Also filled it a bit :)
1	Gonna add some songs, enjoy ! 
1	Cool! Added some songs I think you guys would like :)
1	Admittedly, I put off responding to this because it overwhelmed me for some reason earlier. I just love so much music, and I'm not good with spotify. Instead over continuing to overthink it, I'm just going to link the last song I listened to:\n\nThem Bones - Alice in Chains [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTuD8k3JvxQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTuD8k3JvxQ)
1	This is a great idea definitely gonna have to give it a listen! 
1	I love this! I added a couple of songs as well :) excited to listen to all of your additions as well.  Hope you guys like them. Ahhh
1	Love this. Thanks for sharing. I think instead of adding allllll the INFP music I've found over the years, I'll just share this old thing again. Here's a similar thing I made and posted a few years ago for any who may be interested: [https://open.spotify.com/user/1248294346/playlist/3C6MjlTPCyeP4XotKkEeVI?si=yv3uMIkpQ5-ayNn9x58XYQ](https://open.spotify.com/user/1248294346/playlist/3C6MjlTPCyeP4XotKkEeVI?si=yv3uMIkpQ5-ayNn9x58XYQ)
1	Car Radio by Twenty One Pilots
1	Neck Deep - Dont wait\n\nADTR - end of me
1	I know it’s kind of late, but I just added some songs! Hopefully I didn’t add too many lol
1	finally got around to adding some songs! i love sharing music with people! 😄
7	Can you tell I’m an INFP by looking at my instagram?	
3	Yeah, I can tell by the name.
3	Totally. You seem awesome 🌟
3	You are a great photographer! So many beautiful pictures of nature. 
2	Yes I’d say so
5	Positivity problem?	So I am a positive and happy person but lots of my friends act like the world is ending when I am genuinely happy?? But other friends freak out when I show my sad because they always see the Happy face or when I express my sad they tell me to stop because the normies will get upset and I'm annoying and complain too much but I'm just saying the things that my brain relate to the situation?!?
22	Fantasizing about death	So I know this is a little depressing/morbid but does anybody think about dying and all the possible ways you'll go? It's always something I've thought about myself and didn't know if it was common with others similar to me. \n
12	YES! I don't remember a day when i didn't think about my own death or just death in general. It always freaks me out how it can literally just happen at any given moment. Is life just some kind of weird simulation and when you die you're actually just waking up in the "real" world? 
4	From time to time I’ll romanticize death, I usually don’t talk about it because I don’t want anyone thinking I’m suicidal and I don’t want to scare them. But I think about people that have died as heros or martyrs and think about how cool it would be to die in some grand and meaningful way like that. 
4	I usually do this in front of some of my closer friends actually, they'll start talking about something that could kill you (e.g. electrocution) and I'll just say something like "oh yeah, that's how I wanna go really", which usually gets a a funny reaction, but I do actually consider it every now and again as to how it would be to die like that
3	No. For most of my life I've had a strong existential anxiety and particularly a very strong fear of death after a very unfortunate experiment i did, when i was 8 years ago. I tried to imagine/feel how being dead would feel like. I closed my eyes, covered my ears and focused on this silent darkness and that i can't do nothing to escape or end this feeling. This "experiment" ended with a very intense panic attack, from which I then concluded, that this is what death would feel like - an endless panic attack. For almost almost 20 years this crippling fear of death (and panic attacks) haunted and restricted my life, eventually resulting in a complete burnout and sort-of a nervous breakdown. But thankfully, with the help of therapy i was able to work with these fears and eventually change my perception of death and accept it as a normal part of life. And the "key" factor, that has helped me to accept death is, that i am (hopefully) not gonna be feeling/experiencing it. Like, for example, world has been populated by people for thousands of years before i was born, and yet all that time has not have any impression on me, because i didn't experienced it. Or every time i go to sleep, i "switch off" for 7 or 8 hours and i have almost no experience of that time.  I used to spend so much time fearing death and trying to keep myself safe, that once i accepted death and the uncertainty of when it will come, i choose solely focus on life. 
3	Fantasizing about dying of a terminal illness and all the sad and fun things I would do while still alive ✔️\n\nFantasizing about taking my own life and how it would or would not  affect people I care about ✔️\n\nFantasizing about dying too soon before I accomplish something great in life but not even remotely trying to accomplish anything great  ✔️\n
2	yes often
2	Absolutely. I've fantasized about my own death many times. Usually, its when I'm very depressed but sometimes even when I'm not. How people would react, what my funeral would be like, etc. 
1	I used to, when I was more dark and depressed. Now life's just better and I like living. Death is just what it is. 🤷‍♀️
1	Yes, a sweet temptation of death that allow one to escape from this world. The temptations is never too far from my thoughts.
5	Based on what I've seen here so far, this seems like the kind of humor a lot of you would also appreciate	
3	Thanks I gotta clear my YouTube history now
3	3 dudes and a dog running all together on the grass cause they're not gay
11	As a male(45) infp, I can totally relate to this song. One of my absolute favorites	
30	When people fake their feelings (Slytherin INFP here)	
7	Also a Slytherin INFP. The sound of ingenuine tears makes my skin crawl. 
7	I'm a Ravenclaw INFP, even if Hufflepuff has a good percentage
5	Another Slytherin INFP. I feel like I have found my tribe.
3	I've been called a Hufflepuff, but I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan so I don't know. 
3	Slytherin INFP! I used to be Gryffindor for many years, until a few years ago when I switched sides. Heh. 
2	Hahahhhh love thisss! So many infp Slytherins woow! I would never assume that combination..griffindor entj here✌🏻
46	I just want to thank you all. I haven't felt this "normal" and accepted in God knows how long	I've always felt so weird and isolated. Talking to you all and hearing about our shared experiences just really is uplifting to me. If makes me feel less alone and on a different wavelength than everyone. I normally don't get to be so authentically me without getting some weird comments or looks. 
9	Welcome to the circle, friend. You're still fucked up, but you're not fucked up alone
5	Cool. I feel ya. People give me weird looks too. It's good to know I'm not the only one.
4	We’re all weird together here. And no ones alone.
7	INFP Homes - Creating a Comforting Haven	Tell me the things you keep around in your home that make you feel cozy and safe. I’m moving back home with my husband after a year separation and I’ve loved having my own place. I’ve been recovering from PTSD and MDD and having a safe place *just for me* is indispensable to my sanity. We agreed to transform our unutilized dining room to be my space. I’ve got a single closet sized pantry for storage and a small corner bar area and one standard sized window. I’d love to use it for relaxing with a book or my crochet/knitting, artwork, etc. \n\nI’m pretty lost when starting projects these days. My emotional and mental health issues cause everything to become terribly overwhelming so help from fellow INFPs would be greatly appreciated during this time :-)
4	Do not make a safe space specifically for a safe space. When you are feeling bad you need to talk to people you trust.  Creating that safe space will just worsen the underlying problems you have because you will just run to them whenever any adversity hits you. I recommend being outside somewhere where there is a lot of nature whenever extra stress hits you. I believe in you.
2	I like to have a little place to curl up with pillows and blankets, like a comfy chair or couch/futon. I have a diffuser in my room, and also a night light that projects aurora patterns on the ceiling. These make a nice atmosphere. Candles, strings of lights. Lighting makes all the difference. Having colors that make me happy is great. Plants are lovely! Being surrounded by hobby stuff where I can see and grab it is nice. Books, knitting stuff, art supplies. A good little desk to do things at is good. Playing music to put in the mood you want to be in helps. Also, I think it's important to keep your space at a level of tidiness/messiness that you are comfortable with. I get too overwhelmed if it's messy, but if it's overly tidy it's not as fun. I may have gotten carried away here, but I love daydreaming about cozy spaces! :)
2	One of the things I have in my room that helps give me a peace of mind is a sunset on a beach tapestry. It's so beautiful! \nIf you're interested in buying one i got mine from this website https://www.dresslily.com/tag/nature-tapestry.html?lkid=1559746&gclid=CjwKCAiAkrTjBRAoEiwAXpf9Cc7Ry1WlKZ7QZJQRSKNrwv6iNFM23yhYCoXuifOLCH6V0f-6I2eTbxoCqkYQAvD_BwE \n\nGood quality. Good prices. Shipping is kinda slow tho. I promise you won't regret getting one! 
21	Thoughts on this?	
4	I meditate every day. It does wonders for my mental health, but takes practice. 
4	I used to meditate but not so much anymore. \n\nDifferent perceptions are like dimensions or world's to the awareness. I notice when I go to sleep or if I study a topic or religion intensively my awareness will get caught up in that specific dimension / perception for awhile. \n\nI think there is no wrong or right perception but it's hard to be open minded because the awareness gets stuck in perceptions and experience points. \n\nI tried focusing on being pure awareness but you can't control when the peace comes. It comes randomly or not at all. And being open to perceptions and ideas sounds great but it makes the mind and heart very lonely. \n\nThis is just my opinion / experience with awareness and perception. \n\nHope that helps. Good luck. 
3	Probably simultaneously the words INFP live by while needing others to remind them of at times.
3	Yes. 
2	I struggle with meditation, I don't want to focus on my own thoughts, that's what gets me down in the first place! It works for some but for me I just end up thinking about all the justifiable ressons why I feel awful. I do enjoy the spiritual aspect and reflection of life Buddhism and Thich talks about. He has a very relaxing voice.
0	Uhh it's got fucked up grammar?
59	I got so caught up in my own thoughts this morning I got ready for work on auto pilot and didn't notice it was 4:45 am until I got to the car	Now I'm listening to Frank Zappa music until I'm SUPPOSED to leave at 6:30 am. 
15	I feel like I’m zoned out for the majority of every day lol.
4	Done it when i was a teen, just noticed the time while at the door waiting for my mother to take me to school, and she was still asleep.  \n\n\nBack to bed in school clothing.
3	Ain't dissociation great?????
3	I've had couple of moments where i intended to brush my teeth, but ended up putting water to boil for coffee. And other way around :D
2	I try to control zoning out when on my own by checking the time periodically and keeping close track of what I'm currently doing. It's hard.
2	“Why Does it Hurt When I Pee?” is a classic.
877	Haha 😂	
32	there are no comments so here is one
23	I laughed and became socially exhausted.
6	Yes! Anyone else go in these cycles of a couple months of doing as little as possible after a couple weeks of doing stuff with people involved lol?
6	Can I steal this and put it on r/INTP?
2	Pretty much lol
2	Ahh the best feeling ever 😍
2	❤
2	lol more like “me, recharging for one Thursday night after going out for six months” for me
2	Me after running a small errand in the city. Or after the full moon. Or after eating a red beet forgetting I'm sensitive to it.
1	WHERE IS THE BODY!!!???
0	This stuffs fake
20	Do you do this too?	I have to touch every soft-looking and/or fuzzy thing I see at the store. I have no impulse control for this lol 
3	SAME. It's so hard when someone I don't know is wearing something that seems amazing to touch. Don't wanna be creepy. Must. Control. Urge.
3	I used to be like this real bad as a kid. Not so much anymore. Probably because I was scolded to not touch stuff so much haha.
3	Yes, me too. Loving all the sequins on things lately too! 
2	No fuzzy soft things. However... i have this habit of fiddling something small with my fingers. For last couple of years i have few plastic sport bottle opener's, that i like to play with. I put them on their back on the table and then cradle them with my fingers :D
1	Buttons on electronics. I HAVE TO.
1	Fabric stores are the best !!! Touch all of the textures 
1	The weird thing is that I just read this thread while I was touching a fluffy pillow xD
1	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 21	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
3	Always thought I was very odd in the way I was thinking and going about things. I was never truly bothered by it, but felt that lonelyness because of my conviction that I was the only one who had these traits that no one really understood. Not in a way in which I felt better than other people but just different. And somehow I always have this returning depression phase (where I think I lost the essence of myself and that I am an absolute failure in everything I do and did) in which I revisit every moment when I was not happy abour my actions. This can really turn into a rabbithole that you fall into. (But generally I am a happy person)\n\nAnyways it was kind of therapeutic to learn that generally there is a described charactertype like this that not only I seem to have. It is nice to just have the possibility, that somehow, around the world, there are people who understand you deeply. Thats very comforting.\n\nHow did you feel when you discovered you were this type and were you able to understand youself better because of it?\n(Well...that got a bit long.)
2	Had awesome date yesterday with Infp.  It's just so comfortable. 
1	Reminder to myself: this feeling, too, shall pass. \n\nI hope whoever is reading this is being reminded of the temporary nature of everything - but in a good way, if it makes sense. 
1	Thank goodness I don't display percentage of upvotes to downvotes on posts. The anxiety of seeing my own posts and their percentages would crush me.
1	So I've been binging some Parks and Recreation and I'm at S06E13 where Chris and Ann moved out of Pawnee to start with their new life as a family.\n\nI'M CRYING. 😭
1	I have the opposite of a writer's block.. I have a few ideas for a story but too am too lazy. *The spirit is willing but the body is weak..*
12	Historic photos are amazing	Do you also love seeing photos/paintings of how a city- or landscape used to look like? I love old photos and comparing them to how it looks now. I also love seeing traces of were a road was or where a wall used to stand. Often I also miss how it looked bc I’m not very fond of the boring architecture nowadays, only me??
5	I especially love seeing videos from the early 1900s and seeing how much people have changed since then. Everyone looked so elegant and had a completely different way of speaking. It’s so cool that old photographs and videos exist so that we’re able to experience times before we were even alive. 
3	I’d recommend following r/historyporn it’s one of my favorite subreddits and I think you’d enjoy it as well. I really enjoy looking at how things have changed 
3	Nice, i also really enjoy going to historical places in the local area, especially industrial stuff as i find it the coolest. I think i romanticize history a bit too much, even weird mundane stuff i keep hold of and marvel at. I found a coca-cola can from the 1970's and kept it even though its just trash, just find it amazing though that a can of coke has outlived me by several decades. As you said, i can spend hours going researching and pouring over historical photos of my area, just find it interesting really. Glad to know this is an infp thing and not just a me thing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease don't think i'm crazy :)
7	Where do INFP’s find happiness?	Where do you find your happiness? 
15	I simply find happiness in music and nice conversations. How about you?
9	I find mine in music, being alone and playing video games that I find inspiring.
5	I like trees and when my cat shows me her belly and pictures of my family.
3	Deep relationships with people, music, breaking rules and thrill seeking. 
2	[deleted]
2	In freedom of choosing, how i want to perceive/live my life. Choosing to be happy.
2	In the opportunities I have and the people in my life. \n\nSometimes when I’m driving down the highway by myself with all the windows down and my music blasting I get this pure, deep feeling of being completely and utterly at peace and content. I also feel like that in open fields. Can you tell I’m an English lit person? Lol. 
2	1. Food. Oh to have endless stomach and endless food!\n2. Affection with a loved one\n3. Experiencing flow while doing meaningful work\n4. Happy music\n5. Connecting with a random stranger
1	If I can be somewhere scenic or looking at photographs I've taken which hold memories, put on a little bit of Debussy's Nocturne.. I drift off into a daydream trance. Find beauty where it's to be found, you know? 
1	Music, namely film score and orchestra
1	Spending time with my dog outside 
1	Being in love and feeling loved and spending time with that person. Also enjoy time in nature observing everything. And being creative. Visiting a new place and exploring it. 
1	I'm extremely close with what few friends I have. I want to pour all of myself into them. 
1	Inside oneself.
1	Cute animal videos. Specifically whales, sloths and bats. 
1	Being content in the moment. Like enjoying the sun, walking the dogs and them being obedient and sweet, the joy of being alive and feeling all there is to feel. 
13	Documenting your life	Don't you guys have the feeling that you want to document your life? I always am so interested in my ancestors and what it looked like back then. Hearing about my grandpa and his stories of when he was a kid in the 1930's and 1940's I want to be able to have more personal experience of the past. I think I'm gonna start vlogging, taking pictures, saving music playlists and write about my life a lot more. Saving pictures of my childhood, sports, school, college, best friends and more will be included. When I am old I will want to show my loved ones a lot more of my life that they couldn't see. I also just started a daily journal.
3	yeah but then I realize I am no one of importance and no one would care about it.
2	I personally think social media is a great way to document your daily life. I'm certain historians in the future will see our posts and create a large catalog of everything and link it up to each person. However, I do I have personal recordings where I just ramble about life. Might not be of any interest towards my decendants, but idc.
2	I have done this in perhaps a slightly more abstract way, by writing music. Even though all of my stuff is instrumental it documents how/what/why I was feeling and thinking at various points in my life. For me the things I created are like little snapshots back to my previous self. It may not be as literal as a photograph but it’s no less potent. 
2	when i was a kid i loved the idea that when youre dead you will one more time watch your life like a movie in realtime.
52	Anyone else feel like they romanticize sadness too much?	
15	i only feel like i'm toughly me when i'm sad..   \ni think way more and understand who i am  \nlike happy me is a fake me 
12	Sadness is when we're most reflective on life I think. I have poetry in my head when I'm sad, it disappears when I'm feeling better and I miss it a little. 
7	>  **romanticize suicide**\n\nFTFY :\^)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
5	This is definitely an INFP thing. Even when everything is fine and I'm happy I need to find something to be sad about haha. Not in the 'woe is me' sense, but that feeling of melancholy that kinda makes me who I am. It fuels my creativity and inner world. 
1	I love anything that is in angst/melodrama genre. I'm generally a happy person but I need something to make me feel really sad.\n\n
1	I just realized how unhealthy it is to ruminate on my emotions lately. It's been a habit to listen to sad music all the time since high school, but every since my worsened mood, I decided to make a happy playlist for the first time.
1	I think this comic artist (Christine Marie Comics) recently summed it up pretty succinctly: https://www.instagram.com/p/BtclDZBF0wg/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1n4yzuza8tkes\n\nTl:dr - saddens itself is not beautiful, but opens you up to beautiful things 
1	maybe
1	Too much? Sadness is awesome.
1	I don’t get sad.
147	maladaptive daydreaming anyone?	
6	Me. But it isn't nice, i'm doing it, because real life is shitty, thats real addiction and makes me totally asocial.
5	I like this, have a orange arrow
7	I know this place, I spent my whole teenage life there.
10	Dangerous, unhealthy, addictive and not to be encouraged. You will lose years of your life to it.
5	Yes, extremely familiar with this. It’s such an awful way to live and it really sneaks into your life in such an innocuous way at first. Once you know it’s a problem it’s far too easy to slip away into fantasy to avoid that truth. I haven’t had a significant problem with this in several years but I remember the large chunks of days I’d miss because of it. It also led to me having a crippling avoidance coping method which has led to some life altering, terrible mental and emotional health problems. What a nightmare.
3	Props for the song reference
2	There must be a reason we’re all dreamers think it makes the best poets,novelists,filmmakers,artists etc.\n\nGlad to be a daydreamer,we the people of spirit.
1	ME :(
1	i dont know what any of you are talking about
2	any infps with the same issue?	are there any INFPs in a relationship with an INTP and know how to help me out?\n\nhey guys!! i’m an INFP female and my INTP male seems closed off. yesterday he asked me about my past intimate experiences with men before him, and he seemed fine then. it was like nothing. but i talked today with him and he actually brought it up again out of nowhere. he said “just so you know, please don’t ever talk about the other people you’ve had sex with again. it was like the worse thing to hear” and i can’t even explain how badly i felt. i had NO IDEA he cared that much and i know you guys hide your feelings so much so i should’ve just assumed instead of just cold reading what i thought he was feeling. please help, how do i get through to him that none of the other guys mean anything to me because i’ve never loved anyone before him? how do i make sure that fully resonates with him? thank you guys!!! 
5	Here's what I think happened:\n\nI think he regrets asking the question, but wasn't quite sure how to say that. Like maybe he thought he could handle it at first but it turns out he can't. \n\nI would say that all you can really do is just tell him that the past doesn't matter, because he's more important to you than any of that. Maybe let him know that you would never intentionally hurt him, and say that you'll be sure not to bring it up again. That being said, if he asks for info. like this again and back-tracks, you'll need to have a conversation about that behavior. It isn't healthy when repeated regularly. 
37	Me and my bf (both INFPs) made a sock puppet music video for a love song he wrote	
4	I wish I had a socket puppet, I mean boyfriend, I mean girlfriend. D: \n\nVery cool, made me smile.
4	Cuteness overload, brain about to melt, must go kill a critter to rebalance the universe out lol joking. This's amazing!*😁
3	All in one take! Very impressive. \nJk. This is the cutest, I love it. Also I love this language so much. Reminded me to take a course next semester. Wish you two all the best.
3	Great song! 💜🦄🐯💜🦄🐯
3	I LOVE IT, SO CUTE! And the song is adorable too even if I don't know what the words mean. Hope you have a wonderful day 😊
11	Someone ground me please	My imagination and fantasy way of thinking is in overdrive at the moment. The only freedom I have from it is when I’m feeling melancholic instead. \n\nI’ve just started dating and find myself fantasizing over people. I get carried away and read into things far too deeply, imagining all the possibilities with said person. This way of thinking is also applying itself to ideas around employment and my future too. \n\nAnyone got any advice to help stay grounded when this way of thinking takes over? 
9	Get ducking rejected, you will never want to fantasize again.\nI have an automatic. NO - voice in my head each time I'm dreaming about that shit.
6	There’s nothing wrong with dreaming, as long as you recognize that you’re dreaming. The problems will arise when you start finding disappointment where things don’t work out as you have dreamt them to. \nLet your head be in the clouds, shoot for the stars, if you will. But remember that real people come with real problems, and real circumstances come with real difficulties.\nOn the flip side, don’t let the problems throw you to the other end of your dreaming. Where you only see the worst of everything and everyone.\n\nBe real, be happy, and never stop dreaming. 
2	Same problem. I'm happy with my choices but I keep imagining other possibilities out of the ones I've made.\nI bet we INFPs would be the best movie directors😂\n\nIn some cases we should force us to use our inferior function (extraverted thinking) if it doesn't come by itself
7	I feel worthless	My life is a mess. My parents are abusive. My social anxiety is ruining my life and I have no friends.\n\n I feel worthless. Any self help books that's gonna help figure my self out and change my life please?
2	If your parents are abusive then you need to escape somehow. Start to devise a plan. Find someone who can help you.
2	My parents aren't really abusive but they aren't great either. I feel the same on everything else though. You aren't worthless for realizing things aren't going well. That only makes you aware. I'm planning on doing a self help book haul and hoping to find a path towards a fulfilling life.\n\nMy list:\n-The subtle art of not giving a f*ck \n-Emotional first aid: healing, rejection, guilt, failure and other everyday hurts\n-101 secrets for your twenties\n\nI hope you perservere through this, it's tough but something needs to be done.
2	Check out Thus Spoke Zarathustra
3	I mean this sincerely, I would read the Bible. As an INFP all too aware of life's disappointments, I've found its the only system of belief that can explain why life is both so difficult but such a gift. Knowing that God knows the purpose of my life-- and that it has one--is the greatest source of peace for me. \n\n1st Peter is a good, short place to start. Would love to talk to you more about it if you want! 
1	I don't know if it will help but Introvert Power by Laurie Hilgoe PhD helped me a lot. Even so, I feel wiped out today. Some days are just like that. 
1	I binge paranormal docs and do cooking experiments. Self help doesn't help me, I find it keeps my mindset in the same place.\n
1	I’m guessing a good place to start is with attachment styles. I used to feel/be similar to you, and learning about how I attach to others helped me create healthy relationships and deal with the childhood abuse. Here’s a [book](https://www.amazon.ca/Attached-Science-Attachment-Find-Keep/dp/1585429139) to consider. Hugs... you are definitely not worthless.
1	It's easy to entrap yourself in the thoughts you're not worth much because of others. Take time for yourself. What is it you like to do or get out of life? As an INFP you must have some longing desire or interest. I didn't think I had any until one day (with the help of prescriptions) I decided I won't allow my doubts to win over me. It's a beautiful but short life, nobody will remember the stuff you  think holds you back. 
1	If you want to talk with someone... feel free I guess. 
1	Self-help books? Lord knows I've perused plenty, but none come to mind. Sorry to hear that snippet of your situation. Can I offer some suggestions? (I'mma do it anyway)\n\nJournal everyday. Map out your emotional state. Lay out as many perspectives as you can imagine on the why's, what's, and how's of your life. \n\nGo out and explore your town/ city. Be by yourself in nature and wander as you wonder. Try a new hiking route every week or every other week or every month, whatever you can manage.\n\nTreat yourself and talk to yourself like you would another person (who you love, respect, and admire). \n\nPractice being mindful of all the beauty and joy there is in the world. Doing so does not detract from being aware and conscientious of the injustice and ugliness there is. Practice letting the awareness of both coexist.\n\nGood luck and cheers!
1	I am currently 30, and have loving parents, a great job and good friends, yet it seems like there is something missing. It's feels like drowning and I just can't feel happy no matter what I do. I now believe that some people are just born sad and I am one of them....
3	Maybe...	...world isn't this perfect, complete, simple, efficient and optimal place in which i could never really find my place and always felt lacking and falling behind it with my countless faults, oddities and imperfections and with this strong fear, that i could "ruin, broke it"? But instead world is a flawed, faulty, f*cked up sh*thole with injustice, inequity, deceit, contradictions, narrow-mindedness and  countless lack-off's. And i am just trying to preserve myself and resist from being sucked into this wasteful, gear-grinding madness. Trying to survive, which i think is pretty normal and adequate thing to do?
3	I am literally you. I speak to a therapist and he was showing me these two different yin-yang type of symbols and telling me I’m trying to be right in a world that is so wrong.. and he told me I need to learn to navigate this world with the way it is. 
2	I think no one else can understand  the things that we have to undergo just to survive in this world.... 
10	After doing this and actually reading about INFP I feel like I'm not just crazy, maybe just a little crazy.	So I recently got back from a vacation, a week spent with my best friend who I realized I have much more than a crush on but that's not exactly the point. Or maybe it is because this is kind of about how I have zero idea what I'm feeling and why. I'm not even sure if this is just me ranting to get it out or trying to get some feedback on exactly why I feel this way.\n\nI realized I can talk much easier through messages/texts than in person even there being comfortable with them it didn't come all that easily. Sure conversation seemed fine and it was exciting to hear about all the things they had to say and explaining everything we saw or went to do. I also loved listening to them talk or vent or whatever, it made me feel like I was doing something good because I don't care much for most people but with them I'd do whatever I could to help. Though being as independent as they are I've got a hard time just stepping back and leaving things at "If you need anything I'm here for you," and find myself worrying quite a bit. \n\nI also found myself worried about being boring, there are obviously other people in the world but I just seemed to want all the attention because I guess it's not something I'm used to getting and loved the times I got it. Which lead to over thinking and daydreaming about what could be and what could've been. Then realizing over the last couple of days that it's all in my head and I would in fact have to go home after one of the most fun weeks I've had despite occasionally trying to hide away cause emotions were taking over and I knew nothing was happening going into things but between being a dreamer like I seem to understand is what this whole personality type thing is and genuinely enjoying time with someone I care about I couldn't help myself. \n\nI ended up getting down at times because I was overthinking and in my head about whether or not any of this was enjoyable for them and if I was just a pain being there. Withdrawing and not knowing what to say or do and have an awful hard time saying anything about it. Though I suppose I'm not really sure of being moody at times is common. Though I suppose it did get brought up and talked about some, though through messages rather than words cause they for some reason put up with me being dumb and unable to actually speak but at least able to write.\n\nBeing spontaneous and just kind of going with the flow of what we'd be doing day to day was fun, or maybe it was because I was just really happy to get to just unwind for a while and just being around her made me smile. Not that they don't make me laugh plenty or smile when I see something from them but still. I suppose I know what I want, or what I would really like to happen but know it's just a pipe dream it's awful hard to get out of my head. \n\nSo I suppose if I really need to ask a question is how do you guys deal with all these emotions? And is it really common to get in your own head and screw up your evening and stuff, and if so is there a way to get out of it? I'm bad at vocalizing and worry saying things just makes stuff worse but if there's any way to help deal with that kind of stuff I'm all ears. I'm sick of worrying. Also sorry for the rant and rambling, but getting it out was nice. Also thank god they doesn't know my actual reddit username, or come here since her personality type is different and I know she visits that one so I'll just guess I'm safe although I told her I just took it and was infp, so if not um, hi and you're the best!
2	I always find it funny that we all just rant post about how we feel then realize that we’re just ranting. \nBe in touch with your feelings, enjoy your life, think about things but try not to just live only in your head, and tell your friend how you feel. Speaking from experience, you’ll regret it if you don’t. \nHave a good one friend :) 
11	Regreting having guts.	Thing aren't going well since i moved back at mom and grandma's place.  \n\n\nsince i could not get a job, i am supposed to "help" at home. Help is my entire mornings and when they want it afternoons doing home stuff, and cooking.  \nI already have trouble focusing on my stuff, and sometimes i wake up excited,  thinking about some project and can't do shit since i have to help. Or when i am focused doing something in the nighttime and can't give myself fully to it because the dishes should be clean by 8:30 or i'll listen my mother talking endlessly.  \n\n\nOver time their requests are becoming more stressfull, and i am getting close to a bloiling point. At home me and grandma try to keep on our own because mom's got "the nerves", but i also have to keep myself at check at all times since my grandmother is really conservative.   \n\n\nThing is, came to mom asking if they could forget my existence for a week. Got too anxious to say the rest of it, and just got a crude "okay". She only do that when pissed.  \n\n\nNow i am afraid of having hurt her. Crying a bit since i was supposed to be the one who helps them. But when i am at their chores, i am afraid of losing my future one clean dish at a time. Fuck, i have a degree, just need to focus on my shit for some time and get my portfolio ready, but i have to spend too long time chewing my emotions of all the little things that happen at home.  \n\n\nShit, i don't even know what i want by posting this. Advices? Blurping it all out? IDK. Don't even need to reply.
5	I just moved out of a situation like that! \nIt is really trying. I did eventually loose my shit! \n\nIt's going to be better later! Just right now it's going to be hard. 
3	Keep applying for work. \n\nRemember that you would have to do these chores for yourself if you were living alone anyway. Dishes, cooking, cleaning, so just remember that.\n\nContinue to apply for work. It’s a numbers game.
2	You are not indebted to someone else beyond what you think you owe them.\n\nIf the situation is life and death, then it could be better to go along with it. Otherwise, you can afford to take some time to yourself at least once in a while.\n\nIt's easy to be taken advantage of by anyone if they make you think you owe them favors. The only real favors you owe to anyone are the ones you know will have the most dire consequences.
1	Any good spoken word musicians?	
3	I like hotel books
1	The rest of their songs aren't like this, but you might like this song by Nada Surf - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gdc6PcwHTE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gdc6PcwHTE)

5	Does anyone else ever think they'd be great at standup comedy?	
7	Yes, I know I would, my crippling fear of public speaking says otherwise, but other than that, yes, I'd be really good.
4	Yes, but only to the right crowd. I think my humor can be a little too out there and weird for some people. 
3	I can't watch a comedy show without spending the rest of the day fantasizing about what my comedy routine would be (without writing it all down, of course lol)
1	Yeet have though about that a little.
1	Me! I have always fantasized about doing stand up comedy one day. I’m kinda funny, I got jokes, but I’m not always a jokerster. I’m pretty witty, I can think of good come backs, and I have good comedic timing. I just have a unique perspective that I can use material from.
1	I'll spend hours in front of a mirror working on a routine that will never have an audience. I'd crumple before criticism.
23	Learning to start less sentences with "I / me" has helped with social anxiety	I don't know if there are many other infp's here who are babbles (despite being obviously introverts) - I often speak a lot and don't always think what I'm saying. It often gives me so much anxiety. Especially because a lot of times I'm in a hurry to explain or validate myself or my actions, or just plain please. By constantly defining myself to others I'll build up expectations. Am I trying to control how they see me or brag or something? Isn't that stuff usually just counter productive?\n\nSo like if I was looking at the stars and wanted to say how I think this, I do that, I always do that, I learned/know that...\n\nIt felt much better. More present, more harmonious. Better conversation, better friend. I ended up being silent quite a lot.
3	I don't understand exactly but it sounds like a good idea. How do you start sentences if not with an I? LOL. Honestly want to understand. Sounds like a novel idea to me!
3	Great idea, I’ve noticed lately my use of “I” and stating my opinions has grown exponentially and it sucks, it’s great to hear you feel better after stopping, hopefully I get the same results!
3	\*starts with I don't know\*
1	Wow. That’s kind of deep yo. Is this something you read somewhere or did it just come to you? I have noticed people get offended when I use a lot of I statements. It comes across like I am self absorbed, even if I don’t mean it to. And you’re right. Who cares what I think? \nAlso, I think it creates confusion because my inner world is complex and always changing. 
6	Tips for dating another INFP?	I suspected for the while now but just confirmed that my girlfriend is an INFP as well. Anyone got any tips on relationships between two INFPs? 
3	As an INFP female married to an INFP male, we're pretty compatible. We tend to like those who have the same values and ideals as us, so it's common for INFP's to end up together.
3	Infp females are very sensitive creatures. Zero practical skills. Live in La la land. Give great head tho 👌
3	IN F/T P	I have seen at least a half dozen times over my few months on this subreddit, people ask if they are INFP or INTP. The first time I ever did the MBTI test, I was INTP (forgot about this until today xD). Then the next half dozen+ tests I have always been INFP, including today. Today I got INFP-A w 51% feeling and 49% thinking, but the other 3 traits are firmly in one direction. So I decided to read about INTP, and much of that resonated w me as well, although INFP resonates w me more, so I suppose I am INF(t)P-A if you want to get technical. For those of you who are on the fence about 2 types... That could be a way to potentially describe your type. I don't think human beings can be stuck into 16 boxes accurately, but w that said I have learned a lot about myself from MBTI and this subreddit as well, thank you all for being awesome! ❤
3	Until a few months ago, I was convinced that I was an INTP.  However, after more research and some internal observations, I realized that I was actually more of an INFP than INTP.  Looking at the 8 cognitive functions helped me distinguish which one I am, because I use Fi more than I use Ti.
2	The difference between an INFP and INTP is more than just f/t . Check Fe (as in INTP ) vs Fi (As in INFP) to see to which you relate more.  
606	When you’re INFP but 40% extroverted so you want to go out and be social and make friends because everyone is perfect and amazing but also it tires tf out of you and you don’t like big crowds and don’t like socializing and are just a big hypocrite.	
98	When you like to be in the spotlights but also not like to be in the spotlights so you just stand there alone thinking you like to be in the spotlights.
49	Ugh, I feel this so hard.\n\nI get excited whenever I get invited to things/events by people because I finally feel included and not invisible as usual. I start getting this adrenaline rush (aka the energy to socialize) resulting from the anticipation several hours before the event. \n\nHowever, once I leave the house I immediately start feeling a pang of regret and I start thinking about how nice it would be if I were to be curled up in bed reading a book or watching a film.
16	You are not supposed to stay out all day! I like seeing other people, but not stay with them for more than 3 or 4 hours (in extreme occasions). That is completely normal.
13	Lol I can’t relate. I’m as introverted as you can be. 
8	I routinely put the mask on for meetings. I force myself to stop, gather myself, and put on the pleasant persona I need to make sure things go well. \n\nIt's not being a hypocrite. It's shoring up your defenses so you can engage in an efficient war. 
6	When you're an INFP but n% extraverted, where n is any positive integer.
7	Im like 49% extrovert and 51% introvert. So life is a big wtf should i do most of the time
6	One year I decided to put together a little get together for my birthday. Because I’m INFP and I love people, I quickly started to invite everyone. I invited about 100 people, hyped up my party for a week, and got other people excited. On the day of my own birthday party, I would of been content to just take a nap.
36	*When you base your personality on percentages*
6	facts. I’m literally a contradiction. I don’t like going out to socialize but I really want to go out and socialize 🤦🏾‍♂️
5	Hitting the infp-a crowd I see. I'm pretty damn close to 50/50 introvert/extrovert and I love having plans but sometimes it feels like I am incapable of making them.
5	Ugh, this is me exactly. I actually socialize really well, when I can drag myself out of my room. I just got a new job and am really liking  my coworkers and my boss is impressed with me too. It's not easy - but sometimes you simply have to fake it to make it. That's what I've been doing for years. Feign confidence. 
3	they only look perfect and amazing because you like to see the best in others. it works best if you get paid and the people need you.
3	Mood
3	When everyone you used to associate with is too busy for you and your life outside of work becomes nonexistent you start wishing you could find big crowds, no matter how much you love alone time 
2	Tests are all telling me I'm super introverted but I know I'm almost 50/50 from experience
2	WHY IS DIS ME 🙃
2	Oof yeah I reeeallly walk the line between introvert and extrovert so it’s this constant catch-22 of wanting to be around people but not having the energy to acquire people to be around :/
2	Socializing is painful.
2	Lol I got these results too, the struggle is real
2	I like about 5 people out of every 100 but those 5 are so awesome that I keep socializing in hopes of finding such people. And then I stop for a while because it exhausts me 
2	I'm in this picture and I don't like it
2	Yep and I think I was about 40% extroverted too
2	This is incredibly specific who are you and how did you know about my forty percent I feel attacked
2	I like being included, I hate being left out. I hate being included.
2	I relate, but like in a different way.... Its more like, when you are 40% extroverted and you want to go out and make friends! So you do and it's great but then you realize friendships require keeping in contact over the phone and that takes away from your precious recharge time. And you cant keep adding in new people or you will never have time for you. So then you have to learn how to demand your space and then you watch as friends and family leave. (Because your the only person who ever reaches out.) 
2	maybe
3	Try being INFP and working on a switchboard all day ..... "(Insert name ) Bank, how may I direct your call ?" ***AND*** half the people either can't hear or aren't paying attention, so repeat ad nauseum .....
0	come join r/INTP where we hate everyone\n\nThinking master race
10	Do you feel stressed and/or anxious because of daily life and responsibilities? If so, how do you deal with that stress?	I get stressed out really easily, especially when I think about what I have to get done, and I was wondering if other INFPs share this feeling. Recently, I've been a bit better at being organized, so I think part of being less stressed is making sure you're organized whether it's using a planner or putting reminders into your phone. For me, I found that using a Google doc to write a list of everything I need to do really relaxes me. Idk why, maybe it's because I like the format of Google docs. Anyway, I know I went off on a tangent there, but basically, I'm open to discussing anything stress/anxiety related. Or really anything that's one your mind at all because this sub is great and I love discussing stuff with you all :D
3	I make a list of the things that are bugging me and need to get done, and I try to get them done the soonest I can. Sometimes I pick some of those errands and place them somewhere in my daily schedule. Maybe lunch break or after work... \n\nIf I get a burst of productivity, I tend to knock out as much as I can. I used to procrastinate a lot, but realizing how much better I enjoy life without much of the stress has led me to be a little more disciplined.\n\nThat being said, I have a very high tolerance for stress which sometimes can really backfire because I forget about responsibilities or postpone them to the very very last moment. 
3	I get stressed out so easily!! I feel overwhelmed with all the responsibilities that come with being an adult. Making lists and being organized helps for sure, but I still feel anxious and stressed out most of the time. I think that since we feel things so deeply, it makes things way more stressful than they need to be.
2	I can completely relate in everything!\nBut sometimes even planning doesn't help me. I mean, I often get distracted anyway and have to plan again because I didn't do what I had to. Lol\n\nAnxiety can be either good or bad: if I have time it will just remain anxiety because I will procrastinate anyway, if the deadline is near it helps a lot
2	Yes because of random events.\n\nDeep breaths, let the emotion passes.\n\nResponsibilities? No. I do stuff, I write things down, evaluate, I terminate activities that indicate to have little to no yield, I break the problem into steps... I tell people when I'm overburdened and cannot do the tasks on time. I put an effort to correct my mistakes.\n\nI do forget and make mistakes and there certainly is a time when the fear tries to overtake me but I will not let any of that define me. 
2	I absolutely get super stressed. Maybe part of me doesn’t care about doing the stuff I need to do, even though I know I will *have* to do it. Idk, it’s just a problem I’ve always had and a habit I’ve never been able to shake. How do I deal with it? Poorly. And whenever people give me tips on organization and time management, I just don’t even listen anymore. I’ve heard it all (making lists, taking things a step at a time, scheduling stuff, including breaks) and it doesn’t help whenever I’ve tried them. I just figure stuff out as I go along. What I really want in stressful times is for people to say, “I don’t care if you get this stuff done at all, I still love you, and you’re still a wonderful person,” but everybody wants to be a problem solver, (which doesn’t help me, as I said), so I’ve never heard that. And it just makes me feel worse because I know I can’t do that stuff. I don’t know. I like to think there’s something beyond just trying harder, getting more organized, staying focused. All of that just feels like treating the symptoms rather than getting to the root of the issue. Maybe it’s a deficiency of love, from myself to myself, and not being loved the way I really need to be (having people make sure I know they still love me). So I feel you friend. Stay strong, and you are always loved.

8	The one that got away; please share your stories	I saw an older post asking about stories for those of us INFPs who have a “one that got away” what i wrote was way too long to comment reply but I wanted to share it. Thanks for the idea; writing this was therapeutic. I feel like other INFPs will relate to this..\n\n4 years ago in early summer 2015 i was about to turn 23...\n\nI had been talking to a guy and he was into me but i wasnt sure how i felt(platonic or romantic?), since i was still torn up from a short but tumultuous relationship I had a few months prior [at the beginning of 2015]. But he convinced me to go on a casual date after hanging out a few times. We had dinner which was good and then we went to the bar to meet up with his best friend and his best friend’s boyfriend; so it turned into like a double date thing. \n\nWhen we were walking to the bar my date says something to the effect of “oh my god youre gonna meet my best friend’s boyfriend, he is so hot.” \n\nPart of me was like ew dont say another person is hot when ur on a date with me, but then i realized he was just trying to be funny and make conversation. This still made me extra nervous though, as i already was anxious just being out in public and now about to meet several new people. \n\nSo we get to the bar and my date introduces me. I realize that i actually know my date’s best friend by association. My date’s best friend is not someone who is traditionally attractive but he has one of those personalities that he lands people who are attractive/very attractive; & well then of course his boyfriend was super charming and attractive, as my date had told me earlier. This made me feel super insecure. I immediately thought to myself “wow ill never be good enough or attractive enough to date someone like him”. But I continued on just trying to get past my negative thoughts. \n\nAfter we all kinda did our introductions, i took a passive role in the group convo and i kinda just listened to them talk. Eventually my date and his best friend went to go get drinks or something so i was left alone with his best friend’s boyfriend. \n\nWe randomly started talking about something we had in common (we had both lost a lot of weight semi recently) and started actually hitting it off, i was pleasantly surprised, i didn’t expect him to be so nice and actually a decent human. \n\nAfter a bit we went to a different bar for a while then last call came around and my date offered to drive us all back to our places. \n\nOnce we dropped them off and we were on our way to my place i told my date that he could stay at my place if he needed to because he looked super tired and his place was a farther drive. My date asked me what i thought of everyone and i said they were fun and that he wasnt kidding about his best friends boyfriend being very attractive. We got to my place and went to bed and he was very respectful and didnt try to make a move which was refreshing because some dudes (especially gay dudes) are promiscuous af and i dont do hookups so it would have been... not a good time. \n\nA week or so later... i hung out with my date again and he says that his best friend’s boyfriend broke up with his best friend the next day after we all went out together and completely stopped talking to him. I was really surprised because i thought his best friend’s boyfriend was a really nice guy when i met him but then i was like well i guess he’s really not that nice?\n\nAfter talking for another week or so and hanging out again i realized that i just didnt have feelings for my date the way he had feelings for me so i knew that i needed to end it to avoid leading him on. He wasnt happy but i think he understood. \n\nAfter 2 weeks of feeling bad about it, i felt super lonely so it was back to grindr. I chatted with several new people but only with one person consistently-who i came across when I was back in my home town for fathers day weekend. \n\nAfter chatting for a few weeks the guy from back home asked to meet me/hang out on the 4th of july. I had plans to go home again for the 4th already so i said i might be able to. When the weekend of the 4th came around i got day drunk with my family and friends but then really sad after. So that night i hung out with him and stayed the night. We ended up getting along really well he also was respectful and didnt try to get me to hookup with him. I immediately had a big crush on him, but we were a two hour drive apart so i would only be able to see him when i came to visit my family; also he was only 19yo going back to college in a few months so neither one of us wanted to make a commitment. A few days after we hung out he asked if we can again the following weekend and since i worked that friday and sunday i said it would work if he could come to me this time and we can spend tome together saturday, which he agreed to do. So on like july 10 he made the drive to visit me i told him he could stay at my place; and after spending the weekend together he asked me to be his boyfriend. since we just met and he wasnt even out to his family yet i said i would have to think about it(i didnt even know if i wanted a relationship in general let alone a long distance one and there was someone else that i was even more interested in) But before he left i said yes because i did like him and i felt way too guilty to say no after he was so nice and drove to see me.\n\nConcurrently right before meeting up with the 19yo from home on july 4th weekend i also came across my previous date’s best friend’s super hot ex-boyfriend on grindr; so i decided to message him just to chat and he was very nice just like he was when i met him the first time. Eventually we ended up exchanging phone numbers. To my surprise he actually was super into me when we met (but we were both on a date with different ppl so..) and he said he was also nervous around me which i thought was adorable. According to him there was a reason that he broke up with his ex so suddenly. I still didnt trust him completely because I was still so messed up from the relationship i had at the beginning of 2015 however I was totally infatuated with him and i wanted to date him so so bad but he said he was only looking for friends when i asked why he was on grindr. Additionally he cohosted a radio show (yes of course i listened to it every morning) and I was working 2 jobs so we were both super busy with our careers and nothing really could happen besides texting occasionally over a couple weeks.. until i invited him to my birthday party. When i invited him he asked me when my birthdate was and gave me a super cute shout out on the radio (i still have the recording i took of it; yes i know thats prolly psycho of me) He ended up being able to come to my party where he got to meet my friends and they all loved him. (They were like “oh you should date him!”) At this point i was getting mixed messages because he said he was only looking for friends but technically never said that directly to me but saying it more so as an answer for what are you looking for on grindr?(i didnt realize this at first). Actually my friends were confused at my party becuz i had also told them about the 19yo that i was technically dating but he couldnt come to my party because he had plans with his friends and was only 19 so he wouldnt be able to get in anyway. I explained that i had a crush on this (radio host) guy who actually could make it to my party and who i originally met when out on a date with someone else but he since he was apparently only looking for friends (aka what i mistook for what he actually meant) so im not going to pursue it. \n\nWe had a fucking ball at my party... i was already pretty infatuated with radio host guy BEFORE the party... but i really fell HARD for radio host guy AT my party. I knew i couldnt pursue it tho because i had my brand new 19yo bf who i had only known for 2 weeks and had been officially dating for a week at this point so i figured i should try and see how that works out and i just didnt know if i could trust radio host guy because he seemed too perfect. I felt really guilty for not telling radio host guy about my brand new 19yo boyfriend at the party but there was literally no appropriate time to bring it up. The next day he said he had a lot of fun and i told him we need to party again soon. A few days later i got put into a position where radio host dude saw new 19yo bf in my snaps and asked who he was and obvi i wasnt going to lie so thats how i told him that i had a boyfriend now and that was pretty much the end of my and radio host guy’s budding relationship/friendship aside from chatting occasionally on snapchat. \n\nI felt super guilty towards my new 19yo bf too; that i didnt tell him immediately that me and radio host guy were kinda talkingish when he and I started dating. But i explained everything and it ended up going over ok-ish. Except a month later my new 19yo bf ended up confessing to me that he was dating someone else when we first met 4th of july weekend. And that he ghosted his bf right before he came to visit me the next weekend so he could start dating me instead. Which was like actually shitty! \n\nSo i ended up missing out on a chance with a genuinely good guy that was my age, to date a 19yo piece of trash, our relationship went on for two years before we broke up because he tried to cheat on me and was an actual psychopath. I still feel tricked and manipulated. I wouldnt have chose to date the 19yo and not pursue radio host dude if he would have told me that he had a boyfriend when i met him. I would never date someone who is capable of doing what he did to his ex.\n\nMeanwhile cool awesome hot Radio host guy started dating someone else a few months after he and i stopped talking in 2015. They are still together to this day. I still have feelings for him to this day :(\n\nBut whatever i guess you live and you learn. One good take away is that this whole mess of a situation helped me realize i had serious self esteem issues and that i am worthy/good enough to date anyone if i so choose. It also taught me that i really need to start living for myself and start making decisions based on what i wanna do and not be guilted into doing things.\n\nSo yeah thats the story about how the one who got away was my date’s bestfriend’s boyfriend when i met him.\n\n(I also just have to make clear that my actions were genuinely transparent and innocent; more so than what it may seem. I was not trying to play anyone nor did i ever attempt cheat on anyone. My whole life up until summer of 2015 i looked down on people who would casually date multiple people at the same time. The experience I had summer 2015 was the first time i learned that anyone, including me, can actually have strong feelings for two different people at the same time and that doesnt make you a bad person, its more so how you handle those feelings. Part of me wishes i could have done things different and tried to date both of them/and not been so honest like other ppl do all the time but thats just not something i could bring myself to do, and i dont think i would have been able to live with myself if i tried.)
9	Something I've noticed with NFPs	It's like there's an avoidance to conflict in relationships because "it's too sad/depressing" that there is a conflict in the first place. Really it makes me think that NFPs actually just see a difference in values that can't be met in the middle and therefore don't want to talk about it.\n\nI think in reality by not talking about it ever and leaving their partner in the dark that there even is a conflict, they are actually making the decision FOR their partner rather than letting them make it for themselves whether they can live with the disagreement. It comes off manipulative, like the NFP wants to preserve their partner's fantasy of them so that the current happiness levels of the relationship sustain. Those happiness levels don't sustain though and there is always an undercurrent of anxiety about the topic and I feel its unfair to do this to a partner. If they can live with it then say your speal and live with it, if they can't let them move on and find someone who doesn't cause an undercurrent of conflict and anxiety.
6	Personally, if I truly care about someone *and* trust them enough to know that I won't eventually be abandoned and/or rejected, I will not avoid conflict nor will I be afraid to voice out my thoughts, views and opinions. I will try to find middle ground as soon as possible because I really can not stand fighting. (But if I can't imagine that middle ground being able to be found I guess there would be no point in bringing it up at all...?)\n\nHowever if I don't feel secure I will always and absolutely hide my true feelings just to protect myself and will 100% be an unsure, awkward mess around you. \nIf you know an NFP (or anyone I guess) who acts like this, maybe they *do* want you to only see their ideal, flawless self because they don't quite trust you to stay otherwise. Or that's how I function at least. 
2	This whole post seems skewed and pretty blame-y, not all "NFPs" act a certain way, and you're responsible for your own involvement with people and your own feelings. If someone causes you anxiety, realize that anxiety comes from you, not them. I think if you phrased more of this as an open question instead of a definitive judgment, that would yield you more positive results. But, on the other hand, I think that very action illuminates why you have this issue. Communication is a dynamic and you're really just pointing the finger here instead of looking at where you come into play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike the other poster mentioned, the person you're upset about and now projecting onto an entire type (or uh, two types, lol) probably doesn't really trust you enough to be open with you. This post doesn't really ooze of acceptance or of trying to be understanding, it more comes across as needing to assign blame to someone for an uncomfortable feeling you experienced with communication, as if every type besides NFPs were flawless in that regard; communication is extremely difficult regardless of type. Not looking at your own methods of communication and simply picking apart other's will just compound how difficult it already is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally have very little issue talking about conflict with those I'm really close to. If I'm not close to them or I simply don't trust them, I'm not gonna waste my time. There's no middle ground with people who very clearly aren't going to be receptive to what you'd actually say, there's just a very blatant lack of understanding, and there are plenty of hints that I pick up on that are very strong indicators about that outcome. I personally don't bother getting that close to them in the first place, and so honest communication tends not to happen.
1	You just weren't the one, get over it and move on. You obviously did not get it, and it was not compatible, that person more than likely did not feel safe to go deeper with you, you were tested and you did not pass. You have your own criteria too, and that person did not meet yours. 
1	I think middle ground can be met if INFPs use their Fe? Because being an INFP,there's been recently some issues in my friendship,I uses to be more avoidant but the reason of being avoidant is that I just didn't want any conflict but I think INFPs should really try opening up,although it can be hard because we can't really open up till there's a emotional bond but it's good to just open up to notify the person what's been going wrong so that they might help making the situation better,also whenever I go through a conflict with someone,I give myself time to think about it and bring out my Fe by first sustaining my Fi so we.can discuss about the conflict in a much more respectful manner,I hope everything's making sense 
2	INFP-INTJ RELATIONSHIP	I've already made a post about this, but basically my boyfriend (m/intj) and I (f/infp) are having troubles with the dynamic. \n\nAny tips? 
2	It's tough. I'm INTJ (woman) and my boyfriend is INFP. It took a long time for me to realize that he is just like he is, and even if I enjoy the differences between us, it's very hard to not see some of his behaviour as crazy and irrational. I still think it actually is crazy and irrational, but I've learned to assign it meaning thinking more about his point of view. And this is very, very hard for an INTJ, so he has to care a lot, or he won't accept the struggle.\nAnyway, you should understand that if he spends time with you, value your ideas and enjoy your presence, this means a lot more, for him, than a bladant act of romanticism.\nIf both sides can understand the other, it will be ok. But if one side keeps asking for something that is absurd for the other, it won't.\nFor example: I hate surprises and I prefer to tell him what I would like for my birthday, as a gift. I can't see why this could be a problem. But he feels like surprises are sweet and romantic, more than just buying for me something I ask. I explained my point and he explained his. We agreed that he'll be surprised, and I will ask for what I prefer.

3	Have you ventured down the rabbit hole of musical temperament and tuning yet? That's a fun one that will blow your mind.\n\nI've been reading about the Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania, just on wikipedia but it's interesting and I was curious. It's a state that was formally formed in 1569 and marked by its proto-constitutional monarchy, which made it relatively progressive for Europe at the time, and low urban population, powerful nobility, and fledgeling bourgeoisie compared to other European nations. It was a powerhouse throughout the 16th and 17th centuries until falling into decline as it couldn't compete with the imperial expansion of the other major European powers, it suffered in a war with Sweden and an uprising in Ukraine, and its political system, which required consensus amongst the nobility on decisions, made it vulnerable to influence by foreign powers as bribing a single noble could grind decision-making to a halt. The Commonwealth was forced to cede territory to Austria, Prussia, and Russia in a series of partitions in the late 1700s until finally being fully absorbed by said countries in 1795. Neither Poland nor Lithuania would have statehood again until after WWI.

1	It takes a lot of time, but if you enjoy poetry and language. Try reading through some of the book of Psalms with assistance from a commentary.

4	I’ve been there sir or miss. It’s never easy, there’s no one anyone can say. It’s like someone died. The hurt, the betrayal, the confusion, the heartbreak. Just know, things change. Crazy things happen. You might get back together with them next week, next month, next year. You could be thankful that you are no longer with them when you find out how they change. This might be a blessing in disguise. Chances are you’re a great person and it probably has little to do with you ultimately. Just their own mind, own insecurities, own weirdness. Learn to be content in your own life first, then your love will come and want to stay forever.

2	i loved that movie so much! normally not the type of movie i would watch at all (i normally watch thrillers), but i love musicals and lady gaga so i felt inclined. it was one of the best movies i've seen in recent years. i've seen it twice now. it was devastating but i enjoyed having such a strong emotional reaction to a film.
1	what is it that made you cry so much
1	I was just watching that holy shit!! I just turned on off because it's so cheesy!! 
1	Was this the first time you’ve seen it?  I’m planning on watching tonight. 
1	I cried my eyes out too. The main character being so misunderstood and shamed by the music industry guy when he was already in so much pain pushed me over the top. So sad. 😕
1	Instantly became one of my favorite movies when I watched it.  Sometimes I sit back and relive movies, and this is one of the places I go.  
32	Was recommended I find something “earthly” to keep in my pocket to help with panic attacks. So I made this.	
4	That's awesome! I really like that you added your own touch to it. Great work!\n\nI thankfully don't get panic attacks, but I do keep a river rock on my desk at work. Clenching it when I'm overly stressed seems to help.
4	Beautiful! 
3	Wow, I'm so impressed with this. For a second I thought you'd bought it, and I was gonna ask where so I could get one. But you made it! That's so cool!
3	how did you make this!?
3	Nice 😀 when I go for a walk I like to pick up a piece of nature, grass, flower, twig to twiddle with, prob sounds a bit hippy dippy but feels like I'm getting energy from it as well as the relaxation of the twiddle!
5	Am I as good at reading people as I think I am?	I've told people that one of my strengths is being able to read people and their motivations. I've always been perceptive of how other people feel and the reasons behind their actions. I truly believe this to be a strength of mine and (I believe) I'm usually correct. \n\nHowever, I've been made fun of several times for being proud of this; people see me as overconfident and stupid. My roommate and I were just in an argument and she told me that I'm not as good at reading people as I think I am. It actually hurt me a lot when she said that and now I've been questioning whether I'm good at it at all. \n\nKinda just wanted to rant, but also wanted to know if any of you have experience with this.
8	Why do you need to tell other people? I've no doubt that you are perceptive about people, isn't that enough? Why does anyone else need to know that? If they spend enough time with you and get to know you, they will find out for themselves. You weaken yourself when you need to verbally announce to somebody what your strengths or good qualities are. You make yourself vulnerable and of course people are going to tell you that you're not as good as you think! You set yourself up for that. Power comes from allowing your strengths to display themselves. Telling other people about what you are capable of just makes you appear needy.
5	It can be quite dangerous to consider yourself to be so good at reading people, because you can fall into the trap of believing you are always right about someone and getting blinded by your bias. It's great when our intuition can help us and shield us from others' bad intentions, but if *several* people have pointed out to you that you're going overboard with this, there's probably a reason behind it. Perhaps you jump to conclusions about someone too quickly, or you're simply being obnoxious in the way you judge others.\n\n I understand this is something you're proud of, and that's great, but some self-reflection on this topic can't hurt you. 
5	Yes, I feel the same way about myself and this has been proven over and over again. When I fight with my gf she has attacked what I consider strengths as an infp, but that’s because she knows I’m not confident in much and this is something I’m confident of (kinda f-upped that she goes that low lol). You are more than likely very perceptive and intuitive and do read people well. There is nothing wrong with being proud of that because it’s a unique thing. I imagine the fight started over something else or if that was the issue then maybe there is something else that she is not saying that really caused her to lash out. We may be able to read people but it doesn’t mean we know every thought and feeling they have. Especially if they are not even sure themselves. Hopefully you guys can work it out. Don’t let her statement take away your confidence but be humble of your gifts at the same time. 
3	Well I've noticed INFPs tend to project a lot so that's something to watch out for. Basically don't make huge assumptions. You can't know all there is to a person. Basically you can inquire about them, just don't convince yourself you know the truth.
3	I think questioning your own "reading abilities" is the best way to keep them at an above average level. Once you gain too much confidence in it you trust it too much and completely forget about your possible biases.
2	You are confident in it, but you can't be sure about things like this. Also, many people have an urge to criticize others when they see shortcomings, or feel complelled to put someone's confidence down if they show too much of it.
14	This is a place to show poetry, right?	With large goals to chase\n\nAnd standards to meet\n\nMY life becomes a race\n\nI must reach great feats  \n\n\nAnd when all's said and done\n\nWill it all have been fun?\n\nOr will it leave me on the run?  \n\n\nWhen my goals are met\n\nWill I be filled with regret?\n\nOr will I walk away with pride?\n\nWith family of which to confide?  \n\n\nI know all I want to do\n\nIs to bring joy for you\n\nAnd with all that count\n\nWill my goals be para-mount?  \n\n\nAnd when I've passed away\n\nWill I be met with praise?\n\nOr will I be forgotten by day?  \n\n\nWill be tries be for naught?\n\nWith all the battles I have fought?\n\nWill I be left to rot?\n\nOr will I end up shot?
3	Beautiful poem, loved the part “And when I’ve passed away/Will I be met with praise?/Or will I be forgotten by day?\n\nKeep up it up!

4	Platonic Love Song No.- Lauren Bird	I found this today by chance and it really hit home for me. It's a beautiful song you could sing to a close friend. I tried to find the artists YouTube channel but I had no luck. I thought the people here would appreciate it  (i'm honestly surprised it's not more popular) : \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74rUhOMkg\_A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74rUhOMkg_A)

3	Yep. 
2	Yeah like spending all my time on League of Legends even tho I’ll probably never be good at this game.

7	INFP Soldier	(20 M)\nFor as long as I can remember I’ve wanted to be a marine. Almost every man in my family has been in the USMC and fighting for what’s right in the world is an idea that really interests me. \n\nI have done a few things in my life that have made my friends and family proud of me. But I have never done anything that has really made me feel like I made a difference or has given me a sense of accomplishment. I’m not looking for bragging rights or to boast to anyone else. I just want to be able to look back on my life and know that I did something that mattered and made a difference for the better.\n\nI was wondering if any of you have had any military experience and I wanted to know how it made you feel (accomplished, a sense of pride or duty) as well as if you’d recommend it. \n
7	I'm in the military and a infp. It just feels like a normal job after a while. When you first join your sense of pride and belonging sores to new heights but after a few years that wanes. With that being said it is a small brotherhood that will always accept even though we make fun of each other mercilessly.
3	My husband is an INFP and he is in the Air Force. He didn't join for any real altruistic reasons though —it was a job for him and a way out. \n\nOne thing I admire about his outlook is his sense that he can make a difference even in small ways. For example, he is going to be deployed to a location this summer which neither of us agree with (the US is in many morally-objectionable wars right now). But his outlook on it is that he can do a lot of good even in a bad situation, and in fact, the world needs more good people to be in bad situations. So even if, for example, he befriended a few locals on the ground, listened to them, and tried to do right by them, etc, that would be a lot of good that would not have happened otherwise. In this sense, INFP's, who tend to have loads of empathy for others, are a great fit for the military.\n\nTwo other things to consider are 1) the intense structure/bureaucracy and 2) the authority.  If you can handle crushing bureaucracy and don't mind that you belong to the military in almost every sense—they own you— you'll fare well. My husband appreciates the structure because he has little naturally, so that's a good balance. He accepts but doesn't love the authority piece. It becomes complicated at times because they really do own him. If I get pregnant, for example, they don't care at all. They can and will still order him anywhere on earth, and there's a good chance he can miss the birth. He's missed funerals too. About half the military folks we've met have missed the birth of a child. You're young, so that may not matter now, but it might someday. Hope this helps!
2	My brother just graduated from marine corps boot camp. I have wanted to be a navy seal since I was 7 and will definitely be joining a branch after highschool. I probably won’t fit in that well as an infp but I really want to be disciplined and change for the better 
2	I did ROTC for only my freshman year in college. I chose not to continue since my reasons for joining were weak. I had no specific reason that would bring me into the military. I wanted to help people, but that can also be accomplished outside of the military. I never saw myself as working long-term (renewing contracts) in the military, and instead, I was viewing it more as a way to pass the time and learn more about myself. I wanted to travel, but I can do that outside of the military. Also, I just felt like I didn't belong. Nothing I wanted to do needed the military behind me to support me to do it. I had no absolute ties to the military, so I had nothing to keep me in. \n\nI believe that if you choose to join, you need a grounded reason. I just couldn't find a reason that got me interested enough to join.

6	Who else likes to find empty classrooms to enjoy some alone time before class starts? I found out I'm not alone in doing this. I really hate sharing space when I'm on my own. When someone sits near me or the chair or table I'm using, I bolt.
6	Does anyone else her only stick to a few friends in their life and never actively go out and try to make any?\n\nCause thats me in a nutshell
5	I never state my opinions out loud and in front of people. I am very passionate about things, but I rarely speak out because I suck at defending my stance. I always get dismantled. It’s like I have an inherent lack of debate skills.  
1	I met this girl today, very pretty, nice, my type. I bet you know where this is going. I thought about her a lot until I found out she is taken. On top of that her boyfriend if buff and I’m the military. I should have figured a pretty girl like her wouldn’t be available, yet alone into me. I just wish I can finally meet a girl I’m attracted to that is also into me.
39	Music is just the best thing this world has to offer	I feel like music just hits me at such a fundamental level. I've been listening to an Alice in Chains pandora station at work and I forgot how much I love some of the better 90s music.\n\nOne of these days I'll learn to use Spotify. Tried it once and got fed-up with how not user friendly it was.
4	I must disagree, I prefer buttered toast.  Brings a smile and warm contentment every time.
4	Anything is the best with caffeine. 
3	music is literally the reason I'm alive right now! highly suggest learning spotify asap! it's worth it- there's SO much music on it. soundcloud too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwho are your favorite bands?
2	I apologize because this has nothing to do with your post but I saw RuPaul in your username and I totally started fangirling. For some reason I felt the need to tell you this haha. RuPaul’s Drag Race is the best thing ever invented and I don’t know you internet stranger, but I have gained a ton of respect for you and your existence. :) 
2	Music is the gate to my inner world, and thats why I decided to study and make it. Also we can never stop discovering new kinds of music and be amazed. Have you ever listened to Robert Rich s sleep concerts? Amazing trips/meditation. 
2	I like the sound of engines
2	Omg same here! I love music and also I like better pandora....I tried to use Spotify but I don't really like it/get it. Pandora is way better or YouTube!
2	I'm very passionate about music as well, I feel you.\n\nSpotify doesn't really seem that bad. Maybe frustrating with it's frequent ads, otherwise pretty okay.

3	Dream interpretation? [Long]	Unfortunately, I don’t remember a small beginning portion of my dream but the dream had a mysterious orange tint to it. So, this is how it went. I am not the best writer so please bear with me.\n\nI am sitting on the couch at my house watching tv and I notice that there is this small bump on the corner of my house. I go and check it out to see what’s causing it. I lift the carpet and realize it’s underground and not the carpet. I grab a shovel and start digging. I’m digging for a bit and I suddenly hit something. I see it’s a small package. I open it up and there is things in it. \nFirst package: * I can’t remember this part unfortunately * I do remember that there as a candy wrapper in this package that has a heart drawing on it. I have never seen this candy before in my life. \nI’m curious if there is anything more so I continue digging. \n\n\nAfter a while I once again hit something else. This second package contains a pair of old jeans, a single dirty converse shoe and a small shoe box full of random things. In this box, there is this small book which looks like a travel book but from a place I had never heard of before. It looked like a small forested island with a beach side town. I even looked it up in an atlas and there was no mention of it. But the book was so well detailed and had so many pictures of all the locations that it was hard to believe it was a made-up place. Among the book was a picture of this chubby young man in flip flops and shorts at the beach with his family smiling and posing for the picture. Along with all these other things, there is the similar candy wrapper with the heart drawing in this package too. \n\n\nI get more curious and I continue digging.  After a while I once again hit another package. This package contains random clothes, a notebook with notes on it but were no longer readable due to washed out ink, an old camera with a little power still in it and once again there was this wrapper for a heart shaped candy that I’ve never seen before. I turned on the camera to see if I could find any more information to all this and saw that she had taken regular pictures of sun set, her playing with her dogs on this rolling hill as the sun was setting and of a family football party she was attending earlier that day. Weird thing about one of the pictures was that one of the pictures showed her celebrating the final score of the game but on looking back I remembered the other team winning the game that year. Confused I double check on google to make sure if I was right and google showed that I was right. I get even more curious now and am wondering what this all means. So I continue digging. \n\n\nI am digging for a while but nothing this time. Just as I am about to give up, I hit an opening. It looks to me like there is a hole in the ground that leads to a small room. I continue digging until the hole is big enough for me to put my head and my arms in. I take my flashlight and stick my head in. On turning the torch on, I discover it’s a room full of old travel books from all over the world with a yellow cover. There were piles and piles of these travel books stacked all over. I jump into it and start exploring but there was nothing other than these books. After I was done looking around, I go back to the spot where I was digging earlier and start digging again but this time the ground is much harder. I’m using all my strength but am making no progress at all. After digging for what seems like forever, I see that I have made a small hole in the ground but accept the fact that I wouldn’t be able to go any further. As I am about to give up, I catch a glimpse of this plastic bag coming out of the ground. I dig a little more and grab its side and pull it out. The plastic bag had the same heart shaped candy that I found in all the previous packages. While the package was open, there was still a few more left in it. \n\n**** Unfortunately I woke up after this and don’t know what happened further.

3	"Offense to Truth"	
5	Riding and Writing	Riding because that's all I have when I'm upset. \n\nRiding because its fast moment in one direction with a racing heart that wants nothing more than to love and gets stopped every. single. time. it tries to.\n\nTwice in one year, damn\n.\nMy track record is fantastic. \nNo pun intended. \n\nRiding because the tears fall backwards when you are doing laps around the park. \n\nRiding because eventually these laps become all I think about and you will fade. \n\nNow. \n\nWriting.. \n\nWriting because seeing my feelings in words scares the shit out of me...\n\nWriting so I don't feel alone like I currently do. \n\nWriting because I'm so embarrassed I opened up the little bit I did. \n\nWriting because I cannot talk to you\n\nWriting because I'm over all these thoughts in my head that get tangled with my heart while my soul sits on the sidelines and just stares into the dark. \n\n\nI'm fine, \n\nExcuse me while I drown these feelings out with miles.\n\n\nINFP thoughts \nSeptember 7, 2018\n
1	What is trust?	Is it a willingness to believe, or something else entirely? I've thought about this a lot today and found that I don't really know how to describe trust very well. \n\nHow does it show in your behavior and thoughts when you trust someone? And how does it show in others' behavior that they trust you? What is trust like to you guys?
4	Trust can be a lot of things I guess. For me it's mostly feeling safe to be myself around the people I trust. I don't have to fear that I'm being judged for being me.\n\nAnd so trust for me is hard to give someone, it developes over time.\n\nBut what trust means for others... I do not know.\n
9	INFP's and Relationships	Im starting to get confused as to if i just have a bunch of sexual hangups that prevent me from casually hooking up or dating or if like its just not for me. Maybe its cuz i never really dated throughout my life and now everyone's already gone through hella dates and shit and im just worried due to inexperience and just being a ball of worry or do i just not even want to do that in the first place. like is there a point if im just gonna get myself hurt ya know, Kinda feel like i care too much about this sort of thing and it just keeps me in my house all day on reddit as opposed to making some "real" friends. of course im sure i couldn't make any real friends anyways, knowing enough about the weird artsy shit im into and the fact nobody gives a fuck about it. maybe i should just stop caring so much, but then again i really don't think i can. Good job if you can decipher this wall of emotion, I need a therapist bad, fuck insurance.
5	I also keep myself in the house all day and don’t have friends. No one has the same interests in me I always feel like no one likes what I like. So I just stay hidden. I feel this 
5	I’ve found that having a few friends that are really close to you helps tremendously. If you can find just two or three people in your life to really trust as friends then they will help you out a lot. For me it’s my brother, and my best friend who lives across the hall in my dorm.  My brother constantly encourages me to talk to girls I’m interested in and they both keep my head above water when it doesn’t work out. I use to just bottle up inside and when things didn’t go my way I would just hide somewhere alone listening to music, but because of the trust I’ve found in them, I’m able to tell them about the crazy stuff I think about and they help me work through it all. Regardless of how things turn out, having a few people to trust with everything I have is the most rewarding risk I’ve ever taken. 
2	Me too. Im terrified of getting hurt so i never put myself out there but really im lonely and i want so badly to love
10	INFP males bad at getting dates.	I feel like an INFP male does not have the qualities that women typically want and it makes it hard for me to get a date. Being romantically involved with someone would be wonderful but after 26 years of being alive I feel like it is becoming less and less possible. I’ve never been in a relationship nobody has ever called me their boyfriend. I just want to be in love and I want a healthy relationship. It hurts my self esteem and I don’t feel masculine. Getting girls is seen as a masculine thing and I am just horrible at it. I wish that I could become extroverted but it is really tough. I don’t know what to do anymore. I think I am probably going to be alone forever.
13	You don't have that quality and that's okay. \n\nNot all women are Into forward men. I certainly am not. \n\nI believe if it's hooking up, women want forward men, if it's meeting someone to date, I personally like a more reserved man that let's me chip away at getting to know him. \n\nI don't think you'd meet someone through environments that require a lot of social bravery and pressure, like tinder, one on one outings or blind dates.\n\nYou'll most likely meet someone amongst a group activity or through mutual friends in a low pressure environment. \n\nI'd reccommend taking up a hobby. That's how my SO and I met.\n\nHe's the INFP im an ENFP and when he joined our hobby group, I instantly felt attraction to him and thought he was so sweet, adorable and hella good looking. He vibed well of my social leadership and bubbly nature. \n\nWe got chatting when our hobby group went out drinking and to see a band and flirted a little when we had a couple of drinks. He stuck to the corners, but I made an effort to connect with him when I was free. \n\nWe both hung out with different people throughout the night, but we'd gaze across the room and share eye contact and a smile.\n\nWe flirted more, he made me laugh a lot and from there I was done, I fell for him. We hung out again in the same group the week after, then proceeded to hangout one on one after everyone had left.\n\nWe've now been dating for 9 months and crazy for eachother. We're head over heels in love. It's the most beautiful, deepest, unique relationship I've ever had. 
3	It is okay not to be masculine. You just need a girl that is not so shallow that she only has to be with a masculine guy. Also it is okay to not be an extravert. Half the world is not an extravert, so it would be pretty lame if that half wasn't able to find someone.\n\nI am an INFP and I have had some success in relationships. My longest relationship was 7 years. My advice is to just be yourself. Be open, honest, and fearless. Be independent, wise, and kind. But just be yourself, that is number one. Also confidence can go a long way. So if you can learn to become confident that will probably help immensely. :)
3	I will give you my advice. This works for me it may or may not work for you.\n\nSo having confidence is important , so is charm, and having a honest compassionate mentality. \n\nTry not to look for someone with good looks. Just be positive, be kind, be honest, and make her feel cared for with compassion and honesty. \n\nIf you can drive and have a independence , that is also very good and a boost to self esteem and self confidence. \n\nLike I said earlier - don't go after women who look attractive. Go after a women who has a good heart, good charm, friendly nature, fun and caring, and a women who is more about good personality not looks. \n\nThe biggest bad thing for women is lying and Selfishness. Just be good to her and show a lot of love and you will be alright. \n\nIf you have emotions like I do, then you prefer probably get super horny. Passion romance charm and being a kind sweety is really great. \n\nAll in all - depending on where you located - women with ugly expectations can exists. \n\nHope you find true love and have lots of pleasure and happiness. \n\nGoodluck. 
2	Start saying yes to things you wouldn’t normally say yes to. It will get you out and around people more and you may find something that you didn’t know you enjoyed. \nThe second part is the hard part, when you find someone you like, ask them for coffee and just let them into you head and try to not think of how big of a risk it is. Even if it doesn’t work out (which for me it rarely does) having genuine conversation with someone feels good. I’ve learned a lot about people and myself by just risking letting someone in for a few minutes. It also gets a little easier each time you do it.  \nGood luck and stay positive my friend 
2	Move to a big city where masculine and feminine don’t mean anything. Sell yourself with your best qualities and be real. Don’t try to “get girls”  do your own thing. Date another introvert that you meet on the internet. Order takeout every night and never leave your home, happily ever after 
1	I'm an INFP female and bad at getting dates! I assume because I'm too afraid to ever pursue anyone myself. They have to come to me or not at all. Are you the same way? I personally feel that masculinity is way more dynamic than getting girls, being strong, and all the other stereotypical things. What qualities do you wish to have in your best self? How do you want to feel as a man? What does authenticity mean to you? Follow that.  I feel you on the introversion problem. Someone told me to seek discomfort when it comes to social situations and I think it's good advice. Even if it seems stupid, start with a small risk you know? Ask someone what they're reading at a coffee shop or give someone a compliment. At the end of the day, we can't predict the future so it's best to not torture ourselves with the thought of being alone forever. I know, easier said than done. 
1	You gotta just boss up and go get what you want. This may include trying lots of things, but you can’t give up! If you consistently are trying your best, you will eventually find the perfect girl. I’m saying this and I haven’t even found her yet! In fact I’m just as bad at getting dates... trust me. I have learned however that we INFP males just have to try a lot harder, but the reward will be so much better after all the effort. 
1	I wouldn't worry about it too much—but try to put yourself in situations where you will meet potential relationships! Start saying yes more often to social gatherings, especially if cute girls will be there.\n\nI'm an ENFP and I fell for an INFP, and I had to make ALL the first moves. Now we're married and we laugh about it.
1	This looks like a bunch of assumptions that you let society impose on you.\n\nThe stereotypical masculinity is probably not what you should strive for. Men and women are just humans and are very diverse. Some women will desire extroverted and very confident guys, some will be the opposite. Also, getting girls? Most girls don't want to be 'gotten', they want to start from genuine and respectful interactions. For a healthy relationship, what's important is acceptance of yourself, of your situation, and going into socializing with a positive outlook.\n\nYou can find girls that have things in common with you. Try asking them about themselves, focus on the pleasure of interaction, show that you're a trustworthy guy. If you try (with moderate effort to not get burned), eventually things will happen.\n\nSorry about the way I worded the comment. I'm writing from a female standpoint and I would rather befriend a guy like you than a stereotypical 'alpha male'. Many of us girls feel lonely and desire relationships too. Both parts just need to reach out to each other.
1	Finding a good female specimen can be hard even for the most masculine male now-a-days. Your pool of possible specimens is much smaller than usually so yeah, good luck! I would watch some MGTOW content, maybe that can easy your pain a bit.

1	huh, never saw this gif without the bird and huge explosion
123	Too good not to share haha. I guess this can serve as a reminder to my fellow infps to make sure they step out into the unknown once in a while.	
5	This is totally me on the weekends. \n\nLike..."Get groceries" - check! \n\nAnd then run home to snuggle under a blanket, binge watch shows, play with cats and read. Mhm that was my weekend. 
3	I wanna make this my dating profile pic 
3	How to play Resident Evil 101
3	Yep. That's it for today. 
2	Omg this is way too true!
1	OMG yes!!!
1	The first "AHHHHHHHHH" always gets me. :D
677	Me @ Starbucks boy who told me to have a good day

48	At least daydreaming about romantic love gives a bit of joy to the broken mind :)
38	Lol, I’ve obsessed over strangers for months and years, shhh...
31	Looool this is so me. The other day a nice lady at the gym was super nice to me and i kept thinking all day yesterday about how nice she was and what i would like to tell her the next day we meet, and she didnt show up. If you really think about it, its hilarious. 
18	Ouch. This actually makes me afraid of how I’ll manage in a real relationship. 
11	I feel personally attacked
7	the mbti is too accurate
6	I do this everyday these days 😭
6	You fit perfectly to me in all your loneliness... \n\nMelt this curse away.\n\nThough I’ll never know your name, I’ll cry for you the same.
6	I feel personally attacked. :)
5	oh man this hit too hard 
5	When its happening and you are like ‘oh comeon, not this shit again!!’
5	Delete this, I feel intimidated lol
2	Hmm not only INFP feels like this. An INFP was nice to me (IsTJ) for a month and yeah I kinda daydream now he disappears lol. Strange
2	Ow.
2	🤭😬
2	this feels too real
2	It can be challenging to separate basic human decency from pursuit, unfortunately. \n\nwhat a whirled....
2	as a fellow barista, I hope you know we try our best :) I don't always get to say 'have a good day' to everyone, but I'm glad you felt a connection!
2	When the barista draws a heart on your coffee and you're like "marry me"
2	Go talk to him. \n\nI used to work at Starbucks, and obviously trying to hang out with customers is unprofessional, frowned upon, and most of all a risk to self esteem. \n\nBut damn if I wasn’t hoping my slightly upgraded kindness to a specific person wouldn’t go unnoticed and go somewhere. \n\nIt got noticed one time. Turned out the girl was a coke addict and an alcoholic and kept trying to get me to go home with her later so there was that. \n\nI guess what I’m saying is... do coke and drink alcohol so u have the courage to ask out anyone that smiles at you. \n\n
1	Taylor The Latte Boy is a song for all of us! 
1	Haha, accurate. Reminds me of the time I was upset over the fact that I couldn't have a relationship with the guy who was in my house for an hour to install the pv, just because he was nice lol.
1	Are we all just Joe Goldberg from the show, YOU?
1	Fuck....
1	This literally just happened to me few hours ago after striking a friendly conversation about PAX with a juice bar boy. And I just HAD to read this while having my first dinner alone in a while now. C:
1	Y am I being attacked like this?
1	Me at the stranger i follow on tumblr that is probably just being polite and who i know nothing of except for tumblr posts
1	I relate on a spiritual level as an infp\n
1	Hahaha.
1	Why is this actually me?  I am in the situation currently with a cute cafe guy,  we are genuinely friends now though.  He has no idea I'm crazy about him.  Oof
1	I remember falling in love with my best friend because I thought he was gay and afraid of showing, and it was a beautiful trainwreck. 
1	This is why INFP's get married so easily. We 'know' when it's right. 
1	You didn’t have to come for all of us like that🤣
0	Yikes. Normally I don’t like the bummer stuff on this page but this is INCREDIBLY accurate
16	still avoiding potential meaningful connections yaaay	Growing up I always thought my “weirdness” would go away as I got older but, now at 24 I’ve realized that it’s never going to go away. This is just the way I am.\nInstead of feeling bad for myself though, i have made the decision to get out of my comfort zone more often and try new things bc i understand now that almost all of the worry exists only in my head.\n\ni have never had a real boyfriend so my sisters had a talk with me this weekend and made me get a bumble. i’ve chatted with some guys on there but every time we try to meet up i flake and make up an excuse.\n\nyesterday i was going to meet up with a really cute guy that i was really excited about! i told myself i had to go NO EXCUSES bc he was so cute and so far we had had good conversation but instead my dumbass decided to meet up with a different guy  i’ve been hanging out with that i already know i don’t like (let’s call him roger)\nhe’s so different from me and kinda bad?\nbeing around him is a little scary sometimes but i like it??\nbut i don’t like him? it’s so weird. i just like being around him and he’s kind of obsessed with the fact that i’m “good” and “sooo unlike him” and all of that makes me feel good in a way.\nlike for the most random things he’ll get so excited about like somewhere in a conversation i told him i cared about deer that get hit on the road and how my mom and i feed them sometimes when they come to our backyard and he’s just like ??????? how are u the nicest person ever??\nbut i dont say it to seem like i care SOOOo much about the environment or to seem like the nicest, most caring person in the world. i just like to feed deer w my mom bc they’re cute but he’s so shocked bc i feel like he’d never do anything like that.   i also made a paper star with a receipt one day when we went out to eat and he was like “??? OKAY HOOW TF are u so creative i don’t understand!??!”   and to me it’s just something that i do every time when there’s paper scraps like at school or when u get a straw wrapper but he’s like shook bc it’s too girly for him and has kept the paper star in his car since then.\n\nalso the other day were talking about using my moms makeup and i said “oh yeah but that’s not sanitary” and he’s like “omg hell yeah SANITARY YOURE ALL SMART N SHIII” \nim like ???? do u not know what sanitary means? and in my head im like HOW TF AM I HANGING OUT WITJ A GUY THAT FLIPS OUT BC OF THE WORD SANITARY?! but at the same time i thought it was so funny!!! \n\ni met roger through my mom’s friend, he’s like her nephew or something. \nsooo spent the whole day smoking in his apt and abandoned the opportunity of meeting a new person who could have been great.\nalso now i’m scared that roger is going to get bored of me, even though i would never introduce him to my family i know i would feel so hurt if he didn’t want to see me anymore lmfao this sucks cause i don’t care for him but i like him and i want him to want me!! \n\ni don’t know why i keep investing in these relationships with men i know i don’t see a future with but it seems less scary than meeting someone new.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: was supposed to meet a cute boy for a date, flaked and spent the entire day smoking with a guy i don’t want instead.\n\n*ps: so sorry for the terrible grammar. this phone has the automatic punctuation turned off and i was too lazy to do it manually.
5	 I guess is it maybe somewhere in your heart you feel like you’re not ready for the commitment of a serious relationship yet so I guess it could’ve been for the best?
4	I’m a guy but I do that same kind of thing, not online. But I constantly avoid people (especially girls I think are pretty or cool) I know I want to talk to. I don’t know if it’s the same for you, but I realized that I avoid them because I’m scared I’ll get hurt again if I let them in.
17	What INFPs dream about while stuck in their alien corporate jobs	&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/dzvladdkpjh21.jpg
4	That's me! 😭😭 have so many ideas and than get distracted.\nUsally in the night they all sounds so cool and in the morning they are so unreal. Why? 
3	I'll settle with Fantasy Bookstore owner.
4	Hey don’t personally attack me like that 
2	I'd like to crochet blankets and sell them and somehow also have a million dollars from doing that. 
6	ISTJ-Probably the next worst thing for an INFP	I dated an ISTJ and she recently broke up with me despite me begging her to stay. She was very religious and expected me to do the same things she did. I made compromises but unless it's exactly her way, she doesn't see them. All in all, an ISTJ would never understand you. Don't bother explaining, just won't work.\nI think INFPs should seek out Ntypes. Stypes especially with a J function are the worst.
6	ENFP here who was MARRIED to and ISTJ.\nCan confirm, not the best combo. \n\nThey just don't get your emotional brain and have not much of a sensitive, creative or intuitive side.\n\nI think the Extraversion and Intraversion can work together, and the judgement and Perceiver can work provided, there's good communication and respect.\n\nBut I think feelers should stick with other feelers and Intuitives should stick with other intuitives.\nOr both. 
3	My father is an ISTJ. \nI try to avoid discussions with him because they won't lead to anything anyway, except for me getting angry and him not understanding my point of view.\nWe love each other anyway (just because we're related😂)
2	Same feeling with an ISTP and ISFP. \n\nENFJ might think our imagination is cute over realistic, they're continually supportive
2	That is rough. Breakups are never easy. I don't know though if it is fair to judge a whole group of people based on your interaction with 1 ISTJ. I am sure there are lots of INFPs who are in happy and healthy relationships with an ISTJ. According to socionics, INFPs and ISTJs make great activity partners, meaning they have fun doing activities together. There always has to be some form of compatibility too though. Meaning not all INFPs and ISTJs are compatible, but that does not mean all INFPs and all ISTJs are incompatible. 
2	xNxP is the best combo for me imo
2	I dated an ISTJ for a few months years back and things ended on good terms (though I'll admit it was still frusturating) when we continually failed to get on the same wavelength. We've stayed friends though and still enjoy eachothers company. I check in on him when I know there are things going that will cause him stress (Having to find a new apartment most recently, so much worry over such tiny details) and he checks in on me every three weeks on the dot then, in response to whatever panic-induced babbling I serve him, offers kind words with which are usually so fantastically off the mark and yet so consistant and warm that I've come to value them as much as the back and fourth of other friends who actually "get" me.   \n\n\nIt's like we're two very different people who have both taken the time to read the manual on how the other works and even though it's not natural in the slightest it feels nice to know that someone cares enough to go through the trouble.   \n\n\nI don't think it would have but I find myself wishing it had worked out sometimes. He's got some annoying politcal views I can't get past and I'm pretty sure my ~~occasional~~ constant dingy-ness drives him mad but there's just such a warmth there even if I have to squint a bit to recognize it. 
2	vision is not an attribute that is restricted to N types.  \nITSJ is a profile for someone with a perceived context of urgency / emergency. The priorities are survival and shortcuts toward results.  \nu cannot expect growth from them if you do not first resolve the context and all the unmet needs.
2	I mean, sorry that it didn't work out BUUUT. I couldn't disagree more. ISTJs are great.\n\nI think it's easy for people in subreddits like this to dismiss SJ types for dumb ass reasons because they don't really care to know more about them than what some uneducated generalization gives. *They can't understand my MIND~~~~ * The top post right now is a meme that's literally titled "haha 😂" and that's it. How deep can you really be here? \n\nAnd then I'm supposed to be with N/NF types? Theoretically, that's not true. TJs and FPs are our best match. And PERSONALLY, why would I ever choose an NFJ or NTP over an ISTJ? Big yikes from meI feel like they are the ones that could never understand me.\n
2	I'm dating a guy who I think is ISTJ, though he hasn't taken the test so I'm not 100% sure. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but I think we work really well together so far. Maybe this is because we share many of the same core values? \n\nDoes anyone (INFPs) have a positive experience being in a relationship with an ISTJ? This thread is really scaring me 😅

1	Good talk. You're certainly a well developed INFP
133	In case someone needed to read this	
7	Thank you. 
1	I'm scrolling through reddit trying to avoid thinking about how soon the doctor is going to do that nose thing to see if I have the flu \*cries\* tell me that is not worse than being sick......  I know it won't kill me but omg
1	I needed this. Or something like it. Trying not to think of a recent bad breakup. Should be looking for a new job and getting my life back together. All I'm doing is drinking and trying not to think of her.
1	Thank you for this.
3	Do you ever struggle with no will to invest into/build your life?	My BF (22M) who's an INFP role me last night that he struggles with a will to live.\n\nHe isn't financially responsible, he doesn't take care of his health, doesn't eat well, doesn't have any interest in pursuing further study, doesn't take care of his home. \n\nHe said it's not out of not knowing how to or being lazy. He said he simply just has no will to live and that what's the point if he does all this. \n\nConfirming: THIS IS NOT SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. \n\nYet on the flip side, he can be incredibly driven and obsessive over his work ethic, self image, career, travelling, being independant, being successful. \n\nIt's like the depression conflicts with his self-pride.\n\nAny insight for his girlfriend? We're pretty serious and I'm concerned he won't ever have a desire to build a life with me. 
4	I’m a 22F INFP and I can definitely relate to this. I have trouble eating everyday and tidying up and things most people just do. My fiancé will remind me to eat and will usually eat with me so that I eat enough everyday. We will usually set out days to clean together and we just jam to music. He reminds me to put half my paycheck into savings. He pretty much just helps motivate me in areas I need help in. And this is something we’ve had to work on and talk about. I help him with letting go and relaxing and he helps me be serious and get things done. I do suffer from depression but I’m doing everything to overcome it. I think you should talk to him and see how you can help each other grow and build together. I never had any money saved up at all and would always be broke before my fiancé. We just sat down one day and I was like okay you gotta help me here. 
2	Yeah I asked him to help but he was already mentioning I was bad with money and I couldn’t argue with him because it was definitely true haha. But yes if you want to help him with it sooner rather than later I’d ask him if he wanted to be better with money and then ask him if he wanted help with it. The reason I’m not good with money is because i honestly don’t care much for it it doesn’t motivate me but realizing I need it to get a house have a family etc it made me want to get better about it with some help. All the enfps I know are so sweet so I don’t think he’d be upset even if he didn’t want the help. We just suck at valuing money don’t hate us haha
1	My only 2 friends are enfp I love them! I think if you try to approach it nicely he will take it the right way. I know my enfp best friend is super independent and great with money and everything. I know you’ll be able to help in a caring way! I think it’ll work out for you! 
1	I don’t care for materialistic things. I just can’t make myself buy that stuff because I don’t care about it. Money in general isn’t what is important to me. I value my experiences and people way more. Money can’t buy happiness for me. I do buy things and get happy about it but usually I regret a lot I buy because I don’t even know why I bought it. I don’t enjoy being broke but there’s worse things to me. Right now I have a couple thousand and that’s the most I’ve ever had in my life. I impulsively buy things but I don’t care because money has no value to me. It’s so weird and I never know how to explain it to people haha 
1	Yes. I make sure all my bills are paid first before anything. I’ve always had a job since I was 16 and I just don’t like to stress over that stuff even though I usually do a little anyway 
3	Find myself stressing before meetings.	It's like this: I can prepare before hand. That's fine, but if I try to de-stress after that, what I really want to do is isolate myself and keep to myself until the meeting. But this creates a lot of guilt, because it feels like I should be somehow pumping up for it, getting into it. Breath exercises don't seem to work.  
7	INFP books	This week I picked up the book CIRCE written by Madeline Miller. And although I have only read 20% -  holy cow does she remind me of me (I am turbulent too). Circe is totally an INFP.  \nWhat are some books you have enjoyed that you can completely relate to the main character? 
5	Jane Eyre. At the start of the book, she's totally INFP, and when she grows up she's described more as an INFJ. Nevertheless, a great book.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSong of Ice and Fire has some good INFP characters - Samwell and possibly even Daenerys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia - one of my favourites, I relate to Lucy a lot. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Great Gatsby - I never saw anyone type Gatsby as INFP but I relate to him sooo much. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHarry Potter - everyone always says Luna, but I've always related more to Hermione (nerdy, kind of an outcast) and even Ginny (very shy at first but secretly a badass).

6	The Paper Kites: The Perfect ENFP Band (x-post /r/ENFP)	Thought that you lovely INFPs might like this post, too! ;)\n\nDiscovered them a couple of months ago through Spotify, and went on one of their concerts in Vienna this month. The videos and music itself just describe the feeling of being an ENFP perfectly.\n\n[Revelator Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fi4T-yR8tM) (have just recently discovered a similar vinyl bar in my own city, love it!)\n\n[Electric Indigo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWF5_wdqQj0) ("I don't like people, but I do love dancing!" lol)\n\n[Give Me Your Fire, Give Me Your Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybparFEZf2I)\n\nAnd many more! Check them out, really. You won't regret it! :)

2	I LOVE The Paper Kites. Oh god. I always keep talking about how more people need to listen to them. \n\n[Mess We Made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PUa2-LkTgE) is another great song.
2	Relationship search for infp expat	Hello all, I'm feeling a bit confused so thought I'd share my situation. I'm working abroad on a contract, in a country I don't think I want to settle long term. I think I would like to teach in Africa for a few years. I have two years left on my contract. I'm reluctant to start dating where I am now  as I'm not sure about settling here or taking somebody with me when I move. But two years is a long time to be single so not sure what to do. I don't really want to get involved with someone and then to leave them as it hurts. I'm 40 and had the same dilemma in the last place I worked and the pain of the separation was tough to bear. I have real wanderlust but it can be lonely! Any thoughts welcome, thanks
2	I guess its a tricky one...
1	Might have to be celibate for a few years :)
1	I guess it involves letting someone know early on what are some of your life plans such as relocating and discussing hypothetical situations and choices relating to it should things progress?
10	The Secret to a Good Life	Is understanding yourself.\n\nAnd understanding the world around you.\n\nThere's ups and downs and all kinds of confusing sh*t going on. The more you understand yourself, the better you are equipped to deal with this.\n\nI'm a fairly happy guy and I attribute this to the fact that Ive gotten to know myself.\n\nIf you understand yourself you can think more clearly, since you know your own biases. Sometimes I should to things but I hesitate. Earlier I might not have done these things but nowadays I do because I know and have accepted the fact that Im a slacker, and therefore I know there are somethings that Ill thank myself for doing later, despite hesitating.\n\nSimilarly there are things nowadays that I DONT do because I know that it isnt my style, and it saves me energy and time.\n\nIt helps in all sorts of situations. I know what to avoid and what to indulge because I know myself.\n\nI'm introverted, i dont care about status, I value freedom and empathy. This helped me choose a profession which I enjoy these days.\n\nI think we understand ourselves better by reflecting on our life, whether through writing or just simply by thinking, and by being honest with ourselves.\n\nSo get out (or in?) there and reflect and enjoy yourself. You are a truly unique being and you deserve to know and accept yourself :)\n\nhttps://professormofasa.wordpress.com
3	I agree wholeheartedly. Great and inspirational observations. Thank you!

6	Told my bff intj the truth	and it's likely I inadvertently activated her doorslam. :(\n\nI (infp, m) have a really close intj (f) friend. We've hung out as friends at least twice a month for some three years now, had great, long, random conversations (online and offline), shared ridiculous and dark-humor as well as gripes about life, and generally had a great time. \n\nI really liked her as a friend, gave her books I knew she wanted (that's proof, right?), listened when she needed to get things off her chest, and was happy as her go-to emotional sponge.\n\nShe was (surprisingly for me) really great to me on my birthday, treated me really special. Fell for her, simply because she was all physical and transparent with her feelings (an INTJ!) that day. Told her I loved her, a few days later. She loves me as BFF. Now on radio silence.\n\nFearful of the typical INTJ consequences when it comes to this. Really hoping against hope that I can be friends again.\n\nFML. I thought I was brave, saying so. With this new reality, I'm not sure I am. :(
6	Based on my similar experience with a male infj, she probably will be detached for a while to let you forget her. Maybe she will write you some brief and cold answers...Anyway she still cares a lot for you as a BFF. She's doing this for you.\n\nI know it will be so difficult to forget her, but the sooner you do, the better will be for both of you. I'm sure she suffers too in seeing you suffering for her.\n\nWhen this happened to me, I convinced him and myself I didn't see him in that way anymore, even if deep down I knew I still liked him (I did for months).\nI had to do this because I didn't want to lose him at least as a friend.\n\nI suggest you to meet new people, do something new and to keep watching around yourself... don't let this crush stop your life!\n\nAnyway, if you want to know how my story ended (but please don't think it will happen the same to you, I were just so lucky):\nAfter about one year we were still bffs and I was beginning to get interested in other guys around (even if I still liked him) and I was getting attentions by others as well...\nthen SUDDENLY he realised he liked me too!😂\n4 years have passed and we are still together now *blushes*
3	INTJs can be weird about feelings. She probably just needs time to process this and she's feeling really awkward right now. Let some time pass, then try to rekindle the relationship in a friendly way. Try extra hard not to mention any feelings for a while. 
1	Easy. You are already talking about her as a friend in past tense. Don't.\n\nNegative emotions associated with a relationship with someone don't mean it's over. I know I often don't contact people, because inside I believe we aren't on good terms. That they don't like me for some reason. It's just a side effect of the need for harmony in relationships, which I believe is a very INFP thing to do, but it's taken too far. Sometimes things simply aren't as good as they were. But it doesn't mean this won't change.\n\nThey sky isn't falling and you aren't bad for being brave - that's actually pretty cool that you can be so vulnerable. What did you learn?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a female INTJ friend I fell for once. Lately we meet maybe once in two months. We have a strange friendship, mostly because I have very chaotic lifestyle and she has a "boring" one. And I don't talk much through text or phone. I worry a lot about why I am the one initiating the contact, about if I wasn't focused too much on myself when we last spoke, or if I wasn't too serious, too focused on my problems. But regardless of that I know we are friends and we will meet and talk and if there's an issue, we will work something out.
1	And that's what the INTJ doorslam feels like.
31	My first digital painting, and first time to ever draw. Thoughts?	
5	Really beautiful use of colours! It gives a nostalgic and happy vibe, like the feeling you get when you watch a show that you loved as a kid :) 
1	Well done.
1	It's intriguing
404	This picture perfectly sums up my relationship with an INTP and I wanted to share.	
31	Aw, so sweet. 
20	I’m an INFP and my dad is an INTP.  It’s amazing how much difference one letter can make.  We’re on different wave lengths.  
13	I tend to gravitate towards INTPs the most. Theres a great amount of understanding I can have with them, and their love of debate is something I enjoy a lot. And yet they're so mysterious to me, which keeps it interesting.\n\n
7	This is me and my Intj too :)
6	me and my intp☺️
3	beautiful!  
3	Describes my relationship with my ISTJ pretty well!
2	Make this about friendship instead if romance and this becomes my best friend and me lol
3	they can be charming but I don't like them.\n\ndrawn to types that are kinder & more people-intelligent
1	I'm an INTP and can concur that out of 24 hrs in a day I'm either sleeping or thinking about something philosophical or may be about what could be happening at the same place I'm sitting at 1000 years in the past. 
1	This is so wonderful... I hope it can happen to me.
1	God I'm fifty fifty and I just wish I was artistically talented but....even if I was I'd never think so...so now I'm entering science and worried I'll be so bored

30	Is it normal for INFPs to be extremely picky about the writing in TV shows/movies?	Not so much about the overall plot, but the dialog between characters. Maybe it's the INFP superpower of detecting authenticity, but the moment a character says something thats just a little off for their character. I'm out!\n\nThis has become very problematic especially for TV series, where there are usually different writers for every episode and seasons.\n
7	I’m kind of the same. I have to either be invested because of something external or completely enthralled by the show or movie. My boyfriend likes to make fun of me for only liking fast-paced stuff but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
6	I find it easy to watch trash shows but bad acting/ overacting throws me off. 
5	I'm so picky with dialogue in movies. A good example was when I saw the last fast and furious movie in theatres cause my friends took me and I had to physically cover my mouth to keep from screaming at the dialogue and a lot of other parts.
3	I absolutely agree! I find it very cringy and almost unbearable if the dialogue and behaviour is not well-made, inconsistent with the character or simply irrational for that person. Very interesting for you to point that out!
3	I'm picky with the plots overall. Fake deaths, unrealistic or broken characters, everything that puts crowd pleasing ahead of quality, it all drives me mad.\n\nI've been trained to be critical by artistic hobbies, that obviously affects. But I think infp's also have a Sensitive eye to details and as Feeling we are more driven by art. Creative idealist, we are prone to perfection(ism) too.
2	i hate when the characters in the movie are just archetypal clichés
2	Watching terrible shows on tv makes my skin crawl and makes me feel nauseous. So yes. I can relate.\nI was in film school and had to watch other people's amateur movies. I have never felt so sick a couple of times. \nIt was something about the acting and writing. It was an awful experience and I felt terrible about it. I'm just too sensitive though. Swore I would never do that to myself again.
2	Yup, i kinda get called out on it too. I actually love slow movies and tv shows. I get its not everyone’s cup of tea. \n\nAlso bollywood omg, i dont understand how people can go and watch those meaningless movies with meaningless characters (not all the movies but most of it is usually crap) so i was talking to a friend about how its like people want to be stupid by choice and he got mad at me saying maybe its entertaining for them. He is probably right but yeah i find it insulting to watch something that assumes i am dumb (i mean this in the best sense possible) \n\nI cannot just pick a movie/show at random and watch it without reading reviews so to answer your question yes i am quite picky. \n\n
1	Kind of, but i also do theatre so acting + bad dialogue is very clear to me. Even though I watch it, riverdale is one example (but this time it’s bad acting+bad dialogue). I also easily pick up on weird tones, which words they mark. I can sit and re-say the lines like I think they should sound when watching tv
1	Same here..
1	Yes.  Also the acting.  I love trying to figure out what is going through the actors minds irl. 
1	Yes, realistic dialogue makes me feel so satisfied.
37	Greetings! From the Macedon Ranges, Australia	
3	Jealous. Reminds me of pics I used to take when I lived in Kentucky 
2	Beautiful! I’m jealous, here in Northeast USA is quite dreary. I like snow, but we haven’t had enough to make it pretty yet. It’s all been muck, and I miss the summertime.
20	Fellow INFPs, what are your thoughts on romantic love/relationships?	I'm not looking for advice here, just a discussion about love because it's such and abstract concept, especially when I've never even really experienced it. \n\nI've never been in a serious relationship and that doesn't really bother me, because I believe that one day I could find "true love" as it were. However, I believe that to have that kind of relationship I personally have to find a someone that I connect with on a deeper level, like (as cheesy as it sounds) a soul mate. Don't get me wrong, I don't believe that anyone is perfect. I know that relationships take work, and I love and embrace that our flaws are what make us human. But, I feel like my friends don't understand why it upsets me so much when they try to set me up with someone, or why I don't spend my time actively seeking out a romantic partner. I can't stand the thought of wasting my time trying to make something work when it was never what I wanted in the first place. SO--\n\nDo yall believe in soul mates and do you believe that your lover absolutely has to be one? \n\nIs love just an animal,chemical reaction that inevitably fades after time? Or does being a self aware creature drive us to break free from our instincts in search of a new path?\n\nAny thoughts you want to vent about love and romance in general? I'd love to hear them!! \n\nI just discovered this forum and I'm so happy that I could find a community of people who think similarly to me, like other INFPs I feel quite isolated in my real life so with topics like these I only have my own brain to bounce ideas off of,  when these are things I enjoy discussing with others and hearing new perspectives. 
19	I have the same perspective on love as you do. If it isn't permanent true love with one of "the ones" it makes no sense to me to have a relationship. I don't need someone who can balance me out, I need someone who is able to understand and connect with me on the deepest level possible.
9	>I believe that to have that kind of relationship I personally have to find a someone that I connect with on a deeper level\n\nYes! This is exactly how I feel too. I've grown to hate dating, and I'm sick and tired of using dating apps, and trying to meet people casually for the sole purpose of them being a potential romantic partner.\n\nI've been on many dates, but I've never been in a serious relationship. I don't think it's possible for me to end up in a relationship with someone who I don't already connect with and feel comfortable with. Also, I know that people always talk about "having butterflies" as a way of determining how they feel about a person, but I don't think such a feeling means anything but nervousness and excitement. Once the "honeymoon phase" is over, those feelings will fade away. It's just a dopamine rush, a cocktail of lust and adrenaline that goes when things settle.\n\nI think true love only has the capacity to grow, and is instead filled with a deep sense of contentment and comfort from the very start. Knowing that your soul truly connects with another person and you'll never have to question how you feel about them. Everything should just make sense. \*That's\* what I want. So I understand how it feels when you're trying to date when ultimately, you know it's not and is never going to end up being anything like what we've described. I just see it as a waste of time. However, I will admit, having some shitty experiences has made me trust and respect myself more. I know the kind of love that I require and deserve, and I know that trying to experience anything less than will leave me inadequate.\n\n&#x200B;
4	Love your questions!  Interesting that you use the term ‘soul mate’. Have you looked into twin flames at all?\n\nI think we all have the capacity to love any being deeply. If we tried long and hard enough, we could find something to bond over, which would result in love. But that tends not to be the case in our larger, more fast paced society these days, where not everyone wants to open up to that level. \n\nI believe we have many soul mates and then on top of that; the true (often underrated) magic is finding someone who commits to your relationship daily by choosing to be in your life while simultaneously challenging you to be the best version of yourself. While it would be nice, I Romanticise everything in my head anyway so there’s less pressure for my SO to provide sweeping gestures of romance. \n\nBut perhaps that’s because commitment & reliability are key components in love for me? 🤔 Are they for any of you? Sometimes I find it difficult finding the difference between my own emotional mapping and fact (I’ve heard that’s an INFP thing too). \n\nRegardless I totally agree with peanutbuttereverday in that you should live in your authenticity and then love will come to you. 
3	>Do y'all believe in soul mates and do you believe that your lover absolutely has to be one?\n\nI think of soulmates as another word for kindred spirits but with a more exclusive and (not always) romantic connotation. I used to think my lovers didn't have to be soulmates or kindred spirits (which was why I have loved and dated sensors in the past), but after meeting an INTJ man, and experiencing what it feels like to be deeply understood and being able to communicate so easily with him, I just don't think I could ever go back to dating someone who couldn't see or appreciate me fully in that way again.   \n\n\n>Is love just an animal, chemical reaction that inevitably fades after time? \n\nI think lust and infatuation can fade (or more fluctuate) over time, but that love can grow forever the longer you know someone. Think of the attachment you have with friends from school days compared to people you've only known for a short time. I guess the word for that is more bond than love. So bonds can grow stronger over time. Love is more of a choice one makes and a disposition one takes every day to see their SO in a loving light and be the best one could be for them.  \n
3	I don’t necessarily believe in a “soul mate” but I do believe that there are people out there who go fantastic together. The idea that two people can be better together than they are apart fascinates me. But I also believe that that kind of connection would take an immense amount of effort from both parties, love is a choice my friend. If you bank on a soul mate, one day you might wake up and feel differently about them. \nI’m not in a relationship and I’m only 20 so I’m by no means an expert. But when you find that person, make sure that YOU choose them to be “the one”.  Wake up everyday and choose to fall in love with them again. 
5	Idk if this is relevant, but I’ve always loved the saying ‘seek the life you want, and the love you desire will find you.’ I’m not sure if anyone says that, but it sounds right in my head haha.   \n\nI believe in soulmates-the few and far between people who you just click with. I have no idea if everyone has only one absolute soulmate though. Maybe we have romantic soulmates and platonic ones, too? \n\nI think love can be forever, but perhaps the essence or experience of it changes over time. Maybe initially it feels enthralling, but eventually it’ll lull into a reassuring warmth that’s always there and welcome. 
2	I believe in soul mates and in true love. \nMy point of view on love is sooo complicated but I really like how Fromm thinks about it even if it's very psychoanalytic. If you're interested you can read his book called "the art of loving", I really like it!
2	I think love with another being is something that's impossible for me. 
2	I love the idea of a relationship in my head more than the painstaking effort and all the time that it takes to build one up in real life. \n\nI don't think I am capable of being in love with anyone either.\n\n
2	i love everyone who loves me
2	I believe in soul mates because I found one and we felt a connection almost immediately!\n\nBut I also think love is too big a concept to fit into one word. There are many different kinds of love. Some are purely in the moment and fade after a while. Some are deeper and only grow stronger over time, and stay even when you're mad at that person. Some you feel by yourself and some you feel only when together. Some live in memories and some live in objects. None of them can accurately be put into words.
2	If it was a mere chemical reaction we’d be going off chemically with every person we met, but the soul is selective and only certain people set us off.I believe love at first sight is recognition of an ancient love.I would hope that infps not being driven by reason were still capable of feeling the poetics and majesty of love.I met my soulmate after knowing and dreaming he was coming for four years,I even dreamt of him with a piece of paper that had all the ancient Irish words for soulmate written on it,anam cara and others I couldn’t remember.
1	Don't think too hard about. I believe that those who overthink love are the ones who are always unsatisfied by it when they have it. It's a best friend you can do extra stuff with, but the friend part is important. We like our space, so it's got to be like a long distance same house relationship. That is my ideal. To wife me a gal that likes to do simple stuff and knows I'll be there to quietly hug her to sleep. (Memes here.) If you're looking for huge drama or action fight scenes, take your high expectations with you as I help you find your ideal guy as a wing man. I can not pilot that kind of ship.
12	I heard you like poems	Seeking shelter in your love;\n\nLonging for your warm embrace.\n\nWho I was, was not enough;\n\nNever-ending fall from grace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTouching what has closed my heart,\n\nWith all strength that still remains.\n\nGoing deeper into dark,\n\nI have found a man in chains.
1	A simple piece that manages to say a lot with few words. Admirable work!\n\nIf you'll allow me, i have one critique: watch your syllables, perhaps make them more consistent\n\nOther than that, its fantastic and instantly reaches to the heart
1	this is gorgeous. what does it mean to you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso could be reworked into a villanelle; those couplets are amazing.
30	I want to adopt you! [ENFP/M/21]	Ciao dear introverted soul! My name is Wes, and I'm conducting an experiment to determine if the MBTI world really makes sense. So far I've learnt quite some bit, and as I have understood by the help of fellow redditors, YOU might be the one I'm looking for! Alrighty, now that I have gotten you hooked, I'll tell you a bit about myself. I am Latvian, yet I study in Denmark. My dream is to travel the world, taste the world to be specific. I speak somewhat 5 languages, English being my second one. I write and I'm very creative. One day I will be working in the field of international  relations, as I have trouble staying in one place for too long. Gets too dull for me. I am very adventurous and I just love when a person supports me throughout my crazy schemes. I am not looking for anything specific, I just want a INFP test subject to understand if we truly click as great as I think we should. A quick chat,friendship, romance, love, marriage, sky is the limit!!! Age is also not something I care about. I'll add a picture of myself to encourage you to message me a bit more. https://imgur.com/a/C4Z4kRy
29	*Laughs in 86% introverted*
10	You sure do sound like a typical ENFP haha, but I don't really get what you're saying. What is it that you're asking of us?\n\nEDIT Ok I guess I'm too tired because now I saw that you're looking for a chat. Well, good luck with INFPs contacting you first haha. But you seem really nice and I wish you luck! 
9	You expect infps to message first huh good luck friend
15	This is friggin adorable
7	The combo really does work wonders, my brother is an ENFP and he is easily my best friend. We complement each other well. 
4	Definitely would like to read updates on how this goes. Sounds like an interesting penpal experiment. 
3	Aw, this is so charming. 
2	The person I'm closest to/most comfortable with is an Enfp who is also 21(me being 25). So I'm just gonna biasedly say that im sure you'll be pleased with whatever result you get 
2	I love this! I’m openly always seeking ENFPs; best friend / brother / mum. I love those connections deeply, so would love to chat...except, excuse me, I’m new to reddit and can’t find the right button ??
2	Oh, I’ve seen you before! Hello again
2	Hey Wes! 👋😁
2	The term "adopt" is giving me some really weird mental images so I'm just going to scroll past that one...\n\nHello Wes (Hi Dr. Nick!), I'm not necessarily sure what you are wishing to chat about, but I do sorta 50/50 in online conversations, Generally the other person messages first and I'll respond, generally the best way to get a response out of me (with opinions and thoughts), is to mentally interest me, (not sure if this relates to other INFP). Talk about a topic that both you and the INFP are passionate about (if it isn't passionate then a conversation will fizz out / be boring / not worth responding to). and just engage the person like crazy.\n\nIf we wish to talk about someone like me, you gotta get on my level, you gotta talk about things we both like, because someone like me, prospers in a response that shows equal (or more) interest in the subject that I'm passionate about.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm making sense or not, but if anyone else understands, please feel free to continue on what I meant
2	My boyfriend is an ENFP <3. He is such a light. 
2	Damn.. I would never put myself out like this. The balls you have to do so. I'm impressed.
2	It feels like I finally have someone who can keep up with my Ideas and put them into purpose. We work really well as a team, and remind eachother about things we often forget about on our own. He can run circles around me, but I always catch up and I am able to pick out the details! 
2	Dating an ENFP, oh boy seriously the best thing that's happened. \n\nI've dated lots of types, but this is by far what my soul has been needing. \n\nBest of luck to you!
1	My only two friends are ENFP! 
1	I made an online enfp friend recently (through reddit) and he's awesome. He's not as happy as you though. You look very happy... Are you ok?
4	Suggestions for coping strategies when you feel emotionally overwhelmed?	I really like meditation and there are a few monks I like to listen to give talks on YouTube, but yesterday at work was just the worst.\n\nThere were a lot of people having personal crises and I hadn't been able to sleep at all the night previous. I got to a point where I could physically feel the tension in my body. Even stepping out to the sunshine for a bit didn't help much
3	I withdraw and let them deal with their own drama. 
2	I usually don't deal with it *---*
2	1- Think about random stuff like spaghetti\nor\n2- Breathe through the mouth, hold your breath for a while (focusing on the belly button helps) and exhale slowly from the nose. Sounds weird but it works (thanks, daniel!)
2	Lack of sleep can ruin a day. Anything you can do to keep that in check will help greatly.\n\nBeyond that, some sort of meditation is great. Maybe have something you can repeat to yourself to calm yourself when you need to. Find a corner, close your eyes, breathe deep, and remind yourself that you get to go home at some point, the annoyances / tension may be gone tomorrow or you'll be feeling better and able to deal with them better. Breathing deep and focusing on good things.\n\nAlways remember (as hard as I know it can be) that you can't control others, but you can control yourself and how you respond to others. At my old retail job I semi-mastered the ability to roll with the punches. When something annoying or angering comes at you just pause for a second. Tell yourself "This is happening / going to happen, I feel this way about it, but I have to deal with it regardless of how I feel. What can I say or do and how can I act to provide the best possible outcome given the circumstances that are out of my control?" I would think like this in that pause after being presented with a stressful situation, and I'd do it in the form of a big sigh. That big breath and the pause to think are greatly beneficial. It's almost like saying "Please hold a moment while I consult with myself" and retreating into the safety of your mind to analyze a situation and decide what you can do.
2	Interesting that other INFPs (including myself) seem to withdraw if the issues aren't their own.\n\nI generally just drown the world out either by excessively sleeping, playing music or playing an immersive game.
49	His name is Dumpling!	&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/q59qdwmmmeh21.jpg
6	He is so cuteeeeeee. <3 Give him a hug for me :)
10	And his thoughts and feelings are valid.
2	Such a pretty boy☺️
2	this post made me very happy
1	He is so adorable!!! <3 Does he like cuddles?
1	Ahhh so cute! Hello Dumpling! :D
24	Worn aesthetics?	Do you guys find yourselves attracted to the more 'worn' look. I mean legit usage, not $150 jeans that someone cut and bleached. There is just something about a leather bag that's been passed down and has thinned out around the corners. A lighter that has worn down to the shiny metal. A pen with ink stained near the nib. A bag with patches sown on to keep its utility. A coin that's oxidized. \n\nI mean. New and modern is beautiful, don't get me wrong. But there is just something about an item that someone's used so thoroughly that even though it probably should be replaced, you just can't. \n\nSo...what do you have that's beautifully used? Mine is an old 360 controller. The rubber's worn off the analog sticks and the grey matte backing is shiny now. But it's perfect. 
6	I have a pair of Nikes I've had for about 10 years. The treads are rubbed down to nothing, the soles flattened out, their black now a dark gray, laces still in alright shape. I've repaired them with superglue dozens of times and they're still hanging in there, or only just coming into their own I'd say. They're easily the lightest and comfiest shoes I've ever worn, plus I've gotten my money's worth several times over by now. Looking forward to another 10 years!\n\nGive me something that looks lived-in any day. I'm tired of the modern aesthetic: everything bare, minimalistic, sharp edges, bright lights, solid colors and chrome. Especially if it's a coffee shop or a restaurant, it's not a relaxing or inviting look.
7	Yes,Japanese call this wabi sabi.
5	For me, I love old clothes. I like shopping at the thrift shop, it makes me happy to know that an item has had a whole life before I saw it, and a purpose and story for someone else like a hidden wonder that I can never know. I like that I can give it more stories, attach more memories, etc. And I love that I can give my clothes away to live a new life and bring happiness to a new person when i'm finished with them. Is that cheesy? lol. 
3	Not me. I mean I sorta like things to look slightly worn. Too new feels too weird and fragile to me. And too worn is like... eh... I wish I knew how to repair the thing.\n\nThat said, I think expertly and artfully repaired and modified things look neat as long as they fit or complement the original look.
3	Yes, I love thrift shops for this reason.
6	This is how I like my automobiles...used and worn....because I can “use” them and not worry about a perfect paint job, immaculate carpet...or a detail cleaning after every rain shower.  Low stress, lower cost and each one is unique in its own way when I get it. \n\nAnd other than cars. I love almost all things used. Each object has its own identity and life so to speak...👍🏻
87	Found something from last summer going through my Google Drive	
2	Appalachians?
2	i felt my shoulders relax seeing this 
60	I love you all and I love this sub	I am moved to tears of how how amazing it is to have found this community. :') In the middle of a cafe and I don't even care (crying a bit) , can you imagine. I feel much less misunderstood and much less "wrong" when I know I have all you who are the same, that I'm not the only one or alone.
7	That's precisely how I felt when I discovered this sub too!
5	Same here!
3	Cheers...you beautiful soul!
2	Love and snugs :) :)
2	I just found this sub! Everyone here seems so kind, and lovely, and calm 😭 It feels a bit like home
1	Yes. It's nice here. 💜
7	What do you think of death?	Been thinking about the end and what it means and all... Just wanted to know what you all thought.
6	It doesn't scare me that I will die someday, sometimes the thought is comfortable. But it terrifies me that the people I love will leave me and I can't stop it. I try to remember that death is as natural as life, and that truly I believe that our souls/energies live on somehow, in a way that cannot be seen with the naked eye. 
5	I wouldn't care. \n\nAt all\n\nAlmost\n\nNot suicidal or anything 
4	i not afraid of dying, just afraid that in the afterlife i’ll never see the people i love again. if i don’t, then i guess it makes our time together more meaningful, but the thought of never seeing them again terrifies me
3	Where can I sign up
3	I thought about death to the point where i put myself into psychosis. It was scary because of the thought that earths life span is finite. We will be converted into different energies and masses after we pass. I got to the point where i just straight up picked a religion to make myself sane again. The idea of non existence freaks me out sometimes. Now i have belief in heaven and the like.\n\nJust gotta enjoy life because its so short when you start thinking about it. Time flies so fast. I found that keeping a journal saved my sanity. Now i can look back on memories in detail and think about all that ive done. Its still scary sometimes but death has become the least of my worries.
2	The old Hymn “I’ll fly away” brings me peace when I think about it. One of my all time favorite songs. 
1	I believe life is just the way back home and death is the entrance. Or if im wrong it doesnt matter i think it would be like sleep. Im sometimes a little bit tired of live, of the ups and downs, emotions, helplessnes, happiness. So i like the thought of falling asleep and never wake up. 
1	Death brings comfort knowing that there is an end. Eventually none of this really matters. Makes things less stressful. 
1	My dog died years ago and I frequently think of us reuniting when I die.\n\nNot afraid of death but afraid of how I’ll die and how my family would feel.
1	For the most part, no one has died and came back to tell us what’s on the other side. It’s a huge mystery I will have to experience. I don’t want to die anytime soon but it is something I’m vary curious to know what’s on the other side.
1	I dont fear my own demise. But i hate the idea that the people around me will leave me someday. 
15	The War of Life	In a world where our brains are meant to triumph over our hearts and souls, we are among those most vulnerable to failure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut that is also our greatest strength. While we may lose the battle of careers, money, and status, we can still win the games of meaning, purpose, and fulfillment. And those are the battles that win the war. 
3	We are the Medics, Nurses, and Doctors on the Battlefield of Life....everyone is trying to kill each other at every moment on the frontline. All the while, we wait for them all to fall and give them back their most precious gift and demonstrate to them that all the things they may have been fighting for were actually pointless and of insignificant value. ✌🏻
2	beautiful
1	Maybe our instincts know which battle are worth fighting\nI wish i could interpret the mechanisms that measure worthiness.
3	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 19	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
8	Yay, hit another depressive arc in my cycle. Time to release the demons.  \n  \nFear? Yep. Anxiety? Right here. Hopelessness? Mhmm. Lack of motivation, unable to see anything good happening as the result of my action? Got it all right here in me. And for the topper, I no longer want to do anything for a while despite having something to look forward to.
4	Is there anything wrong with saying or having the 'philosophy' of telling people "you'll see how you feel when the day/time arrives" or "ask me when it's closer" to events? Other than I guess.. events that require pre-planning or early registration.\n\nI ask because I feel like a lot of the time I may say I want to do something today but when the day actually arrives my mood might be in a totally different place and I don't wanna go anymore.
3	Did giving up, voluntarily, something you held dear initiate productiveness development?
3	when you write out a huge response and by the time you're done, the post is locked. cool, cool, cool. totally not a waste of my time or anything 👌
2	Hi all! I'm new here. Anything I should know? \n\nAlso, I was idly wondering if anyone ever downvotes anyone on this subreddit. Is that a thing that happens?
1	I know everyone has a different approach to things but I just don’t get angry, explosive people. 
1	People confuse me so much, I suggest something that I believe is correct and people just stare at me like I've grown a second head...\n\nWhy is my opinion any less valid than the other's opinions around me?
1	just got diagnosed with ADD aND EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE NOW
15	How to stop being upset about not being the best	I swear I suck the fun out of everything. It just seems as though every time I have a hobby or something that I’m supposed to be good at, I can’t help but feel envious when someone is better than me. These feelings ruin almost every activity because no matter what I tell myself I’m constantly comparing myself with others and I can’t help it. 
5	Jealousy stems from insecurity.  It's not about the other person it's about your insecurities.  Why do you feel insecure?
3	I have this problem, too. I've been drawing my whole life. I'm damn good, too, but there is always someone who's better. It's literally the reason why I changed majors and opted to be a teacher instead of a concept artist.\n\nThose who can, do. Those who can't-
2	Just ask yourself questions whenever you feel insecure about anything. I learned this particularly after going out during my party days and being slammed with anxiety the next day.\n\nThe only thing that stopped it would be to ask myself “are other people doing similar things? Do other people notice these same flaws in myself? If they do, will they remember it in a week? Are these people I care about? Am I feeling inseure about something I did or said that was silly/funny/something that will be a funny story? Etc.”\n\nAnd then I started applying this methods to any intrusive thoughts. If I start really getting down on my art for example, it’s “can a random person off the street do this? Was I doing this for pleasure or to sell it (I don’t sell)? Do I recognize what is off? (Then it’s a learning experience) if I showed this to a random person, will the odds say that they’ll think it’s neat at least a novelty level that I can create something like this? Do I like parts of the whole at a bare minimum (experience of creating, color, character, linework, medium, etc)? “ etc\n\nThen it’s not a waste and it’s easier to see the value in an experience that my intrusive thoughts are hellbent on ruining 
2	I try to divide my goals of interest in small little pieces and attempt to be in love with the process
2	I want to tell you that you shouldn’t compare yourself to anyone else since you don’t know what they had to get through to get there. Only compare yourself to your past self. That being said I’m guilty of doing the same thing as you. I just hate knowing I will probably never be good as other people.
2	Classic judism INFP	I was wondering if anyone is what I would call a "classic Judism INFP". \n\nBasically you believe in God Buddha Jesus angels and saints. You think with your heart and not your logic or intelligence. \n\nYou have a messy room. You do things based on spontaneous direction and you don't really plan ahead. \n\nAlso I think people relate their emotions as an Empath like - positive negative. In psychology positive emotions are happiness joy and love peace while negative is anger sadness hate and stuff. \n\nIt can be taken a step further and said that - positive emotions are good and negative emotions are evil. In terms of an Empath as they judge label their emotions as positive negative or good evil. \nFurthermore ....\n\nI was just wondering if any INFPs feel like an idealists but also feel kind of Empath and classic Judism. \n\nI was just wondering. \n\nLastly - I don't know why people say INFP are introverts - I feel as an INFP ( a classic Judism one at that) I treat everybody with kindness and talk too much or like to be in large crowds. \n\nAnyone else like this ? 
2	is this what people hear when we talk? :)))))\n\n(just kidding; but what do you mean infps arent introverts? isnt the I from introverted? aka getting tired from people& socializing as opposed to getting energized by it?) 
2	I don’t believe in buddha but this post def sounds like it’s describing me

3	That contrast between tulipans and snow, stunning.

9	Needed somewhere to vent.	Hey all, I hope someone can relate because I feel so alone lately.. To be honest probably for the last 2-3 years. Nothing keeps my attention long because I get bored so fast I can literally be extremely excited about learning something knew or doing something new and within 10 minutes I'll be staring into nothingness thinking about god knows what, probably something I did when I was 8 years old or dreaming some new exciting scenario about my future life which will never come to fruition. I struggle to make and keep relationships with people because I always feel pressured to constantly be talking or entertaining and for some reason I seriously struggle opening up to anyone which causes people I care about to slowly drift away so I've found myself purposely cutting myself off from the world even my family to protect myself? I think.. God that sounds pathetic. This is making me incredibly lonely which in turn is making me irritable and I really hate the person I'm becoming.. I spend all my time alone. I'm never satisfied with anything and I've always got this sense of 'there must be something more, this can't be it.' I'm 26 years old and I truly have no idea what I'm doing with my life or what I want to do with it.. I'm just really feeling lost at the minute and was just wondering if anyone here has felt the same and if they've managed to shake it all off? Sorry to ruin your day with my sadness! 
4	I feel the same way fairly often. I especially feel like I have to entertain people or else they won’t like me anymore. What I would say to you is to try new things (yes, I know everyone says it, but it’s true). You don’t have to do major things just see if there is something small which you can get into and really focus on. This will bring some of the excitement back to your life. I’ve recently started training for a new entry level job and it has made a huge difference. Don’t allow yourself to settle into the normal groove of daily life. You have to just try new things even though it is super hard sometimes. I hope this helped in some way. Just know that we can relate to how you feel. I’m here if you ever went to talk or anything like that. Don’t be a stranger! 
2	Do you have someone you can talk to about your feelings?\n\nThe INFP traits say we are hard to get to know and difficult to understand. We hide our true selves for fear of being misunderstood - I know I do. That can leave us feeling particularly lonely. Those that do get to know us tend to be lifelong friends. There are two people I consider to be close friends. \n\nDo not feel guilty for taking time to yourself. Sometimes it is much needed. Recharge your batteries and try again another day.\n\nMy thoughts run around in circles as well. Negative memories haunt me much more frequently than positive ones and can plague me for days if not much longer. These thoughts have made me feel depressed and very alone. \n\nA big thing for me was finding my outlet. Writing worked wonders for me. I started as a young buck in a journal. I moved on through life, changing to poetry and dabbling in other projects. Ultimately, I found poetry worked best. Just putting my feelings on paper always helped me to sort out what I was feeling and helped me to find the source of it. It takes a while to get to the bottom of it, but it’s so worth it when you get there. An ounce of clarity goes a long way. \n\nFind your coping mechanism whether it be writing, exercise (whether it be going for a walk or yoga), meditation etc. \n\nThere are some coping mechanisms in this article that help to deal with stress and better your emotional health. I hope one or more of them works for you. \n\nI am personally guilty of a few maladaptive mechanisms here. Thank you for reminding me to better myself. \n\nhttps://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/coping-mechanisms
2	I do have a couple of close friends I've known for a lot of years but I still don't think I could talk to them about stuff like this I feel like they would just make fun of me and then I'd laugh it off like I always do while feeling absolutely terrible inside. I did use to read a lot of books when I was younger and get lost in the world's I'd created for myself relating to the book.. Maybe that's something I should revisit. Thanks a lot for taking the time to reply I really appreciate it, do you ever post your poetry anywhere? I'd love to take a look. 
1	I'm in the same boat. I have a huge fear of talking about how I really feel. People drift away because I never talk to them or put any effort into the relationship. I'm also hesitant to make friends because it seems like it would take so much effort... and then I feel like a horrible person for not wanting to do normal things. I've been getting increasingly isolated. It's lonely, but seems less painful than trying to relearn how to be human. I just pretend to be normal when I'm around people. I have good days, but some days it feels like everything hurts. You're not the only one! I hope you find your way to a happy life :)
1	It seems like our souls lack affinity with simplicity. Our font of joy always needs to be intertwined on a multi dimensional level so we can bear the overwhelming, as contradictory as that sounds.\n\nMy advice is:\n\n divide your goal into molecular level size pieces and explore thoroughly their inner mechanisms. You might find something unheard of which ignites desire, motivation in the form of novelty. \n\nThe human brain was designed to engage in positive emotion as we further our horizons. That can happen internally also, maybe that's what people mean when they say: learn to love the process. \n\n_Journey more important than destination and all that crap._
3	Who else struggles with “intensity” in relationships?	Okay so I feel like I’ve absolutely had bad habits instilled in me due to hookup culture. I’ve literally self sabotaged every good thing I’ve had because I try not to “try too hard” which makes me seem uninterested to those that like me because I’m trying really hard not to be needy and/or annoying. \n\nI’ve recently stopped doing that and just decided to express positive emotions because like... obviously it’s worse to make people feel like they’re not enough than to make them feel like you can be too much at times. But yeah, now my needy side is out, and omg... cannot find a proper balance.\n\nIt’s always intense. One end of the spectrum or the other. Why is dating so hard 😂
3	I am right there with you. Its so difficult. You care for them and either you are true to that and freak them out or you end up pushing them away. Dating sucks. Its terrible. I wish the person you are meant to be with would just show up like heyyyyy.\n\nDo you happen to also attract confusing people? 
5	INFJs and faking it??	I'm an INFP and my best friend is an INFJ. I'm always kind of scared that she's lying to me about whether she's okay because I feel like I can't tell. She'll tell me that I only tell when she's lying when she lets me. Reading about how INFJs can fake it really easily only makes me more worried. I always feel like I can't tell what she's feeling and I'm scared that I'm not a very good friend. I'm worried she thinks I'm a horrible person or I'm really violating her values or something and she just doesn't tell me. She's the nicest person I know and super amazing, I just had to let out some of my worries for a bit. 
8	Can confirm. INFJs do hide their true feelings even with a close friend. Because they think their inner world is too complicated and not worth discussing. You can try and make them open up more but it might get awkward. I tried that with a close INFJ friend of mine when I was feeling extra helpful and he ended up crying and shutting down more. Sometimes it’s best to just let people be. 
2	My bestfriend is also INFJ and he can do this as well. He is kinda self-sustaining in general and likes to handle things on his own. Best thing I can do is just give advice on the side or emtional support.
2	I used to feel the same for my infj best friend. honestly, you cant control what she wishes to tell you or not tell you. and although worrying is like second nature to us infps esp wen it comes to the well being of our loved ones, all you can do is ask them if they're doing okay often or wen u even see the smallest signs of distress. just let them know that wen they need you, they can come to you without a thought. I think the biggest thing for infjs is to know that someone is looking out for their well being while they are out looking after everyone else.
1	Tbh opening the floodgates is a huge risk. It’s really difficult to regulate what happens once we decide to say the truth and alienating even our closest friends is a big possibility.
1	You can placebo yourself into INFJ pretty easy...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n^(I might of done it myself..)
139	Dang it, I keep finding them	
2	Thanks for the post, how is your week going?\n\nI've certainly resolved to be that change! It's hard because I'm afraid of everyone and subconsciously think they'll treat me poorly. Trying out some advice to treat strangers as if they're already your friends, which I hope will bring out the best in them as well as me.
2	Traders Joes is the only place I am cool with small talk to a degree, every other place I can't stand when they ask if I need help, or all of that. 
1	OMG I’ve literally had so many panic attacks in the Trader Joe’s parking lot just trying to prepare myself for small talk with the staff. 
8	Anyone else really struggle with organization? Does anyone have any tips?	My room is a mess. Everytime I attempt to clean it I just get overwhelmed. I know it's dumb. Any tips?
7	I have an huge exam next week and I procrastinated sooo much for months. The only thing that helps me is the anxiety for the deadline, but I easily get distracted anyway.\n\nHow nice is not feeling alone anymore!\n\nAnyway, another good thing is forcing ourselves to use a bullet journal, especially when we have so much to do. \nPersonally, I divide big tasks in many small ones and set a deadline for each (like by 2 hours, for example).\n\nGood luck!\n____\nOh sorry, didn't read about your room.\nYou can use the "do one thing at a time" method for that too! \n\nThe real struggle is seeing all of the stuff to do (like my exam and me) but if you just see one little thing first you will do it easily!
5	Typically I just live in the mess. Then every once in awhile, when things in my life get really bad, I clean and organize everything I see to keep my mind off of things. The irony is that when my room is clean, it’s because the mess has moved to my mind. Poetic I suppose, but also accurate. 
5	I let my clutter pile up like the problems in my life, and then when I reach peak levels of anxiety, I stress clean to procrastinate on all the important things I need to do *cries*

24	Why are INFPs seen as the softies of the MBTI?	All I see online are flowers, hearts and bunnies when describing INFPs, really ticks me off that.\n\n
22	Because INFPs who have had the privilege of being coddled in life usually are pretty soft.  I had an extremely hard time until I learned how to hide my hypersensitivity.\n\nAlso, flowers, hearts and bunnies are soul rejuvenating.  
16	We're not aggressive with pushing ideas and we're fairly open-minded.
13	Hard on the inside, soft on the outside.  We get called crybaby a lot, and I kinda don't mind, its like whatever's, I gotta express myself. 
9	Because so many of us insist on it. 
7	What symbol would you choose, OP? \n\nI am certain there are better ways to represent this group than flowers etc. However, the freedom and spirit of nature is probably the closest thing to represent me, personally. Maybe a starry night sky with a few thinly veiled clouds barely hiding a bright crescent moon. I know of nothing man-made except maybe poetry/art that describes my inner turmoils and other likenesses. I realize though we are all similar, we are also different.\n\nOutwardly, I am a ball of sunshine and optimism. But also a huge crier.. No matter the emotion, it seems to surface without much control. However, I am still embarrassed by it and adjusting to it. Unfortunately the embarrassment only amplifies my tears. Especially at work. I have a high stress job, and I would utterly implode if the tears were not allowed to escape. \n\nI wish there were a way to turn off the faucet without changing the structure of who I am, but I have not yet succeeded in finding this avenue. My coworkers just say I “care too much.” Which isn’t wrong, but it’s also far too simple an answer for my liking. 
6	Probably because underneath my hardass front I am a softy... haha 
1	We act cold and aloof on the outside when in fact we're very sensitive on the inside
1	Not lyrical but will do for the time being	Talking about yourself don't sound much like an INFP but bear it with me\n\nI'm at a turbulent period and also on my early twenties, feels like a wise Fox trying to make partnership with adventurous bunnies\n\nMy source of fun is so close yet unnacessible, without a piece of that pragmatic living, life seems insurmountable.\n\nBeing an aimless contributor to society seems too plain, my mindframe is one to blame, full of stained principles to set aflame\n\nWhat I most desire is to be satisfied with simplicity, what to do if contradictions rule my city, what must be done to subtract disappointment yet maintain the mistery\n\nThrough indulgence I feel my taste for novelty getting ruined, a void filled with emptiness expands inside. I knew it all this time, to let go of what I love most, is what I must abide\n\n_Notes from a noble enterprise._
6	A few positive thoughts on using Tinder	I've (23f) been using Tinder for a few weeks now and just wanted to share a few thoughts on my experience - particularly as it relates to my introversion - since a lot of people here seem to hate it.\n\n**\[TL;DR at the end\]**\n\nA bit of background: I've always had difficulty talking to people in large groups like parties, work mixers, networking events, and I've never gone out to a bar or club with the express aim of meeting people. Any time I've had a crush on anyone I knew through school or work, I'd retreat far away and just observe them at a distance, grasping for hints that they might even think of me a little bit. This has obviously been very counterproductive, and to this day I've never been in a relationship because a) I'm not gorgeous (although I've been told I'm cute) and b) everyone, including friends, think I'm uninterested in other people until they get to know me well. I've never been good at navigating tricky social situations - finding out whether someone is single or not, feeling out whether they're interested in you, etc. I'm also very quiet in person, which leads to a lot of people not hearing me when I talk and assuming that I have no personality.\n\nA few months ago, however, I got sick of feeling unloved and undesirable because of my inability to show interest (which is something I'm trying to change), so I made a tinder account just to try things out. Since then, I've managed to get quite a few good conversations going with interesting people who are willing to talk about things we like, and I even went on a date - the first one in my life (and did other things, although that's a different story). The reason it's worked well for me is that there's very little emotional risk to texting strangers as long as you put yourself in the right mindset - I went in with zero expectations and consciously reminding myself to not take rejection personally. Sometimes people don't reply to messages, and that's fine - maybe they found someone else more suited to them, or they're looking for a hookup, or they're just not interested in a serious conversation - in which case you wouldn't want to talk to them anyway. Not everyone is interested in having a meaningful conversation in the same way as you, and that's perfectly natural. But the fact that I can text people without having to pay attention to how I look, or dress, or sound, or my posture, or whether I can follow along with the conversation etc - all of the things that I'm self-conscious about - has done wonders for me being able to show people more of my personality without the social awkwardness. It's less draining than having to go out to social events, especially because I am MUCH better at expressing myself on paper (or screen) than on the spot in person. I'm still trying to work on my self-confidence in person, but it helps. Another benefit is that when you're having a conversation on text (and if you manage to go on a date) is that it's solely between you and the other person - you get more of a chance to express what you're thinking and the other person's attention is focused on you, which is great if you struggle to make yourself heard in larger groups (like me).\n\nA few things that have helped me so far:\n\n* **Be yourself, and be honest about your introversion.** That's the best filter for people who can't handle weirdness/awkwardness/quiet/whatever your quirks might be. It might suck to be rejected or ghosted based on your personal qualities, but at least you know that it wouldn't have worked out anyways.\n* **Quality, not quantity.** Even if you have only one good conversation with a match, and even if you don't have a lot of matches, it's better than having many meaningless conversations, hoping that at least one of them will evolve into something more. Take your time, and get to know what you like. It's much less tiring to focus on one person than ten people.\n* **Read the bios!!!** I automatically swipe left on people without anything in their bio, or something really vague and non-descript (although that is a personal preference), no matter how attractive they are. How am I supposed to talk to someone if they don't write anything about themself?\n* **Interesting pictures.** If you're not conventionally attractive, as in my case, maybe try to make your pictures interesting - weird faces, memes, whatever (although you should include at least one picture of yourself). It adds personality into your bio, if that's what you're looking for.\n* **Patience!** If you don't get any matches or if people ghost after a few lines of conversation, that doesn't mean it's the end - just keep trying.\n* **That said, don't invest TOO much of your attention into the app.** Keep trying, but don't let it take over your life. There's a life to be lived off the app, and if you focus on it too much, the rejection or the burnout from endless swiping through unappealing profiles will get to you, and it'll weigh down on you unnecessarily. I generally only answer messages twice a day (if people have a problem with this, explain, and if they still don't like it, good riddance) and only go through different profiles once a day or sometimes a few days apart, if I'm not feeling it.\n\nOf course, this won't work for everyone. I've noticed a lot of INFPs here don't like texting, and in that case, I don't have a solution. But as someone who writes much better than I speak (at least in initial stages), it's been a breakthrough once I abandoned all of my hangups and prejudices against Tinder. I'm still learning how to navigate first dates and afterwards, but I do feel like I've gotten a leg up because of the app.\n\nSorry that this got so long, and thanks if you've read it all! I just wanted to share because I think a lot of INFPs dismiss the app for being shallow (which it definitely can be), but you just have to know how to use it in a way that benefits you.\n\n**TL;DR:** Tinder works for me and my specific preferences because I have a pretty good idea of what I want, and actively trying to manage my feelings and anxieties when things don't work out the way I want.
1	http://gotinder.com/@pepacioretrasovich\n\nMy account is not serious, but if I ever saw this on tinder I'd give that person my entire existence
3	What kind of job do you have?	Im curious to know what kind of professions/jobs you INFPs have currently or would like in the future. Are you content with it? How does your INFP traits help you with your work? I currently work as a line cook. An extremely grueling and stressful job. Very long and hard hours. But its also very rewarding at the end of the day. Im proud to have created something for the public to enjoy and consume. Maybe making their day just a little brighter with the food i prepared for them, even if it is just for a moment. In a weird way i feel that my infp brain being filled with chaos and constant rumination helps a lot with the stress of his job. Especially when it gets really busy and the tickets on the line are just endless. I almost feel like im in a state of flow, total distraction from my usual self loathing and ruminating thoughts. Its amazing really, Id compare it to a meditation practice. My chaotic brain fits into the chaotic environment of the kitchen very well. 
2	I’m currently going to school for a Christian ministry degree. I really enjoy helping people even though I have a hard time talking with new people, I’ll probably end up doing some kind of overseas mission work. I like looking back on each day and thinking that I’ve made some kind of positive impact on someone’s life, regardless of how small. I’ve found helping the big man further his plan is a good way for me to do that. 
1	I work in an office, it's a really easy job that I don't have to think about once I'm off work. Leaves my evenings and weekends free for whatever I want. And it's a stable career building towards retirement eventually. But I'm not really happy with it. There's no real "purpose" to it, so it's not really fulfilling. 
1	Music as a Tool to Connect w/ Distant Loved Ones?	TL;DR: Left home due to abusive situation and hurt my brother. We were very close. I looked up to him. I listen to music he introduced me to in order to still feel connected, but i’m makes me sad simultaneously . \n\nMy brother and I have recently been torn apart by family drama and his battle with addiction. He chose to side with my abusive family, but i’m sure his substance abuse plays a role in this. I don’t blame him, he’s young and still finding himself. My brother has always been my best friend through the ups and down. He’s always understood me and just let me be without trying to make me into someone i’m not. I notice I look for him in friends and romantic partners but always come up short. \n\nHe’s an intp and we have that sweet soulful connection. I definitely feel a past life connection with him. The T and F differences can be obvious at times. He can be insensitive when he doesn’t understand something. But he makes it up with his actions. He’s always kind of been an emotional caretaker/protector for me, even through our dealings with our fucked up family. \n\nI was struggling really hard towards the end of last hear and was fighting my own battles with addiction and suicidal ideation. I got alcohol poisoning and was hospitalized and kind of spiraled after that. Once he found out, he tried his best to be more attentive. Would always take me out to hang out with him and his friends and would smoke me up. I struggled with paranoia and weed in the past, so he was patient and helped me find a strain that worked like it was supposed to (Sativa). He introduced me to my favorite artist (Jhene Aiko) and he trip sat me through my first dance with Psychedelics. \n\nHe’s a Pisces and I’m a Virgo, so astrologically we are known as Sister Signs. A lot of my development has a lot to do with this kid even though he’s two years younger than me. We both are children at heart but he’s a little bit better at adulting xD \n\nI miss him terribly... I feel like there’s a hole in my heart. But he can’t understand my perspective because he was the golden child. I’ve been having withdrawals from being in a safe house because I can’t drink or smoke and so i’ve been relying on music to help me through this rough patch.\n\nI just realized that half of my playlist is composed of songs that he’s introduced to me and idk... it’s weird. I can’t stop playing the songs but it’s also too painful. I want to feel connected to him so i’ll play the songs. But I can’t help but break down when I hear certain songs.\n\nWhen we were on our way to pick up the LSD for my first trip, he set the mood with a Kid Cudi Album. I remember feeling so free and just so happy to be with him and finally enjoying life for once. I remember him teasing me to “Dance 4 Eternity” and we had this really silly sing along. It was my favorite moment with him. \n\nSorry for the really long rant. I just don’t know what to do with this hurt right now \n\n
35	I talked to her today	Well rather she talked to me, that girl I had opened up to and had been slowly falling for asked me to talk today. She said she could tell that I had feelings for her and she said she didn’t want to lead me on. I guess her telling me that is better than me continuing down that path and getting hurt worse. \nI wish I wouldn’t fall so easily, because I honestly shouldn’t be hurting as bad as I am. I opened up to her one time, which for most people isn’t a big deal but for me it was. \nAnyway, I suppose getting hurt so many times will only make me appreciate my future wife more when I find her. But that doesn’t make it hurts any less right now 
15	That’s a nice way of her though
8	Yeah she did what few have the matzy to do. Which is AWESOME! I wish more people would do that.\n\nBut I'd say that you might wanna practice being more open.\nIts the very same reason you get attached so easily and get hurt so much.\n\nBecause if you keep things bottled up inside you are giving it exactly what it needs to build and build into something much bigger and more able plus likely to hurt you.\n\nIf however you are more open this sort of thing doesn't greatly affect you. Give it a shot 😁\nJust picture how you're currently doing thing like a pressure pot with the seal locked shut.\n\nSlowly but surely the pressure builds and builds and builds until the casing it creaking and bending and unless the valve is released very lightly the pressure pot is gonna blow. Give yourself a safety valve to relieve the pressure.
3	As disappointing as these things are, I'm glad she was courteous and honest. Sending lots of love your way today. 
2	Bathe in the suffering, you are truly alive
2	Something similar happened to me last year. I had a crush on this girl I was in a volunteering project with. The thing is, she was 24 while I was 21. We were together for what I though was a date, when she asked me if I had feelings for her. \n\nEven if I had tried there's no way I could have denied it. I'm glad she was so respecful in the way she said it wasn't mutual though. I was heartbroken, but now I feel lucky because, it could have been way worst and I've been able to get over it much quicker.
17	There is nothing more infuriating than over-the-top, obviously phony praise.	There's praise, and then there's this. You all probably know what I'm talking about. Its just so off-putting when it happens and you spot it straight away. It comes off as manipulation to me. Like the person doing it is just trying to get their way and will say whatever it takes.\n\nReminds me of when I used to work at Starbucks. That job forever ruined the phrase "you rock" for me. Trainers were told to use that phrase as part of their "encouragement" to employees. They all said it, and somehow never connected the dots that because they all said it it was so obvious what they were doing.\n\nAnyways, you all rock!!! Keep up the good work!!!! You're the best!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!1!!!!! /S
7	Yeah. I hate it too. Most praise makes me uncomfortable but especially so when it's phoney. Ick.
4	Phony. Yes. Correct word
3	Same here. It's extremely irritating. And that was really cheesy, what they did at Starbucks .\n\nMy social circle already knows that I'm really quiet, introverted, bookish and a little strange. One day, a co-worker comes and tells me "You're a ladies man, you just don't know it yet". Sorry, but to me that reeks of pure mockery.
2	They're trying to get you to do your job for free.
5	What do you score on the DISC assessment?	https://www.123test.com/disc-personality-test/\n\nI scored C on this version and others. I'm curious about y'all?
1	A: Compliance - 44%\n\nB: Steadiness - 37%\n\nC: Influence - 18%\n\nD: Dominance - 2%
1	46% compliance; 39% steadiness; 9% dominance; 6% influence 
1	.08% C, 84.1 S, 78.8 I, 75.8 D 
1	D 45%, I 7%, S 34%, C 15%
1	Compliance: 35/ Steadiness: 30/ Influence:25/ Dominance: 10
1	Steadiness: 36%\n\nInfluence: 31%\n\nCompliance: 28%\n\nDominance: 5%\n\nPretty different than most everyone else, but not necessarily a bad thing :)
339	Build therefore your own world.	
9	This makes my heart happy 😌
8	I think all the time about how to exist in this world, and be sane.  'Cause this world does not make sense.
5	One can only ponder what this was in reference to.
8	Life Being a Struggle For Us?	As I read more and more on this page which I love doing because I feel so connected and that I'm not the only one to feel and think some of these very same things everyone posts about on here. The question comes to mind though just as I have struggled in life pretty since day one it feels like, and so many others on here. Is that just the normal life for an INFP? a life of struggle? The only time I don't feel like everything is a struggle is when I have a day off with nothing that needs to be done, and can just do whatever I want. Which those days are pretty much turned into a few hours here and there as I get older. While most people would call this a form of depression and probably two or three more things, but is this just the way we are? With so many people with the exact same feelings and thoughts about life to the point of having the exact same scenario play out in real life for a totally different person but with the same outcome just really gets me thinking. If we as INFP's were able to do exactly what we wanted in life be that art or anything else would that make our lives not a struggle or would we always struggle no matter what? I would love to hear your input on this, sorry if its all over the place just a random thought.
7	Totally, I am currently in school (post grad diploma) and I absolutely hate it. Its like forcing myself to like something that I loathe. I chose it out of convenience and to force myself to do something practical. I am without a doubt the least motivated and poorest student in the entire group, and I couldn't care less. Its shameful, but I have come to realize that I may never have my passions translate into the workplace. 
5	I’m just glad that it’s going to get warm out again soon. Adventuring through nature, longboarding And graffitiing are my outs to my normal mundane life. I think we just think so much about things that when we can’t act on them they eat away at us. I just try to do things I enjoy, talk with my close friend and brother and break the rules to feel like I’m not just a machine.  
4	This is an interesting thought, thank you for posting it.\n\n\nI thought about it for a bit, but I can't really say that I have struggled in my life. Sure, some things weren't great and there are some things that are semi-great at the moment, but overall 'struggle' is not a word I would have used to describe my life. If anything, I should have struggled a bit more in times when I was too quick to let go. Unfortunately I don't really have any answers why this is the case, maybe I have been lucky so far, and you have been unlucky, or maybe it is nothing like that, it ist most likely infinitely more intricate than that. I know that changing the world is pretty difficult, for some people it is as difficult as changing themselves - especially their perception and outlook on it. But for some it can be easier to try to shift their perception just a tiny bit, than to change the world a lot. I have no clue about your life, so reading about someone telling you to just look at everything again with your tilted slightly to the left might be annoying, sound pretentious and not applicable to your situation at all - but it has helped others, so I am willing to take the gamble.\n\n\nP.S: I would, however also like to mention that this subreddit is maybe not an accurate representation of the average INFP, it is more akin to an something like the average representation of INFP problems.
3	Dealing with leaving home	So I'm 22 (F), and  I've never lived away from home before. This fall I started a full time program at a college that's a three hour drive from home, and I'm living on campus. My mom and I have always been very close. I try to come home whenever I can, which is almost every weekend. Sometimes she comes and visits me. Still, she misses me very much when I go. The parting is the hardest part, then we do ok most of the time. I think I do better than her being on my own. I'm busy with my program, have plenty to distract me, and I'm much more introverted than she is. She does pretty good too though. She's always busy and takes good care of herself. It's the leaving part that's really awful. I can feel that she is sad the day I leave and it kills me. It hurts so bad that sometimes it kind of makes me angry. I try to show as little as possible though, and be positive to make her feel better. It's not super healthy to bottle up my feelings, but I don't want to make her more upset because that would make me more upset. She has a more dramatic way of expressing her emotions than me, which kind of makes it hard too. She keeps her composure when I'm leaving but when I'm gone she gets really anxious and upset sometimes. She says she doesn't like feeling that way and wants to get better but she can't help it. I probably just have to wait until we get used to this, but in the meantime it hurts every weekend. I just wanted to get it off my chest, since I don't talk to anyone much about my emotions. Thanks for listening.
1	Good job with expressing your emotions! I think it's important. 😊 I believe you'll manage, both of you. 🌷
1	Be happy you dint get screwed over and get put the other side of the country.
16	First post !	Ok so long time lurker, first time poster (both to this sub and to reddit!). I made an account just to keep up with my favorite subs but I always get so anxious/start over-thinking when I start typing up a comment or a post that I just stop. But idk I don’t want to live like that anymore! And I don’t have to! So....hi! \n\nThis is one of my favorite communities because of how nice and totally not alone you guys make me feel so that’s why I decided to do my first post here :) \n\nAnyways, I can feel that good ol’ anxiety creeping up and so I’m gonna post this right away before I chicken out !
7	Hi 😁, I'm kinda new to Reddit in general and just found this today.
3	Welcome to the fam! I had a similar experience when I first found this community. It's crazy its like the only people that understand or care to understand INFP's are INFP's and this place has been amazing for that. Keep on posting:)
125	I know I've posted a lot today, but I couldn't pass this one up. True enough to hurt a little bit.	
11	Once had the cyberskills to make friends online, now i am a failure at both
5	That's because you can't use MEMES to communicate in real life.
3	Yeah cus in person you think differently about your response, on the internet it's much less about the person liking you by coming up with something amazing to say to them(we all suffer the need to be liked) and we're relaxed ourselves just focusing on what the content is that the person you're speaking to is saying.\nThe moment you focus on what the individual is saying only then good things happen.\nTry this 😁
3	This is why I love INFP’s. You like having friends enough to occasionally invite me to do things so I don’t sit in the dark long enough to fully mummify.
5	You guys do sometimes spend way too much time in your heads when conversing in person due to often overthinking things that don't require the overthinking.
4	Why am I the opposite tho
2	Honestly fucking same. But I’ve been working on it. Today I went to get a drink with a friend and she mentioned how I’m a good people person. She thinks that because I socialize a lot but I explained to her that it’s because it’s part of my job, I have to be engaging and network a lot. I explained to her how lonely it makes me feel and that I value genuine relationships over just going out and talking to anyone. And I’m happy because I felt I was able to share things about my life I had never told her and was too scared to tell her.  I think our friendship became that much stronger today.
2	It's actually alot easier and more fulfilling to make friends irl given the right setting, but starting a approaching someone to start a conversation, hell nawh
1	Acc. 
5	INFP (f) relationship with ISTJ (m)	What are your experiences of this relationship dynamic? \n\nI'm in a LTR with and ISTJ and we are struggling. I LOVE change, he hates it. It's really affecting how we progress in our relationship. I have never had a relationship that is as reliable as this one, which brings me a sense of peace, but I feel so stifled and my emotions and mood swings are giving him whiplash. \n\nHelp! 
4	I just came out of s 2 year relationship with ISTJ.\n\nI loved his stability, gentleness, and honesty.\n\nHowever, my soul withered because he could not feed it. \n\nWe ended things for many reasons, but ultimately because it wasn't "logical " to love me.\n\n
3	You know your relationship best, and you know yourself. If the fundamental parts of each of you are too different for you both to be happy long term, then it may be time to face that.\nI say this as an infp who spent too many years trying to make it work with an intj partner. Everything felt like a struggle, I was incredibly unhappy, felt unloved, and like a hollowed out version of myself. \nI am currently in a much more fulfilling and emotionally supportive relationship with someone who gives love, support, and listens even if he can't understand my emotional volatility. I hope this helps, and I wish you the best. 
3	i know one ISTJ male and i am a female INFP. as much as i tried to make things work, it never did. he comes off as incredibly cold and logical to a fault. bad at expressing emotions and comforting me. was very manipulative in the end. i hope your istj is not like this. 
7	PLS: Send me your book recommendations!!	I used to really love reading, but for the past couple years, video games, social media and the internet in general has taken up a lot of my free time. I miss the enlightenment that reading used to bring me and how I developed different aspects of my own character when I’m exposed to the different perspectives. \n\nSo I’m taking a very long cleanse from my video games and social media platforms (except for reddit) and in the meantime I’ll get back with some books :’) \n\nSo please send me your recommendations on what to read! I’m very lost and there’s just so much to choose from.\n\nI’m open to ANYTHING. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a “book that resonates with INFPs specifically” either. Just comment your favourite books, or recent reads that just opened your mind. I like the kind of books that leave me paralyzed for the next 20 minutes after I finish reading it and keep me thinking about it for the next week or so. You know what I’m talking about? \n\nThanks in advance! Also if there’s any book club on this subreddit let me know... maybe I should look into that too! If not, we should start one 😊 have a lovely day (or night)!\n\n\n
2	My 2 favorite books are Catcher in the Rye by Salinger and End of the Affair by Graham Green\n\nI have more recommendations if you already read that ^
2	The Mountain Man book series. There's a short story intro to it (31 pages) called The Hospital. It's free digitally on Amazon. Got me hooked and there were 5 more books to follow it. Lone guy in Nova Scotia after zombie virus outbreak. Gets very interesting.
2	All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr. I’m a better writer because of this book, it’s beautiful
2	New York Stories(Auster), The Secret History(Tartt), White Noise(Delillo, Shogun(Clavell), The Pearl(Steinbeck), Beartown(Backman), Turtles All the Way Down (Green), all very different. 
2	I zipped right through Ham and Rye by Charles Bukowski. It was recommended to me by a philosophy professor when I asked for books about making sense of life.\n\nI also love Amy Tan, who has a very distinct INFP writing style. Saving Fish From Drowning about a bunch of tourists in politically unstable Burma has stuck with me for almost a decade, because it was so personal and even humorous in the center of it all.\n
2	I always find myself coming back to I capture The Castle, Never Let Me Go, A Confederacy of Dunces, and Everything Is Illuminated.
2	I'm currently reading Repetition by Peter Handke, which is a INFP masterpeice imo. 
2	If you want some weird shit you should check out the “John dies in the end” series. David Wong has a truly unique sense of humor and a mind that’s possibly too creative. The first book in the series (it’s just called John dies in the end) is a little rough, but the story is worth it. If it’s too hard to follow, the second book doesn’t have those problems and it’ll catch you up to speed. It’s very similar to hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy (also really good) in many ways. Also features hotdog cellphones, shadow people, and evil trans-dimensional gods made outa meat. If that doesn’t intrigue you nothing will.
2	*Britt-Marie Was Here* by Fredrik Backman\n\nRead it during the spiraling-down of my last relationship. Finished it about a week after he broke up with me. Really made an impact on me and helped me see the light. One of the few books I can only describe as "soul food".
1	Something I just read and thoroughly enjoyed, not too long either\n\nCannery Row by John Steinbeck
1	It's a popular one but if you haven't read the Book Thief, that'd be my recommendation. I think I cried for a good hour after finishing it and I just couldn't stop for the life of me. \nI also read kokoro by natsume soseki and it's quite slow in the first half but after finishing it, I thought about it for a good week and still do at times. I had to lay down the second I finished it too.
1	- Madeline Dare series by Cornelia Read  \n- How to Talk to a Widower by Jonathan Tropper  \n- Beach Music by Pat Conroy  \n- Love Will Tear Us Apart by Sarah Rainone  \n- So Much for That by Lionel Shriver  \n- Spin by Catherine McKenzie  \n- Stupid and Contagious by Caprice Crane  \n- Miriam Black series by Chuck Wendig  \n- Newsflesh trilogy by Mira Grant  \n- Red Sparrow trilogy by Jason Matthews
56	Treat for you lot	
3	Now  I see where purple rain comes from.
3	Wow, i love it! Very original in my opinion!
1	Love it! Great job!
56	Starlord diabetes	
5	LOL I'm so conflicted
8	I laughed lmao
9	People are rude about this kind of thing and really it just comes across as someone so stuck up their own ass and happy with the smell. 
2	🤭😂
3	Lol thats wild. On another note, that’s my soulmate right there. Totally matches my Sag sun/cancer moon
1	Lmao
1	Hahaha people are dicks. It makes a lot of sense actually to have a cancer moon and be an infp. If I was talking to you and you told me those two things, I'd be in heaven. Meyers Briggs and natal chart shit is like my fav thing. 
20	Have you been told that you seem apathetic?	A close friend told me that I seemed apathetic now and then. She said it looked like I did not feel joy or happiness , no emotions. I know that it is not how I feel. Do INFPs often struggle to show emotions?\n\nIf that is the case, It have definitely have hurt my relationships with other people.
9	To people who just met me, I’m told I’m apathetic. Which is partially true because, you know, I have no real relationship with a stranger, why should I care? Of course I’m courteous, and a overall empathetic person to pretty much everyone. But I’m most empathetic to friends. 
5	I didn't realize until a few months ago, but i tend to speak more with a more monotone voice than others do, most of the time but especially when i'm with people i'm less comfortable with, and i think that can give people the impression that you have less emotion/care less about things (which is totally absolutely not the case for me). my friend who's also an infp says that it's a common infp thing... i just thought it was funny because i really didn't notice i did it until someone pointed it out to me lol
5	I hate being called this - especially when people say I have no emotions or something. Oh I have a whole lot of emotions, I just hide it well most of the time, or I'm just tired. Just because I'm not that expressive doesn't mean I don't feel anything.
3	I have a tendency to hid my emotions really well. I actually only have one friend who can tell when I’m hiding something. 
3	I've definitely been told this, and have been making an effort lately to adjust the appearance. INFPs are often described as seeming "aloof" to others, since our primary function is introverted feeling. We can be too busy sorting out how information fits into the bigger picture of the world around us to externalize what gears are turning in our heads.\n\nWe are, however, idealists, and we're great at "what ifs." I've found that externalizing my thoughts by expressing those "what if" ideas, connecting less-related things in a way other people may not think to, or even just relating to other people through metaphors can be helpful to break through the "aloof" appearance, since that's a natural way for me to express what I otherwise might not acknowledge externally.
2	i personally feel like i don’t show emotional expression on my face very well. sometimes i purposefully don’t want to show when i’m excited because i want to portray myself as a really mellow person. idk why. 
2	Me, I beat down my emotions when I was younger and they haven’t resurfaced. So I don’t know.
2	Yes, people often ask me if I'm bored or tired
2	This drives me nuts. People are always telling me to smile more. Just because I don't go around constantly with a smile on like some extroverted idiot, doesn't mean I'm not happy or am apathetic. \n\nWe are focused on our internal world so it makes total sense we aren't expressing things outwardly as much. If people make assumptions about me based on that they probably don't have a deeper understanding of introvert nature, so to hell with them.
2	My coworker has told me I look like Eeyore. Like I have resting sad face. Others tell me I look tired or depressed. This is not the case when I'm around people I'm comfortable with. My wife says that if you capture those small moments, you would think that I was an extrovert. 
2	Sometimes I can be apathetic, but I’m usually very emotional. Like I cry a ton, sometimes in front of people. 
1	I reserve my attention only to those who I think deserves it
8	Can pick up on internal judgement	One girl in the classes clearly does not like me. She loves to talk about body language. Has an look on judgement whenever I talk, with flared nostrils and a hand on her hip. Is it normal to pick up on this kind of thing? I feel like judging personalities have that obvious tell in that. She is also really extroverted and she does that kind of relational bullying kind of stuff with me. She is just a young punk. She thinks she is funny but really she is just insensitive and probably intimidated of me. Not a fan. 
4	She's probably ESTJ. Just my opinion. Regardless I avoid people like that like the plague. And yeah, I pick up manipulative judgey stuff like that from a mile away. It frequently makes me a target, because I see through these kinds of people and that threatens them, because many people, surprisingly, buy into their game. INFPs, like a lot of empaths, have the ability to reflect back to people their shadow and some people absolutely cannot stand it.
1	Yeah. Maybe it's the J.  Of course people can be jerks in every category but that would makes sense from the way you described her.
47	Took this few years ago in my home town :)	
2	Great shot 
1	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)\n\n&#x200B;
29	Do you still feel awkward even after resolving an issue with someone?	Even if we talk things out and fix things, things still feel weird. I still remember that whole ordeal in the back of my mind, and I assume they feel it too. Because no matter the outcome there is still that tension between us. It's why I avoid conflicts at all cost. \n\nAny of you feel this way after a conflict? Any tips to get past the awkwardness?
5	Yes!! I end up just not contacting that person again unless they contact me but only if it doesn't happen again. If it's a repeated thing of them causing conflict with me then I just leave and never speak to that person again. IDK if that the best thing to do but its what feel the most natural for me to do. 
1	same... v.v/
1	Yeah for a few days :/

4	Tidying up	Anybody else here feel like watching Marie Kondo, but scared that you'll find out that you're actually a hoarder?
2	I've been meaning to watch it. Seems satisfying.
1	Watch it ! I just folded everything and it looks so nice 
0	How do INFP's feel about putting structure into typically non structured things like dating, romance and sex?	Things like a dating bucketlist, the mojo upgrade sex preference quiz, taking the MTBI etc... \n\nMe and my BF have been together a while.\nThings like our dates, adventures, and romance are still pretty spontaneous.\n\nBut mainly in the bedroom, I want to try some new things. I want to get my INFP BF to do mojo upgrade with me (a sex preference quiz) but I'm hesitant if he will feel awkward or offended that something typically spontaneous has a structure.\n\nI say this because he doesn't seem to get excited over plans and structure in life in general. Which I get! I'm generally the same (ENFP here) but I guess I also see the value of applying it to certain areas.\n\nHow do y'all feel about it? 
2	I’d be cool with it 
2	Just go with the moment. Or plan it and do it. He probably is very comfortable with the spontaneity.\n. \n
2	I’d feel excited about being able to improve my life with structure, but it’s not realistic. When someone tells me to do something, I’d feel like it’s a chore and super not want to do it.  \n\nExample: my partner wrote me a schedule for how I should spend a day to get back on track. (Recovering from depression). And I tried to follow it and hated it so much. I even hated things I usually enjoy, like reading. I couldn’t stay on track and then felt guilty about not being able to do it. 
51	Tell me how you romanticize a day. I can’t be the only one!	Hi everyone! My name is Jessica and I am so happy to have found you all! I created a reddit account today just to subscribe to this group. Reading some of your posts has already warmed my heart with feelings of recognition and deep understanding. \n\nI’m in a romantic mood today, and for me romance has a dream-like quality where each thing/action has feeling, weight, sound and a day dream feel attached to it. \nFor example:  Today I have a Barbra Streisand special playing in the background but I’ve already rewound one part over and over again because the intro is so pure and powerful. I’m drinking hot coffee in my favorite rotund, green coffee mug. I’ve brushed my hair out so that my curls are messy and big which makes me feel more connected to being a woman and natural. I have been burning two candles that are pine and fireside scented, and even though it is cold outside I have cracked my kitchen window so I can feel a breeze and hear the birds and cars go by. All this while perched on my couch wrapped up in soft blankets and surrounded by velvet pillows. \n\nI’m sure many of you get these days where you feel romantic and dreamy. What do yours consist of? I’m so curious!
10	Welcome to this sub! Can't help smiling reading your post, you sure are having a good time. My dreamy days would involve me letting down my hair (my hair is pulled into a bun most of the time) and let the scent from the shampoo tickles my nose. I would listen to good music too, sometimes classical piano piece, looking out at the trees swaying and clouds drifting in the sky. The day would be full of gentleness and smiles.. :) 
6	I don't have the capability of putting my hair down since I'm a guy and It's pretty short. I think a good day for me is one where I can either spend all day:  A. Drawing or B. binge-ing some random rom-com anime I found on crunchyroll or netflix. Show's like that make my heart happy and drawing is a good escapism if I've got anything stressful going on. I'm glad your day is going well. Remember to drink plenty of water.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso u/Dreamsawait28 I rate your username 8/8. It's pretty great.
6	This is very wholesome and it makes me happy right now. Whenever I'm having a good day like that, I tend to laugh at the little things and sort of jump around everywhere haha. I also dance a little to music in front of people like if I'm doing the dishes. Just like the other person above, if I'm really in a good mood I'll put my hair down and shake it while listening to music (I usually have my hair up in a bun as well because it's really long). I'm glad you're having such a fantastic day! 
4	Well I like rainy days. Especially ones when I get to stay home and really focus on reading a book. Or stay in bed next to a window and listen to a podcast with my eyes closed. It helps if I’m drinking something hot like chocolate and milk. But your day sounds awesome 
3	I love having days like that! Whenever I get that warm, bright feeling like I think you're describing, where everything feels right, I write out a nice description of exactly what's happening, just like this! It's so nice to be able to recall those moments in detail when times are less wonderful.
3	Oh my, that is a powerfully cozy picture you paint! Sounds absolutely perfect, I love every bit of that. This is exactly how I am, I romanticize everything. I love how you describe what romantic feels like to you. I definitely relate :)
3	As strange as it sounds, a leisure drive around nice areas where the open sky is especially beautiful. It can be broad daylight, dawn, or sunset. Even gloomy weather can have a sense of nostalgia. Accompanied with the appropriate music to my taste with the windows rolled down occasionally to enhance the sounds and atmosphere and it's perfect. I also love night drives. I romanticize the heck out of that. They're like very personally special moments that I tend to dream of sharing with that special someone (which thankfully I've already found ☺️). Also, this car freshener I've been trying out is super pleasant. It's tea-like with hints of sweetness.
2	Making time to do morning pages (even though I wake up after noon). Making a big ass rice bowl, ideally with an avocado or jackfruit. Opening curtains to get some sunlight, saying hey to my plants. Stitching some embroidery or drawing in my notebook. Going for a walk. 
2	This is honestly such an adorable post. I have nothing to offer myself, but hopefully I can learn from everyone else in this thread. <3
2	I somehow revert to my childhood and remember when I imagined as a child about the things I am now doing as an adult. For example, now when I’m home alone I romanticize the moment because I often fantasized about it when I was younger and remember that. It happens in bursts all the time. I’ll stand somewhere and suddenly everything about that moment will feel magical and warm. 
2	Leaving New York on the train looking out the window as the world rushes past. I listen to John Coltrane, A Love Supreme, and wonder where she is
1	When I'm in the mood you describe, I like to sit out on my porch and listen to funny reddit narrations all the while feeling the deck under my bare feet and sipping my favorite coffee. I feel this way most when a chill is in the air on a cloudy day. There is just a true sense of wonder that I feel seeing the world gray. I love to get lost in that wonder and feel as though I am on a million journeys simaltaniously\n\nFor that fleeting moment nothing but that moment truly matters and I am whole. \n\nHope that made sense. 
27	How does an INFP make friends as an adult?	I always feel happy when i’m around people I can connect with. As I get older, friendships dwindle, people get busier, and I just feel more disconnected from the world. It seems like I am always the person who puts in the effort to maintain friendships, but i’m so...tired.\n\nI wish I had a close group of friends here, but I don’t even have anyone I connect with. If I weren’t so socially awkward, life would’ve been easier :(\n\nHow do you all make new friends? 
14	From my experience the best way to make friends is to leave your house and get involved in clubs, events, bands, whatever it is that you are passionate about that you can share with other people as you engage in that passion. If you are in college, you can join an extracurricular club. If you have a job, you could try to arrange a social event with your coworkers. Expose yourself to the world and the friends with inevitably come :)
6	Welcome to my life. I have never felt so bleh about people.. In my mind I try not to think about how they look at me let alone wonder if they even notice the significant difference in effort to maintain a friendship (or care at all).. I know what you're doing wrong and it's just you being you. Probably would have more friends if I had qualities worth paying attention to I guess, maybe it's the same case for you? Isolating yourself at home because lack of friends would definitely feed the never ending loop. I started doing volunteer work at a charter school which.. doesn't help with the friends situation, but it fills some of the void- you know?\n\nI even tried going to a club for a bit a while back but that slowly grew to be cumbersome- it's all we did and to be honest I felt no synergy... And nobody was my age. I had better results with another group perhaps merely on the topic it was covering, but it didn't lead to anybody interested in being friends. Either everyone else is also awkward, it's now a new taboo in our society, me, or people suck too much.\n\nI only have one strong friend via internet at this point from university as roommates for a little while where we talked about life, philosophy, personal values..etc. He still values me as a true friend and I the same for him.. So I don't know other than him. Was it because our similar interests or that we got to know each other merely living in the same room for about a month? I don't know. Only other friends I have are through my wife which again isn't the same.
4	Thanks for asking this, I wish I knew the answer myself. I'm only just about to turn 19 but the few friends I have are all just friends of friends of friends since I was a kid. Slowly drifting away from the friend I had originally (who basically just came up to me as young kids) and then befriending their friends and so on. Everyone I know was friends with a past one and it feels like I've never actually made my own friend before.\n\nI'm moving for the first time in my life and I know it will be more difficult to see the friends I have right now, but I have no idea how to meet people in a town even further away from anything than I am right now :/
3	Friends come and go for us my dude. Ride the vibes of your life and the choices you make will naturally lead you to the friends you are meant for. I'm willing to bet most of us here have relationship problems. We have enough energy in our lives for a SO and maybe one more person at a time. The rest is dedicated to internal thought and processing. We don't make good lifelong friends, but we make great situational friends when someone needs something (or vice versa.) \n\nAlso, look for those who you can turn to without guilt even if you don't talk to them for two years. My best friends are those that I could call up tomorrow and have a conversation with, as if we just did it yesterday. And I haven't seen/heard from them in years. \n\nThis is a really shitty r/narcicism thing to say but I feel like many people want us in their lives because our presence is really different, calming, and thought-provoking. We naturally want to be a presence in people's lives, but we can't do this for everyone and everything we want to. I think the solution is to do things that allow you to get your presence out, but in ways that don't require intense commitment. This is why I comment on Reddit and this sub even lol. \n
3	Volunteer, be it a clean up campaign or canything. I joined the Leo club (it's a volunteer organisation and it's worlwide), most of my new friends come from voluntering prjexts with Leo.
3	I agree with others. The best way to meet people is to join a club or social group of some kind. Especially those that are recurring on a regular basis. Just meeting someone once and trying to be friends puts a lot of pressure on both parties. But getting to know people gradually things unfold more naturally, which is why clubs or ongoing group activities with the same groups of people work so well. \n\nIt may take a few times of seeing someone to even feel comfortable conversing and that's actually pretty normal human behavior across the board I believe. People who come on too strong often have an agenda or come across as needy and awkward.
2	This may sound cliche but I think the method is being 100% your self. I don’t think Fi doms are good at initiating much. Most of my friends initiated the first few conversations. But I think something about Fi makes people want to approach us. Perhaps it’s the passion combined with the authenticity? Idk dude, but it seems to work 
2	Same.
2	Pretend to be an alcoholic and go to AA meetings! Or really be an alcoholic and go to AA meetings!\n\n(ps. they have to accept you)
2	I've made a few unexpected new friendships from just engaging in casual chat with people who work at places I usually go.\n\nIt's hard to get a real line of conversation started, but once you get used to talking to people under conditions like that you start to warm up to them.
395	Decided to study outside yesterday:)	
15	This is a nice shot!\n\nOn an unrelated note, this picture reminds me a lot of the opening scene in Donnie Darko. That movie is nearly incomprehensible, but I’ve always watched it with friends, so it makes me happy to think about. Thanks for the weird nostalgia smile. :)
11	Looks like the Netherlands
3	What if somebody wonders why you are there? It must be really peaceful to study there.
3	username is 🔥
2	Looks like a park I know in nj 
2	Where is that place? Looks nice.
2	I would love to be at a place like that perhaps not for study but just sitting there
2	Were you sitting in that spot you took the picture?
2	It looks a lot like my village in one area
2	:D 
2	I don't see snow.\n\nI envy you.
6	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 18	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
3	Ok so I really want to ask a friend of mine (ENFP, 16) to move in with me after she graduates next year (I'm 17). She has BPD and we've joked about this before but I legitimately want to do it. Should I man up and tell her? I'm a bit confused.
1	ENTP here, how do i cheer up my INFP friend when he is feeling down? any trade secrets?
49	Deepest depths of despair, highest heights of joy. Both were done in the same 4 hour painting session.	
2	There is a song called Peach by a band called Broods and it is basically about this feeling.\n\nOne of the lines is: \n\nI know it's hard to see me down\nI cry and cry upon the ground\nA simple price I pay for all the love I feel when I'm okay\n\nIt makes sense to meee . Thank you for sharing too ❤️
2	Nice that doge makes me very happy.
2	Despair is sooo dope!
1	Cats or Dogs, which is better?	You can say neither if you really can't decide ;P\n\nedit: Tell us whether you've had both before, I'd love to know your opinion.
4	i like both\n\n&#x200B;
3	Dogs.
3	Currently have both and definitely dogs
4	Caaaats
2	I’m a cat person 
1	They're both wonderful creatures
1	Prefer cats. They are more open minded. 
1	Cats
10	Have you ever dated another INFP and if so how did it go?	I did because he was so much like me. As if he was the male version of me. He really liked me but I wasn’t so sure about him. In the end it didn’t last long and it ended kinda badly but we’re friends now (and yes I know that might be bad). So what was you guys experience?
11	I dated one. It was okay. I want to try another.\n\nWhat I love about the infp-infp dynamic is the nonstop romanticism. Everyday I woke up to a heartfelt good morning and every night I went to sleep feeling reassured and confident about his feelings for me.  I think what was difficult was that we both were stuck in our ways to an extent and no one wanted to budge. So there were certain differences that were very difficult to work through due to a lack of compromise 
7	Am 'dating' an infp right now. We met only 7 months ago and since October we've been in a long distance relationship you could say. Unfortunately we didn't had the opportunity to meet yet, but we're gonna meet soon.\n\nThis is my experience so far. So we're 19yo and 18yo, and so far it has been absolute magical. We're both hopeless romantics, and super loving towards each other. Every day starts with a goodmorning message, and every day ends with a goodnight message (ik, cringe😅). We also have a lot in common. Personally, I share my 3 biggest interest with her. Yet we still differ in certain things. F.e. , I'm super talkative to her. But she is super listening towards me. So, for now I can say that I never met someone even close as amazing as her. This relationship is exactly as the one I always fantasized about😊
4	I did...Two dates and they were amazing. He brought out the manic pixie dream girl part of me. I thought everything was going well, he even talked about going on a tropical vacation together and told me the sex was amazing. He would tell me that "I get him"  and that "I'm the best" ....And then boom. Ghosted me. Never answered back a text or following texts. I still have no closure about why or what happened to this day and it drives me crazy and I get sad about it.  \n\nIt's weird BC I thought that him being an INFP would be a good thing....Like, "oh he'll be a good person like me"....Was not expecting the ghosting and consequent heartbreak with that. 
5	You know how you think about and idealise what the love of your life would be..?\n\nImagine that dream coming true.. and better than you ever thought.\n\n*sigh*
3	"dated" really short time. Lol I got really into him and then it stopped. He wasn't ready and wasn't that into me. Lol he might have low-key used me but not on purpose. Was about month ago. He still on my mind a lot. He was awesome!!!  And I hope life goes well for him. Sad that didn't get to know him more. I going on date with a new Infp person soon maybe. Want that deep sweet connection again. 😊\n\nBut I have Infp male friend and he is younger than me and we are really good friends. Never have I thought about him in other way.\n\n
3	We got married after meeting on r/exmormon. 
13	ENFP here dating an INFP. Need relationship advice.	My BF (22M) has a lot of the classic traits of the INFP. Creative, smart, writer, introvert.\nHe has the same struggles of loneliness, pessimism and depression.\n\nI noticed he was a bit flat for a couple of days and when I asked him what was wrong he said, "I feel dead inside" then giggled.\n\nHe has these depressive moments occassionally where life seems meaningless. I know this probably won't ever change. That's okay.\n\nI just want to know what to do in those moments.\n\nI try to give him some affection and assurance that I'm here for him. I do this by scratching his head, booping his nose or giving him a heartfelt  compliment.\n\nWhat would you appreciate in these moments? 
9	I’d say make your SO feel safe and loved. I know, it sounds kinda obvious and super cheesy, but in those moments we actually need that reassurance. It’s better to have simple plans, nothing too elaborate. Even tucking us in bed is something extremely nurturing in times of need. I hope this helps!
8	i would appreciate lots of cuddles and maybe food, depends tho. maybe talk about one of his latest projects with him, it helps to take your mind off the nothingness of depression and focus on lets say... one of your characters.  
5	i think you’re already doing the right thing! \n\ni think.. for me being around someone who makes me feel safe/reassured/loved/appreciated/like they believe in you/understood is the best thing! \n\ni would be a little bit careful with feeling too responsible for his moods, it could you make you feel frustrated or forget about the things you want, and it could make him feel too emotionally dependent or feel guilty when these moods don’t go away. though that’s a little bit of experience i have and it doesn’t have to be like that in every situation! \n\ni think you’re really sweet for wanting to help him like this!
3	Honestly distraction. I've dealt with stuff like that for a while now and the one thing I know is I'm very prone to getting into these destructive thought loops. Anything that could break the pattern, shift my perspective, basically get me away from the black hole that sucks me in. It's not always easy pulling myself out of it. Sometimes I'm too far gone before I realize I'm doing it again.
3	Hi, INFP here who is in a relationship with an ENFP. If this were me who was feeling a bit flat something that would help would be just talking about it. INFPs can be rather secretive at times and bottle things up but encouraging them to open up and talk about their feelings always helps. We're not always looking for advice or a solution to our problems, just for someone to listen and support us through them. Hope this helps:)
2	Very nice that you want to be there for him. Just give him love and support. As an INFP male all I’m looking for from a girl is emotional support and evidence that she cares about me. The depressive thoughts come and go, but the strength of love and support stays with us. 
2	Be like an ENFJ. That is probably what he needs to break out of his shell. He needs someone to push him to grow and become his best self.
2	"stop being a cringy nihilist"\n\n"you're not you when you're hungry"\n\n"give it a hundred and ten percent, bobby"\n\nEH?..... any of these? I feel like sometimes you need to be hard on someone (wife is to me),\n\nbut I don't want to make you to make it worse :s\n\nOh and...\n\n"I think I'm pregnant" Don't do this. Not... good.. trust me... people can be unpredictable and "unaware" in some sense. I mean maybe it can be funny but don't let the silence take over, maybe a "gotcha!" after a good long second before he speaks.

17	Does anyone else ever feel lonely when spending time with other people?	Not really sure if this makes sense, but does anyone else in this sub feel lonely, even when they’re spending time with friends? I can be doing something fun with them, but still feel a sense that I’m missing something, and feel left out sometimes. 4/5 times I hang out with friends I feel this way.\n\n
7	Yes. Absolutely. This was my entire high school / uni experience. I’ve learned now that I am no good in groups. Better 1:1 or 2:1. And usually only if that’s deep, connected conversations / growth focused. 
3	Yeah I feel that, too, sometimes. It happens most when I’m with a group of people rather than if it’s just a one on one situation. \n\nI think it depends on the people as well. I can think of a few friends where I tend to feel lonely around them, even if we’re supposedly having fun. \n\nOn the other hand, there are a special few who truly make every moment spent with them worth living for. I wouldn’t trade them for the world. Ngl,  I think these people are few and far between, I can only think of two in my life. \n\nI know it’s hard to be lonely. I struggled with it pretty much my whole life. Just remember there are people in this world who dream of having a friend like you, and you still have the rest of your life to find them. \n\nHere’s a video you might want to watch https://youtu.be/n3Xv_g3g-mA\n\n\n\n
1	Loneliness and being alone are not the same thing. Here's a great video about loneliness\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Xv\_g3g-mA&t=653s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Xv_g3g-mA&t=653s)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	Almost all the time. I’m coming to accept that i’m more of a lone wolf 
72	Already do.	
2	Happiness is found in the struggle to getting what you want.  Not in actuality having it. 
13	Any INFP love doing housework? Or has anyone learned to “not hate” keeping a clean and tidy home? I’m looking for tips to change my attitude towards the monotony of housework...	
16	We make it a jam session.  Crank up some hoppy music and make it fun.
8	I have to keep reminding myself that future me will thank me. \n\nMentally I always feel better after it’s done. And doing a little bit each day eliminates the need for the painstaking tackle of it taking your whole day. \n\nMusic ALWAYS helps. 
3	Omg! I’ve been thinking about this for years now. Part of the reason I’ve wondered if i’m an infj. I really like to clean, it’s therapeutic. But the thing is, when i’m creating, I don’t like to restrict myself. So I really don’t care how much mess I make at that point 
2	If it’s financially an option, hire someone to clean. I have struggled for decades with cleaning. In part because I have strong issues with the redundancy of it, in part because I’m so apathetic about how clean something needs to be that I have no internal motivation for it, and in part because my awareness of my surroundings is low and I only notice clutter not so much that something needs to be cleaned. I’ve tried schedules (last for a short time and then forgotten), turning it into a mindfulness activity (worked for a while and then didn’t), music, spacing over a week, burst mass cleaning, etc. Whenever possible I hire someone to clean and my overall well being is increased many times over by doing so. The time that would have been spent on soul crushing mundane life things gets rerouted to things I value and my house does not look like it it’s a few months away from a Hoarders episode. It is by far the best solution I have found that sticks. 
2	I like doing housework when:\n\n1) I am stressed.\n\n2) I am having company over and I want the place to look nice.\n\n3) When it is doing the dishes. I don't know why but doing the dishes is very meditative for me.
81	Thanks fellow infp u/wizardflurryhome for the beautiful Valentine's exchange postcard!	
1	How pretty!.. Is that a water color?
40	All INFPs need to watch this.	
7	Honestly, I feel called out by this video. I’m a senior in high school. I moved to this school sophomore year and I was very depressed at the time. I actively withdrew from people at times, then wondered why I wasn’t close to anyone. I don’t think I’m disliked, but at this point I have forgotten how to make connections and become close to other people. I’m definitely the type of lonely in this video, as hard as it is to admit. It’s not like people hate me or I’m an outcast, but I have no close friends in this town and I have prevented myself from being close to anyone on purpose. 
3	This video and the ones by School of Life (their videos in general, not just about loneliness) spoke to me tbh
1	I saw this in my reccomended
1	Good vid. 
1	No thanks I don’t need a reminder of my life
25	Give your darkness some light and hug it.	Laugh and the world laughs with you.\nCry and you cry alone. Be the difference.
19	Snuck out onto the roof of our hotel in Ithaca w my friends last night	
1	Holy shit. Beautiful! 
7	Hey all. What artists, authors, bands resonate with you?	
3	Tool is definitely one of my favorite bands. 
2	Novo Amor.. (birthplace album holy)\nBon Iver \nBen Howard\nDermot Kennedy\n\n\nGraham Greene\nThe author of the book Catcher in the Rye\n\nyeah 
1	Radiohead
1	Owl city
1	Bands: Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Sigur Rós, Radiohead, etc\n\nArtists: I'm not too much into art, but I like impressionism like Monet\n\nAuthors: my favourite is the German author Hermann Hesse. I also like GRR Martin and older stuff such as Goethe or Dostoevsky
1	Curtis mayfield, his song move on up is so inspiring :D also there’s something about him, he seems to be like me. also jefferson airplane, janis joplin, quincy jones (summer in the city! 00:43-00:54)\nLa femme d’argent by air (it sounds like a blue sky with clouds) \nForge your own chains by D.R hooker (that doozy sax part after “drown your sorrows, in a drink”) 
86	This spoke to me! Saw this during a hospital visit.	
8	What does it speak to you, OP?
6	It my brain
8	Boundaries	Is anyone else just horrible at setting them, or having confrontation of any kind? 
2	It literally makes my stomach turn.
2	I can set them but I have a hard time holding myself to them. This is something I'm constantly working on. 
2	Yes and no? It seriously depends on my mood. There are times where I want someone to invade my space and flood me with an endless supply of love because i’m needy like that xD \n\nBut there are also times where I need to know that I can take space/time for myself without the threat of losing a persons respect/appreciation. And that’s when it becomes more difficult to set those boundaries 
1	I have trouble with them as well, it also makes me physically ill to try to say no to someone. I have wound up doing things or in situations that I didn't want because I was too afraid of disappointing someone or making them mad. But I'm not sure if that's just due to being a people pleaser or if that's actually an INFP thing. \n\nOnce I've had enough though, and I feel like they're not reciprocating, just taking advantage of me and I don't care if they get mad, then they can just fuck right off. 
1	There are boundaries; they are meant to keep other people away me and my close ones.
6	How would INFPs have manifested themselves if they lived in a world where slavery was common?	Scenario 1: Ancient Rome, so kinda "equal opportunity" slavery \n\nScenario 2: Confederate State of America, where slavery was based on race. \n\nHow do you think an INFP, providing that he/she's not a slave, would react to slavery while living in societies like these? 
7	As of right now, there’s currently more slavery in the world today than there has ever been in history. Check out the A21.org and other anti-human trafficking organizations to read more up on the topic. \n\nBut to answer your question, living in that type of world currently, I’ve personally made it my life’s passion to raise awareness and do whatever I can in my power to help bring slavery to an end. I’m even enrolled in school currently to become a licensed social worker because I believe that’s how I can best serve the victims of this modern day slavery known as human trafficking. \n\nFinding out how common slavery was in the world today while I was in high school is what fueled my passion to do something about it and has set the course for my own life and personal career. It’s an injustice I couldn’t bring myself to turn my head to. 
1	I’m gunna directly answer your question rather than be a smart ass about it xD \n\nI honestly believe that I would be one of the first ones killed because it would be very hard for me to put my head down and obey dysfunctional authority figures. Even if I bite my tongue, my eyes have a heard time masking what I truly feel 
1	I've thought about this a lot. \n\nGoing off of how I have reacted to other types of discrimination against other people in the current day and age, I think I would've been against it but not out protesting alone and speaking out every chance I got if I lived in the slavery era. I think any thing I would've done would've been subtle, as in being kind to/helping out an individual, one on one. Saving up money and buying relatives/families to keep them together and treating them as part of the household - Give them everything they need and allow them to leave forever if they wanted to. Or to help slaves escape and be part of the underground railroad so I could play that double agent vibe. It's a little disappointing to think I wouldn't be all "SLAVERY IS WRONG!" to every person on the street, but I know that isn't me and wouldn't be a fair assessment of what I would actually do. \n\n If I go to what I would be like in segregation era America, depending on my age, I think that a younger me might have been indoctrinated for a while until I grew up and saw what was being done to protesters/the violence surrounding that. Then I would've joined the marches, protests, and sit-ins and spoken out when the opportunity presented itself, but probably never on my own.\n\nI think the reason is that drive in me to "root for the underdog" in most any situation which I believe is very INFP... And it sounds very flippant of me to equate slaves as "underdogs". Not my intent... but I mean it as I tend to gravitate toward wanting to help the disenfranchised in my own way when I see it. 
8	It took me seven years to figure out I am INFP.	I have been wondering what my MBTI type is for a loooong time. \n\nI've gone through phases of believing I was INTP, INFP, maybe INTJ and maybe even ENTP. When I first took the MBTI, I was typed as INTJ. When I took it again four years later, I was typed as INTP. I read into the descriptions of types, the cognitive functions, and interacted with other people of many different types. I tried all types on for size and INTP seemed to fit the best. I felt fairly secure about it until just a couple months ago when I fully realized how emotional I actually am. \n\n* I start crying when I get into real arguments. I *hate* arguments because I believe people should be able to solve problems without waging war against one another. \n\n* A small part of me takes little things personally when I know I shouldn't. I am a rational person yet I feel my rationality acts more as a filter over my sensitive core than as my default mode of processing.\n\n* I love to dream about future events. I love imagining romantic scenarios with my SO and imagining living out my dream as an entertainer. \n\n* I love brainstorming new solutions to problems. I love making poetry and writing songs. Using words to express my emotions is very cathartic for me.\n\n* I can relate to ANYONE. I feel sympathy for everyone, even if they've wronged me. I always consider what life must be like for other people and how it manifests into their actions. Most conflicts are actually misunderstandings. If we'd all *genuinely* try to understand what each other is going through, we'd be much more cooperative.\n\n* I always want to make myself a better person. I feel like a bad person deep down, which motivates me to make myself more compassionate, earnest, and productive. I feel like it is my duty to give something back to the world for all I've received from it.\n\nI think I'm INFP now. What do you guys think? \n\nI guess it is also possible that one's type could change over the course of their life. Many MBTI enthusiasts seem certain it cannot, but I'm not entirely sure. Though I think in my case, I just haven't fully bloomed because I've been acting out a persona and haven't embraced my genuine self.\n\nSo what has your self-discovery process been, INFPs? (and other types, if you're out there)
3	I have debated which of those 4 types I am for a while too. (Not as much for INTJ but still a bit)
2	Exactly the same, even the order in which you were typed lmao. 
2	Wow, I think we should be best friends, I agree with everything you described. I originally thought I was INTJ, because I wasn't an emotional person, until I learned that I did have emotions, I was just unsure of how to express them and hid behind a cloak of rationality. Once I left the bad relationship that made me question if my personality was broken, I did some reading through the types and embraced INFP. I'm happy to be who I am.
131	"But I did everything right!"	
12	Yes, I absolutely agree!\n\nI think INFPs desperately need strong friendships, but we can get in over our heads very quickly when the extrovert mask is involved. For example:\n\nLet's pretend we've just started running for exercise. We can go a couple of miles without dropping dead, and we're proud of our accomplishment. We meet someone new who starts running with us, and it's great. They're helping us stay motivated and pushing us to go a little farther each day...but we don't realize our new exercise partner is a fanatic. Before we know it, the other person is asking us to run a marathon with them and discussing which way to attach the band-aids to avoid the dreaded nipple bleeding. We know a choice must be made. We can (1) admit we're not that into running, which might ruin the budding friendship, (2) we can die of a heart attack during a marathon, or (3) we can give a non-committal answer that gives us time to figure out a way to save a friendship we've exhausted ourselves cultivating. We INFPs don't like confrontation, so #3 is often the best choice. The other person sees us as a flake, and there goes the friendship. (An extrovert would choose #1 or #2.) Yes, it is possible to have solid introvert-extrovert relationships, and they can be very rewarding. It's just that we can't seem to tell right away whether a seemingly-compatible extrovert will be a lifelong friend or not.\n\nWhen it comes to starting friendships with other introverts, the problem seems to be more a matter of true compatibility than a misunderstanding. Introverts often know their MBTI types, so asking personality type questions may save us from investing time in an ill-advised friendship. Of course, it's not a foolproof system, as true compatibility cannot be predicted from a chart. If, like me, you live in a heavily extroverted area (eg, the suburbs), fellow introverts might be too exhausted from daily interactions to cultivate a friendship.\n\nFunny story: I once met an INFP at the toy store while shopping for Christmas. We hit it off right away and began asking each other questions only INFPs would dare to ask a total stranger, like "What are the most important implications of subpar parenting in today's society?" and "How many times per day do you experience an existential crisis?" She gave me her phone number, which I entered into my phone. I promised to send her a text ASAP. When I tried to send the text, I realized that I hadn't saved the contact, and it disappeared. Sadness.
4	But what are the ‘right’ things tho?
2	Oh my word, exactly! So glad this sub exists. It's so accurate it hurts.
1	Why is this so true?! 
1	Here's the kicker. It doesn't actually matter what you do or don't do. Say or don't say. With the way we human beings have built our society it's a surprise if people can stay friends for more than a couple of days.
1	oof
530	Been trying to come out of my shell more lately and I drew this to help me visualize it	
29	Cool!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHands are hard to draw. This looks good.
12	It's beautiful and I can feel what you're trying to convey. I can feel it within me too. Great job, you're really a great artist.
12	Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn son. 
9	I’ve never felt so understood...
5	This is really cool.
5	I love how palpable the force, the energy in the piece is. Thank for sharing. Great job!
4	Very nice
3	Literally me these past few days, super relatable\n
3	Hell yeah!
3	Oooooh!!!!!!! Yes!!!!! That perfectly describes how I've been thinking and feeling! I've been trying for years to come up wit a way to draw it out. You nailed it!
3	This is great. I love the imagery
3	This is so awesome, it says so much!
3	Love. 
3	This is so amazingly expressive...i can feel it
3	God I love INFPs. They get stuff! I can feel it too. I love that you're expressing it like this. 😍
3	Fantastic  
3	The coolest thing I’ve seen all day
3	I love this!!
3	I feel this
3	I would love to have this drawn or painted on my snare drum head. 
2	At first I saw a triceratops head outline. Lol
2	Outstanding\n
2	Yes 
2	wow, you're incredibly talented it looks great!
2	This is amazing I wish I had even an inkling of artistic talent 
2	I get a little claustrophobic around people i think i should know but feel i don't know well enough yet. and this art piece has brought that air of panic to me. Crazy the emotions art carries. I hope your exit into shell-lessness goes well. Remember to carry a temporary mask to hide behide when avoiding awkward situations, even extroverts have them #wink
22	Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell's video on Loneliness	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Xv\_g3g-mA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Xv_g3g-mA)
2	So according to this video,I should be dead a long time ago,damn
3	Yeah, it bummed me out too.
2	I felt the urge to contact people whom I've lost contact. 
1	While watching this video I started to feel verry lonely but on the end I felt better because I made contact with an INFP friend. Don't know why INFP is improtant here but ok\n\n&#x200B;
1	Wow how many people that feel it doe
7	Stealing a thread idea from the ISFPs: Want to create a list of "INFP" vibe music, or just your favorite music	This seemed like something that would also be popular here, and I'd love to hear what you all listen to.\n\nI'll start with a classic that's still one of my favorite songs: Riders on the Storm by The Doors - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv8GW1GaoIc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv8GW1GaoIc)\n\nDefinitely doesn't have INFP vibes, but I highly recommend Primus for you all too. Les Claypool is just so unique. Southbound Pachyderm has a great music video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xb898sQtu8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xb898sQtu8)\n\nEdit: How could I forget my all-time favorite solo artist Stevie Nicks. Landslide is one of the best songs ever written, and the Smashing Pumpkins cover is surprisingly good. I think Landslide might summarize the INFP experience in one fell swoop.\n\nVery different sound from these others, but I recently discovered Bazanji and really like him. Highly recommend "Fed Up" for those who like Hip-Hop/Rap: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYAUU5kDuYE&list=RDxYAUU5kDuYE&start\_radio=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYAUU5kDuYE&list=RDxYAUU5kDuYE&start_radio=1)\n\nAdding a new one to this post I mentioned in the comments. I love Matt and Kim. They always make me happy when I'm feeling down. Daylight is a favorite for sure: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgBeu3FVi60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgBeu3FVi60)\n\nNo one's brought up Frank Zappa yet. I love Frank Zappa. Black Napkins is my favorite instrumental only song: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNkl1avYXRM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNkl1avYXRM)\n\nDefinitely NSFW: This one has a solidly anti-INFP vibe but I adore it: "Baby's On Fire" by Die Antwoord. Sticking to MBTI, seems like an ESTP/ENTP poster boy song: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcXNPI-IPPM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcXNPI-IPPM)\n\nAnother one no one's mentioned yet: Tame Impala - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7mia9UMG4Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7mia9UMG4Y)\n\nNSFW warning on this one: Neon Hitch did a great remake of No Hands by Waka Flocka. No INFP feel, but I think the music video is so funny and I love the directing style. Seems very ESTP/ESFP to me. - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y9rRkwzeio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y9rRkwzeio)\n\nAnother NSFW one: For those of you who are also obsessed with Ru Paul's Drag Race, I love following the queens' music. #SueList by Detox is one of my faves. Again, no INFP feeling but so awesome. If anything, maybe some ESTJ/ENTJ feels - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjE1nJLz-Zs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjE1nJLz-Zs)\n\nLately I've been obsessed with Better by Kahlid as a love song. Give me very ISFP vibes. It is such a good love song on so many levels - [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3bfa3DZ8JM**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3bfa3DZ8JM)

5	Some of my favorites that haven’t been mentioned yet: \n\nNothing But Theives \n\nMissio\n\nDeath Cab For Cutie

2	Check out Omar Apollo.
2	Nice! I still haven't seen the Doors movie. It looks interesting.\n\nI am not sure what music is INFP vibe music, and I honestly do not think I can pick a favorite song. That is hard! Perhaps the favorite thing for me to listen to is the _Lord of the Rings_ soundtrack.\n\nEdit: Maybe my favorite song is John Lennon's "Imagine." Once that song came on my phone and I started crying. There is something about his murder and that song looking for peace that really hits home for me.\n\nYeah I just relistened to the song and I think "Imagine" is the most beautiful song ever written.
2	I have a playlist of all the music i enjoy.\n\nIts mixed genres and moods, but i know all the pictures so its easy to pick for me :p\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ1v3XnfHmseWV0vvhCq7RpkFY9ms-NHK\n\nSome music that is not on here, but i really enjoy for the darkness of it is the album, Music for the quiet hour. By Shackleton.
2	Landed into a phase where I'm only listening to rolling stones 
2	George Ezra - Shotgun\n\nI heard this [song](https://youtube.com/watch?v=v_B3qkp4nO4)  at a bakery yesterday.  \n\n
2	It’s almost 10 years since this was posted.  https://youtu.be/5ky6vgQfU24\n\nINFP’s want to take personal growth journeys, but overthink/overanalyze the risks and get caught in a decision-making loop.  Great choice of music and inspirational songs in this video.

5	NF's in Science	Hey guys - I'm technically an ENFP but test really near the middle of the E-I spectrum, so thought I'd ask you guys as well - do any of you work in the hard sciences?  If so, what has been your experience?  Do you feel like you can be imaginative and creative enough?  Do you spend a lot of time working alone, or do you get to work with other people?  What are the best and worst parts of your job?  Thanks for your input!
3	I do research in mathematics / computer science and I actually find it to be very creative. In the end, learning to do exact science is just like learning any other skill, just like learning how to hold a paintbrush (to make a very INFP comparison). I think many -NF- people get discouraged learning these skills and never get to the interesting part. I was never extraordinarily good in school, never the best at taking exams in hard sciences, but the further I got along, the less important these things became, and imagination and curiosity became more important.\n\n\nI like to discuss my work with others, but I also work in solitude for long stretches of time, just me and my ideas. I work in a nice office on top of a hill where I can watch the sunset with a cup of coffee and get some work done.
3	I’m INFP and I’m a scientist! I majored in Environmental Physics in school but now I work in a material testing lab. I find it therapeutic to zone out and do detail oriented work like checking calculations or entering data and in my free time I like to write stories. I don’t have any huge career aspirations as most of my driving factors are at home, but I enjoy what I do at least. 
3	I’m in chemistry, and have been in science since before I learned infps are supposed to be “bad at science.” I actually love the hands on work because every chemist has their own style, it’s almost an art like cooking! I did and still struggle to excel at having an encyclopedic knowledge of reactions, but with time things are starting to stick, almost like learning a language. 
2	I'm still in school but I'm an engineering major. I love brainstorming new ideas to problems but I'm concerned that when I find a job after I graduate I won't allow me to be creative enough to feel satisfied with my work. I hate procedural work. I don't like following lists and doing everything as it should be done by the book. That can be left to the NTJs, who do very well in jobs that require that. My roommate is an INTJ and he really is the living stereotype of an engineer. Nevertheless, I think that NFP's can find a place in science if given enough room to give their ideas flight.
1	I'm in human genetics. A first year undergrad so I don't do much lab work but I want to get at it soon!
4	Do you ever get jealous of your friends’ other friends?	Wondering if this is an INFP thing. 
6	I don't think so. Maybe I was jealous once because my best friend said that this other girl was her best friend. I still think of her as my best friend though even if I am not hers.
3	I do, even though it's ridiculous. I don't know if it's an infp thing but I've accepted that I feel that way. Of course, I don't tell them!
3	the classic i didn’t really want to come but i still wanted to be invited sometimes happens to me.\n\nother than that i feel like the bonds i have with my best friends are unbreakable. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ don’t think about what they do w their other friends \n\nBUT i do get jealous when i’m left out and they don’t confide in me, and i only find out later. *shaking fist ‘IM the listener friend!!!!!! ME!!! I help!!!!’ 
1	I do, it seems like all my friends are closer to each other than they are to me, even if they've done things that really hurt each other. Especially when they make a new friend and I see them getting close to each other :(. Like they can have to same level of trust with someone they've known for 3 months as they do with me after knowing me for 3 years. 
1	Yes but not because the have friends other than me.. I get jelly because I wish I had more friends and want what they have.
1	It only happened with one specific friend to me... then I realised I was in love with her ¯\\_(ツ) _/¯ in my specific case I guess it was more a gay thing than an INFP thing, lol
11	What colors do you like to wear? And which colors do you feel uncomfortable wearing?	For most of my life I have stayed inside the greyscale. And the idea of wearing the color red has always made my physically ill. HOWEVER, I have been tempted lately to just go for it and wear red to see what kind of energy it brings out in me. Has anyone else tried something like this? 
8	My favorite colors to wear are black and red. I mostly wear maroon jeans with black / grey shirt and / it jacket. Or the opposite with maroon shirt and black pants. 
5	shades of black
4	I mostly wear black, blue, purple, teal and red. I dislike yellow, pink and olive. 
4	My wardrobe includes a vast range of colors from grey all the way to black. Sometimes I like to spice it up and wear darker shades of other colors, but that’s only when I’m feeling a little wild 
5	I love wearing color!  Usually tied to my mood of the day.  I am a rare person who actually looks good in orange.  I like sunshiny yellow.  For around two years recently, I wore blue very often.  I will wear white, but almost never black or gray.  I also have various greens, a red, and a purple shirt, too.
3	My staples are: Black. Blue. Army green. Grey. Mustard yellow. Brown. \n\nI have a few coloured items that I sometimes wear. People complement me in yellow, but I feel the most insecure in it. 
2	I like a lot of grey, black. blue, purple and green.  I stay away from red and yellow.
2	My wardrobe is mostly made up of black and gray. I love wearing the rare pop of yellow and pink because I feel I look really good on them and basically any other cute pastelish colors. I hate maroons but navy is okay.
2	I do love grey
2	I'm dark skinned and I usually wear just Blue, Grey, Green/Olive and white mostly, along with  a little pink and one maroon T-shirt. I've always wanted to try yellow tho, a very light yellow.
2	I really like white or complete black hoodies, for t-shirts, orange and pink sometimes
2	I prefer dark colors. I like wearing navy blue or black the most. I don't like wearing yellow, light green, or pink. My skin tone looks best in eggplant, tomato red, black, or white. I had a guy tell me what my colors were. He had a book that will look up your skin tone and tell you what colors you should wear.
2	Black, grey, white, blue, green. I dislike yellow, red and orange.
2	I like black, grey, and blue. I hate yellow or orange because I think they’re  ugly colors to wear.
2	I normally wear dark colors (black, grey, dark blue)  but my favorite thing to wear is my thrifted baby blue sweater, I wear it on days where I wake up feeling happy. 
2	Black, blues, sea greens and a splash of red here or there. I don’t typically wear anything too bright. And I absolutely hate wearing yellows or oranges. Red is as bright as I’m willing to go and it’s almost always as an accent. 
2	I don't have any specific colors I hate wearing. With the exception of yellow. I don't know why.
2	I like earth tones and jewel tones mostly
2	My staple is black, I really don't like wearing grey. I occasionally add in a dark red, bottle green or deep purple. Sometimes I like gold if I'm feeling shimmery. 
1	Grey mostly, with everything else a mix of colors but mostly toned down (nothing vibrant). \n\nI've thought lately about trying to be more creative with what I wear, but it would probably have to mean something to me, like its from someone, or the colors remind me of something. Otherwise I usually don't take what I wear too seriously
1	Black, grey and blue. Most of the time it's black and grey but if I'm feeling happy it's blue
1	I’m happiest in white or nudes.
4	33 single dad. A little lonely.	I always test out as infp..even when I try and answer things differently to see what happens. \n \n Anyway, I got married young (20),had 2 kids (8) and (13), and now have been divorced for almost a year. We divorced because of her cheating multiple times over the marriage.\n\n So now I have my kids two times a week and every other weekend. I secluded myself in the happiness of my family so much that I have almost 0 social life.\n\n I had a girlfriend for a few months but things just didn't work out. \n \n A part of me loves this opportunity to grow into what I want to be (my ex was very negative and it affected my confidence for years), but I want someone to love. I want someone to experience life with some times. \n\n I've read so many books on how to treat people and the right things to do and say and what not but I talk to maybe 1 person a day.... I do go to the gym 3 to 4 times a week and live a healthy life but I'm really missing the deeper love life I need. \n\n End rant. \n From an infp who thinks he would hate other infps lol
2	Haha... yeah I'm getting a Siamese in May!!
2	Hey there. From one INFP to another... loneliness is always there. No matter if you’re single or with a partner. So I wouldn’t focus on finding someone to love. It looks like you spent many years trying to make things work with your SO and maybe now it’s time to focus on yourself. Going to the gym is good but it can be a bit monotonous. Perhaps you can try a new hobby of pick up an old one. Also, leaning towards something spiritual can be beneficial, regardless what your beliefs are. \nDating is kinda tough for us INFPs so I’m not sure I’d recommend that. I think is great to have knowledge on how to treat others but it’s also important give yourself some time to heal from what happened in the past. Sometimes we try too hard to make other ones feel good and we tend to forget we need that ourselves.\nOh and definitely find podcasts you like, watch stand up comedy on Netflix or YouTube or try to go out and catch a good movie or show.
2	Suggestion: if you can afford the time and money, work on your hobby(s) and/or do volunteer work.
1	It sounds like you have more freedom now being single. Like you can do all the things you wanted to do, but could do when you were married. At least that is how I look at it. I have been in relationships where my partner stopped me from pursuing my goals. Like I wanted to go back to school and he said it would be too expensive. But we broke up and now I am back in school. I suppose everything happens for a reason.
1	Why do you think you’d hate other INFPs?
1	I can't stand all the pictures everyone post even though I know in a few months I will post one of my own. Just me being stupid infp lol
1	This might not be helpful, but at least you're not a cuck. Good for you god dammit.\n\nThere are actual degenerates out there who live the "open marriage" bs like it's all good.\n\nKeeping doing good- good will follow. Don't let people take advantage.\n\nAnd seriously. Good for you on not being a cuck. Scum of the earth... End of my rant :-)
3	Should I say sorry in a fight even though I was hurt?	Like, let's say I've had a really bad fight about a really stupid thing with my friend, I wasn't rude and they were but I really miss them. Should I say sorry just to get our friendship back together even if I don't truly mean it? \n\nI'm still in school so even if I don't say sorry, we'll still see each other and it may be awkward. I already know I'll cry a lot because I won't be able to go the whole day without looking behind me and seeing them, knowing I won't be able to say anything. 
3	Only if it was your fault and only if u caused the fight, but that's only my opinion, you'll look needy if you say sorry that for sure 
3	Moreover if you say sorry and it wasnt your fault your behavior is hurting the others, because you affirm them in their bad behavior. 
2	Omg, please take some more time for yourself to sit with your feelings. Please do not apologize if you don’t really mean it. That’s not a very kind thing to do to yourself
1	An extreme metaphor, but that's like sending a text message to a murderer and telling them your address and times you'll be alone.\n\nIf you're feeling lonely go somewhere that allows you to make other friends.\nIf she was rude then it's on her to apologise.\nUnless you want her to know that you're a walking bulls eye for her rudeness.\n\n(If secretly you had a part to play in offences being given on her side also but don't want to admit it that might be worth talking to your ego about.)
15	"When Being 'Nice' Hurts You More Than It Helps" interesting article by a fellow INFP	
3	Serious question, because this topic has been on my mind for a while:\n\nIsn't being a "nice" person, and a people-pleaser (as described in the article) associated with Fe? Especially since it seems to directly contradict Fi (authenticity, personal values, etc). Wouldn't that more likely make the writer an Fe user?\n\nSo in other words, can you be an INFP and struggle with being too much of a people-pleaser? 
16	Literally dreamt this.	We met in a museum. She was some scientist and we went on a trip in a rowboat in the ocean for her work. Then she fell overboard and I dove in after her, and she died on a box with me holding her. Then I wake up and I got the sensation of her hand wafting away like smoke or a ghost in mine. Probably one of my most vivid dreams. Pretty cool but it did really feel like losing someone you really care for. :/
1	I hope you don't mind if I share my most recent dream as well.. so here goes. \n\nMy old teacher was complimenting me for doing an excellent job, helping hang an old schoolmate's laundry. He tells me, I must really be trusted if he was able to bring me around his family's property. It seems a little bizarre because I don't really like those people and I usually go out of my way to avoid them. The former schoolmate never really liked me either.. but hey, maybe they must have made a huge impression on me.
1	Woah. How strange is it that we can dream these profound moments, in this case a loved one dying by your side, and then we just wake up and we're like "oh that didn't actually happen" and then we go to work or whatever.

2	Was Layne Staley an INFP?	Hi there. I'm a fan of Alice In Chains and I'd like to know if Layne was an INFP or not. I have seen him typed as an ISFP as well. \nHis lyrics, altough simple, are of such a brooding nature that makes me think he is intuitive. I mean, if Kurt Cobain is considered almost unanimously an INFP, why not Layne?
5	i’d say one of these two as well....\n\nunplugged helped me survive high school, the entire first two years i’d listen to it daily, and even now i sometimes go back to it and admire the absolute beauty.\n\nsomehow i’d rather say infp. just a guesstimation + intuition \n\nsomeone w more knowledge of the cognitive functions should share an opinion 
22	META observation: I kinda wish groups into MBTI focused more on how to improve yourself as a person before thinking of any other MBTI as a "perfect match", "optimal friend", "not compatible", etc.	My family's been visiting the last few days but in my downtime I've been getting back into MBTI as a concept. Its interesting to me. \n\nI've noticed, though, that there's a lot of focus on people being fundamentally good or bad for each other in MBTI discussions. Like, people either inherently or not inherently jiving. \n\nI don't think the world is that rigid. I think, if anything, MBTI is just a great starting point for maybe figuring out your weaknesses and how to improve your life and peace of mind. \n\nThoughts?
6	This is exactly why I love mbti-tests. It gave me a better understanding on what I need to work on.\nPeople treat it like some astrology-shit
2	gonna slap a solid SAME on this one 
36	My wife (INFJ) and I (INFP) are splitting up and it's my fault.	I've made mistakes in this 7 year relationship. I wasn't the perfect husband. But I loved her with all of my heart. And at the beginning, she loved me too. All I ever wanted to do was to care for her and to make her happy, but I always managed to fuck things up. I hurt her in the past, and I betrayed her trust. I always tried to be a better person but I didn't feel like I deserved her anymore. I let myself become so passive in this relationship and life in general. As a result, I wasn't there for her when she needed me. \n\n2018 was rough. It started out with a miscarriage, followed by depression on both sides. Traumatizing stuff from her past came up that was never properly addressed or handled. We had some pretty big fights and had nearly stopped having sex. During the summer our bedroom got so hot that we slept on separate sofas in the living room. \n\nThat's around the time she met David.\n\nHer and David met on an MBTI group and instantly connected. They messaged each other daily for multiple months. They shared each other's passions and interests. He was there for her when I wasn't. He was her shoulder to cry on. She shared her intimate side with him. She was happy with him. She told him she loved him....\n\nShe told me this last Monday.\n\nNeedless to say I broke down. Our last big fight was in November. After that fight I went out and got her the biggest bouquet of red tulips (her favorite) i could find. It was at that point I had made a clear point to her that I wanted to save this relationship. We had a wonderful Christmas together. I was planning a weekend vacation for our anniversary next month. We had just spent the night in Chicago eating pizza and dancing. I even had a beautiful gift I bought her for valentines day that I never got to give her. I was really trying to get our love back because I still love her with all of my heart.\n\nThen she tells me all of this on Monday. Abour her 3 month romantic affair with David. I cannot describe the amount of mental and emotional pain I have been in since I found that out. And the fact that she hid it from me for 8 months. I asked if she is still talking to him and she said no. She said he wanted to meet her in person, she was nervous and didn't want to, they ended up fighting, and stopped talking to each other last fall. But then she told me she wanted to split up. She said she thinks we are no longer compatible and there are better people out there for us. She wanted a divorce.\n\nI don't know how to handle this. I picked up divorce papers from the courthouse. We're sleeping in separate rooms for now until we figure out living arrangements. It's been 6 days and still each day I hurt worse. We used to have something amazing together. How could I fuck this up so badly. I feel like there's just something wrong with me.\n\nAnd if she was unhappy why didn't she just leave...
8	I followed everything until the last sentence. Leaving a marriage seems like huge, scary decision and usually people want to avoid such an extreme measure. You obviously don't want her to leave but then said she should've left if she truly felt unhappy? This puts her in a difficult situation. I guess the biggest problem on your end is how you perceive your self-worth. Sorry but tell me if I'm reading this correctly... 
7	Try not to blame yourself too much, OP. You’re already going through a hard time. Please take care of yourself.
7	I'm was in the same situation but 10 years 2 kids. It hurts, its tough, but you'll manage. Took me along time to realize she was putting in 110% and i was barely giving it 30%. It's amicable now, she ended up cheating physically. I wasn't there for her. I'm 34 and still trying to piece myself together. Each day I learn more about myself. It's gonna hurt for a while, learn from this and time will heal the pain inside your heart. It's a lonely path we walk, but it doesn't have to be. 
4	In the meantime keep yourself busy. Find a hobby or something. Just stay away from the house as much as you can.
5	Everyone makes mistakes, and you shouldn’t feel the need to carry 100% of the blame for this.  A marriage is a partnership, or at least — it’s supposed to be.  I’m sorry you’re going through this.\n\nI’m actually going through something similar with my husband of 7 years.  We love each other, but I can’t help feeling like we’d be happier with other people.  Neither one of us seems to put in any effort to make the other happy, and any attempts to remedy the situation last for mere days, before we’re back to our regular routine.  We don’t love the same way, and we often talk past each other.  We’re both incredibly lonely, and longing for a connection that we’re just not getting from each other.\n\nNow, in your situation (and mine, actually) the trust has been broken on both sides.  I think this makes it difficult to work toward a resolution, because that requires truly believing in yourself and your partner.  We may want to be the kind of people who put in every effort to make our relationships last, but because of past mistakes, we don’t really believe we’re capable of doing so.  Plus, we may have trouble trusting our partners to keep up their side of the relationship, too.  We’ve let each other down before, so who’s to say it won’t happen again and again and again?  It’s almost expected now.  Also, that causes every little argument to thrust us back into that negative thought pattern.    I don’t know how to escape it.  \n\nChildren complicate things further, because while they’re innocent in all of this, the decision to stay or leave will have a huge impact on them — there’s no way around it.  I’d guess that’s a big part of the reason she didn’t “just leave”.  That impact can be a positive one, though — I don’t want to sound too negative, here.  I think it’s actually preferable for children to have separated parents than parents who are together, but modeling an unhealthy relationship.\n\nYou’re not alone in this, though, and it sounds like you have a good enough relationship with your wife to separate amicably — if that’s ultimately what you both decide to do.  I’m sure it won’t be easy, but who knows what the future holds?  Give it time.  
4	Have you guys tried couples counseling? If you find a good counselor I know of many people who say it saved their marriage. As long as your efforts are sincere and not an act just to rope someone back in, people usually appreciate the sincerity of effort.\n\nEven if you ultimately decide to split up it could be really healing for BOTH of you. \nFrom my experience, it's really the healthiest gift you could give one another. It offers the opportunity to learn and grow, whereas without support you two could be angry and disappointed in each other for years to come. \n\nI would tell her you need help understanding what went wrong and how to make things better for your relationships going forward. \n\nGood luck. I hope things get better for you. It may take time, but have faith, eventually you will overcome this trial.
3	If she’s totally set on divorce, you can only learn from the painful experience. But if she’s got part of her that wants to try, I recommend the book my husband of 36 year marriage and I are using along with counseling. Sue Johnson’s Hold Me Tight. Very useful. 
5	You are trying to find errors in yourself while you have been suffering from infidelity for a few months. She didn't even tell you enough. And she stayed. You said that she doesn't love you anymore. Why blame yourself? Please don't be harsh on yourself. You did nothing wrong existentially, you've only been a victim to someone's change of """standards""".\n\nLook, INTJ's and J's in general spend a lot of time thinking about what they have Vs what they could have. What is a person's worth (often can mislead them and people in their lives to lose their self esteem because the values they judge by are a big ugh). And so on... It's not like we don't think like that ourselves but she turned her eyes to other values than the amazing thing you want so much.\n\nLove is a beautiful thing. But make sure that she loves you for you, not for the husband you make her seem you are. I'd never compromise on this as an INFP. Yes, I know, fantasy world. No problem. This is your life. 
3	How is her cheating on you your fault. I don't think you are thinking clearly. Is it even worth saving the relationship or will it cause even more pain in the long run? 
1	I would not get a divorce. I would maybe take 1-2 years living separately and see how you feel from there. Maybe 1 year apart, you will realize how much you miss each other. I think it is never a good idea to make such a huge decision without taking the time to process it.\n\nIf you haven't read it already, I recommend you read the book _Getting the Love You Want_ by Harville Hendrix.
1	Relationships take two people to work. This isn't on your shoulders alone. 
1	I hope you find healing soon:)
1	The way you wrote this alone broke my heart. Don't be so hard on yourself, it sounds like you really did try to me. Maybe you were more available than you thought, and are just having a hard time seeing it now because of all of the pain.
1	It isn’t your fault, it just isn’t working out. INFPs are great at blaming themselves but some relationships just don’t last till death. You probably made this persons life amazing for the whole time you were together, it’s gonna hurt but you are strong and worth every second. You sound so genuine and loving, someone else is out there for you when you are ready. 
11	How to spot an INFP and make friends with them in real life?	I've never met an INFP in real life besides myself and ironically, there are supposed to be more INFPs than others personality types where I live (10% according to 16personalities.com ). I really want to meet other people who think like me. And also, probably try to date one. How to spot an INFP, especially a guy?
14	First of all, even if the site thinks so, there's no way that a country has more than 6% infp's, from my observation.\n\nSecond of all, here are 3 things: \n1. Look for the disenchanted. Tricky because they don't get out much but yeah. \n2. Nature parties! More INFP's there. \n3. Music and art scenes in the closest big city. 
1	Question of the year. I’m not buying these percentages. I’ve only ever mer like two. Ironically, i’ve met too many infj’s and they’re supposed to be the rarest type. I would give anything to have an infp best friend irl

6	Poll: MBTI relationship matches. Best and worst.	If you’re in a relationship - what type is your partner? How is it going? How long has it been?\n\nWhat’s been your best MBTI match?\n\nWhat’s been your worst MBTI match?
8	I dated an ENTP for 4.5 years. He was intellectually stimulating and creative. That kept me entertained. But, his insatiable need to debate, even the most taboo topics, made me feel uncomfortable at times. I felt I was constantly on damage control. \n\nI also dated an ESTJ - who is the complete opposite in every way. At first, I loved it and it worked out so well. When we were good - we were extremely connected, communicative and unstoppable. The things I lacked, he strengthened, and vice versa. But, when we were bad, it was exhausting. Communication broken down. The way we worked through problems was completely different. We both felt misunderstood and misinformed.\n\nI have an INFP friend who I went on a couple dates with many years ago. But I never felt the spark or passion. While we get along on so many levels, share similar interests and are still very good friends, I find myself wondering what dating a similar type would be like. There’d be the inherent understanding - but would it be boring? 
4	My type has been ENTPs for as long as I can remember. I just find them so attractive even if they annoy me pretty often. They're a challenge, a puzzle to be solved, and we always have amazing chemistry.\n\nMy current bf is an ENTP. It's not always perfect and he can sometimes hurt my feelings with his 'facts and logic' and argumentative attitude but otherwise we're really happy.\n\nI have also been in love with a fellow INFP. It was like a fairytale, insanely passionate, but ultimately too much drama.\n\nMy best friend is an ENFP. I love ENFPs but I wouldn't date most of them. 
5	My husband is an ESTJ, complete opposite of me. Sometimes we struggle to understand each other because I’m lead by my heart and he’s lead by his head, but we still work well. He takes initiative and does things when I’m held back by anxiety or doubt and I help him see things from a different perspective. He genuinely cares and tries to understand how I see things. We balance each other out perfectly :) 
5	Atm I'm talking to a girl I've met online. We already like each other since October 2018 and I think you can say we're in a long distance relationship. She's also an INFP and I couldn't wish myself a better match!!
3	I'm only going to go based on people who've told me what they got for MBTI. \n\nMy most longstanding friends, oddly enough, have been ISTPs. This is why I always encourage people not to focus too much on best MBTI matches listed online because ISTPs are the fucking best and everything I've seen says we shouldn't sinc up. No sexual chemistry at all, but all around amazing buds. Some of my other best friends have been ESFPs, ENTJs. and ESTJs. ESFPs are so much fun and I always felt so supported and accepted by them. They didn't care what my personality was, they just wanted to party and have fun all the time haha. My good friend is an ESTJ and you couldn't find more protective mom type if you tried. She said she loves my sweet attitude, and has tried to set me up on dates. The only thing that bothers me about her is I've seen her be rude to servers. Not cool. Had some great ISTJ friends. They're the only people I've ever met who've been able to give me truly callous criticism and it didn't put me on defensive or make me upset. Something about their tone and the fact that they're usually fucking right and I should listen haha. \n\nMy sister is one of my best friends, and she said she always tests ENFJ. Sometimes I think she thinks I'm self centered, which hurts because I never want to disappoint her, but on the opposite end I often get annoyed by her 'steam-rolling' my opinions/emotions/interests. Like, acting like they are either not important or petty, I dunno. She can be extremely condescending, but that might be because she is my sister. I'll never be able to date one because I'll always think of her haha. \n\nI've dated some ENFPs and either fell instantly in love or felt like they were suffocating me. No in-between. Either straight up wanted to marry them or just wanted some peace and quiet. So, so charming when they're confident and love themselves. In my experience (any reading, please don't take offense) SUPER clingy and needy when they're in an unhealthy part of life. \n\nMet a guy ENTP one time and swooned so hard. I don't think he was as into me, though, since I didn't seem like his type looks-wise. Been wanting to meet another for a long time, and have only run into one person who seems like they might be but they moved. That being said, it was incredibly hard for me to tell if he had sexual interest in me since he seemed to exude sexuality and flirtiness 24/7. He seemed like one of those people who could be flirty and display interest in everyone in the room just in an effort to make friends, so I never wanted to read too much into his actions. We messaged back an forth about a lot of random ideas we had and some debate, and I wish I had the balls to ask him if he liked me, but I was so afraid of how dissapointed I'd be if he rejected me. I admittedly think about him more than I should. I'd never met anyone quite like him before and would have loved to learn more of what was in his brain. Especially now that I've learned that I'm more sensitive than most people and need to learn to tackle my emotions better and express myself healthily, I think we would have gotten along even better if I knew him now. \n\nI've met one INFJ, and we were instant friends. I feel like I wasn't the most healthy person when it knew her, though, which I regret terribly. I deliberately try to make up for it now by taking what she's told me she hates friends doing and doing the opposite. For example, she told me once that she hates when friends move to a new state and ghost. I text her at least once a month just to check in.\n\nBecame fast friends with at least one INTP. If I was more mature then, I wouldn't have been hurt when she went to another job and didn't keep up with me. I always knew she was pretty insensitive to that kinda thing. \n\nAlways got on well with other INFPs and ISFPs, but mostly when we talk it's been during depressive episodes where we just needed someone to understand our emotions. I wish I could meet one outside of that now that I've worked on myself and I'm happy. ISFPs, can you please mind-meld your amazing fashion sense and super cool aura to me? Thanks. \n\nThat's all I can think of now.\n\nEdit: Take this one with a grain of salt, because I'm only 90% positive on the type. My mother, who I believe in an ISFJ, is one of the sweetest and most caring women I've ever met. She put up with my ass through the best and worst of times, and never gave up on me through some of my darker times. I couldn't have asked for a more caring and loving mother if I tried, even if she doesn't quite get my quirks sometimes. Interesting combo of being practical and artistic. The only things I would say that we just don't get eachother on are: She HATES vulgar humor and I love it, she can be a touch too gossipy about her friends for my taste, and she is much more conservative than me. Both of my parents have pretty strong republican values, and we definitely don't see eye to eye most of the time, but they are good people with amazing characters. I think they definitely have me beat as being consistently decent human beings. If I had to guess for my dad, probably ISTJ? I don't know for him, though, that's tougher.  \n
2	I forgot to add the types I don't mesh well with - it's definitely ENFJs (too fake) and INTPs (they're so arrogant, but they're actually so fucking clueless). Of course, this is just from my experience. 
2	Interesting!\n\nA colleague is an INTP and I feel somewhat like kindred spirits. I think I just like the way his mind works. And they are so rational. I respect ration and reason - probably because I have to work hard on those things. 
2	My GF is ESFJ. S and J can make it tough sometimes, but we complement each other most of the time. The shared F helps a lot. 
1	I honestly don’t know what my best match would be or if I even believe in a best match anymore. I’ve grown so much and I feel like i’m still growing. I feel like a new person each day I wake up. So my ideal partner would be someone who’s good at adapting without being too detached about it. Someone who is internally consistent even if they are externally inconsistent. Someone who is willing to explore as much life as possible without losing their passion and connection to me. \n\nI guess I want someone who’s equally curious, passionate, and loyal. Someone with a child like spirit/soul.\n\nMy worst match would likely be someone who fails to have any of the qualities described above xD 
1	Totally. Our need to keep the peace is smothered by an ENTP’s constant need to debate (at almost any cost) and an ESTJ’s need to control. 
1	ENFP - I have dated 3 who I had really comfortable, intense, deep and fun relationships with. But two cheated on me a LOT, the other was better as a friendship. \n\nISFJ - was very lovely and kind, so loyal, but no depth. We had some similar humour but made me feel quite trapped and hated how unconventional I was. As did his family. I think I broke him. \n\nINTP - we really got eachother on an intellectual level, we had an open relationship and lots of exploration. However he could be incredibly arrogant and actually weirdly analytical and rude about my appearance? Ended up as long distance which fizzled out, but we still talk and learn so much from eachother. \n\nENTP - really intense connection, made me laugh more than anybody ever has, the wildest imaginative conversations. The biggest love - but so unreliable and flaky. \n\nISTJ - current and longest relationship. When it's good it is light hearted, so many inside jokes, reliable and affectionate. Balances my weaknesses - brings logic where I bring empathy. But he can be rude to kind people. When it's bad it's like we are from different planets - communication is problematic, we just don't get each other. I feel stifled, he cannot understand my moods and emotions. Right now we are struggling. I crave constant change, he fears it. \n

3	I like it!!
3	For me it seems to have a... Not paranoia, but maybe a nervousness (?) about it? Like a being of light that's hiding in gradually darker shadows. The texture reminds me of rain on a window, or of rough terrain ahead for this little dot of light as it takes its first few timid steps from the darkest recesses. 
1	It has become an enigma in my workspace. It is a bastard painting hanging in my workspace. I’ve never really had strong feelings for it and I never thought it was finished but over time it has become such a stranger of a painting to me...like it has formed it’s own opinion of itself and it’s telling me to leave it alone...lol. I know I’m kinda weird about my creations. Just felt like I needed to share. ✌🏻
8	How do you guys cope with a loss of relationship?	All I could feel right now is a mix of anger, regret, and sadness, trying to figure out what went wrong with our relationship / friendship. How do you guys try to cope and accept these kinds of pain?
8	Good habits and routines. They’re called ‘good habits’ for a reason. Habits are something formed by repetition over time.  But they have to be GOOD. Nothing destructive.\nDo all the shit you couldn’t do when you were shackled. And time. Time heals all wounds. \nAlso. Let your narcissistic side out a little bit. Take time for yourself, do stuff that makes you feel good about yourself. \n

1	I feel like i’m always losing relationships. People are always coming in and out of my life. Partially because I can’t sit still. Partially because I tend to get bored easily. I have a hard time letting go of the past until something new and exciting comes up. When I know that I need to let go of something or someone, I start spoon feeding my Ne new experiences to help cope through the pain 
130	Every INFP i know	
6	I don’t think I’ve ever let mine out...I’m too submissive and afraid of conflict. The closest I’ve ever gotten to releasing my inner bitch is yelling at bad drivers from inside my car with the windows rolled up. 
6	I feel like I’m being a bitch when I get things done, but my coworkers just remind me that I’m being a leader. I think we tend to feel like we should let things be and mind our own business, but there’s nothing wrong with speaking up, and it doesn’t in itself make you a bitch.

Well a few years ago I decided that if good people like me and you are too afraid to do the same then our world is doomed. \n\nNever felt more empowered than by standing firmly behind myself. Best advice I ever got from a therapist was to be as kind to myself as I am to everyone else. And that means allowing yourself your opinions. Because they are probably good and just and desperately needed in this world. And we all have your back.\n\n*climbsdownfromsoapbox*\n

2	Fresh cigarette smoke, yeah. There's something oddly comforting about it. Even though I don't smoke myself and never have. I feel similarly about bonfires too, it's relaxing. 
1	I don't mind the smell of those solid  black kinds. Cloves or something  like that. But even then I'm  like...nah.
1	Certain types, mainly cigars, smell nice. The smell get more overwhelming and gross when strong, though, and I only like it when they're actively lit--not a fan of the sticky lingering smell they leave on everything.
1	Can't say I do, particularly as it reminds me of  death, BUT I do get similar with weed for an odd reason (never smoked it, just don't mind the smell)
9	Love yo self!	I know I need to practice having better confidence, etc. and I think a lot of us here do. I think it's great to appreciate your own good qualities. It makes you happier and healthier. Being modest is one thing, being self deprecating is another. So, I occasionally try to remind myself of things that I like about me. Today I like my green eyes and my ability to knit (even though I'm not exceptionally good). What's at least one thing you like about yourself? \n\nP.S. Please don't say, there's nothing you like about yourself... Even if you can't think of anything right now, you are valuable. You matter, and the world is a better place because you're in it. Yes you. Really.
1	Thank you for this topic! \n\nI like that I have a knack for making miniature things. 
1	I got into self love kinda a two weeks ago and I am already in love with myself. Low key. I think it's the Infp thing to fall fast 😃 I hope I don't blow it 😃.\n\nI can be good with words.\n
15	Crushes and being in love	Hey,\n\nI don't know if this is  something that happens to me (always) or if it's part of a trait of being introverted or infp, but it's always the same, I tend to have crush and internally obsess about that person (without being invasive or idk intrusive...aka bothering that person in any mean possible) until I get to the point that, that person is never going to consider me even as possible option (and no, not talking about celebrity crushes) I'm talking about the type of person whom you see at work, school or something, and honestly i'm exhausted, I tried not to think about it, or to ignore such feelings because I feel they're partly delusions or daydreams, but I always end up hurt because even if from the beginning I knew the answer my heart is always hopeful, and i'm just tired of always the same, not being good enough or feeling like ·$%&/ because my crushes are never going to set an eye on me, my friends have advised me to act on it, like start talking or you know coy flirting and test the grounds, but it's simply impossibly because in my head I already know (or feel) that i'm not even the kind of person someone would be ever be attracted to. It's basically [this](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/9b/26/9b/9b269bdeeefe8ca540169036427f209c--joey-friends-hatred-quotes.jpg) from the moment i realize I like someone, I just wish i weren't attracted to anyone sometimes, it'd be easier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEver happened to anyone? Did you find a solution or have any advice or any word/perspective to consider on?
5	I do this same kinda thing, I feel like it has to do with INFP's idealizing our romantic partners and wanting perfection which is what we think this partner could be, So we obsess about them, but To be honest I don't know a solution as I am still a young person myself, but this is something I can identify with and honestly struggle with.
3	Yes I obsess over people I barely know. I day dream about a life with them. I think they are the one. Then I realize they probably wouldn't be into me or it's not meant to be. Because if it was meant to be it would have happened. I too don't have a solution, and I kind of don't want one. I like doing this, even if it's unhealthy, doing it just gives me hope that maybe one day it will happen and I will realize why it didn't happen with the other people I was obsessing over. Because part of me wants my future SO to come out of nowhere when I least expect it. And it's not going to happen like that when i'm obsessing over them and expecting it to happen.
3	  \n\nI myself tend to shut my head when it's making noise. I know as an INFP that I sure do idealize the many crushes I’ve had, and I’ve learned to take it as something anomalous that shouldn't be there in my brain, or a disease that I should fight against to center in reality. And what really helped me neutralize those emotions was focusing on personal projects that make me feel good about myself. it worked well for me since entering college last year.\n\nif you want to get to know someone, whether it'd be for friendship as romantic interest, the obvious answer would be "approach to them" but we know how BIG of a deal that would be to go in just like that so that’s a very true obstacle.\n\nI found purpose and fulfilment in sticking to my plan. To expand my comfort zone and dealing with failure for a bigger reward, which is finding balance between being explosive outwards and reclusive inwards, rather than just the later. discipline to what you wish to obtain.\n\nother thing I say to myself is that as long as I don't intend to hurt someone in the process of my development, I can do anything I want and experiment. I recognize myself as an ignorant who's jumping dive first into real life just a tad late and I sure don't want to stay behind just for being afraid of failing. You can be a little bit crazy uwu\n\nthere, I sprawled some thoughts that I hope makes sense to some. do take care out there.  \n\n\nalso not a native English speaker by the way. Might've screwed something up.
2	I feel this.. although I have a good friend who happens to be an infp too. And our "weirdness" works well together so maybe I do have a chance. \nWho knows.
2	I experience the exact same things! And the worse thing is, I internalise my feelings so even my friends don’t know about my crush, hence making it even more suffocating.
1	*Always* .
0	Two Questions:	The first question is for both guys and girls but the second one is for guys only. \n\nThe first Question: **Are you able to make people online think you're the obbosite gender?** (Like you're a guy and can make anyone convinced that you're a girl. And the obbosite for girls)\n\nThe second Question (For guys): **How often people confuse your gender online?**\n\nI'm asking this because I get both and can 'catfish' as a girl.  \n\n
5	1: yes\n2: often
2	I'm a boy and have been mistaken to a girl twice. in real life

1	Trying to root out all the male Infp’s aren’t you? Smart plan but now that I’ve exposed it you’ll never get them all.
0	This sub this strange... pretty much expected. 
8	Official r/infp Minecraft server?	Is there an official server for this subreddit? I know a lot of us like MC, but from asking around it doesn't seem like there's a dedicated place for the whole gang. Just wanted to check if there's anything :)
2	I want this.
1	We can all have our own little chunk and do our own thing while feeling the comeraderie of each other's presence and leaving random gifts for each other. 
84	Infp man just realized what he wants in a partner	Man here. Have always felt different from other men when I don’t get attracted to hot women. I mean, yeah, I can see that they’re physically attractive, but have never wanted to be with them. Was talking with a fellow infp man and realized what I’m looking for: an adorable woman whom I can cuddle with and can connect with emotionally. Not a spokesperson for all infp men, obviously, but it is very liberating to know what I want. \n\nHere’s to owning who you truly are! 
37	I’m a woman but I understand what you’re saying. Not the same, but somewhat related: I’ve always thought that I was odd because I cannot feel physical chemistry/attraction to someone right away no matter how good looking they are. I have to feel an emotional connection over time, before I feel physical attraction. This makes dating tricky because I move so slowly. But I’ve tried to just accept that it’s the way I am!
16	Ahhhhh I was just about to post this!!!! I’m a woman, but I realized my ideal relationship would be with a human that I enjoy where we buy houses so we’re next door neighbours. We can cuddle whenever we need, but can also retreat to our own safe spaces. I also realized that sex actually isn’t a necessity, even though I previously thought it was. 
5	I'm glad you figured out that part of your life. It's really relieving when you find out who you are and you can be yourself. keep learning.
5	INFP 32M here, what you are saying here resonates with me a lot, I wish I would have come to the same conclusion years earlier. It is simple, but kinda difficult at the same time, coming to the realization that it is perfectly fine to be different, than most men.
4	Looks don't do anything at all for me as well. I need a lot of runway when it comes to dating which does make it very difficult. 
8	Yes, recognize it!! I mean, I do get attracted to hot woman, but mostly only in a sexual way, where as with cute woman, I just can't get my eyes of them.\n\nWith all the luck of the world I can say that I actually met a girl online who is super adorable, loves to cuddle and love me all the time, and is also an INFP!! Only downside is that she lives in another country and I have to wait a few months to meet her :(
3	I’ve always dated extroverts. No idea why. My current bf is also an introvert and for the first time I understand why I’ve always had to struggle to get enough me time in a relationship. From here on out - ambiverts or introverts only for me. 
3	Sounds like you're demisexual tbh 
2	I'm an ambivert infp lady who has been single for almost 4 years now.  I realised that my ex needed me to be his EVERYTHING.  i was his only friend, his only family, his idea of constant companionship despite having completely different tastes in most things... he EXPECTED  me to be there.  \nNow i know that i can't possibly live like that.  I know that i like sexy intimate times but sex doesn't necessarily have to be daily, just the intimacy. I know that i like to be near someone, but not actually talk.  I have found that I'm quite happy to be aware of my own accomplishments, i don't feel the need to share every little thing i do with a person... but when i do share, it's because i really want to. \n\nI'd love to find a bloke who could accept all that.  
2	The comfort and cuddle-ability aspect is very strong for me too. I think that's why I prefer guys with a slight paunch and a soft hairy chest and belly. No rock-hard Cristiano Ronaldo-smooth abs for me, thank you. 
1	Totally agree. 
18	I don’t mean to sound so pessimistic, but I am extremely prone to boredom. I don’t know what to do with myself half the time. It’s a real problem.	
5	Podcasts. Morning, noon and night...podcasts. Also weed.
3	I feel ya bud maybe you should try a new hobby which is something I have thought of doing, but I can't really stick to anything, so that's pretty hard for me. Maybe you could spend your time doing whatever your current hobbies are if any, if you are in school maybe study more, there are infinite possibilities, but honestly I have a hard time actually starting anything.
3	I would personally stay away from weed. Been addicted for 26yrs and now into week 8 of quitting and it’s hard. r/leaves \n\nMayb join a community group, old ladies knitter club :)  or chess or DnD club. Or even archery.  I love being alone and find so much to do. Late night home Reno’s, building bonfires, writing in my gratitude journal, learning mandolin, playing video games, painting on my windows, organizing, learning to upholster 
2	Love pod casts 
2	I feel this.. I'm struggling really bad with chronic illness right now and have been bedridden for months. I've done everything I can possibly think to do and the boredom is the worst part.. 
1	Inner work. 😍
1	I got back into Pokemon Go. It's kind of like a video game, but it's more like a hobby for me. I get to meet people, go out driving, collect Pokemon, etc. It's just something I can do whenever i'm bored. And it helps clear my head when i'm out driving.

9	I feel like my internet addiction is fueling my introversion and often wonder what it would be like if I quit the internet altogether.	I spend all my free time on reddit, twitter and gmail.  And I've been doing this for so long its just become a way of life. Instead of going out into the world, and trying new things, hell, even trying new things in the comfort of my own home its just constant scrolling of reddit and twitter.\n\nAnd it's gotten to the point where I don't have many friends left because I never bothered to really nourish relationships or try/join new groups of people. Friendships fade, situations change and instead of going out and seeking new experiences I just go down the twitter rabbit hole or the youtube rabbit hole.\n\nI've often wanted to see what it would be like if I just quit the internet even for a day or week and was forced to like call that person I've been thinking of and make the effort to go do something.\n\nI'm alone on another Saturday night because my parents are out of town and it frankly really sucks...  If I had no internet, maybe I would have made an effort to make plans with somebody or do something. I don't know.  It's not good to go through so much of life alone. Something inside of me knows its not ok.\n\nFeeling kinda bummed about it. I fear my internet addiction is too strong. The chains have been locked through years of internet-abuse.\n\nThanks for reading.
2	Go to the local library, register. Browse the books or newspapers, see if anything catches your interest. \n\nBuy a newspaper, take a marker. Read through the article, evaluate what you're being told, highlight what you think it's not correct or requires further elaboration.\n\nGo for a walk.\n\nClean up your room.\n\nTurn the internet off, set yourself a challenge for the evening. Just brainstorm what would you like to do and how you're going to do it.\n\nMeditate.\n\nSet your own exercise, no watching YT or anything like that, do the research make the plan, execute the plan.\n\nJust some recommendations.  
1	You could just try for like a month?
1	1. RescueTime: Install to get a starting point of how much of your time is being spent and where. Moment, is another good one for the phone.\n2. Utilize this information to make changes and slowly try to decrease time spent in categories per week.\n3. Use website blockers to further this goal, such as StayFocused, blocking your "problem" websites at certain times, or limiting overall hour usage to what you desire.\n\nI struggle with spending too much time on the internet in pursuit of "knowledge and research", but tend to be just bouncing around between different websites. My problem isn't so much with phone usage but this can apply there aswell.\n\nYour first step is tracking your usage and seeing just how much time you spend on what websites and at what times of day. Seeing the actual usage is key as it then takes away the unknown of how much time is being spent and where.\n\nIn my own experience, my internet usage isn't just a "habit", but is an information addiction. Its also masking other areas in my life I'm avoiding improving / working on. It can be really hard to break, so I would start slowly. Try to define the true reason you spend so much time on such sites. Then try to replace that feeling with another hobby or activity. You got this!\n\nA quote that resonated with me when making changes in this area: \n\n"Some people die at 25 and aren't buried until 75." - Ben Franklin\n\nEdit: Some activities that have worked for me: Utilizing library for free books and reading more, color drawing books, listening to interesting podcasts, spending more time outside (even just walking around your neighborhood), one screen at a time, working out, etc.
1	What are you still doing here?! Get out of here, now! Go live. Go!
36	Thank you 😊	I just wanted to tell you that I'm really happy with this little corner of the Internet.  I often have trouble with expressing myself and speaking my mind even when am online, be it for fear of regection, judgment or the fact that English is not my language and I don't like making mistakes, that even leads to me not being able to comment on the Internet, but you are one of the most accepting, not judgemental and kind people out there so it's not that hard to express myself.\n\nJust keep being you, and don't let anybody change you. We can often feel like we are not needed but the world wouldn't be the same without someone like you ❤.
6	Thank you bro, i'm not always that expressive either, even on the internet.

6	it kinda sucks having a close friend who has other other close friends or like not even having a few close friends. i am starting to feel lonely once again haha
1	i wish i had any confidence in my capabilities. i can't even think to send a care package or gift baked goods for another *without* my overthinking getting in the way. why can't i ever just do something simple without all these thoughts and doubts?
1	My dad is very sick. I think I might lose him soon. He's my everything. \n\nThere are other individuals like him but only one of them is my dad. Only one of them do I both respect and bother and love and argue with because he's such a wonderful enigma - my dad, the man that raised me. Please help.
1	Neon genesis evangelion should be required viewing for all INFPs. I've clicked with the director in a way that makes me feel like I really understand his emotional state. I feel weird liking a cartoon as much as this, but do yourselves a favor and check it out!
1	Well recently made my reddit account and fortunately I found this thread with fellow INFPs.\n\nI have recently finished high-school in a computer oriented one, and when I had to choose a career I   just appointed myself to computer university just as if it was kind of what "I should do" . But one week there made me realise it isn't what I like, that I followed it by pressure (my brother followed that one, plus everyone I knew was following some career that led them to moneymaking stuff) and economic necessity as I am pretty poor. I am very good with computers but I don't see myself studying it. Working? For sure, but no studying it at the same time. I would be so unhappy.\nI am thinking of studying cinema, as it's something I love and kind of a dream to be a filmmaker. Also considering educational psychology and physical therapy, almost anything that involves taking care of others and counseling.\nThis change of focus responded on me in lots of anxiety and stress, so that nowadays I feel a bit too socially anxious, just as I used to be in the past (I could "get over" it, but now its back).\nMy poorness is a bit depressing for me and makes me still reconsider following some career that favors money, but programming is a pretty flexible world, I don't think I need a paper that says I know how to program to be a good coder or smth. As for cinema, I think I will love it. 
22	Generally speaking, are you fascinated by airports, people watching at airports, travel in general?	These are some of my favorite things....curious if this is something that also resonates with other's INFP's sensibilities....
5	Same here :) I love airports, planes, watching people following their dreams and creating new experiences. Sometimes I go to the nearest airport just to see arrivals and departures. It makes me feel so good and relaxed. I always wonder why people travelling from point X to Y - are they changing their lives now? Are they coming back to loved ones? Imagination can reach the highest level here. It's kinda weird I guess, but who cares if I just love this ❤️ \n\nPS Two days ago I booked weekend flight just to meet my friend and to fly above clouds again! I'm totally excited about it (one month to go)! It will be my first solo trip and I can't wait anymore 🤗 \n\nThank you for the post (little reminder about my beloved flights haha) and have a nice day! 
4	Sure, airports are cool... But what I really love is watching the workers do their thing at the local port. Watching the ships come and go, the shipping containers get moved around and stacked, all the buzz is just so fascinating. 
3	Yes! It's so exciting. I still want to get pilot license one day. 
3	Love travel and seeing new places.
3	I love watching people at train stations and imagine their stories, especially when they're saying hello or goodbye to each other when arriving or leaving.😍
2	I love travelling if you mean that
2	I love airports! Especially when i am travelling alone, i get to actually sit down for a while and just look around. I love how you see people from all over the world, different shapes and sizes and different languages in one place. It’s so fascinating. \n\nWhenever i am comfortable enough, i try and make conversation with whoever seems willing to. I had met the most interesting guy once who was from saudi arabia but had a canadian passport and he told me ‘i want to make this much money and then...’ the ‘this’ part he showed holding both his hands up and suggesting a good stack of money. I had never seen anyone say it like that. \n\nI also like train stations. Everybody going about their daily lives some for work, some to visit their loved ones. \n\nThe thing i love most about travelling is watching people say goodbye to each other. It’s usually got so many emotions in it even if they aren’t necessarily crying, just beautiful to watch people be people.
1	I dislike airports.. so many rude and anxious passengers. But I like people watching, pref from a cafe.
1	Airports, bus stations, buses and trains, the places in between are beautiful 
1	People watching.
1	Absolutely!
2	How do you guys type other people?	Just curious because I see posts like "I met this INFP" or "this guy is such an ENTJ" and I am wondering how do you know?\n\nDo you just guess based on your knowledge of the different types? Do you get them to take the test? Or do you ask them?\n\nI find a lot of people I speak to have either never heard of it or know very little about it. Is this just to do with it maybe not being as well known where I am from (I live in the UK)?\n\nAnd as much as I would like to know other people's types I sometimes find that people aren't as interested in this stuff as I am and getting them to do the test requires some convincing.\n\nSo how do you come to your conclusions about other people's types?
1	I've still to master it but i use this guide https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/149191973762/type-spotting-guide\nscroll down a bit to see that actual guide on the page 
40	Does anyone else get annoyed by some words?	I was just recently talking to someone and the conversation went like;\n\nMe: what are you up to?\n\nHim: just reading mario puzo’s godfather\n\nMe: is it nice? \n\nHim: yeah\n\nMe: the movies were awesome \n\nHim: obviously \n\nUgh that ‘obviously’ was just such a turn off. I dont know what was so annoying about it but just... \n\n
10	My body collapses in on itself like a dying star when I see "EEEEK!!!!" typed out\n\nOfc I'm sure there's words I use that irk other people too, I use "literally" a lot.  Sorry, other commenter!
13	I love words and I love to hear them used in surprising combinations
13	[deleted]
7	Words and phrases I loathe:\n\n"Bae"\n\n"The missus (referring to your girlfriend)"\n\n"Literally"\n\n"Long time no see.."\n\n"That's/You're so extra (What does this mean?)"\n\n
5	Yep.  For me, I struggle with words that come across in a slightly insensitive manner.  It's all about context for me.   For example, if someone says "thanks for the help" when I feel as though my contribution was equal to that of the person who thanked me for "helping", I go nuts.  It's not "help" if it's my project too.  "Help" implies that I'm here to be a supporting role.   I'm fine with that IF I am truly in a supporting role.   I am NOT ok though if I feel I have equal ownership of a project.  In that case, I prefer the word "collaboration" over "help".  That's just one example but suffice to say there are many nuances of words that equally make me lose my mind.  I know I know, I'm super sensitive.   
4	Ughhh I hate yummy, tummy, or any baby words
5	I want to stop talking with the person if they do a really fake sarcastic laugh after I laugh for real. Feels like they're mocking me either for thinking it was funny or because I have a weird laugh; either way I hate it
4	Oh fucking green hell!\n\nINFJ perspective....\n\nI take the time to spell out my words. Maybe sometimes they're misspelled. Sometimes it's on purpose because I'm bored with the human language.\n\nMostly I take the time to spell out my words to show that I respect you as a human. My time is valuable and whether you understand those or not doesn't matter. Spelling out all my words is my little way of showing you are valued.\n\nI get frustrated with myself because I don't think there's anything in any human language that can adequately describe exactly what I mean or how I feel by each word. Often times I overcompensate. It annoys the hell out of me. I can't just tell you that I'm proud of you. I have to say that I'm really extremely proud of you. \n\nAnyway......\nMost things other people type or text to me are annoying. Abbreviations weird-ass slang somebody just made up last week. Using words in text that they actually don't use in person. Short one-word replies. \n\nI probably shouldn't post this because it's not specific enough but I'm just in one of those moods and I'm going to let this hang right the fuck right here.
4	I used to hate Likewise, but now I use it all the time. I am also one who dislikes modern slang. it feels fake and shallow and doesn't express anything real. New slang is like a social prop to be accepted or fit in. That bugs me.\n\nThe inflection of voices, especially females, where they're kinda copying that "omg did you see Becky she's like soooooe blaaaaaaah!!!" kinda inflection really irritates me! It's kinda like a voice that's trying to imitate what cool sounds like.
3	Many people get annoyed by certain words, obviously
3	I hate the word "poop." It's like youre trying to make something gross sound cute. Just say shit.
2	Yes I hate so many words!! Lol I really hate obviously too!
2	I just read someone using  "finna" which I'm assuming is variation of "gonna" from "going to". I understand "gonna" which now seems so immature to me but where the hell did "finna" come from?????(I know... I'll google it) but I have to say I hate that word. It's gross and unnecessary. 
2	Yeah, I hate „literally“ too and „anyways“ and when people say „the thing is, is that“ (which I hear all the time) and for some reason I hate when people pronounce the t in often.
2	Utilize... \n\n"use" functions exactly the same way.
1	I have a lot of words people say and I’m totally getting it to the heart and I feel shit about what he said, although maybe he didn’t even mean it like that. Sometimes things can get really negative for me when someone didn’t even mean it negative. Yeah. I’m not that easy to understand hopefully someone can give a explanation if they understand what I mean
1	Yes, especially when used in a derogatory way. 
1	I hate when people say ok and  okay to something I tell them on text. Like I need more reaction please. 
1	I cant stand when someone says "sure". Not in every context but sometimes it sounds so denigrating for example: \n\nTeacher: can someone explain hamlets behaviour in act IV\n\nstudent: [insert an answer that is correct but not in the teachers words]\n\nTeacher:...sure \n\n-_- 
1	The terms yikes or weird flex\n
1	"gotcha" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nomgosh i want to strangle people who say this. it sounds so stupid! 
27	I need to talk to myself everyday	I don’t know if I am crazy or I am just super lonely but I tend to talk to myself everyday and I cherish my own time a lot as I really want my own personal space and time to do my favorite things and TALK to myself literally. Despite I always want attention and companion outside and always feel lonely. I get extremely frustrated when I am not alone at home so I tend to get really pissed when my parents or others enter my personal space. And tbh, I am starting to talk to myself outside a LOT too especially during the night I take a walk(I do it all the time when there aren’t many people around or empty). And it feels a lot better also relieves stress a lot. I have no idea what am I becoming.. I feel broken and depressed af but at the same time my mood swing is making it hard to identify how I am actually feeling logically. Since I do get excited easily and anxious..
6	I can be so outrageaos and be laughing and then can get into a depressive sad quiet moment the other time real quick.. 
4	I test as an Entp yet the more i read this thread the more I relate To being an infp.  Because SAME 
5	I'm an ENFP and I talk to myself everyday too. Almost like I am answering an interview question.\n\nI think it's the common intuition and mind-full trait that we share.\n\nAlso. I am an external processor. If I've got a lot going on in my head I need to talk to myself, someone or journal it down. 
2	I do this too. Like exactly this. Like I could have written this post this.  So far not crazy... though sometimes I wonder...
12	Anyone else imagines walking on the street, a random interviewer comes across you and askes you all type of personal questions about things you want to tell people in you're life, but you're to afraid to?	However in this interview you answer all questions and this feels really relieving for a moment, until you realise it isn't real.
7	Haha not that exact scenario. But yeah for some reason i am always being interviewed like a celebrity and i always spew such facts when i answer that i surprise myself. Great moments, those. 
3	I do this all the time haha 
2	I fantasize that I'm a famous musician and I'm getting interviewed. But it's not so much getting things off my chest, just me giving joke answers and subverting the interviewer or throwing in clues or references to my favorite books and movies for my fans to discover.
5	If any INFP here has had success battling alcohol and drug abuse, could I pick your brain maybe?	Any advice for depression, chronic unemployment, fantasy world inhabitation, lack of focus and motivation wouldn't be kicked out of bed. 
5	Not sure how much I can help but I would suggest having faith first.... when things are in context they make more sense generally.  Also a healthy routine... pray daily, eat right, excercise 3x a week at least, get some sunlight, stretch, get out when your feeling down.  Make a routine to get out of bed everyday by say 7am.  Set goals and work towards them.... then don’t overthink them but make steps towards them daily.  I also find doing something rational (chess) helps.   Also just stop the alcohol and addictive behaviors, they wreak havoc on your neurotransmitters and the rest of your life.       Replace them with something more constructive, easier said than done I know, but also no excuses....   Just start moving....when I’m depressive I’m an expert at making excuses....   praying for you mate.  If I can help any please let me know.
2	I was a raging drug addict from my teens to the age of 27, I've been totally sober and happy for over a year now and believe me when i say i fucking loved getting high. \n\nAs INFPs we have an intense passion for at least one thing in this world something we want to change or a cause we want to get behind, for me it is the welfare of animals, always had been deep down. \n\nGetting involved in animal rescue helped save me but it's not that simple, you have to ask yourself why are you using in the first place? \nFor myself, being a male and an INFP, a rather feminine personality type in my opinion, i used drugs to alter my personality, give me confidence, allow me to act more masculine.\n\nWhy are you using? What part of yourself are you ashamed or unhappy with?\n\nI abandoned myself for so many years and i now embrace myself, I'm sensitive, I'm introverted, I'm somewhat feminine but i wouldn't change any of these things now. \n\nIt is so much more satisfying to have people love you for who you really are and i now have an abundance of friends (and animals) and a partner who know and love the real me. \n\nJust over a year ago i never in a million years thought i could be sober AND happy but it's very possible. \n\nMessage me if you like and I'll do whatever i can to help you.\n

Writing is legit the only creative thing I do. \n\nJust took this neat version here tho: [https://www.123test.com/career-test/](https://www.123test.com/career-test/)\n\nScore:  CIASRE\n\nAccording to this test, my top three jobs are Mathematician (80%), Bioinformatics Scientist (78%), and Historian (77%).\n\nI'm average in math and absolutely terrible with science. My grad degree is in history though, so that one makes sense. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your scores? Jobs? :)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/qw562flxq0h21.png
3	ISRACE\n\n100% Immunologist\n\nI didn't even do biology in college.
2	AISRCE\n\nTop jobs were Desktop Publisher(85%) and a bunch tied for 84% such as Stop-Motion Animator, Digital Artist, Writer. I also got Anthropologist at 72% which is cool considering I'm changing my majors from Psych and Music Therapy to Psych and Anthropology. Regardless, it's pretty accurate because I've also been considering going back to community college to get a Graphic Design or a Photography degree(I already have an AA in Music) instead of finishing my BA. I'm honestly still hella confused lol. At least I know I'm going in a somewhat okay direction.
1	My husband (ESTP) took it and got RASECI. His top jobs deal with furniture making and being a Jeweller. Interesting. 
1	ISACRE apparently. Psychologist (91%), Immunologist (89%), Dietitian (85%).\n\nThe results could be worse, I guess.
1	ASIRCE
1	SAICER with 94% Recreational Therapist. Actually, doesn't sound too bad!
1	I got RAISCE with 77% Pharmacologist. I felt so conflicted choosing answers and I kept overthinking everything haha. Because of that, I don’t feel as if my results match me

281	Cute INFP struggles	
56	Economics and politics are mundane yet magical subjects; that tension clicks profoundly with my personality as an INFP
51	Really? if people are talking about something I don't know I usually feel intrigued and want to know more
14	I've been rated as an INFP and all of my conversations with literally everyone are about Marxism, feminism, and Existentialism.
7	Don't know much about economy. Just that I don't see it to carry on like this way for the next hundred years. Late capitalism is a downward spiral
5	Spot on!
5	This stuff is definitely right up intuitives alley, but the dogmatic partisan shit is a major turn off. I find that I can have a convo with only NTJs on political issues, because they are usually the only ones that can debate on merit and "see-through" political spin and actually talk pure N and T, and sometimes you see the Fi coming through. They also seem to be the only ones that have a "meta" approach, whereby they've investigated their own ideas and can connect them with political philosophy. So many people don't even understand what is fundamentally left or right.   \n\n\nLike... I don't really care about values when it comes to issues... I care about what works. It's pure N & T for me... you know, what could be done, what matters, what is pragmatic, what benefits people, whats cost effective, whats new and innovative etc. Like I am pretty open minded and like to research different approaches, and see what worked and what didn't in the past, rather than just having some strong left vs right ideas that is just so inane and backwards.
5	I love to argue about these subjects, unless everyone has an open mindset towards eacothers opinion. If not, im out before it even starts
12	Oi, I'm an INFP, but I'm a proud economist \n\n\#AustrianSchoolRules
3	This is literally me, so often. I get anxious and paranoid almost to the point of panic about things I have no knowledge of. Just abstract things like corruption of the government and smart people being motivated by greed to exploit others.
3	INFP.  I follow politics and the economy just enough to know what's going on.  Neither fulfill me in any way.  I've gone on media diets, where I stop listening.  I feel there is so much in our world that is anti-human being.  We don't have basic skills or knowledge any more.  
2	soooooooooo true. I just find the economy to be a really dry and boring topic.
2	yikes same. i really want to understand it but it just flies over my head and i have a hard time even memorizing the terminologies sometimes
2	Intps don't like politics and economics too
1	It's actually a very interesting topic if you understand it. We treat the economy as a living, breathing thing. 
1	Maybe this depends if you are a jumper or not. Half of INFPs have Ne savior so maybe they would be more interested in learning new information on economics than an INFP with Si savior who would have more fun talking about past experiences.
0	ENTP* I think you meant, I don’t know a single INTP that actively cares enough to keep up with such things unless it somehow directly impacted them on a daily basis
1	OOOOOOOOOOOOF BIG MOOD
1	INFP myself. Sorry, but I just can't like this meme... it is not accurate, it is stereotyping at least 3 personality groups, and it kinda indulge in the ignorance of such important topics, economy and politics. Looks like it was made by my teenager brother.

9	"Love is at the root of everything. Love, or the lack of it." -Fred Rogers\n\nThat quote helps keep me grounded in my worldview. Most people are in unbelievable circumstances that you couldn't even wrap your head around if you wanted to. In all reality, their situation probably controls them a lot more than they would think (although one shouldn't necessarily play the victim, either). Their decision making is rooted in years of trauma, learning, and development with just as much emotional depth as your own. \n\nIt's easy to forget that, however, when you're in a heated argument, treated unfairly, etc. In spite of this, the only way to move forward with anyone is to show kindness, respect, and empathy (especially when it's hard to do so).

16	I seriously have problems relating to this sub	Like I know I’m an INFP but sometimes this sub is just too sensitive and feels for me.
12	I feel like I’m about 10-15 years older than everyone here. I’ve developed some boundaries/callouses/hardness because I needed to. I think it skews young. Maybe you’re an old soul. :)
6	Perhaps that's because you're an ambivert. I am, and I get what you're saying. It's why I am in other relatable subs, even though I usually post here. 
2	sometimes communities like this are way too "cute animals and sunsets ahhh" for me. its kind of taking things most people enjoy and labelling it as infp thing...very inauthentic...

1	Yeah, same. I never seem, nor want to resonate with these posts.. 
-3	I'm glad you got this off your chest. Feel better? 
16	Just wrote down my feelings. You can skip.	Hi guys\n\nNow, I'm feeling really suffocated so I wrote this all down hoping it will ease my chest pain a bit.\n\nI don't know if all of you are like me, but these days, my logic and feelings are fighting inside my mind everyday. If I use logic, then everything my boyfriend did or do is right, and I can accept that. But my feelings can't accept that. I feel hurt and suffocated. And it's really hard fighting against myself.i know everything I wish or want is not logical, I know it but I can't accept that, my feelings can't accept that. I'm trying to improve myself by studying, but it doesn't progress much. I made a timetable but I can't stick to it. My mind is delusional, dreaming stuffs, and imagining things which I never do, like "I'm gonna wash these bags" and then i never did. Trying to realise that I'm in dreaming state and call myself back to reality every fucking time is really exhausted too.\n\nI wanted to tell my boyfriend everything what I'm feeling, but I don't think he can understand me, coz I can't even understand myself.\n\nHow do you guys face this kind of situation if this happened to you?\n\nI feel really suffocated now. Sometimes,i even think about suicide. I did well when I was young, now I'm just useless. I feel like I'm useless, want to disappear from this world.\n\nI want to say "help me" but I'm really good at pretending. My parents doesn't even know about my mind state and I plan to keep them in dark till i die. I rather die than my parents finding out about my mental state.\n\nMy feelings are so messed up right now.\n\nI want to improve myself but I'm getting nowhere. I want a better life for my family but then I realised that I'm dreaming too much and then the two states of my mind started fighting again.\n\nAlso, my boyfriend said that he wanted to own a house so that we could live together, so I thought he wanted to marry me. But, one time, we had a fight and asked him about that, and he said he just wanted to live together, not marrying me. I felt so ashamed of myself. I was dreaming by myself, living in imaginary world. I hate that but I can't do anything about that. I'm always in my own world, dreaming about stuffs.\n\nHe also said that why would he marry me when he isn't sure that we will work out. I thought about that and I understand that he was right. It was right thing to do if I think logically. But i feel hurt, ashamed that I was dreaming, hoping and thinking seriously when he's not doing it.\n\nMy mind is so messed up now.\n\nAm I at fault for being too serious?\n\nI can't help but think everything seriously. What should I do?
3	Hey I really don't think you should beat yourself up for dreaming or to be honest any of this. I know exactly what you mean about suffocating. I'm a singer and write my own songs. One song that's going to be on my album has lyrics about suffocating. That's how I feel when everything is on top of me and I feel like people don't understand me. Though I think I'm in a much better state of mind now to when I wrote that song a few months ago. I think what helped me was communicating better with the ones closest to me. I still have bad days and life is tough but it's tough for most people. I think me and my best friend are closer becuase I told her little bits of how I feel and i actually asked her to take the MBTI and turns out she's an ENFP. I think maybe she read a little about INFP'S becuase I just feel like she understands me so much more. My parents have always been pretty understanding and know who I am. I think there's just some things they get confused with and they can't quite get it sometimes when I talk about MBTI etc. But they know me and know everything's not so simple for me. To be honest life is still pretty tough at the moment. My career isn't going so great, I just met a girl I really like and I'm afraid I've scared her off becuase as INFP'S we can be way too intense. I'm just grateful I have my best friend to talk too. \n\nI don't want to give you the wrong advice. I just hope in the end you can take all the info you get from all of us on here and do what feels right in you're heart.\n\nMaybe you need to tell you're boyfriend how you feel? If it's really bothering you. Maybe you should get it off you're chest. I'd say go slow and maybe not say too much at once and overload him with to much information that could confuse him. I don't know you both and I don't know what you're boyfriend is like but it seems to me like he cares about you enough if he wants to get a house with you. Maybe the marriage conversation just scared him a little. I don't think it means necessarily that he doesn't want to be with you. Please remember also people say things in an argument or heat of the moment that they may not mean. He might want to marry you one day but I think that if he wants to live with you and get a house. It could be a good foundation to build on.\n\nI know what you mean about pretending. I'm really good at it too. I perform on stage and have gotten more used to socialising. Sometimes people would probably think I'm more of an ENFP. It's so exhausting and that's why my best friend is so important becuase I can talk to her about things and I don't have to bottle everything  up. \n\nAbout suicide please don't even think about it.\nI know it's not just as simple as that. I'm not someone who has really gone through that kind of feeling. My way of looking at it is I just wouldn't want to let everyone,everything and life itself beat me. You're better than that. I don't know you but I know if you're an INFP you're strong. Please don't give in! \n\nDon't be ashamed for any of these thoughts. They are all completely normal and I included I'm sure along with many many more on here can relate. Be proud of who you are. Maybe try and talk to you're parents you might find that they know more about you than you think. If not I'm sure they will be really glad you talked to them. They are you're parents and if they love you I'm sure they would want to hear the truth and i hope they would. That's what they should be there for to help you. \n\nSo my advice would be to try and clear some of you're feelings up with you're boyfriend and try and talk to you're parents. Let the ones closest to you into you're world. Just not too much at once. Please don't keep everything bottled up. I feel so much lighter not having to carry around so much in my head.\n\nWe are dreamers and I don't think it's something that we will ever be able to stop doing. I think we should actually be proud of it becuase we can see a bigger picture and we see and believe in things that others don't. \n\nLove to all my fellow INFP'S. I hope we all find our path and happiness ❤ x
2	It's normal. I'm also think like you also. There's no need to be worry. Just wrote about to express your feeling in your journal. 
2	There's nothing wrong with the way you think, your dreams, aspirations, etc.\n\nWanting better for your loved ones and yourself is a very honorable trait. You"d be surprised how many people don't think about those things at all.\n\nIt can be overwhelming. It's real easy to feel like a failure because YOU "didn't" or "couldn't" produce the Utopia built up in your imagination.\n\nYou can take solace in the fact, if you knew the answers, and knew the way, you would absolutely make it all happen! All this stems from that deep well of love you have in your heart for your people. That itself is an amazing thing which can never be adequately described to another human.\n\nAs far as that's concerned. Try to understand, that you can only do what's possible in this realm, on this planet, with the limitations imposed, or given at birth. All one really can do is the best they can with what they have. Absolutely strive to do better. At the same time, learn to be content with the outcomes.  There's really only so much you can do at a time and you never know what great things like ahead. Make the best of what you have and can do.\n\nOften times, others expectations of us is far lower than the expectations we have of ourselves. These things can only be learned in time.\n\nAssuming future relationship status is often tough and heart stressing. There is nothing wrong with you assuming you both would marry. It really seems to be the case when talking about buying a house and living together. Though, there really is no fault on this point. It's often times these little miscommunications and assumed expectations that cause problems in relationships.\n\nIt's a good idea to have a talk with each other and clearly state what each person's expectations/I tentions are for the future. Assuming has caused me a hell of a lot of heartache and years and years of wasted time,life, and potential.
1	it’s logical to listen to your emotions when it comes to relationships or emotional matters
1	You’re not at fault here. Also a thing that nobody here has mentioned or at least I don’t think so is that you’re not irrational to assume that he wants to marry you if he says he wants to buy a house for you. Why would you buy a house with a boyfriend? Buying a house is a manner of commitment and trust and marriage is another one. So you weren’t wrong to assume that. Also why would he say that he doesn’t believe you’ll last that long? 
11	Now I get it.	Guys, I haven't felt this sad and happy at the same time.\nI'm an INFP dude, almost 30 and I don't know anything about love. I've always struggled with opening up to girls and people in general and because of that, I've missed a lot even though people seem to like me. When I'm in a good rational mood I know I'm good looking and I have worth but you know how it is... Making this feeling permanent is tough. \n\nOver the years I've had quite a few occasions to be in love. I've always ran away or simply felt nothing. I really need to trust the other person to feel safe. I've been raised in an unhealthy emotional environnement, I've seen so many couples hurting each other, and I wasn't taught how to show emotions. I love my parents and they have great qualities but they're emotionally dumb. I have to learn everything on my own. Do any of you relate to that?\n\nI've been on a few dates. It never went far. Most of the time I felt like I was forcing it. \nSo for years I got very independant, stoic. I honestly thought my heart was kinda fossilized.\n\nLast week, I randomly met this girl online. The funny thing is that we know the same people, we have a lot in common. The date went well. It could have gone better of course but it felt nice. The important thing is that for the first time I really felt something strong. She's beautiful, intelligent and so kind. Kindness is such an attractive quality to me. We spent two hours together and I told her I wanted to see her again. I knew I was in deep shit instantly. I spent the next days miserable. Not knowing what she felt. I wasn't totally able to read her, there was some positive signs but you never know. I was a mess, like Woody Allen on coke.\nAfter 5 days and no news, I started to think she was ghosting me. Ghosting is a cruel thing, just say yes or no but say something. Still, I understand why some women do that, they can be fed up with guys overreacting to rejection. I know it happens a lot. But she was just busy and she finally answered. \n\nShe was not feeling it. \n\nI'm the only guy she met on OKCupid and she stopped using the app after our date. She says dating is too much work. She was nice enough to propose that we stay friends. I'm grateful for that although I don't know if that's a good idea. \n\nI'm doing all I can to fight the ideas that I wasn't manly enough, assertive enough or stuff like that... Dating is awful. For INFPs especially since I think that we show our true potential over time, I don't think we make great first impressions.\n\nI'm feeling a little better now. I know this is infatuation and that I'm idealising. It's an overreaction, people are just people. She wasn't the cure to my problems. I just want to feel safe and I know I have a lot of love to give. \nNow there's still this lingering melancholia... This feeling that I'm missing some essential thing that makes love work on both sides. It looks so easy for other people. I have no idea what makes it work. \n\nBut it finally happened. I guess I'm grateful for that. Learning is painful, and so slow... But we keep trying right? Such warriors!
6	I'm in much the same situation as you. I'm an INFP approaching my 30s but have long been too afraid of rejection to try dating. I can't offer much advice then, but I wanted to comment on a few things you said. \n\nFirst I know it hurts now, but you should be proud of the effort you made. Its more than I can ever say I did. In the long run its better to open yourself up and be rejected than it is to close off your feelings and end up dead inside. Second people can only make dating look easy. It isn't for anyone. Even the greatest relationships I know of required working through sacrifice, arguing, and heartache.\n\nFinally you can learn to be more mainly and assertive if that's what you want for yourself. But don't change yourself just to attract others. If you did that you would have been fake, and in the long run neither of you would be happy for it. I hope you feel better soon and don't give up hope. Best of luck in the future. 
3	You know what’s worse? Getting really deep into loving them with all that love you have, thinking “she’s the one I’m gonna spend my life with! Finally I’m happy after all these years!”, and THEN “she’s not feeling it” happening. That’s really something that fucks you up forever. So, always look at the bright side! That’s what I’m sayin
668	I feel a little like this brick	
62	Embrace it. Now that I'm in my 30s, I've found that so many people enjoy meeting someone who is authentically unique. Key word here being authentically. You can be that person for them. 
21	Current mood: this brick
8	I feel A LOT like that brick lol
7	\*cries\*
6	I’d feel like that more if the brick was broken.
3	You're not alone my friend. A picture which speaks a thousand words. 
3	The hole looks like a keyhole.  \n  \nBut the brick is not the key. 
3	I look at that photo like the brick is trying to escape the hole but the other bricks/stones are in the way, almost holding it down with their uniform shapes 
2	I don’t think it’s trying to fit in. I think it’s trying to fall down the hole. 
2	Hell yeah, down the hole.
2	~~I think I'm not exactly a brick surrounded by different type of bricks, but I appreciate and understand the analogy and symbolism you are applying here.~~\n\nI can relate. \n\n
1	Tho, I rank as an istp, I can relate
1	r/actlikeyoubelong
1	I relate to this sooo hard 😕
2	Something like a Haiku. Any opinions?	fear like air\nevery breath\nsmother without lungs\n\n
3	I like bad Haikus\n\nThey never have to make sense\n\nChocolate onions
7	Am i the only one who's having some difficulty maintaining a daily journal/diary?	
9	Dude, maintaining any type of routine for me and other INFPs I know is a struggle
7	You’re not alone, i go from writing in mine every day to a week or longer without writing anything. I think i‘d end up feeling like it’s more of a chore if i tried to keep up with it every day
1	I kept it up for a while in the beginning of this year, but found that the journaling wasn’t really doing much. I added in journaling prompts, and that helped. It probably also helped that I resolved to do my journal in a simple Word Doc this year, since I can type faster than I can write, and felt free to brain dump all over my word doc.
5	Is anyone childlike?	
2	I have a formal review next month for Aspergers. The signs all point there and have for the majority of my life. I am a single, 44 year old female with two wonderful teens. But I am very much faking adulthood (for them in some aspects). I feel like a child and am scared most of the time, I can’t read people very well and get hurt a lot. I approach life with innocence and am naive. This is the first time I’ve considered the childhood innocence and it resonates with me. \n\nEdit: if this is you, how do you battle the loneliness of faking adulthood? I literally have to be fake all day to get through my incredibly difficult job in advertising-and the higher ranks I rise to only make it more difficult. 
2	When I feel safe, absolutely 
1	Not everyone is like this or wants to identify like this, but some do.\n\nIn the post it says "I don't know why, but this thread helped me resolve a lot of my issues". That person could have thought "I am a child" by themselves. But they didn't. They only benefited when it was suggested to them. This strikes me as similar to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXfQuXUQ8X8&t=87) at 1:27 and 4:45, where an unrecognised transgender child needed 14 medications, 17 doses per day for psychological issues. After transitioning all the problems went away.

1	Yellow when I'm in a happy or energetic mood, green when I'm more subdued. \n\nI like orange red and pink too.
1	Yellow
1	Blue 
1	Depends on my mood but I love blueish green and red. Also I love yellow, it’s the color of my bedroom. 
1	Red
1	Black.

54	It's so sad to see so many INFPs are going through my same struggles	When I found this sub I was expecting more light-hearted stuff. You know, things like jokes about our quirks, random facts about INFPS etc. It's almost painful to see that so many posts are about people struggling with the same issues I've had to deal with my whole life. And holy shit, nearly everything I read here is so relatable to me it's almost scary.\n\nI can't help but wonder if being INFP automatically raises additional barriers to our happiness compared to other people.\n\n It makes me wish it was easier for us to find each other, it would be nice to have someone in my life who is on the same length-wave as me.
18	In a way, I think that's part of why I've tried to be active here.\n\nI'm by no means all-seeing and all-knowing, but I've dealt with most of the struggles of being an INFP in youth. The feeling of disconnect from other people, wanting to share deep interests and finding others don't care as much, feeling like an outsider/alien on your own planet. At my most depressed, I fell into some of the more dark INFP stereotypes like drug/alcohol abuse and suicidal ideation.\n\nMy life isn't perfect, but I'm still alive. I honestly can't believe I'm still alive sometimes. I made it through times I didn't think I could possibly go on and I've managed to find my happiness in the face of some of those dark emotions. If I could pass that on here, even to one person who feels alone and depressed, it would all be worth it.
7	I get happy from my connections with people. I think it is sad a lot of the time. Like society is a constant overcast day, but sometimes I talk to someone and see a level of trust appear and it's like a break of sunlight. That even in this age of information and detachment, people can find humanity and connect with each other, if only briefly. 
7	I think you caught r/infp in the middle of valentines day/season and winter. Lots of sad vibes. heh..\n\nIt's eerie though, right? I mean we're far from being a monolithic/hive mind, but we can relate to a lot of things. But there are some unique experiences and feelings in there too.\n\nI also wish it was easier for us to find and meet each other.
4	I'm not INFP, yet I do relate to a lot here. This is the most comfortable subreddit I've been to.\n\nJust what seems to be the case for me. These are the things which are hard to express to others. Like, there's a different expectation and things which were allowed as a social norm.
2	It's sad, but I also find it comforting. We all go through shit, we have our own insecurities and troubles, but it's nice to read some of them and know that I am not alone. It reminds me of this [video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14)
1	I find that it’s comforting to know that we’re not alone in what we are going through and feeling.  It makes me feel a bit less sad actually. Or like a happy sad lol 
1	Don't hate me for this, but I do believe that we INFPs have this need to be sad. Like, even when everything is fine, I always feel some sort of melancholy, and to be quite honest, I'm addicted to the feeling. And I'm sure all of us are sort of attracted to sad things. 
16	Was feeling bad about something in me yesterday night, so I drew this digital painting using my iPad (it’s my first drawing ever). What do you see?	
10	It’s a giant tornado arm with paws. 
5	It's a tornado that decided to be friendly instead of destructive. Howdy doodly neighbor!
5	At first I saw a fish, then I saw an arm coming out of a triangle/tornado. I like the blues and greens
5	My first thought was an angel underwater. Maybe it’s an expression of some part of you that may need to reach the surface. 
4	A person disintegrating/morphing/getting sucked into a tornado during a pleasant day in a trance-like state.\n\nHope you’re feeling better, OP. \n\n
3	It’s a lady in a dress falling in water on a sunny day
2	It looks like something out of Moana. An arm reaching up from the ocean to lift you back up to face your destiny. 
2	Baby arm tornado!
1	A tornado
1	Plastic waste in the oceans :(
1	I see a hand on something big, like a giant or something.
8	Any INFP in a serious relationship? Who do you think compliments “our” personality well?	I’ve been in a two and a half year relationship with a INTJ/ENTJ. We’re complete opposites. He’s very logical and thinks in numbers, meanwhile I think in feelings and sometimes it’s hard to communicate. I’m a Pisces and he’s a Virgo which are also complete opposites but can be a good match. Overall it’s a happy relationship.\n\nI’ve been browsing this thread and I’ve seen so many sad and lonely posts. I want to talk about INFPs in relationships. \n
8	All depends on what kind of INFP you are. There is defnitely a trend, for example ESTPxINFP is a pretty rare combo and rarely a satisfying one. Personally, I feel like I'm made for ENFPs. Not the full extraverted, overhyped Ne ones (Though I feel most comfortable being around those as friends) but rather the more ambiverted, cuter and chill (at least most of the time) ones.\n\nI've often read about well working INFPxINFJ, INFPxESTJ, INFPxINTJ, INFPxENTJ, also sometimes INFPxENFJ.
4	23f INFP and 23M ISTJ married for almost 2 years now. I believe we compliment each other very well. I keep his sense of wonder going and he keeps me grounded when I become too wild. ISTJ's can be practical, which I think can be great for us. I also help my husband in the emotions sector, he can be a little stoic, but he says with me he's felt more than he ever has in his life. We still have the normal issues and problems, but I think we are exceptionally happy together and have built a love that will last eternity. 
2	Me: INFP Male. Wife: INTP Female.  We are both rare types quite similar to you and your SO.  We like to learn about our mbti differences and bask in the realization that we xan help each other level out our "lacking" skills in everyday life.  Meaning, If i get to negativley emotive she lines up any and all possible factial reasons I have gotten that way, that helps me get control over my emotions instead of them ruling me.\n  One the other hand she has gone through one major emotional and physically changing event after another:  Narc parents rejection, spine damaging car accident, so iopath boss' negligence, migraine fallout from the first accident, a SECOND car accident, wedding planning, giving away her dog because of the first accident having hurt her to much, rapid weight gain, living in shit apartments with poor management, and now learning her best friend is too toxic to contuinue their friendship.  \n    This is all in the last 3yrs of our lives.  And we have kmown each other for that long.  All of those events gave her a lot of confidence in my emotional intelligence to get through the darkness.  INTPs are known to spiral emotionally and she always tells me and others she could not have ever done it without me.  We now have a house in a nice quiet neighborhood, two medium dogs and two cats.\n   I am sayimg all this not to brag but to boast that I am a big fan now and glad you have someone so opposite lol.  I can only speak from personal experience but I recommend looking at the ironies in your relationship if you havemt already.  Where things go dark INFP can turn on the light (we dwell in dark, the damn dwarves we are) good luck to you\n\nAlso side note:  the wife andbnb I enjoy videos on youtube by a group called "the school of life"  they discuss many differences btween behavior types, philosophies, and interpersonal and romantic relationships.  Its excellent and really helped us "decode"  each others actions during harder moments like arguments and such.  And learn where we can shine in the relationship.  Sorry for over sharing and good luck with your SO!
2	The most perfect man for me is an INFJ. We are alike in all of the ways that matter, and our differences compliment each other. Also, he is silly, smart, confident, with a strong sense of integrity. Love him.
2	[deleted]
2	ENFP has always worked best for me. Very similar to us but more extroverted so brings some excitement. Also I’ve noticed they always notice if I am feeling down/sad/anxious and ask about it so I don’t have to actually divulge much until they press me about it which I honestly need sometimes
1	INFP married to ESTP (married 4 years and counting). We both super love movies, food, and generally being near each other. I have high anxiety whereas he's very sturdy mentally.    He's like a great haven for me whereas I'm a source of comfort for him.  We're both wicked funny in our own way and play off each other like crazy. I love that about us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nINTJ & INFP Coffee (YouTube channel) has done a few relationship videos and one mentioned that SP types seem to be pretty chill with their partner "being themselves" (which is awesome for any Fi dom, tbh) whereas an FP type will accept you as you are. 100% true in my experience. Both types seem pretty dang chill. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I ask my husband what he DOESN'T want in a partner and/or what ended his past relationships, he says he can't stand people who are "stuck up" and/or people who expect everyone to do their bidding or for others to change for them. That would bother me as well. He also mentions how much he hates "fake af" people all the time and I am 100% in agreeance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nApparently ESTP-INFP is pretty common, actually. Just depends on who you ask. ESTPs are often ambiverted based on their functions, so unlike an extremely extroverted person, they're often chill staying at home or going out. Just depends!
1	I am female infp dating male entp. i feel like we have this deep understanding that we don’t have to talk about. we just connect, share beliefs. i love that he is also really into learning, that he teaches me about things i know i feel already (politics and history for example). however i know we struggle with our introversion and extroversion. i used to be able to bro out with his friends and i loved that i could share his friends since i struggle at making friends on my own. however, when drama would come up with his friends, he would rather ignore it and forgive them even though it was hurting me and causing issues. i think he just needs to be liked by everyone but when someone causes drama, without apology and with obvious intent to hurt me, i cut them off!! it’s something we’re navigating still... and communication isn’t great. i am an extremely good communicator within a relationship, and he’s not.
1	What would your spirit animal be?	I have just read the "his dark materials" trilogy and now I can't stop thinking about the ide of spirit animals and what mine would be, it would probably be a bird maybe a sparrow or something similar
3	Cat, fox or raven. 
2	Dolphin
2	Golden Retriever
2	A hedgehog 🦔
2	Short-sighted owl. 
2	My dad told me to be more like a lion when I was little. Courageous, confident, and always lead by example. It really stook with me. But most realistically, I'm a sloth 😂lol
31	Is anyone else an expert at being weird and really bad at being normal?	Because I am.
6	I’m an expert at being a weirdo, but I’m pretty good at being normal if it’s really necessary for the situation.
3	me....  v.v/
3	weird > npc robot\n\nany day of the week.
3	Meh, weird is relative to the individual, like I find it weird some people don't brush their teeth while they shower, but apparently that's not "normal". But to answer you question relative to society, yeah, yeah I am, and I wouldn't change a thing about it
2	Absolutely.\n\n&#x200B;
2	I thought I passed for normal but I think the people around me have just accepted who I am 
2	Eh, not such a cool thing when you're trying to make new friends though. 
2	Weird yes, I have just developed a really convincing “normal’ mask when dealing with the humans.
2	Yes. But whatever I love it, even if I leave two minute awkward messages and cry over inscription in my kid’s copy of Goodnight Moon. Weird>normal.
2	He'll yes I am so much just way way motorcycles better. Any other ones like to yuck up they're gramma and word spelling when talking just so it sound more fun?
2	Ay
1	Has Anyone Taken the Personality Hacker "Genius" Quiz?	I scored INTJ on that. As did my supposedly INFJ friend. Y'all?\n\n[https://personalityhacker.com/genius-personality-test/](https://personalityhacker.com/genius-personality-test/)\n\nIt was strange given most of my answers seemed to be more Feeler-based...she said something similar. 
1	I just took it and got INFP
1	Also took and got INFP!
1	I got INFP yayyy
27	found r/infp for the first time today!	It gives me some sort of relief to know that there are others that feel this way!! Although this isn’t an excuse for all the relationships i’ve left to die i find comfort reading from all of u 💕💕💕
3	Welcome home friend! :)
1	hi im glad you found us
1	Welcome home! It's nice to know you're not alone in your weirdness, right??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember that your "infp"-ness is not a prison, it is a home you tend to return to. But it's also a home you are in charge of, and you can make yourself a beautiful, comfortable and functional home if you put in the time and effort, and ask help. And when life demands it, it's a place you can leave for a while and venture out of.
1	hullo\n\nyoure not alone...
1	New'ish here too, it's so great. Welcome! Did you recently discover the MBTI too and your INFP type also?
27	Anyone ever see the movie, "Her"? Its seriously so underrated! I don't know why nobody seems to be talking about it. Its literally a masterpiece!	
6	I love that movie! 
2	I've seen it once and decided to never watch it again. Loved the show but I think the more I watch that, the more I would like to have an AI inside my ear, having meaningful conversations and a great time.
2	Whenever I see a guy with his phone in his breast pocket I think of _Her_. 
1	A beautiful piece of film. Spike jonze and Joaquin Phoenix are such a great duo together. 
1	Great movie!
4	Friends and Connections	I'm not sure if this is an infp thing or more of a personal thing, but I often think about how people view others and friendships. I don't have many people I consider friends but rather acquaintances. And even of my friends sometimes it feels difficult finding a deep connection to them. The other day I was thinking about friends I had many years ago (who I had lost touch with) and was wondering whether people could still be friends if neither party makes any effort to connect.\n\nI was thinking about how lots of  people (including me for a while) had followers on social media who they knew of but didn't contact outside of social media. To some degree, I kept thinking about how others considered people they didn't contact as friends. What are all of your opinions on the subject?\n\nPersonally I only ever considered someone a friend if the two of us remained in contact which I felt was meaningful. I guess I viewed everyone else as acquaintances on the basis that we didn't have any connection to stay into each other's lives. Thoughts?
2	Probably more of a personal thing. Some years back I thought quite like you, that friends had to remain in constant contact and share a "deep bond", eg sharing lots of personal details or feelings.\n\n>And even of my friends sometimes it feels difficult finding a deep connection to them. \n\nBut exactly how deep of a connection do we need in order for people to be deemed as a friend? How do we know what is deep enough? What if someone made the effort to share something with us which in the process, caused them trouble (for example, by describing an experience and their thoughts on it), and we looked past that, because we underestimated how much effort it took for that person to share it with us, and thought that it wasn't meaningful?\n\nRather than prioritising "deep" connections, personally I now try to focus on the effort that both parties are willing to put into maintaining the friendship. After all, maintaining relations between people is really like growing a plant. It needs care and thought.\n\n>was wondering whether people could still be friends if neither party makes any effort to connect \n\nAfter all that, I do sometimes wonder the same thing. It's probably natural to do so. I guess this depends on the situation - are one or both parties truly not making the effort to connect? Or are one (or both) parties too occupied/busy with life (out of necessity)? Are they in a position to connect/converse with others? Something like social anxiety would hinder that.\n\nBut if neither party wants to connect anymore I guess there is no more friendship between them. Perhaps not permanently though. My thoughts are that the friendship might still form again if they start putting in effort to maintain it.
2	I feel like I need consistency in my friendships!\n\nTo me, people who just check in to be my “friend” when it’s convenient to them is fake! \nI had a friend who always talked badly about a friend of hers that she had known longer than me. She would tell me she just used her when she was bored or needed something from her. Said it looked good on social media, would use her to make other connections, knew this girl was the type to give christmas presents... etc. it was so fake to me! i disliked it a lot but our friendship seemed genuine, we hung out all the time. for a few months... i noticed she started treating me like that other friend and i told her i wouldn’t continue a fake friendship like that. \n\nI like to keep my circle small. I don’t like to call upon random people when I haven’t seen them in months. It just seems fake to me. I wonder if I’d be less lonely, but I think the disconnect would feel obvious and I would feel lonely with people, which is uncomfortable. And that’s how my ex-friend said she felt, she was ENFP. she said she would get lonely or bored and call upon her fake friends and be reminded why she doesn’t hang with them until a month or two passes and the cycle repeats 
3	infp and being a promoter in retail	So I'm an infp and I ended up as a toy promoter at a toys r us (they still exist in my country) as a temp job. I'm 16 and it's actually my first job.\n\n I spent quite a while being anxious about all the human contact, but I turns out that I actually like the job! \n\nI don't mean to sound conceited, because I understand a lot of us have social anxiety and such a job would be an awful idea, but even though I stuttered quite a lot on my first few days, I ended up being able to function properly. \n\nMaybe it's something about making children happy by demonstrating the toy, or just striving to make people happy in what little way that I can by running a little booth, but I ended up not despising the job :D\n\nSo I realised my social battery only truly starts running low when talking for long periods with friends or acquaintances,  but not with a long string of strangers buying toys. Huh. 
2	[deleted]
2	For me, it wouldn't necessarily be a problem about some kind of anxiety but rather the promoting itself. My outward impression is very cold and rather closed off and not inviting. Voice very dry, unmotivating and monotone without much change in pitch, literally no one would by a product from me.\n\nI admire people who are able to have such "moving" personas because I definitely don't.
2	That is cool! My first job was at an amusement park, and I liked it too. There was something special about making people happy. Keep up the good work. You learn a lot about yourself from your career.
29	Does anyone else feel extremely down, sad and guilty after an argument?	Even if I was in the right. Even if it was with a stranger fighting always makes me feel bad after it’s gone. Does anyone else feel like this?
8	[deleted]
7	You crushed another soul over something ephemeral. Hugs sibling. 
3	Absolutely\n\n&#x200B;
3	Having an argument with my bf right now. I said something that was slightly hurtful. And now I feel extremely down and guilty. Like he’s better off without me and we might as well just break up because I’m not perfect and I can’t ever be perfect. I know no one is but it doesn’t stop me from trying to be perfect, so every time there’s conflict that breaks that illusion of perfection, my spirit is crushed. 
2	Yes, absolutely. For me, arguing is SO draining. I over think everything that happened. I strongly dislike conflict and dealing with it. I’m scared to hurt the other person and I’m scared of what they’re thinking during/after. The argument stays on loop in my mind for hours, and sometimes days after. What could gone differently? What should I have included? What should I have left out? It definitely makes me upset no matter what the result is and it’s one of those (many many) times where I can’t figure out how to turn my brain off after. 
2	Something. Not if I was right, then I’m just annoyed 
2	When I'm involved in an argument, even if the "argument" consists of speaking up for myself, I notice a huge adrenaline rush. My heart pounds. My face flushes. I could lift a bus off someone or knock them into oblivion, depending on the situation. The effects can last for a couple of hours afterward. \n\nIs it possible that the feelings of depression you mention are simply the result of depleting your stress hormones during an argument? We INFPs really don't like confrontation. If we've been traumatized in the past, we like confrontation even less.\n\nLike other INFPs, I continue to have arguments in my head for days/weeks/months/years afterward, just to see if I should have said something differently (l'esprit d'escalier, for sure!). It's like I want to go over things so many times that I'll produce the best possible comeback during my next episode of verbal sparring. It hasn't worked thus far, but I remain hopeful.
2	Yes. Just had an arguement with a close friend of mine after she had hurt me numerous times. Even though I was right, I kinda feel sadder than what I've felt before I had the arguement with her.
1	Yes.
9	I thought I was the only one who wrote poems to deal with my thoughts. Wrote this one while I was taking a prayer walk.	Within the gravel, trees and stars, I catch a glimpse of all that you are \nThe creator of every nation is the author of my salvation \nSo everyday I pray that someday you’ll pave the way \nEven when there’s no light in sight, somehow you give me the will to fight \n\nWhatever it is you sent me to do\nSend it hastily so I may come home to you \nI don’t understand why you need me to stay \nWhen I could just drop dead today \nThis world is just so fucked up\nAnd I’m just a pup \n\nYou say you need me \nBut for what reason, I can’t see\nWhen I think of how far we’ve fallen I can hardly choke out a sentence \nWhen all I want is to spend eternity in your presence \n\nI’ve just had enough of being alive \nBy your side I finally want to arrive\n
2	keep at it!
8	Always in my head	I’ve always done this thing where I’ll make up the perfect girl in my head then apply that mental girl to someone I know. I always disappoint myself when I realize that she’s not the girl in my head. \nBecause of this I’ve recently been trying to see people for who they are, rather than who I want them to be. I’ve been talking to a really sweet girl recently who seems to care for me a lot but I can’t tell if she just wants to be friends or if I should make a move. \nShe’s beautiful and really cool but I’ve found myself starting to do the whole “hypothetical girl” thing to her and I don’t want to fall into that trap again.\nThe question I have is should I just appreciate her as a cool friend or should I nut up and tell her that I have feelings for her? (We both go to college together but she’s a senior and I’m a sophomore) 
3	A funny thing: Some ENFPs have this problem of naturally emitting vibes of caring, authenticity and depth to everyone around them. It's kinda funny that they struggle with coming off as super flirty or super compatible. But if anyone's prone to be receptive of that kind of energy, it's an INFP. If that's her, and that's you, it'll be funny.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, don't get caught up in what-ifs. Use your self-awareness and tact. Ask her out.\n\nJust remember. You have immense talents in imagination and ideals. But in knowing people, be concrete. Don't assume random things. That tends to sour relationships, or scare you into inaction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbtw, check back with us if you did it! We're rooting for you.
839	Me_IRL	
121	Ouch this hit a LITTLE to close to home
100	If someone is being really nice to me and I find them attractive I basically fall in love with them. If someone is hitting on me and I find them attractive I convince myself they're just being nice. Either way I do nothing and the cycle continues until the end of time.
81	Happened to me today... we now have two children, live somewhere sunny and have a huge yard in surrounding our medium sized house.
41	Oh wow, I'm relieved this isn't just me. I have a crush on literally every moderately attractive girl that is nice to me, and I feel like it's kind of a problem.
26	This is hilarious because it's definitely something I think about but don't ever admit. Then I worry about being too attached etc.
27	this image just ripped out my spinal cord and threw me into a wall
30	My mission as an INFP: To be friends first and foremost before being lovers with my next partner.\n\nThis IS possible being an INFP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nright? \n
9	This was me, now everyone I meet I go - this person prolly ain't the love of my life
11	This is such a pain in the ass.\n\nCan't bloody help it, then have to keep telling myself, no, its not like that!\nbut a wee feeling at the back of my head wont believe me.\nthen we stop talking after a few days and im sad.\n\ndamn.
9	Then sometime into the conversation they name drop their boyfriend or husband.
9	We are all Joel from Eternal Sunshine. 
6	I wish this didn't hit so close to home, lol
6	Happened to me in class today, turns out theybhave someone already XD. 
5	Oof
4	Yesssss
4	Too real.
5	2meirl4meirl
5	STOPPPP
4	I was recently surprised i wasnt in love with one girl who was very nice to me and even went in our talks towards the relationship. Even more surprising that we really clicked,or so I thought.\n\nThen she told me she is not ready for a relationship and from that lovely vulnerable person that writes me all day she basically behaved like I am bothering her and im super annoying by just saying hi and wanting to talk, like a friend.\n\nINFPs are alright. Other people can be weirdos tho. ^^
3	Yeah this is me...
3	Lol so true
2	True.
2	We are all Joel from Eternal Sunshine. 
1	😂😂😂 for reals
1	I feel this too much
1	Omfg I-
1	stop shamelessly calling me out like that ._.
1	Ugh, this is me. Friend crushes are real. Somehow I managed to have realistic expectations of people back when I was dating. But making friends? I have no brakes.
1	Oh my God MEEEEE 🤣
1	This happened to me today xD
1	Oof. Ouch that's my heart\n\nA bit unrelated. Recently, I've been trying to befriend this person. So like i really tried to be nice and forward despite my social anxiety (all of the interactions were online). But I only get short, polite one-liners. I knoe i should just move on but it stings, you know?
1	And this is why you think friendzoned is a thing. 
1	I like to say "be nice to me at your own risk."
1	When the barista is really nice to you
1	lmao bianca wherever u are haha
1	🐤
1	It’s a soulmate <3
-5	Shut the fuck up with this self-deprecation shit. 
48	Infp and sarcasm	Any infps out there who are also sarcastic af?
30	I learned my sarcastic dry wit from my mother. As a result, no one can tell when I'm joking. 
25	No one can tell when im joking. And i just find it funny when they cant tell and i keep going and going until they think im crazy. So many people out there think i believe the earth is flat.
13	Me? Sarcastic? \n\n*Never*.
13	Canadian and hung out with a big group of people and we were talking about pets, and someone made a joke like who has a pet beaver and I deadpanned Yeah I have 2! And half the group believed me smh you gotta ease new people into it LOL.\n\nAnd no having beaver pets in Canada is not normal. No one has beaver pets.
11	I've spent years perfecting a deadpan delivery.
3	Me! 
3	i think i learned a lot of my sarcasm from the 90s Spider-Man cartoon.  my favourite bit while he was fighting a bad guy named Tombstone:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\[Spider-Man\] ::dodges attacks by bouncing off walls and ceiling::\n\n\[Tombstone\] come down here!  AND FIGHT LIKE A MAN!\n\n\[Spider-Man\] i don't suppose i could convince you to come up here... and fight like a spider?\n\n&#x200B;
3	Depends on the crowd.
2	I’m not sarcastic often, but when I am, it means someone has seriously angered me.
2	Me 100%
2	I am rarely sarcastic. Maybe once or twice a year I will be sarcastic. It is just not in my nature. I also am not a fan of sarcasm. I wish people just said how they really felt. That is just me though. I know people like being sarcastic, but personally I would prefer if people could just speak honestly.
17	I feel very awkward in social situations sometimes, and other times I’m really confident in my social abilities.	I feel like the awkwardness is really just in my head, and even if I do come off awkward I’ve been told my awkwardness is “charming”. I started a new job last month and these people are nothing like me but I feel like I can adapt to fit in with any crowd. Does anyone relate? \n\nIt takes me a little while to adapt but once I do people seem to take to me\n\nI hope this doesn’t sound super conceited lol. I really do feel like an outcast a lot of the time but people’s actions and the way they act toward me makes me think otherwise

2	I wish my awkwardness was charming\n\ninstead it makes people uncomfortable 
1	It used to be the same for me and I didn't know why I would get up and down like this, turn out i'm very sensitive to lack of sleep and hunger, both make me anxious therefore awkward. Idk if it can help you but it would have helped me and saved me a lot of time so maybe try to notice if it's the same for you 
3	Song suggestions? Something that makes me feel transcendent.	
3	banes world, michael seyer, pond, unknown mortal orchestra, khruangbin\n\n&#x200B;\n\ngaze at the stars & enjoy
4	Africa by Toto

10	This music video gives me some very INFP vibes. Most of Grizzly Bear's music does, but the music video for Ready, Able in particular	
2	Love this song and video. Listened the other day.   
2	Really like this, it's the first time I've actually like any music/video suggestion on here 😉
5	An interesting and unusual person	If you have seen my last post I’m talking about the same girl here. \nI’m sure you guys know how I feel when I say that I don’t like talking about my thoughts and feelings, the only person I talk to about those things are my brother. But a few days ago after a session of DnD I found myself alone with a really cool friend of mine while we were studying for a Greek test. I don’t remember exactly how it happened but I just found myself opening up to her a lot, with the things I’ve only told my brother about. And she did the same for me.\nI have never felt so welcomed to open up to someone like that before and it was honestly really nice. \nI was wondering if any of you have ever just found someone that is easy to open up to like that before. She is the first person I’ve ever met that has made me feel that way and I’ve been thinking about it a lot since it happened.
3	That's awesome. It is always a breath of fresh air to share your authentic self with someone and receive the same. You're taking Greek? Guessing by your username, are you studying at a Christian college?
13	A poem I wrote!	I love\nWith my whole heart \nI feel \nWith every inch of my being \nPouring my soul into bottles and handing it out like free samples\n\nalone \nCraving the affection I so readily give \nSurrounded by the gleeful masks of my peers\nFilling me with empty praise \nClaiming to care \n\nBut I know \nIf I were to spill the colors of my soul \nAnd paint the pictures in my mind\nIf I were to rip my beating heart from my chest \nAnd hand them me, in my entirety \nThey would run\n\nPomegranate red \nFor the heat that fills my cheeks when I pronounce a word wrong \nMidnight blue \nFor the deep sadness that resides in the darkest corners of my heart \nSunflower yellow \nFor when your laugh so hard your stomach cramps and you have to remind yourself to \nBreathe \n\nI have to remind myself to breathe \nThe world is spinning 1000 miles a minute \nAnd I’m running \nFighting my way to catch up\nDesperate not to be left behind \nCollecting souvenirs along the way \nonly stopping to take pictures \n\nstop \nAppreciate this moment for what is worth \nA garden of flowers grows in my veins \nThat I can’t seem to remember to water \nI live in the clouds\nTrapped between reality and a dream\nPushing \nWanting \nNeeding\nto set my feet back on the ground \n
3	I’ve always enjoyed writing and reading poetry. That was beautiful my friend 
1	Any title suggestions???
16	Valentine's day really fucked me up this year. Tremendously sad.	I don't know where to start, and I don't want this to be a pity party or anything but ... I'm just so goddamn sick of this.  I'm sick of it being shoved down our throats, and having to deal with being alone on that day.  \n\n\nThere's no reason I'm not, or wouldn't be, good enough for a woman.  But I knew this would be hard, I knew what I was signing up for.  I knew that if I did college later in life, after serving in the military, that I'd be a 25+ year old undergrad... Approaching 30... And I've hardly accomplished anything at all.  Most people my age already have careers and *children* by now.  I feel like I've been left behind.  I feel like a failure.  I *am* a failure.  \n\n\nBut I have good qualities.  I'm tall... And nurturing, and caring, and quiet and I listen and I'm really, really passionate... If I'm with the right woman.  But every single time I've been able to open up, I end up scaring them away.  They learn I'm fucked up, and I've got some weird opinions about the world, and I'm not gonna apologize for that.  \n\n\nEvery potential girl I meet here is incompatible for the basic major reason that they're just not in the same stage of life as me... And if they are, then they're looking for a guy who can provide, and that's not me, not yet, because I'm still a student, just like them.  It's a catch 22. \n\n\nSo it feels like I don't deserve it.  I don't deserve happiness.  Like... Somehow I've spited the universe and I'm cursed and no matter what I do my efforts won't ever pan out.  I'll continuously get rejected over and over, growing older... Growing more and more bitter with life.  \n\n\nThere's a post over on r/wow right now about a guy who's Valentine's present from his gf was a frame portrait of their wow characters doing a selfie.  That's awesome.  That's the kind of thing that lets you know its real.  That's what I want, damnit, and why couldn't that be me?  I want to be able to be close enough to someone so that I can actually open up to them and share with them my passions and hobbies, like that.  And them to me.  \n\n\nWhen you've been alone this long, you really start to believe there's something fundamentally wrong with you.  And there very well might be.  But I don't know what it is.
5	I’ve been to hell and back so many times in my life, I’m 29 years old and can’t tell you how many times I thought there was no coming back for me, in every way. I’ve felt the deepest of depression, the worst of hopelessness and self hatred, etc etc. all you have to do is do what makes you happy. That’s it. Do what makes you happy and what you need to do to survive as a human in this world. The rest will come, you’re overthinking it (as I do with everything as well). Just be you, be happy and do your best to do better every day whatever that might mean. I’m single also, with no kids and no plans to change that and I’m happy! You can be too : )
3	>Most people my age already have careers and children by now. I feel like I've been left behind. I feel like a failure. I am a failure.\n\nBro I relate to this so much and I’m about to hit 30. You should be happy you’re around people you can date. I’m out of college and the only women I meet are at work who are already married and with kids. You should be able to find someone in college you can relate to even if they are a bit younger. Don’t worry bro you’re not a failure, you still have a chance unlike me. Just do you, live an awesome life, and some lucky girl will see that and would want to be part of your awesome life.
3	> I feel like I've been left behind. I feel like a failure. I *am* a failure. \n\nYou are not. You are tricking yourself. Do you know how many people there are (myself included) that thought that by the age of 30 we'd have a house/flat, a partner and a good job? Then life happens, it's a good dream but don't compare yourself to those few that have it or beat yourself that you don't. \n\nYou've been in the military and you're older, you at least have some rough idea what you want out of this life. You're taking steps. You've recognized that there is something is bothering you. That's commendable. \n\nLetting go of things isn't easy, I'm not saying you're not going to meet someone, just that the more focus and work you invest the more bitter you'll become if you don't reach that goal. Do the next thing possible that you can think of and try to enjoy what's been given to you, even if it all seems like a joke.
2	Hey man sorry to hear you feel so down. Although I feel for you as I too have felt the same way, you must realize that this whole “you’re too old” thing feeling in your head is completely not true. Sooo many people go to do such wonderful things at 30. Ex: Peter Thiel help found PayPal at 31 sometime after he realized he did not enjoy law. You’ll find a girl man, you just need to try to be more of an extrovert. Put yourself in uncomfortable positions and situations, learn to grow from it. Much love to you my man. 
2	As someone who followed your basic trajectory - military, then college, and who also felt my 20's flying by with no way to put the brakes on, I have been in your shoes. Probably more so than others as a fellow INFP. But as a 47 year old now, who did get married and started a family at 28, I can tell you in retrospect, the notion of the 20's or 30's as being 'late' in terms of marriage is completely a mental construct and, well, a bit laughable. And I don't mean to minimize how you feel one bit. I've been there. The feelings of inadequacy, etc. I would just suggest being patient, there are actually benefits to waiting. I wish I might have waited a few years to be honest. But just hear me now and believe me later, you have loads and loads of time. You should not be fretting over this, whatsoever. I understand you, believe me, but I would take a deep breath, pour a nice beer and exhale. You're good mate. 
2	I’m 45 and still single.  You have time bro.  It’s hard to find someone.  Focue on your own happiness first.  And one lesson I’ve learned is to not fall in love too quick.  That scares women.  Don’t let your heart get involved too quickly.  Keep in light for awhilw until you get to know them.  That’s my new way of doing things after falling in love too quick and screwing it up over and over again.  Painful lessons are good as long as we learn from them.\n\nGood luck.
2	You sound intelligent hardworking passionate - all good things.  Failure is a state of mind. Hope and openness is a state of mind. You’re bummed, I get that, triggered by V day. Keep on working toward your goals/dreams, keep on living your life, and you will find that person w whom you want to share your life. It’s almost impossible for me to believe this won’t happen for you. \n\nPs I don’t know where you’re from, regionally, but late 20s is not too old! 
15	The sky makes me happy every time... I filmed this like a month ago, but I decided to share it here. Hope you like it!	
2	Wow I love this! Its like the dark taking over or something, but beautifully so 🌄
101	Treat for your eyes, fellow dreamers!	
2	Gorgeous
2	Wow.
26	How much time do you send listening to music on a daily?	I ran into this survey on 16personalities.com that us, infp, spend the most time listening to music compared to any other personality type. This came to a surprise to me! This made me realize how much music I listen to. There’s not a day that goes by without me listening to music. I spent about 3/4 hours average, excluding the days I can go from morning to night non-stop in my little world jamming. \n\nhttps://www.16personalities.com/articles/music-preferences-by-personality-type
4	If I’m not working on something that requires my full attention like homework, always always always. \n\nWhen I’m cooking, showering, driving to/from work, before the store I work at opens I use headphones, and also when I’m making music! My life revolves heavily around it.
3	Can you share the survey? This is the second time someone has mentioned this today. \n\nI would guess I am at least 4 hours/day. \n\nLet’s see...\n\nWeekdays:\n\n-Some mornings while I get ready for work - ~30 mins\n-My commute to and from work (if solo) ~ 1.5-2 hours\n-At least 2 hours while at work. \n-If I am home in the evenings, depending on what I am doing, another ~1-2 hours. \n\nWeekends:\n\nIf I am home all day, I could have music going from breakfast into the evening. \n\nChecks out. 
3	That’s why I think it’s actually essential to our happiness that we learn to play instruments. I feel so much better when I make music
3	Does anyone else notice how listening to music triggers a lot of those fantasy situations/daydreaming that we commonly get into?
2	Listening to music while in the car is probably the closest thing there is to heaven on earth.
2	Too much lol.\n\nI’ve picked up freestyling and painting as little creative hobbies to flex the brain out a bit, and love them so I can see the guy who commented we need to get into music being correct.\n\nIt’s also turned my closed eye visuals I get on weed into WAY more artistic landscapes that I find myself going a lot more just into my mind for a decent amount of time w some good music. So I feel like that’s proof it’s literally improved the artistic part of my brain.\n\nAnd yeah, my car is my happy spot as well. Probably prefer being in it solo over with people, just a 1 man concert.
2	\~2-3 hours during the day, and a compulsory 1-2 hours in bed to unwind ...
2	Any time I don’t have to talk to someone I have my headphones in, and even then I might keep one ear tuned to music during a conversation. What can I say, music is my vice
2	Idk probably 30 minutes to an hour.  
1	All the time. showering, walking to class, while I’m working, while I play video games, I’ll even just jam out alone in my room before my roommate gets back from class. 
1	Does it include the soundtrack currently in my head?
1	Lmao yooo the same thing happens to me except with like listening to nostalgic music or reading something that triggers those kinds of feelings
1	I can spend hours listening to music! I also play guitar so I’ll spend another couple hours practicing. Probably average about 4 hours a day easily. 
5	What this INFP guy creates when he has no one to express his love to	
11	Anyone else find a lot of comfort in going out to eat by yourself?	I’m a very social person. I have friends and make friends easily. But I also feel like I am wired for alone time. I feel like the social side of me is forced and I just happen to be very good at it. My favorite thing to do is go out to have a beer/eat food by myself and play on Reddit or listen to a podcast. I’m interested in how many INFP’s feel the same!!
4	I hate eating out alone, it just feels weird for me. BUT I do love eating alone at home, like in my room instead of with my roommate or others in the kitchen. Idk why, I just love eating alone at home. 
2	Yess parks, movies too I've done all kinds of things alone. 
2	Begone, social person! You don't belong here!\n\njk\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm lucky to live somewhere where eating out isn't awfully expensive. So I've been doing that, and more often these days. I save a lot of articles in Pocket and I use the opportunity to catch up on my reading list, but also just enjoy whatever view there is.\n\nI get too absorbed by reddit so I try not open the app when I'm out and about. It sorta ruins the "eating out" experience for me; Like it ends up feeling like "I'm in reddit", rather than "I'm enjoying going out".
2	I do this all the time at coffee shops! It’s such a great place to be alone but also around people. I can get so productive or just content in the environment. Usually people leave me alone at coffee shops. \n\nI don’t usually eat at restaurants alone. I’ll get the food to go and eat it in my car so I can’t listen to my music or audiobook and avoid people trying to talk to me.\n\nI really enjoy just walking around art museums, neighborhood trails, malls, and small towns. It’s meditative. BUT, being a female, I’m terrified of being attacked or hit on so I really have to be in a place I trust. I wouldn’t feel safe walking around downtown by myself. And I wouldn’t want to walk around a murder trail by myself. Idk, sometimes I listen to true crime podcasts while walking so that probably doesn’t help my anxiety. 
2	When I lived in SF I went out to eat by myself a lot. :) I like it because you can go whenever you want and you don't have to compromise with someone in what they are in the mood for. I also like going to the movies by myself. I feel like a day I just do whatever I want is a perfect day. I have a saying I like to say when people ask me if I have any plans for the day. I will say, "The day is my oyster." They usually don't know what I mean but to me it means I will do whatever I want. I have the freedom to do so. :)
1	I’m literally doing that right now. I just saw movie, ate at a restaurant, now I’m at a coffee shop all by myself. I don’t technically need to be around people to socialize, I have reddit where I can talk to real people without having to actually be with them.
1	And here I thought that "being more open" was weird! Same! It's nice to see people react to the way I treat them and socialize with them, but it's just too much some times. \n\nI'd then prefer to sit in a corner and stare into the abyss, you know? Write up some short story about people or feel the breeze while watching the sunset, sort of thing. 
1	Like it expect when my paranoia that people will see me as a freaky loner hits 
1	I love doing this! 
1	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 16	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
2	I love that I love to create and all but I always get disappointed because what I create is meaningless. Even as an emotional dump, all my art does is exist in stasis in my memory. If it's all I can do and it's meaningless, reality is telling me it wants me to do something else. Gain a new skill and keep gaining skills I like until I find one that it can reward me with. So far, nothing. No mastery, no desirable traits, no resources, just energy going nowhere and walls of people I can't break down.
13	I wish people could understand why I cut them off	I do love my friends a lot but sometimes I feel worthless. I feel like redeeming before talking to them. Anyone else?
1	Yeah that feeling of not being worthy enough to have friends is a constant struggle for me. And then when I retreat from them for long stretches of time they get hurt and think they did something or I got bored of them. It's a never ending loop.
1	Maybe tell them that you need some alone time. I do that. They get hurt, so I sprinkle in some love and reassurance while on break from them. Not always guaranteed to work tho ._.
1	I don’t really have any consistent “friends” because I’m so horrible at constantly putting myself into the loop of “I’m worthless” or “nobody wants me around” and I shut everyone out. definitely one of my worst qualities 
31	Mood right now	
10	Sports, Athletic INFPS	What up infps...\n\nWhat sports and athletics do you enjoy doing and/or watching? 
3	Yoga, hiking, and despite being pretty atrocious, tennis
2	Swimming is my all-time fave. When I had a lot of time, I swam about 40 minutes a day. Also like yoga and rock climbing.
2	Soccer, volleyball, running 
2	I'm big into olympic weightlifting (snatch & clean + jerk) and on occasion, I dabble in either Bikram or Ashtanga yoga. But seriously though, weightlifting is life.
2	I used to play volleyball a lot, but college got in the way. I would definitely love to get back into it when i have the time. I also enjoy yoga sometimes, but that’s about it.
2	Running, basketball, volleyball, table tennis and badminton. I like to do try everything. Would love to try rock climbing next.\n
2	It's been decades now, but I used to like running cross-country. I didn't care about winning at all though.
2	Running, biking, weightlifting, hockey, volleyball, racquetball,  tennis.\n\nI don't particularly watch many sports.  I prefer to play them.   I enjoy friendly competition between like minded people.   Many a competition has been completely and utterly ruined by someone that takes it too seriously or is out to crush their opponent.    I stopped playing hockey for this very reason.  
2	I used to play football and lacrosse. If I was more athletic and my ankles weren't made of paper I would have continued playing lacrosse in college. Really hate the lax bro culture but I love how the sport combines finesse, power, and speed.\n\nI also follow my football team religiously and watch the NHL, NBA, and MLB along with college ball.
2	I love doing running/cross country, but I’ve had to drastically cut down my mileage so my knees don’t give out by the time I’m 30.\n\nI love watching football (NFL), even though I’ve never played in a league or on a team before, I know a ton about the game.
2	Love to see me some athletic infps! Yeah im big into yoga, particularly hot yoga. Also basketball is great, I think when you watch the greats play like Kyrie Irving it almost looks like a form of dance. 
39	My friend from work	
2	Your friend seems so free spirited!
735	This is true..	
113	the accuracy hurts my heart
84	I see a lot on here that we are the way we are because we are INFP. This is our default setting. Nothing says that we can't overcome these things too. These are just challenges that we face, and we can find fulfillment in developing the character to overcome weaknesses\n
14	One thing though, I don't like people.
30	One graphic just summed up 40+ years of me as infp!  Dang, I need to print it out & hand out like business cards!  
20	What's this 'loves people' stuff?  
16	This is uncanny. Like, 100% me. Wow.
14	[deleted]
7	yeah, it's funny. I want to be with people and I want to be alone.
5	well, at least i am not the only one... 
5	Hardly contradicting. 
10	Well, damn. 
3	I can confirm! One of the truest picture i've ever seen!
3	The INFP’s shadow side
3	How funny it is to be both an idealist and a pessimist?\n\nAlso, I think we have low self esteem but high/fragile ego that needs a lot of validation.
3	I found a half assed solution to part of this years ago.....\n\nDoesn’t wanna drink alone, wants to drink alone in a crowd.\nGoes to hole in the wall sports bar.\nBrings iPad with headphones..\nWatches YouTube and ignores every one in the place.\nSucess..😏
3	The "loves people" part, I take to mean, when we love someone we really, really love them. Friends, family .. "our" people. But who knows what the person who made this had in mind.
3	I'm confused by so many people disagreeing with  "loves people".  I tend to think of loving people as a natural consequence of the empathy that's so important to being an INFP. For me, I can' help but love people because I can't  help but put myself in their shoes and think about their struggles and their perspectives.   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
5	Define "loves people". 
4	How is this contradictory?
4	This is why I thought most INFPs were also Gemini like myself. Lol 
2	You guys have heatd about "healthy" vs "unhealthy" infps?
2	#Triggered
2	All correct except I'm an optimist. How about y'all???
2	accurate !\n*tear rolls down cheek*
2	Disagree with the love people.\nI'd say they love one or two people but with all their heart and are either indifferent or dislike everyone else. 
2	There are times in this subreddit where I feel everything is highly exaggerated and not relatable but yeah this one is dead on
2	So true it hurts...
2	How would you define pessimist? I don't think I am a pessimist, but I do sometimes say things that crushes people's bubbles.\n\nA guy I used to know was having mechanical issues with his car. His mom was lying on the couch moping and worrying about the car. She then said aloud, "I hope that it can be fixed." And then I said, "Well, it is certainly possible that it might not be able to be fixed." Then she became mad at me and she called me a little brat. I felt like she was being a overly dramatic, but I could also see why she was upset because she really wanted the car to be usable since it was the only car in the household.\n\nAnyway, perhaps I can be insensitive, but I just feel like it is better to think about the worst that can happen so that you can prepare for it. To just sit there on your butt, moping and worrying about things and then saying things like "I hope it will be okay" seems unproductive.\n\nThis might sound kind of negative, but I kind of think hope is a destructive force. Hope can prevent people from acting. Hope can also be devastating when it does not come true. I think it is better to not spend time hoping, but spend time planning. Hope is a band-aid. It is a temporary fix. Creating a plan is like giving yourself a tool box that you can use perhaps your entire life.\n\nI know that does not sound very INFPy but that is how I feel at least. Maybe other people can see where I am coming from.
1	That about sums it up!
1	Finally someone said it.
1	Yep accurate as lol haha
1	So infps are centrists. Nice
1	Accurate but I have a huge ego. I am infp a though. 
1	Omg THIS!!!!
1	I’m on the front page, what would INFP mean?
1	Hurts
1	Everything except my ego is high af and I don't generally like people.
1	I don’t think the “like people” trait is accurate. Also, not rigid at all. I think we’re pretty easy going and flexible
18	33yo and finally becoming more self-assured	Ever since high school I had been self-conscious. I was especially self-conscious about my voice. Even just hearing my voice made me cringe. I would also become emotional after any sort of criticism. I absolutely hated being called stupid, and if someone called me gay or an f word it would bring me to tears.\n\nYesterday, I noticed how much I have changed. I was with a work partner yesterday. We were working for about 11 hours non-stop. He is 23. Anyway, a couple of times throughout the day, I noticed he was super sensitive. A mechanic told him he was doing something wrong and he became visibly upset. Then later a nurse got snippy with him and he became incredibly upset too. I tried to help him relax and let it roll off his back, but he hated the idea of sounding stupid.\n\nAs much as this is weird for me to say, but I was exactly him 2 years ago. If any stranger treated me unfairly, or claimed I was doing something wrong I would act like him, mad and sad at the same time. But seeing him react those ways was an eye opening experience of how far I have come. Negative things people say to me do not affect me like they used to.\n\nI still have my issues and I do still care what people think of me and I do feel self-conscious a lot of the time, but I have also realized how far I have come. I can only imagine what 43 will be like.\n\nThank you for reading. Maybe this will even help some people out there.\n\n-Written with much love
5	Hey im INFP 32 male,  I am going through the same.  One of the traits for INFPs are that they are what I would call Long Term Life Bloomers or Long Bloomer for short.  We out of every other personality on the mbti have the capacity for greater change and knowledge of society and interpersonal tendencies over the years.  Think of van goh whom was thought to be an INFP. It took him most of his life and was ridiculed probably alot in his day but what would the entire art world be without him.  In a movie sense we are jedis of star wars or neos of the matrix... it takes Time for us to be who we really are, getting mad like you described seem like a rock in the way.  But soon we will look back and realize they were just bunps in the road.  Kind of like Neo and the bullet he went from geting hit by them to dodging them to literally co trollling them in time and space and eventually stopping them... In time my friend.  In time.
2	You are blessed to know this progress. There are people out there (my INFP dad being one of them) who are still stuck in adolescent over-sensitive "trigger" mode into their late 60s. I mean, to some extent, there will always be things that "trigger" us, but it's how we deal with it, especially in the presence of others, that makes all the difference. 
13	I'm a coconut and people are peaches	I'm a really shy person and I don't share much (time, experiences, my emotion, etc...) unless I really click with the person either with or without romantic interests. But once I do, I'm like I would do anything for him/her. And my problem is I assume the same with others.\n It's not that I'm close minded or unfriendly, but I think it's that have boundaries with other people. I'm like a coconut, which has a hard shell but easy to get into the center. To me people are like peaches, has a soft and thin skin but has big seed inside. They are just so open and friendly, share so easily experience with me  and tell me words I wouldn't give to others unless I deeply care about them. In my experience people have invited me to their lives so easily, had me feel so much affection toward them and assume they would feel the same since they are doing this with me or saying this to me,etc... and they just threw me away and I  find out they didn't care that much. This has been confusing and hurting me. \n I feel like I can't express what I'm feeling well enough with my English, but I hope someone feels the same way...
6	Exactly the feeling I had so many times in my life. But look forward, there are other coconuts :)
4	I think you said it very well. I can definitely relate.
5	If anyone here hasn't heard of cavetown yet, his songs have some of the most infp lyrics I've ever heard	https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgmMJJ34k4\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eIhU8wBjtsc
3	Thank you for sharing this, friend 
2	omg that’s so fucking true!!!
2	I absolutely love Cavetown! 💙💚💜
49	Is it an infp thing? I was always that person asking classmates to repeat what the teacher just said	
2	I used to zone out in class when I was younger, but at the age of 33 I am very attentive in class. I think at a young age school was just school and paying attention did not seem important, but as I have gotten older I have realized how precious time is, so I want to make the most of it as I can.
2	I remember this lol. I used to try so hard to pay attention after the exam was passed out, and I would still slip away by accident.
2	I’m still that way. Especially with instructions on ANYTHING. I have an instruction disability 
2	I’m the guy who gets handed an essay, zones out for the first 30 minutes, and writes 2 pages in 15 minutes
1	Direct link to [**tweet**](http://twitter.com/spjdermen/status/1087824823470960641) \n***\n^(This is a bot.     Am I a 'Good bot'?     All feedback is appreciated!)
1	Yes still I am at work 
1	Tests gave me so much anxiety/excitement, I don't think I ever zoned out like that.\n\nI was the guy in the back always doodling in my notebook, but sort of hearing what the teacher's saying. I think I never asked my classmates what the teacher said though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, keeping this up means good grades in high school, and terrible grades in college. INFP friends, apply yourself and purposefully build study habits, please. But it's not about discipline for us. It's about finding something you can believe in, and defining yourself as someone who does what's necessary for good things to happen.
1	Learning from other's people mistakes	It's always important being able to learn from our mistakes, but personally since I can remember I've tried to look at other people and learn from them. This may have to do with the fact that I can't handle being wrong, my mind just won't stop remembering that small thing that I messed up. \nBesides the point fear of failing, I truly believe that in many ocations we can prevent those mistakes if we look around us, and learn.\n\nWhat do you guys do more often; learning from your mistakes? Or someone else's?\n\nSorry if there's anything wrong, I'm still working on my English. 😊
5	How to be more "pleasant" at work? (Even though I think I am pleasant enough)	I work as a consultant in a corporate research firm, and as I progress in my career, I'm expected to be a lot more opinionated and vocal, which are just not my natural tendencies. I am keenly aware that a lot of the INFP strengths/traits can be perceived quite negatively by others, and want to hear from others on how they have dealt with them. \n\nTwo examples:\n\n1. Being so open, I am naturally agreeable with most situations, and so am happy to try new things and go with the flow. So then I'm asked what kind of projects I am interested in, "I'm open to anything"omes across as me being disinterested and uncaring\n2. Again, part of being open is that I simply like listening (absorbing information) more than speaking, and so I come across as awfully quiet. This is not as prevalent when it comes to actual work with clients, but when it comes to social event with colleagues (e.g. lunch, happy hour that I have to force myself to partake in every couple of months), I just don't want to be sharing so much of my life with acquaintances. And so I come across as being quiet / aloof / shy. \n\nIn real life, I don't care if people think I am a bore or aloof, but in a corporate world ruled largely by the outspoken and extroverted, I feel the need to fake it for my own good in the long run.\n\nI love my line of work and the company I work for, but how do I get better at this?
4	What Size is Your Mind	Using any known scale of measurement describe and your own beat words, the size of your mind\n\nYou can say an inch or even a death star, however you personally see fit to answer
3	Oceanic.
2	It engulfs the atmosphere.
1	If I remember right, it's a size 8. 
1	Size 0 but bootylicious
28	Anyone kinda hate having a phone? I feel I would be less anxious without it.	
5	I have always hated phones. It took me along time to get a cellphone which I got 2yrs ago. Having a cell gives me so much anxiety. I wish I could get rid of it but need it for emergencies. 
3	Hmm...maybe you should stop carrying it. I can totally get that. I used to date someone that hated phones too. He actually bought a flip phone with no internet and he only gave his number to his mom. Anyone else who wanted to contact him could call him on the landline or maybe call him at work in an emergency. He does not want to feel bothered all day, which makes sense.
2	i have a phone yet no mobile service aside from the Google VOiP number through wiFi.\ni dont go out/hang out, no buddies in the city so it’s home and work day in day out.\ni save $250/yr!
2	Yes, I am very pro-tech and everything, but just hearing my ringtone gives me that uneasy anxious feeling. I'm scared it might be someone calling with bad news, or even one of my friends interrupting my peaceful introversion.  It's so much pressure to always be available.
2	Thank god I’m not alone. Sometimes not even just hate having a phone I kind of hate that everyone has one because if I try to go without it I feel that I’m in the wrong because EVERYONE has one. I’m thinking about smashing my iPhone into pieces and getting a cheap phone for texting and calling because I’ve been affected by technology in a negative way and have become pretty much addicted(which is my problem) and I feel that will be the only way I’ll stop. I have an actual life and things I wanna do and phones and internet just distracts me dramatically. 
1	I've been planning to make myself contactable by phone only by my immediate family and for emergencies only for a long time. It's difficult since I'm a working adult. Have to do it in phases.
1	Yes, I want to turn it off for a week and tell people if they need me just ring my house's bell.
1	Not really. I kind of get a mini panic attack if I don’t have my phone near me. I like being able to google an obscure fact that pops into my head and being able to double check. Or knowing how to go places, or know how late things are open, or knowing what the weather is or if the apt complex will be plowing the parking lot and towing cars or if anyone liked sometime I posted or being able to text my boyfriend a weird Bitmoji or looking up how to cook something or reading the news or really everything. \n\nIt’s really hard for me to be without my phone because I’m such a hermit right now and I’d be almost totally alone if I didn’t have social media to communicate. BUT I went “offline” for a few weeks once where I disabled my Instagram, and I felt really nice ! I didn’t realize how much junk I let myself see everyday and how it effected my brain. 
68	I started drawing again	
5	I wonderful hobby to fall back into. Good job! Very impressive hatching. A fun excercise to do to better hone hatching and cross hatching abilities is to draw something round, but not spherical...something like a lemon or an apple, or even a heart, and only use hatching to shade it. It's very fun to me, idk, just a fun suggestion. Keep drawing! :)
34	Anybody else get weird nostalgia?	People say INFPs use Si for comfort. Anyone else get nostalgic for an era from before they were even born? \n\nEx. Sometimes when I play piano, I feel like I'm taken to the 1800s... or if I hear a song from the 90s I'll also get nostalgic. But I actually found out that some of my nostalgia songs were songs my mom used to listen to before I was born... so maybe the passing down of memories through DNA is the cause of my nostalgia? \n\n I heard people say they hate nostalgia but I love it... having all these memories playing back in my head feels so... relaxing 😌
7	Of course man , that's just your creative mind at work. I get those feelings about things too, especially  with music and guitar (:
3	I get nostalgia for places that don't exist. I don't really like it. (I love daydreaming about other places, but I don't like nostalgia's vague wispy sadness.)
3	I bet your room is full of things you can't bear to part with because you're so nostalgic. ;)
2	It happens to many people, but the strength is different. I happen to create scenarios in my head after hearing or seeing something. Then I become emotional, negativity or positivity, as if it were real.
2	I looove nostalgia. And sadness. It might sound weird but crying out of sadness is so pure 
2	Yes! I get so nostalgic while listening to music. It’s like I’m there in whatever time period. I only really know music from the 1950s- today, but I feel like I can time travel if the volume is high enough. \n\nIt also makes me wonder if I ever lived out those eras in a past life. Or how my parents or grandparents might have felt during that time. Recorded music keeps artists who passed away alive. I miss them, but I feel less alone when I hear them. 
8	I am a frail gardener in a burning garden.	>Context: I have a genetic condition (MTHFR) that causes me a few problems. I had a dysfunctional childhood and disastrous adolescence. I was close to suicide many times. After a lot of effort, my life is becoming manageable. I still suffer from a lot of issues. This is an epiphany I had on the bus back home from work.\n\nI am a frail gardener in a burning garden. \n\nI worked ceaselessly and put out many fires.\n\nStill my garden burns on, distressing many people.\n\nThe infinite fires that rage on, consuming me as fodder, are far too strong for me to overcome. \n\nI throw them a bucket of sanity but the vapor isn’t sufficient to quench the scorching air.\n\nBut I do not give up.\n\nI am frail yet persistent.\n\nI am weak but tenacious.\n\nI killed many monsters.\n\nI look up at you, my demons and phantoms.\n\nI gaze as you raze my peace and take away my freedom.\n\nBut I am here to banish you one by one.\n\nOne day, I will have peace.\n\nFlowers will bloom in my garden.\n\nI am a frail gardener who does not give up.\n\nI am here. You cannot stop me.
3	I have no idea what that's like; it sounds extremely difficult. I wish you the best and I hope you learn to live with these demons, as challenging as they are, I hope this intensely negative condition you have has helped shape you into a stronger, kinder person. I hope you find the silver lining buried beneath the pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMay you be safe and find peace.
134	But really though, take care of yourselves. You're worth it.	
10	I genuinely wish aliens would come down and scare the piss out of humanity to get them to be better
4	Wow. Love this:)
2	Okay dad, will do. 😋
2	Dang, thanks.
2	How the hell am I supposed to do any of this when I'm trapped in a system that has me making literally *negative* money each month?
2	Awe thanks darlin! <3 I'll do my best, really :) You too mkay?!
2	I need 36 daily hours of sleep, how dare you.
1	Love you guys
16	Post concert reflections.	Currently 1:06am typing this in bed. As an infp, I don't go out much, but when I do, it's to take a break from my old routines. I decided to go to a concert alone tonight because I've done it before once. Still had an amazing time, just wish I had someone to share it with. I felt happy for all the couples though, it'll be the happiest nights of their youth. \n\n\nAnd my ears are still ringing.
2	who did you see
2	Might want to being earplugs for your next concert just in case. Permanent ear damage is not worth it.
1	For me music is much more of an alone in your bedroom activity. They spend hours producing records to make it as polished as possible. I think a lot of people use it as a reason to go out, but I think there are a lot better places to go out that isn't as loud. I still remember my first concert was a Dinosaur Jr concert and my ears were ringing, I couldn't even recognize the songs cause it was so loud. :P
20	Why?	Why do we feel so much pain that sometimes isn't ours? Why do we feel this world is so evil? Why do we feel all alone despite being surrounded by so many people that are smiling and laughing and enjoying the moment? Why is it that we perceive ourselves to be in Syria? Why do we dream so much about something and once we actually get it we feel empty? Why do we jump from one goal to the next when we know deep inside that we're not going to be able to be efficient that way? Why do we stay inside and dream about the world we want to live in instead of actually going outside to create it? Why do we want to be loved by someone that doesn't really appreciate us the way we want them to? Why do we try to see the best in everyone, and attempt to be their friend no matter how poorly they treat us? Why are we so afraid of speaking out and hurting other people's feelings when it is us that stands to feel the most pain out of it all? Why do we hate direct interaction with people so often, yet starve for intimacy nearly every single day? Why does life and the meaning of our existence feel so special yet so insignificant at the same time? Why do we feel so disconnected and unloved by this world?
3	A: introverted feeling
3	Thank you for posting this. It articulates so much of what I feel as an INFP. People tell me to just go out there and do and try, but it hurts. It's exhausting. I say I prefer books to people and get called cold and snobby and lazy but it's just too much. People inflict so much pain on each other and it feels so much safer and easier to burrow in and find happiness in writing and drawing. The world will drive you mad.\n\n::hugs::
2	This really, really hits home today. I need to give this to my bf to read - because that’s a hard space to put into words. Hugs.
5	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 15	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
1	So a random discussion thread as opposed to random discussions on random threads.\n\nI should put out a random discussion tweet.
1	I made a Teespring account to add to the pile of fail that is Redbubble and my inability to shove links into everyone's faces. I can't force people to look at what I've got (Seeing this as the result instead of spamming links anyway). The spread of my art has been entirely luck-dependent, not because it's half-decent. I can't help but put myself down because I feel everyone sees my less than average ass as unworthy.  \n  \nSomehow Reddit has been the most helpful in getting people to see my stuff (and for free). Even then, it's all fleeting moments of discovery, only to have me dig myself out and give more each time. Self-promotion is super limited and that's understandable because spam is annoying. I have been holding back from going overboard with sharing the whole time, but is that what's holding me back? 
1	[A song I would like to share with everyone](https://youtu.be/PUXzhFP2rag) have a nice day.
6	This channel has got to be the most depressing thing to happen to society since Bambi.	stay cool infp's ;)\n\non a more serious note i sometimes get awfully confused at how or why (or being defined as the function \n\n{x, y}→{-((x+y)\^2-3x)/2} where x and y occupy a state of mutually exclusive true and false, represented by 0 as false and 1 as true) infp's are generally optimistic about everyone but themselves\n\nan explanation with functions could be helpful

14	HELP WITH AN INFP!	Hey there INFPs! I've (ENFP 16M) recently begun falling for an INFP (16F) and I think its time I tell her that. She's the nicest human I've ever met, so I dont want to ruin our friendship. Any tips? Do you fancy something cliched? Something unexpected? A mixture of both? A pseudo-recreation of a proposal scene from your favourite romance movie? Do I *sing?* (IDK what to do :P)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Im still unsure if she feels the same for me. We've know each other for 3 months and share music and comics a lot \[both of us love Calvin and Hobbes {oh look a brace inside a brace inside a brace}\]. She sometimes stares at me and we both often smile and wave at each other. But I dont wanna scare her off)\n\n\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE (19/02/19): Met her on the pretext of giving her the 'song sheet' (We usually share music and song names on pieces of paper, christened the 'song sheet'). Was supposed to confess her face to face, and the direction of the conversation was going in the right direction... until her friends showed up and didnt leave :/ (Honestly, they REALLY dont get the message when you try and tell 'em to leave via glaring at them). Didnt want to make a scene in front of 'em (she hates that kinda shit) so I just backed away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was a saving grace tho;  in the song sheet I wrote a lil poem in a code which we both know (Originally she was supposed to read it AFTER the confession, but to hell with that i guess.) Its not terribly original (Sarcasm 100), and certainly not my best work, but here it goes:\n\n>Roses are red,  \n>  \n>Violets are blue.  \n>  \n>If I wasn't obvious enough:  \n>  \n>I like you.\n\nSo... Am gonna try and tell her, face to face, tomorrow. (We have a test tommo so idk if she'll sit back and ACTUALLY decode it today \[after all she dosnt know theres a poem in there\], but hey, we'll find out tomorrow.)\n\n\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE (20/02/19): First met her during the small recess we had. Nothing was outta the blue, no red flags. She was with a friend, but smiles the moment we see each other. We talk a bit abt the test we had, and then ask her if we could meet up in the library at lunch. She readily agreed (to my surprise), but unfortunatly a teacher called us; she had something to discuss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTurns out we have a program to be scheduled on March 1st, and she wanted us, and a bunch of others to organize it, so we met up in the afternoon with the others (Not gonna lie, was a bit disheartened). It was bog standard, but she kept glancing at me (idk if thats my imagination or not). At the end the bell rang and I was keepin my chair, and she approachs me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Hey" she says.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Hey!"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe both begin walking towards our classes; we had like a minute to get there. "So... I read the poem." a small smile\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Really?"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Yeah. The code was simple."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are halfway to our classes. "Well originally you were supposed to read it *after* i told you in person-"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"What?!"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"- but ur friends were there so to Kingdom come i guess"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Ah... *X* (Not telling the name)? Oh my god I'm so sorry." she genuinely looked embarrassed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Nah its okay. You have no idea of the shenanigans I did..."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe had reached the corridor where our 2 classes branched off. "Can I talk to you abt this later?" she asks. We agreed to talk abt it later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe run into each other again during the second recess, but didnt really talk abt it cuz one of her friends were tagging along.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCome evening, and we have 10 mins before our buses are scheduled to leave. Im drinking water from the water cooler, when she materializes next to me from the crowd of teenagers heading home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"So..." she begins "abt that..." a small smile on her face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"yeah. you have no idea. me and *Y* (again name hidden) came with code names and shit" explained the whole things (And i wont do that cuz it involves a lot of inside jokes and percy jackson references; me, she and *Y*  LOVE Percy Jackson)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA short, but (for me atleast) a comfy silence later she says "I really dont know..."\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Well, I was just telling the truth."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA short pause. She dosnt break eye contact (not in a serious way, but that cute inquisitive way I keep falling for). "I mean, what do you expect from this?" (Okay it sounds like shes being rude, but it wasnt; her tone was calm and a tad bit flattered/shy. Idk how exactly to place it but I know it wasnt rude.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Nothing, I suppose. Just wanted tell you. No ulterior motives, if you know what I mean."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother comfy silence. She's smiling; so am I.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"I gotta go." she says "Looks like my friends are waiting for me over there." I look over to where she pointing, and sure enough those 3 witches from macbeth are there (Damn, cant they just leave us alone :/ Atleast they maintained like a 20 feet distance; yesterday they were practically glued to her).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Well, bye I guess?" I say to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Bye"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe both wave at each other she joins her friends; i turn and join my squad 30 feet away in the other direction, as they wanted to know all the details. Didnt get a definite answer, but Im willing to take what I got.
3	Hey dude! It sounds like she is interested in you. From my own experience, she’s probably never gonna make the first move (it’s not really in our nature) so you gotta kinda be forward with her. Be kind, be interested, be yourself! Good luck :)
2	Oh, if you're an ENFP, just be yourself. It's a natural connection. The only pitfall I can think of (should a romantic relationship develop) is her ability to cope with the eventual realization that all those human, social gifts of yours aren't strictly for her.\n\nBut since we're not there yet, I don't think I'd worry anymore about "ruining" the friendship if you've fallen for her. For you, the damage is done. Now you just gotta take the leap and find out if it's mutual.  \n\nAlso don't worry about "scaring her off". It's never **that** with anyone, I don't think. And you think you're gonna scare off an INFP with a personalized declaration of affection? If she's "scared off", it was that her feelings weren't mutual. And that will suck. But if you've fallen for her, anything's gonna suck that doesn't involve her falling for you. Right?\n\nMy only other tip would be to quickly see that falling for her does not equal love. Love is what you *do* from here on out. Good luck. I think we're all pulling for you.
2	How long have you been friends? I mean especially if it's been a while, go for it, man. I'm sure she'll appreciate anything. Sounds like you got some good advice in the comments too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck!!
2	i don't know much about love, i just want to show my support i wish you good luck :)
4	Weird personality	Am I the only one whose personality randomly changes like sometimes you're a ENFP, INTP, INFJ or ISFP? I dunno, I guess I'm just really weird. ;) But when I'm by myself I'm a total INFP.
6	You're not weird. You just don't understand MBTI. 
2	aaaah. same like me. sometimes when i'm happy,i will become ENFP. Buutt when I'm angry,I was become ENTJ suddenly.... xD\n\n&#x200B;
1	I am not sure what you mean. Can you give examples? Also, maybe you are stereotyping types, which may make you think you are acting as other types.\n\nIn my opinion you are one type, but each type is complex and stereotypes may apply in some cases, but on a grander scale do not really fit.
1	That's not how it works. Your cognitive functions can't change. 
11	Thought id share this song with you fellow INFPs	
22	Got this from a friend today. Day complete.	
4	Good ol’ Pokémon. I was obsessed as a youth. I always favored Raichu over Pikachu. \n\nI wonder what the most INFP Pokémon would be...?\nSnorlax? Gloom? Jigglypuff?
3	Have you ever heard of a play called “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead”

3	Congratulations ☺️
1	Thank you!
11	Self criticism and self love are two sides of the same coin.	I made this comment on r/INTP, and I feel like sharing it here with you guys. \n\nI think being self critical isn't just about self hate, but self love as well. We don't always know what makes us happy and content, but we all tend to have this idealized version of ourselves in our minds that we wish to become, but cannot. I think we magnify our flaws because they are a huge part of ourselves, yet they also keep us from becoming who we actually want to become; therefore, we become frustrated and bitter about where we stand in life because we cannot set ourselves free from our own self expectations even if everyone else tells us we are doing fine. To me being self critical is like being a harsh and strict parent to yourself, because you won't be suffering so much unless you actually do care. If we think about developing a child, the kid needs both soft and tough love in order to develope in a balanced way; therefore, for our own mental and emotional development, we can't just be overly critical at all time; instead, we should also pat ourselves on the backs sometimes to be self assured and not internalize the things we do not like about ourselves.

37	That face exactly omg
26	2.34 ~~hours~~ minutes*\n\nFTFY
25	Its always more exciting in my head...one hour later we’re at dinner in a huge group and I’m wondering why the fuck I’m here 
10	\*Human.exe has crashed\*

1	GOLDEN
1	is that a fucking tear in my eye looking at this 
1	Excactly OMG!
25	Do you also think that you avoid people because you love people so much	for me it is like as I love humanity, I don’t want any of them ruin the hopes about them\n\nI know it sounds confusing af but I do.
5	Yes, been there, done that.
4	Totally. That's totally me. People ruin my fantasy that we are evolving as a species, and that some day we will all get this shit right. 😜
4	The idea of someone often exceeds the reality of the person themselves. If we can start to see people as they are, then this becomes less of a problem. 
3	Nope.  I give a lot of love, when I need time by myself it’s cause I need it lol
3	You're not "ruining" anyone by talking to them, that sounds like a very unhealthy mentality
14	You might be an INFP if you....	
30	are overthinking about this too much
19	Can easily spend hours in the zone getting things done when you're doing something you're currently fascinated by, but... \n\n...have to muster up all the willpower in every cell of your body to spend half an hour doing your taxes (or that homework you don't like, or cleaning that thing you hate cleaning). Then after half an hour you figure you've earned the ready of the day off. Right? Lol.
18	Are not so good at being direct, except when under stress lol
13	Avoid sharing your feelings under the guise of "I'm FiNe"

78	Costanza made me think of this sub	
4	That's not good 
2	Wale uses this in one of his songs on his Album about Nothing. Good quote. Not sure if I want to live by it, but i understand his thought.\n\n&#x200B;
2	I so totally agree with Constanza. I want to at least live in reality when it comes to human nature. The rose colored glasses make me overlook bad behavior and I end up being a door mat. Accepting the reality of human nature, without sugar coating it would save me a lot of time in the long run I think. Then I could be pleasantly surprised by people more, when they do wonderful things occassionally.\n\nHappy Valentines Day!!! Lolol
2	I grew up watching Seinfeld because my dad loved it\n\nI have to say, I agree with this post 100%
1	Why tho, I don't want to be hopeless
1	What about it made you think of us?\n\nI think Costanza's the archetypal *anti*\-INFP, if anything. 
1	I can relate haha
2	Thanks Cupid...

1	TC! Hello fellow Texan. 🤛🏻
7	Is it just me or it's an INFP thing ?	I'm a female INFP in my first 20's. I have this one thing about me. Whenever I ask something to others, I try very hard not to hurt or offend them in any way. For example: "I'm just asking. Is it okay for you ?". When I'm required to do work group, I will ask if the other can do it, or else I will. I was asking to my lecturer about my work the other day. I asked her if I still had to do this part when I have already help the team. "I was just asking. It's not that I didn't want to do the work. Please don't misunderstood". She replied by saying she knows I was just asking. \n\nMy friends and sibling think I look stupid.Some said I am stupidly naive.  Honestly I feel the same sometimes. I think I always embarass myself by saying these kind of things. People might think I just want to appear nice and polite. Or they might think I'm stupid for voicing thoughts like these. I should just ask what I need to without expressing what I feel. I feel very bothered by this.\nAnother thing is, I am very quiet around people I'm not close with. Sometimes I would burst out saying weird and stupid things. I also think this is embarassing. \n\nIs it just me or the other INFP did experience the same thing ?
6	I do the exact same thing. My line is, “if that’s okay with you?” 
1	Yeah in general I'd say I'm pretty type B when it comes to directing etc. \n\nI've worked on it a bit now since being in management. Delegation is my least developed ability and servant leadership is my strongest attribute..
1	I am the same way.\n\nIf I ask a favor I will put it in a way that they can say no. I feel like it is more polite. Also I feel like I am not here on this planet to make anyone do something they do not want to do. Although I mean this with other adults. When it comes to children I feel like there is an expectation that they need to do things they do not want to do.
1	Yes I am the same. I have difficulty to ask for any kind of help from others, if I have to ask I will be super polite and say weird things. It looks so unnatural my "thank you" to other I can see it in their eyes. \nI feel like I should be self sufficient for everything and don't disturb people. \nBut I am learning to open up...  at first everyone misunderstood me and later they found that I was just being kind. \n
22	I cannot be the only Brash INFP in the world?	I mean, we cannot all be a bunch of mewling kittens and demuring snowflake dolphin prince/ess/es.\n\nGranted, it wasn't always this way.  I did used to try to bond like a swan couple with everyone I slept with, avoid conflict, and feel eternally skin-crawlingly embarassed in social situations.\n\nHowever, at some point I kind of woke up and realized conflict is inevitable (since there are so many people dedicated to self-limiting binary ideologies), and most people hide a lot of goodies in what they call 'evil' or 'bad' or 'selfish.'  Finally, most of the time people are either going to enjoy me or not and I cannot act conforming enough to change their minds.\n\nKind of like, "They're going to love me or hate me and there wasn't much I could do about it from the start."  At that point, I find a lot of freedom to say and do whatever I please.  Anyway, even if I *do* weave a magical fabric of pretty lies that makes someone think I'm cool, I would have to spend a lot of time keeping that up -- I mean like, you can put on a face in an interview, but if you get that job, you better be able to keep it up!\n\nSo now I almost treat everywhere I go as a testbed of whatever celestial or diabolical experimentation strikes my fancy at the moment.  I generally talk louder, say what I please, and yes, occasionally piss people off to no ends.  \n\nBut who cares?  If those people somehow "liked me" before, it's not like they really liked *me*, just whatever they entertained as the idea of me.  What is there to gain through being a wallflower?  If I sacrifice myself to avoid conflict because "conflict is uncomfortable" am I not then also uncomfortable due to the self-sacrifice?\n\nAnyway, did any of you other dead-eyed INFP magical-world-trapped-in-a-person types ever evolve some outgoing qualities?  What about outgoing to the point of brashness and assholery?  I know we're usually willing to *explore a lot of ways of looking at the world*, so I cannot be the only one who came into this....
9	*Piss off*; I'm a demurring snowflake dolphin prince. \n\n😉
7	Ha, no your not, I think it gets easier with age, to generally not give a fuck about what certain people think! They think I'm nuts at work, I just say whatever pops into my head which can be very random, rude, sick, offensive! Not always tho. But hey ho, sod em! 
3	There's a difference between being "nice" i.e. people pleasing, and being "kind."  The kind thing to do is often to be honest, especially with the people closest to me in my opinion.  So, I say what I think too. And it does tend to alienate people at times. I have a knack for noticing and identifying patterns in people's behavior that they have never seen before. Or are desperately trying to hide. Some would say I should keep things to myself, but I try to say something about it only if it's kind and necessary.  If I want real intimacy in my life I think I have to take a risk and get honest about things that people do that hurt me.\n\nNot everyone will get it but whatever. The people willing to have a real conversation and self reflect on a deep level the way I do, are the only people I want as close friends anyway, and usually those others will eventually let me know they learned a lot from me. They often get pissed at first, and in the worst cases it could take a few years for them to process it enough to tell me but I have had to accept that and not make either of us bad or wrong in the process. Not every relationship is meant to be forever. 
3	i put up a brash front once i get comfortable enough with someone.
2	> However, at some point I kind of woke up and realized conflict is inevitable...\n\nYes, precisely. Running or avoiding it is the last thing that it should be done as it often restrain us. We're being thought to avoid it, to remain passive but what we should be thought is how to handle it, how to resolve the conflict. 
2	I wouldn't call myself brash but I stick up for myself, don't let other people push me around or make me hold myself back. Only got one life so there's no point in living anyone's but your own.
2	I'm in your camp. Spent a looooong time on the people-pleasing side first though. I came to a similar conclusion to yours. I want to just be myself and if people like me, then great. If not, then there's one less person to worry about keeping happy. I have many casual acquaintances but only two friends that I care about deeply (INFP style) and that's enough for me.\n\nI'm also far less self conscious which allows me to actually go out once in a while, have fun, dance, make a fool of myself and pretend I'm some sort of extravert. It's very freeing.
2	Just going by the INFP Facebook group, apparently not, as these people start what will obviously become arguments every other hour. Well it's been two INFP Facebook groups where I have observed this.\n\nI think the more an INFP people-pleases to avoid conflict, the more they will also avoid people. The INFP is not likely to be confused about how they feel and will feel stifled and resentful not being able to "be themselves". \n\nAlso an INFP may not know how to express their beliefs without doing so in a way that will make other people upset, since so many of their beliefs will run counter to what "normal" people think. We are not always very good at explaining all the things going inside our heads and all of the information that led us to whatever decision or opinion we have. Also we have to learn that just because other people are upset that doesn't mean we are wrong. We can't control everything.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with conflict, conflict needs management, not necessarily resolution.\n\nIt is advisable for the INFP to use extraverted intuition and continue to explore all possibilities, and to be expressive about this, even if it makes others uncomfortable. Unfortunately many times INFPs will skip this function and instead stick to Si which encourages comfort and stability and introversion.
2	When I was younger my nickname was "Mike Tyson" and I was told I was contentious and that's why people didn't want to be around me. Then I just started staying away from people as much as possible (while continuing to argue online with strangers). \n\nNow I am known as a very "nice" person, which just means people feel betrayed when I put my foot down, but I no longer regret putting my foot down. It's always worked out for the better.\n\nI have always highly valued peace, just not peace based on deception.
2	I usually get 49% INTP and 51% INFP, so I do have my brash moments with some debates. xD However, I really love the idea of being a mewling kitten/demurring snowflake dolphin princess and a magical world in a person type :’D And I like this sub actually a lot more than INTP. Anyway, what I mean is that I feel more in tune with my feelings side, but I do have my brash moments for sure!! 
2	I find that if I say something smart and funny, people tend to laugh even though I am making fun of them. 
1	Someone once said, "a cynic is just a disillusioned romantic".  Not sure if that means anything to you but it makes sense to me
1	I’ve gotten brasher with age but I still don’t call myself brash. I’ve had situations where I had to put my foot down but they never felt “great” or “exhilarating” 
1	Nah. I like it. I can be pretty brash. A lot of time I overthink it in the aftermath, though.\n\nI think, for an INFP, the move to brashness begins with recognizing conflict as inherently necessary for all the things we're idealizing -- like authenticity, intimacy, community, growth, etc. \n\nYou're probably going a little further than me, though. But I think, apparently like you, that the greater error is to go in the opposite direction, maintaining a comfortable equilibrium of pseudo-harmony that does nobody any good at all.
1	Yess, MOOD. Love this post. 
3	My story.	I found this Reddit subpage through Google search when I was looking for infp stuff.  This is my story. I never met people like me and I kind of have a big ego but again, I never met people like me.\n\nI was born on June 22nd and I am a cancer / infp / a Empath / and I had a sort of a mental disorder relating to my life. I use my right brain. I am a Empathatic cancer INFP man guy boy. \n\nI value kindness, patience, hope, love, wisdom, honor, righteousness, and I have a specialized Empath life. \n\nMy Empath life has made me medically insane. I live in Texas USA. I have dreams of God(Jehovah) as an orb if electricity and dreamed the devil before. I dreamed Buddha and dreamed obatala( Santeria voodoo God) and I seen many angels and saints in my dreams. \n\nMy dreams manifest as positive (light holy energy) and negativity ( shadow dark evil energy). I do not like drugs alcohol muarijauna(weed) and I do not like gothic people , gangsters, negativity, metal music, gore, Halloween, bad neighborhoods, peircing, tattoos, and I rarely have sex with women because their emotional scars make me sick physically and mentally. During sex I heal wounds of the other person or get drained. I believe in merraige and love. \n\nEmotional scars do make me sick. So do people with evil personalities or liers cheaters thiefs as well I get sick from dark emotions like anger fear hate chaos confusion death negativity depression sadness and greed. \n\nAnimals love me. And some women find my charm very attractive. I am charming because I am compassionate and confident. I know my mechanics and my strengths weakness. \n\nI live on social security and get 500$ a month. I am extremely dumb because I am not logical at all or very limited logical and intelligence. I don't know how to drive and I don't know how to survive in this world. I failed college and graduated highschool because of president Bush's no child life behind. \n\nI am told that I am an angel. But I don't know about that. I live with my grandma and I have 3 sisters. \n\nI use Florida water and candles to help strengthen my energies. Emotions are energies. That's a truth but science doesn't know that yet. I always feel an emotional chaos in me....\n\nThis emotional chaos is like starwars. As an emapth I can choose to switch to negativity and be a amazing asshole and greedy evil person. \n\nBut I haven't figured out that mechanic yet. Most negativity hurts me but I always feel a pull to shadows ( to be a wicked amoral human being)\n\nWell what else ...I am 29 and in 5 months I will be 30.\n\nI guess that is the end if the story. Thanks for letting me talk and rant. I know it sounds like a lot of bullshit. But I swear my right brain personality has a weird life. \n\nAsk me any questions and I will answer them. Thanks for hearing me out. I love this subreddit. Thank you. 
1	More about my life ........\n\nAs an Empath and an INFP - I read the power of now by ekchart tolle and know the dalai lama. \n\nI am not shy or secluded. I do not run from social encounters. \n\nThe matter of the fact is - I am like Goku. I love spiritual self development training and I love energy combat. \n\nI know I am super sensitive as an Empath and negative people hurt and drain me. But I "push or force" my positive presence wherever I go and a clash of spiritual energy happens. \n\nI make ugly people bored angry tired or confuse. I know my "light" eats their shadows. \n\nSometimes I need a shower/bath to recharge or Florida water. Other times I light candles for knowledge or defense(protection). \n\nI seriously have an ego and a nasty judgement. I judge bad people as bad based on my feelings towards them because shadow emotions and - negativity - is my sworn enemy. But I do feel the devil try to sway me to the Darkside.  I tend to be a egotistic idealist - a paladin and I dislike hanging around people who are not as um...ethical ? \n\nI don't know what I am and I know I have a mental illness. I am cancer. Empath. Angel. iNFP. And a right brain user. \n\nI actively fight negativity everywhere I go. \n\nAnd yes I have strict morals and high standards. \n\nThanks for letting me go crazy haha 😅

9	How would you describe intuition to another type?	I think the best way I can put it is, "It's my brain processing thousands of finite details in seconds, which allows me to understand people and situations on another level. It's the way someone's smallest corner of their lip turns up when their mad at you, even though they say they aren't. My brain is able to see that and understand it without me realizing it". \n\nHow would you guys describe it? 
4	I have some kind of internal process that gives me a feeling when I see, hear or touch something that is of meaning or importance to me. When I get that feeling my mind can see infinite possibilities and outcomes that paint ideas in my mind for me to bring in or share with the world.

11	Making Friends Online	Many people in my life (especially extroverts) don’t understand how I make so many friends online. In real life I’m painfully shy and awkward, as I’m sure many on this sub are, but online where I have time to think about what I want to say and I don’t fear I’m being judged on anything except what I put forward, I’m much more confident. That and the ability to walk away from someone without consequences takes off so much pressure and makes it easier to open up about how I feel. \n\nI love making friends online! I’ve formed lasting relationships with friends I’ll likely keep for a lifetime, even if we never meet in person. Surprisingly, a good number of the friends I make here on reddit are also INFP! That’s kind of why I decided to make this post. I want to see how many others on here like meeting new people and making new friends through the internet.\n\nAnd if you’re feeling lonely and need a friend or could just use someone to talk to, feel free to PM me. I’d love to chat :) 
2	I wish I could do that. I fail in real life and I fail online. I am not a good friend.
1	I find making friends hard either way, mostly because as I've gotten older the pickier I've gotten with who I consider friends.  I just don't often meet people who I feel happy going out of my way to spend time with.  Whether I have more online friends or irl friends depends on where I happen to find someone I like who'll introduce me to new people.  Either way I'll open up to anyone who cares to be inquisitive and retreat into my shell when they don't seem to care, regardless of whether I want to be their friend or not.
2	A dilemma - get out of comfort zone, or do what makes you happy?	So I have a dilemma.... A week or so ago, whilst high at a festival, I had a meltdown in front of my bf and another friend about how sad I was and how I want more friends. \n\nMy bf is used to these meltdowns so is all lovely and comforting at the time and then knows to not bring it up again when I'm sober cos he knows I don't really mean it and/or will never do anything about it.\n\nThis other friend however, who I only ever see at group events, is a lovely human and is clearly worried and has now obviously resolved to make  more effort so has invited me out for dinner. \n\nTonight.\n\nProblem is, most of the time I'm happy on my own, I only freak out once or twice  a year whilst drunk or high and  on a day to day basis am perfectly fine with being my introved anti-social self. I HATE one on one social activities because I get real bored real quick and there's no escape. \nSo I'm really not feeling like going out for dinner tonight and would be perfectly happy staying in and getting started on my next sewing project.\n\nBUT I know my bf is going to disapprove (he's an extrovert, and doesn't quite get why I don't just go out and make friends)\n\nAND my inside voice is also kinda nagging me that I should make an effort and be more social cos then I won't have bi-annual loneliness meltdowns....\n\nWhat to do? 
1	Im a bit late to the party so to speak, but im a bit curious. \_If i may ask, how did it go? did you go to the dinner at the end or not?
794	Woah	
58	Yeah this is kind of my life philosophy. First read about thinking about time this way in Slaughter House Five. Every moment, good or bad, is happening in its place in time and will never stop happening in that time. It’s permanent. So when I’m feeling my darkest I try to go to a time where I was happy and live in that moment. It’s hard for humans because of the way we conceive of time but if you start to think of time differently, you can try to invoke the emotions of somewhere else in time.\n\nSounds weird but it’s gotten me through a lot.
34	This is why I have anxiety lol
13	I think this is why we always write “never forget” in our culture when someone has passed. \n\nAt first, I thought this post was going to talk about multiverses/alternate universes, which would’ve been a completely different topic.
7	But what if people forget? 
7	This actually inspires me to create some art. Or write. But I’m not in the practice of doing that. Actually, that makes me appreciate (even more) the effect this has on me. \n\nAlso: I read a thing once that seemed to encapsulate this concept a little bit. I think from Pema Chodron or Tich nat Han. Basically that we think of a river as the same entity over time, as though it’s static. But in actuality, it’s ever-changing. From one instant to the next, it’s entirely new in its content and form. But we continue to refer to it by its proper name. \n\nAnd that that’s how people are, too. Entirely fluid in identity/personality, yet we are under the impression (illusion) that each of us is the same person from birth to death, or day to day, moment to moment. \n\nWe are like rivers. 
7	How would people remember if I was the only one there to see me?
3	Wow...I've thought of this before...can I use this?
3	Wow, that's insightful. And so true.

2	Damn that gave me goosebumps, thank you. I'm gonna think about this next time I feel like I've lost touch with myself
2	In 200 years you'd probably be forgotten.\nMaybe your online presence will stay, but there is a point in time when no trace will be left of you.
2	Yay, an anxiety peak.

5	Unexplainable Feelings	Hey everyone, i'm new here. I decided to come due to the intensity of the melancholy i've been feeling today, the sad hopeful type. Walking by my old high school on my way back home it hit me hard. The scenery of the sun setting, a cold evening. The way the wind was blowing. \n\nI almost feel attached to my melancholic feelings when they come. They come and go usually once or twice a month and can last for a few days at a time. I can't really even explain what i'm feeling melancholic about, but i'm listening to piano music now as that keeps the melancholic feel. Maybe the scenery, the distant memories, longing for something but I don't know what it is. I'm in a happy relationship! Things at home could be better but as is life. It's a melancholy I enjoy having around.. Is that odd?\n\n\n\nAlso, somewhat related? This has been happening for YEARS. Sometimes i'll have a dream where I meet someone and feel the strongest love I have ever felt. An extreme sense of comfort and being overcomes me when this person comes to me in my dreams. It's not always the same person physically but it feels like it! There's even been times where they would tell me, "i'll be waiting here for you until the next time!".. I've purposefully taken up meditation and I do so before sleep so I can remember these dreams more clearly and experience them better. I wish I could find an answer as to what this all means..
3	Yeah, that attachment to melancholy seems to be an INFP thing, both from my own experience and lurking around here. I, too, have a playlist just for that. 
3	Deca!!!!!!!!!!!	Hello Norwie. If you find this I just wanted to say hi :D

6	Curious to meet another INFP in person....	How many INFPs do you know in person? I don't know any personally, but very curious! 
3	Turns out most of my friends are INFPs, only exception being one INTP. I don't talk to a whole lot of people though
2	Well, in my country, even most INFP's are very judging. It's pretty hard to tell. Also most INFP's behave and think like INFJ's here. and INFJ's tend to think like ISFJ's. ISFJ's are all over the place and it feels like they have many subtypes here.\n\nAnyway, once I really got into MBTI, I started noticing that more people than I think in my life are INFP. In fact, I just didn't notice before and thought that I didn't know INFP's. \n\nMaybe it's because my family is very distant from me, not only in MB, but also in everything else that has to do with personality. The only one in my family that is somewhat close is my grandmother, an ENFP. Love visiting her. She's also much more interesting and closer as a person regardless of her MBTI type.  \n\nBut apparently, my singing teacher is an INFP, my ex's best friend might be an INFP, a few distant friends are INFP's... With that being said, I've never got real close to one. In fact, I don't get close to people, almost at all. I've only got a bit close with an INTJ but it's over now. \n\nSomething important:\nMBTI types are presented like videogame character classes. And everyone is perfect and beautiful. Well, the descriptions they show for each type is in a very actualised, blossoming form. Most people are not nearly as close to the description in terms of their flourishing as a personality. Also, people are so different from one another and MBTI is just 4 traits. And finally it's also worth noting that for instance feelers can feel less than some thinkers and vice versa. \n\nWhy am I saying this?\nBecause not all INFP's you're going to meet will be the same and will not necessarily be like you. That's why it took me so long to realise that some people in my life are actually similar to me and heck also happen to be INFP's. 
2	I don’t know if I’ve ever met one because, well, you know how adaptable or closed off we can be. But I have met a few ENFPs, they are pretty easy to spot.
2	Found out my dear friend from my first year at college is an INFP. the only friend that I still talk to, aside of one other person who also happens to be INFP! LOL. I spent Christmas with her family in Alaska one year and fit right in. I was surprised. Spent all of last summer with her. There is literally no one else I could stand to be with all the time for 3 months straight. I love her! We were able to help each other live out our thoughts rather than just sit and think them.
2	My sister and maybe 2 friends.. 
2	currently there's only two that i know of for a fact are also INFPs like me   \nive also found that i have lots of INTP friends as well which kind of surprised me lmao   \n\n\nmy closest friend is also an INFP and we've never even gotten into a serious fight once through out the 5-6 years we've been friends which was always kind of surprising to me. but the more i think about it now , the more its not so surprising since we behave so similar.   \n\n\n(only recently gotten into MBTI tho and tbh im not all that confident in my ability to identify other personality types lmao buuut i honestly think this is worth looking into) 
1	Yes, absolutely. I tried to get one of my friends who I am pretty sure is an INFP to take the test, but he still hasn't. Just curious to meet one!
11	Break ups are hard.	I broke up with my boyfriend (ENTJ) yesterday. I did it. I told him that I didn't want us to be together. I'd thought about it a lot. I knew he wasn't right. Nevertheless, I know I hurt him and I've hurt myself. I thought I would take the time to write about the emotions, now that a day has passed.\n\nGuilt. I hurt him. I really hurt him. I believe he really did love being with me and he didn't want us to end.\n\nSadness. This is the biggest understatement of the year. I feel terrible. There were positive aspects of our relationship and we did get along quite well. \n\nRelief. In a sense, I'm glad that it's over. We were never going to last.\n\nFinally, why did I decide to break up? I felt like we lacked an emotional connection. I want a partner who I can talk to and be open with, but he didn't want to do that. He didn't like to talk about our inner feelings. He wouldn't open up to me about his own feelings and when I spoke to him about mine, he'd try to change the direction of the conversation. This was the main reason why. There were other little things, but they were less important. \nWas I being petty? \nShould I have persevered? \nI really don't know. Advice would be appreciated, or feel free to share your own stories.\n\nI thought I'd link this clip from BoJack Horseman. It's quite relevant to me at the moment.\n(Warning Season 5 spoilers)\nhttps://youtu.be/g4x9u6OU214
8	Good for you for doing the right thing, even though it was hard.\n\nI had an ENTJ ex who would dissociate if I tried to bring up difficult or emotional topics. He would space out for a sec and then start talking about jeans. Yes, I am dead serious, JEANS. It was extremely weird, some kind of coping mechanism. \n\nHe was also really obsessed with gaining friends (regardless of their morals or character) and popularity. He almost cried once when a semi famous instagrammer cancelled a lunch meeting on us. \n\nThey cannot stand being alone and most go from one relationship instantly into the next. It's sad.\n\nI am through with ENTJs. They are compelling and fun to be with but in my experience, they do not fit my definition of a good person.

3	GOD that scene with Diane was so fucking powerful to me and I'm honest to god happy that someone else saw what value there was in that scene. I also saw this when I broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years (an INFJ) and it honest to god made me spiral so much deeper into my depression i thought i couldn't survive it .   \n\n\nI always had a fear about my relationship with my INFJ boyfriend because it always felt like a kind of love/hate relationship to me. I was never confident in myself or the words I said so I always tried to find some new way to be heard and honestly , talking to him felt like talking to a brick wall sometimes.   \nHe's a really sweet guy to be honest, and i still hope even now he finds happiness in his life but the constant flip flop between us was always there. We fought a lot in the beginning , we fought a lot in the end. I either did too much or did too little, and it felt like he just always wanted to do something to the point where he'd become unstoppable in his goals. It was exhausting and draining and I never felt like anything I did made any impact.   \n\n\nyou're valid as fuck my guy and im always gonna be hoping for your health and happiness <3 this post honest to god spoke to me and made me felt understood in a way i never thought i could be.  \nkindness from strangers online lmao amirite 
2	Yeah, sounds like you were not getting your emotional needs met.  I like to have a deep connection with my partner too, but I’ve never found the right person.  It sucks.  
1	Happy Valentine’s Day...	
38	Came across this while playing slime rancher, really hit home	
5	How is slime rancher? I was thinking of grabbing it just to have something to play that's relaxing.
6	Yeah except the part where people miss seeing you
1	Ye, i started and finished it last week. I'm glad i bought it. It was a very nice game.
6	What are your daily/weekly routines?	Hey guys! It's your friendly neighborhood ENTP. I'm wanting to create a set of YouTube videos where I follow the "average routine" of each type and then reflect on what I learned. I thought it would be an especially interesting experiment to start with you guys since Fi is my blindspot.  \n\n\nAll ideas welcome! It doesn't matter how unstructured you think you are. Happy V-Day. 😉
4	I really struggle with routine, so I try to avoid it as much as possible. At the moment the main activities/responsibilities in my life are my university degree which involves a lot of writing, working (support worker), hiking with my dog, hanging out with friends, volunteering in a sexual health clinic, working on projects, looking after my niece (who is 4 and thinks EVERYTHING is an adventure) and some self care stuff (yoga, swimming). \n\nHowever this usually all jumbled together and no week, or day, looks the same. One day I could be working a 14 hour shift, the next spending a whole day outside with my dog, the next in meetings for project work all day.. it really varies.. and that is how I like it. 
5	Daily routine would be something along the lines of wake up, smoke a bowl, shower & eat, off to work , home, smoke another lil guy, gym, home, then either go out with friends or chill home and play games/read/smoke more. \n\nAm low-key dependent on pot atm 
3	The most important daily part of my routine is meditation. I make time for it because every time I slack my quality of life goes way down.\n\nI put very deliberate effort into having alone time without a lot of noise or distractions. I like to have peace and quiet at the end of the day. That being said, I've recently started putting more effort into being social again. Otherwise, I get home from work and either work on some crafting projects or clean. I try to stay in the habit of cleaning because having a welcoming home makes me feel so good. My home almost feels like an extension of myself, so I put a lot of focus into it. \n\nI meal prep once a week and really want to start canning and my own garden. I do a lot of knitting and crochet. Big fan of movies and music. Love everything about music. Wish I could play an instrument but I don't. Thinking about taking up painting.\n\nI used to exercise a lot, but I'll admit I let that slip after a very emotionally difficult year.
3	Weekly but not necessarily daily: cooking a big meal to last 2-3 days, running, some yoga and exercise, painting, reading books and blogs, watching tv/movies, browsing social media, salt baths, nature walks, fantasizing about a better life lol
2	Kundalini yoga 2x a week, running and weights 1x a week, meditation pretty much daily for at least 15 mins,  hygiene, reading, hobbies like writing, crochet, learning new things, watch some show/movie of interest. Weekly astrology forecast. Cooking I like homemade meals, and I drink a latte most days usually chai or London fog or some herbal stuff. Work on my personal goals. I listen to music pretty much most of the day while I do things, and have my aromatherapy machine going, and I sage a couple times a week to clear the energy, and pray particularly before a meal offering gratitude and sustenance for all beings in existence. Nothing is in order just off the top of my head and an approximation. 🙂
2	Daily routine: hard af to get out of bed sometimes so, using atleast 20 minutes sleeping right after i get woken up.\nLove Entp's, think you're super fun and brave.
17	Are we often lonely because we are so selective?	And also introverted, often shy, slow to trust... And being sensitive not everyone actually gets us at all, they just find us weird.\n\nBut then we also need someone with similar values and morale. Then that godforsaken "I want to have an intimate relationship with my best friends" - you just don't get there in a few weeks. Trust takes time.\n\nI feel like there's a long and specific list for me before I want to make close friends with someone. Thankfully I already have few good ones around.
6	Yes. But then this attitude only really works when you have a big enough applicant pool. :P You have to give people a chance. 
4	I’m lonely because I have lost trust in people, since I’ve been taken advantage of one time too many.  I’m very guarded around strangers and co-workers. 
3	I think that I'm lonely because I'm not selective. I'm desperate, waiting like an uninvited guest in a yacht party, waiting for someone to notice me, save me, anyone. And people aren't drawn to that... I think that friends are for the selective. Ironic.
3	I dunno why, I just feel like I have so many questions for this group in recent days: Does anyone else feels like people are constantly being condescending to them? Not everyone, but enough people that you actively notice?	Not trying to be dramatic, just curious. 
2	YES. \nAnd seriously underestimating me or treating me like a child. It makes me wonder if i should change something about my demeanor or appearance to convince them otherwise but then I come to my senses and kinda laugh about it to myself. 
1	Do you mean people in this sub being condescending or just the people in our personal lives?
3	What does it mean for an INFP to be very perceiving of others??????????	How is an INFP perceiving of others? What are some examples? Can you read their minds or body language? Do you see hidden intentions? Do you see both good and bad? Please explain. I'm highly fascinated to figure out what 'perceptive of others' means.
9	I just get vibes off of people. Almost like I imagine a dog or cat would. No type of solid information, more just a general idea of what their real intentions are either in support of, or in spite of, what they're saying. I used to push it to the side, and I do still give everyone a chance, but its frightened me how often my assessment of their general motives has been spot on.\n\nI was just saying to someone the other day: I rarely if ever judge someone based on just their words. Body language and just general gut feeling play a big role. 
7	Hah ur wild dude , i just get these feelings and dunno what to do with them :^). \n\nYou can definitely read into people’s minds , you don’t know what they’re thinking but I feel like you know why they’re doing what they’re doing, like the underlying cause to they’re actions. \n\nThis has not helped me in life , especially in regards to relationships but I’m definitely curious to hear about others
3	Most of the time I just feel their vibes, like what their mood, intentions, well being is etc. It's vague and I haven't really learned to trust and use that information very well yet. \nThen sometimes if I'm listening to one person talk about a second person and issues with them, I am often able to explain how I think the second person is feeling and why they might have acted the way they did. Sometimes if I'm listening to an an argument, I can mediate and explain both sides of the story. This is something I've done from a young age, I'm not even sure where the information comes from. \nFunny thing is, I'm not good at knowing the exact thoughts of people I'm directly interacting with very well. It only works in third person. I think my own thoughts and feelings get in the way when it's me interacting with someone. This means I can help other people better than myself. I end up feeling like I have poor empathy in some ways because I'm actually not good at putting myself in other people's shoes. I think this could get better with time and experience though.
1	Well I've always been a people watcher since childhood, from all that I can pick up on people's motives or read their problems pretty easily. \n
1	Basically, I can take a situation and imagine what I would be feeling in their shoes. It's almost always spot on. But the thing is, that I don't realize that I'm doing it, until I'm talking it out with someone. "I think you're feeling X and Y, because of Z. That's how I would feel."
1	perceiving=not judging\n\nso perceiving means having a tertiary/inferior judging function (Fe or Te) when looking at function stacks
10	Chuck Palahniuk-	“You realize that our mistrust of the future makes it hard to give up the past. We can’t give up our concept of who we were. All those adults playing archaeologist at yard sales, looking for childhood artifacts, board games, CandyLand, Twister, they’re terrified. Trash becomes holy relics. Mystery Date. Hula Hoops. Our way of getting nostalgic for what we just threw in the trash, it’s all because we’re afraid to evolve. Grow, change, lose weight, reinvent ourselves. Adapt.”
1	Is it his way of describing the Fi-Si loop?
3	What the hell is a Magenter?	I'm curious what the correlation is between INFPs and liking the Rocky-Horror (late night double feature (fuck your teacher)) Picture Show.  \n\nMy guess is that it's pretty high.\n\n
2	I’ve heard about it, but it looked really weird so I avoided watching it. 
1	Never seen it before
