243	Your ISTJ Care and Handling User Guide and Manual.	**Congratulations!**\n\nYou have just selected your very own ISTJ Worker Unit. As our most popularly selected introverted unit you are sure to be satisfied with your very own ISTJ. If for any reason you are not satisfied, you are simply not being direct and clear enough with your ISTJ unit and that is your own damn fault. So that you may enjoy your unit to it’s fullest extent, your SJ overlords have included this handy guide.\n\n## Your ISTJ will come with the following accessories:\n\n* Six (6) plaid or solid-colored shirts  \n\n* Four (4) pairs of jeans (light blue, dark blue, black, and brown)  \n\n* One (1) belt that has been worn since high school and will be worn for however long it shall live. Because it works.  \n\n* Two (2) pairs of shoes - one for daily wear, one for dress  \n\n* Bonus sports shoes included with athletic upgrade  \n\n* One (1) set of tools and toolbox. Includes basic tools for routine maintenance and repairs to anything they purchased for more than $1000  \n\n* One (1) canine companion  \n\n* One (1) set of How-To Books  \n\n* One (1) duty-powered core reactor \[Warning: Slightly Radioactive\]  \n\n\n## Software\n\nYour ISTJ comes pre-programmed with the following traits;\n\n**Si:** Your ISTJ is acutely aware of personal impact and past precedent. This trait includes the ability to recall events and exchanges of personal significance with immense detail and clarity. This function allows your ISTJ to form memories with such detail that they are experienced as reliving the event. Because of this your ISTJ unit is uniquely sensitive to changes in it’s environment and people around it. Your ISTJ is also strongly aware of it’s own physical sensations and comfort as well as the physical comfort of those it is near.\n\n**Te:** Your ISTJ will act efficiently and effectively when interacting with it’s external environment. Your ISTJ is a skilled organizer, delegator and trouble shooter. This function targets waste and inefficiencies and eliminates them to ensure the system is running at it’s highest functional level.\n\n**Fi:** Your ISTJ may be taciturn, but it is equipped with deeply held values. Your ISTJ will have personal preferences and tastes that it is both very sure of and strongly attached to. This function is responsible for adding the unique variety to each ISTJ unit that is only accessible with regular use and interaction.\n\n**Ne:** Your ISTJ is prone to catastrophizing about the future due to the inferior placement of it’s Ne function. Your ISTJ will be resistant to change and new ideas and is likely to dislike discussing hypothetical situations because of the stress they can induce. In cases where your ISTJ unit’s Ne overpowers the dominant Si software, your unit may feel a need to destroy all current systems and structure and resort instead to individuality and anarchism.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Insert duty-powered core reactor into your ISTJ unit’s duty port (located between shoulder blades on back of unit)  \n\n2. Place ISTJ unit in an isolated area with included set of How-To Books\n3. Allow at least 2 hours of solitude for ISTJ to absorb information and charge\n4. Present ISTJ unit with included toolbox and a practical puzzle or problem in need of solution\n5. If your ISTJ unit does not activate after step 4, leave unit to charge overnight and try step 4 again\n6. If step 5 also fails, repeat step 4 again, but with included canine companion as well\n\n## Modes\n\nFix-It Mode (*default*) - When presented with a problem and reasonably assigned responsibility for solving said problem, your ISTJ will successfully fix or solve the problem assigned.\n\nChill Mode (*default*) - Active when ISTJ is alone or with a maximum of 2 pre-approved closely bonded companion units. Required for a minimum of 2 hours a day for optimum performance. While in this mode your ISTJ will have significantly subdued energy levels, little to no articulation, and will instead enjoy the company of included canine companion and silence.\n\nGet Shit Done Mode - Activated when assigned responsibility for completion of a set of tasks necessary to ensure continued harmony and operation of ISTJ’s life, work, and/or family. Involves only the minimum articulation necessary and zero (0) patience for unproductivity or waste.\n\nWhat Needs to be Done Mode - Activated when ISTJ determines that a particular task must be completed in order to ensure continued harmony or operation of a system or situation, but that said task is not being completed by the responsible parties, or is being completed poorly. Includes silent resentment towards the responsible parties, but successful completion of the task nonetheless. Repeated activation of What Needs to be Done Mode will result in your ISTJ unit’s refusal to help or participate in any future events or activities involving the responsible party.\n\nRighteous Indignation Mode - Activated by applying inaccurate statements or labels to ISTJ or by accusing ISTJ of making an error without providing evidence. May result in emotional outbursts.\n\nTry Something New Mode (*locked*) - Only unlockable with sufficient advanced notice and preparation. Your ISTJ unit is very capable of trying new things, but must be given adequate time to prepare by gaining more information first.\n\n## Relationships with Other Units\n\n**NF:** Generally fascinating and adored by your ISTJ unit, these units can also become annoying if they decide your ISTJ is in need of improvement.\n\n**NT:** Usually well tolerated and respected, but at times can seem overbearing or arrogant to your ISTJ unit.\n\n**SJ:** Well tolerated and most easily understood. Reliable units that can be called on for help if needed.\n\n**SP:** Interesting, but still quite confusing. These units seem to understand your ISTJ unit better than it understands them.\n\n## Feeding\n\nYour ISTJ unit will feed itself regularly and if asked kindly, will likely also feed other units if your ISTJ possesses greater cooking ability.\n\n## Grooming\n\nAs long as your ISTJ unit is not stuck in a Si-Fi loop, it will regularly groom itself without any prompting. Looping units may occasionally need to be locked in a bathroom and told to clean themselves.\n\n## Sleeping\n\nYour ISTJ unit will sleep when appropriate and necessary. Looping units may engage in too much sleep, but can usually be fixed by being presented with a puzzle in need of solving.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n*What is my ISTJ thinking?*\n\nMost of the time, your ISTJ is thinking about whatever was just happening, however sometimes (unbeknownst to ISTJ), they will be thinking about a past event so deeply that it feels as though it is the present.\n\n*How do I get ISTJ to talk to me?*\n\nThe easiest way to get your ISTJ to talk to you is to act it direct questions and wait for a response. Otherwise, your ISTJ will also respond to riddles.\n\n*Is my ISTJ stuck on repeat?*\n\nNo, your ISTJ has simply mastered it’s environment and found a routine that is perfectly suited. Your ISTJ will now adhere to this routine, often until long after it has ceased to be the most effective and efficient use of it’s time and environment.\n\n*How do I get my ISTJ to try a new method of doing something?*\n\nBy proving that the new method works better than the current method.\n\n**Again, Congratulations of your new ISTJ unit! Now go forth and fulfill your role!**
49	YOU'VE KILLED US, YOU'VE KILLED US ALL!
41	So accurate. Amazing. I may include this on future dating profiles. 
30	> Your ISTJ will be resistant to change and new ideas and is likely to dislike discussing hypothetical situations because of the stress they can induce. \n\nBut I would rather discuss these hypothetical worst case scenarios so I can figure out the best solution if it ever happens. Stressful as all hell but very satisfying if I do feel it would be solved. 
22	Could this become a sticky? \n\nu/rawtoast24
13	This was amusing to me.  A few things, though: \n\n>Six (6) plaid or solid-colored shirts\n\nI own 0 plaid or solid-colored shirts.  I do own something in the neighborhood of 30 T-shirts, but they all have logos, designs, or funny (to me, anyway) sayings on them.\n\n> Four (4) pairs of jeans (light blue, dark blue, black, and brown)\n\nThey make brown jeans?  How did I not know this?\n\n> One (1) belt that has been worn since high school and will be worn for however long it shall live. Because it works.\n\nI didn't start wearing a belt until after high school...\n\n> Two (2) pairs of shoes - one for daily wear, one for dress\n\nI have one pair of shoes.  I have no need of "dress" shoes.  If my Danner work boots aren't good enough for a place, I probably don't want to go there anyway.\n\n> One (1) canine companion\n\nNope.  Moar doggos!  At least 2.  They need someone to play with when I'm not there to play with them, cause, you know, work.\n\n> If step 5 also fails, repeat step 4 again, but with included canine companion as well\n\nImplies that you are to withhold canine companion from ISTJ. This is not recommended. Also, do not harm the canine companion, otherwise you might unlock John Wick mode, which is not recommended.
9	Amazing. \n\nEver since I saw the request for this I've been coming back to check if you guys were actually gonna do it. Definitely surprises the ISTP one and the ENFP one it was originally based off.\n\nYou should link it to the r/mbti folks so they too can stop asking dumb questions about ISTJs lol. That also might inspire other types to follow suit (I'd love to see an INFP one for example).
8	> Try Something New Mode (locked) - Only unlockable with sufficient advanced notice and preparation. Your ISTJ unit is very capable of trying new things, but must be given adequate time to prepare by gaining more information first.\n\nI was just thinking today "Hmmm, I should eat somewhere new this weekend. I guess I'm spontaneous now."
7	Brilliant and amusingly accurate haha. I also vote for this to be a sticky.
5	I giggled so hard at this. This so accurately describes my husband. I always joke with him either calling him a robot or a Vulcan. Though curiously enough I think my unit might have a malfunction, when I ask him what he's thinking about normally he defaults to 'Monkey Cymbals' which is something I would add to my list on top of 40 other things being an INFP.  Should I return him to the factory for inspection or does this happen occasionally? 
4	Sweet. 
4	This is awesome.  I do find that I get frustrated about dressing myself. I would like to wear the same thing every day and something practical, goddamnit!
3	Yep that’s me. Good job!
3	Gee, does this mean I have to get a dog to be a 'full ISTJ'??
3	God. Fucking. Damn.
2	Thanks to u/lioneaglegriffin for providing the [link](https://naughty-nanny.tumblr.com/post/139253802222/your-istj-care-and-handling-user-guide-and-manual/amp) to the source material.
2	So cute I love it!  Good job.
2	Also, in the faq part "act", I think, should be "ask".
2	Great post!
2	This is my bf to a "T", down to the one belt since highschool, shoes and companion oh my god
1	Whoa. That's really accurate. Thank you so much for this. It's gonna be useful for me when I'm asked to explain about myself!
1	Accurate and funny. I really enjoyed this.
1	Hi guys, I'm starting a GoFundMe so that I can purchase my very own ISTJ unit. I've never had one and I think one would be very beneficial, except every time I've gotten near an ISTJ unit, I get the distinct impression I am not adored in any way! Is there a refund policy if my ISTJ unit treats me with contempt? How can I get an ISTJ unit to appreciate my differences without trying to mold me into a fellow ISTJ unit?
1	So you guys are basically mentats. That's really neat.
1	This is scarily accurate! Well done! My only critique is that I do own more than two pairs of shoes. ;) 
1	Why is this accurate 
1	Spot on mate, I'm forwarding this to all of my handlers
7	ISTJ trying to find an affectionate and outgoing partner, but knows when to give space	Where would I find this type of person? I find myself very drawn to people who are confident in themselves, very loving and affectionate person and does not get scared or hesitant when I get annoyed or mad. This person can go about their day without having to connect with me 24/7 yet still be very loving as if we haven’t seen each other. Does this person exist??
3	You are saying this because the people who are loving and affectionate tend to get hurt when you need downtime, and they need to stay in touch 24/7..\n
1	Find another introvert 
1	I’m an INFP in a relationship with an ISTJ. I think on the whole we work very well together, but I do tend to be a little more sensitive than he would probably like, and I take things personally when I probably shouldn’t. The perceived/judges aspects of our personalities don’t seem to clash much because I think we meet close to the middle there. So maybe an INTJ would be a good match for you? 
1	You need to set up expectations and let them understand the need for space explicity. Don't expect people to magically read your mind, or be mature if they're obviously not in that stage of their life yet.
1	Sounds like you want another ISTJ
1	Find yourself an ISFP. :)\n\nI've seen ISTJs in very happy relationships with INTPs and with ISFPs, and ISFPs are more independent and less clingy ppl. So... \n\nI'm an INTP in a soulmate type relationship with an adorable ISTJ, but I break her precious solitude out of nowhere sometimes, she seems to not mind me doing that, but she has specifically asked me to stop a couple of times!\n\nThe ISTJ-ISFP couple are just fantastic together, but i don't really know about their situation. I'd assume with the amount of visible love between them, either what concerns you doesn't happen often, or the ISTJ husband doesn't mind her intruding! 
1	yes, they're called ambiverts
0	Sounds like my bf, to be honest. He ranked as INTJ but definitely is more ambiverted.
4	My (f19) ISTJ dad (m56) is depressed. Should my mom(f56) and I travel without him?	Note: My dad is ISTJ, my mom ENFP and Im INFJ\n\n My dad has dysthymia. Since a few months he is taking antidepressants. He was unwilling to take the medication as he thinks that psychology is nonsense and he had weird views on mental ilnesses in general.But he is still definitely not cured. He is an underemployed university lecturer (only a few hours a week).My mom and I try to encourage him to try to switch to a real job, so he does something useful instead of just playing computer chess. But we haven’t had success on that one yet.\n\nNow my mom suggested that she would like to take a small trip just me and her for a few days, maybe to the mountains or somewhere else. Currently my mom feels very tired and frustrated with his slow healing process. We have done this once before he started taking antidepressants. And we sometimes visit my moms extended family together.\n\nIn any case my dad, my mom and I will have a vacation on Easter.On the one hand my mom and I are both free right now and I would really enjoy to spend a few days away from my life. But on the other hand I am afraid my dad could be upset and/or become a bit more depressed about this. What do you think? \n\n**TL;DR: My mom suggested that I should travel with her without my depressed dad.** 
5	Honestly, I think your dad would enjoy a break from you two just as much as you'd enjoy a break from him.\n\nI can't speak for your dad, but as an introvert having solitude is a necessity. 
2	I need to state up front that this advice only comes from my own experience and I'm wary of saying anyone should do anything in particular when dealing with a depressed person.  So, you should only take this as one opinion to consider while you make the final decision yourself.  If you're worried that your dad will hurt himself, absolutely do not leave him alone.  With that said:\n\nI think your dad might find solace in being alone but still draws support from you and your mom being nearby.  You and your mom need to take care of yourselves (the healing process is hard on everyone) so a trip would be a great way to get away from it all. During that trip, your dad would benefit from still being called once or twice a day to know you're still thinking about him.  It'll help him maintain the sense of passive support he likely gets from your mere presence.  \n\nBring home some pictures to share with him.  He really needs to know that you care and that would be one way to show him that you were thinking about him (I don't think us ISTJs typically like souvenirs as much as things that engage our senses, like pictures and videos).\n\nGetting him a full-time job will go a long way towards helping him in my armchair-psychologist opinion.  ISTJs do have a tendency to be driven by routine and work, plus it'll give him a sense of meaning/purpose in his life.  You already seem to know this but I thought I'd reiterate it anyway.  I hope you find success on this front!\n\n**TL,DR:** Go on the trip but call him once or twice a day while you're gone.  Bring home pictures, videos, or other sensory experiences to share your trip with him when you're back.
2	As an ISTJ, while being asked to travel feels like a lot of work, I would appreciate a change in scenery and get some freedom away from home. Perhaps take him with you, make him feel important by letting him take charge. If there’s a place you and your mom wants to go to, like what the other said, let him navigate. He needs to know and feel useful to you, but I honestly think getting him out of that chair will do the works.
2	I’m an ENFP (37f) and I was married to an ISTJ (40m) who struggles with depression. Leaving him alone to work shit out on his own was never effective. Because an ISTJ is an upside down ENFP, they still like positive distractions to keep them from a negative downward spiral. Also, ISTJs are acts of service oriented people who enjoy having a purpose. They like to be needed and they need a job and some physical activity to be fulfilled. Try to talk him into coming with you two. “Dad, we NEED you to help us navigate during the trip, and we NEED you to help chop wood and start a fire.” Something like that. I’m sure your mom needs some time away from the grumpy depressed guy too, but I’ve learned that running away from his depression and anxiety doesn’t fix my own problems, it just creates more cycles of depression. She deserves to get away too! But this trip isn’t the best time to leave him to stew in his misery. 
1	It's only a few days. Leave his miserable ass at home because you guys need some mental health time just like he does. If he's the problem, leave the problem at home,hell be fine. 
1	Reading this breaks my heart for all of you. \n\nI can understand the need to get away from the pressure/burden of taking care of someone with a mental illness - because your mental health is important too! But its important they know they are not are burden, no matter how stubborn or hard to work with they are. They need help.\n\nA few years ago, a friend of mine could not convince her depressed ISTJ husband to go on trips with her. She really wanted to go to disney so she just started going alone. She finally convinced him one time, and he couldnt help but enjoy himself. Now they go twice a year, own a time share, and they look forward to it all the time. Its brightened his world immensely!\n\nIf you and your mom need this trip for yourselves, i say take it. However, make sure you market this trip as a "girls thing" so he cant resent the fact that you go without him. And consider what you can do for hom as well - is there a trip to a place he might benefit from?
5	Political preference for ISTJs?	I don't want to create unnecessary discord, but I'm just curious to see where my ISTJ friends lie on the political spectrum. Do you think there is a correlation between personality types and political affiliation? Personally, I'm pretty conservative.
17	Perhaps not. Liberal AF.
4	No
6	Conservative/Libertarian\n\nThere's a correlation between certain big 5 personality traits and political leanings, but I don't think there's a correlation with mbti.
9	Definitely a liberal. Becoming more so as I age. 
9	Liberal/progressive. 
5	Centrist because you can't be too extreme either way, that means you're using bias to agree on a subject instead of looking at things objectively.\n\nAligning to a political ideology shouldn't be clear cut as it is in bipartisan democracy, but hey people like being on a team. 
2	I'm a classical liberal, don't know if there is any correlation to my personality type
2	I would like the chance to vote for someone who is authentic, trustworthy and represents the well being of the middle class. If this person existed in either party I would vote for them. I think we put too much focus on the politicians and their parties though. It’s the big corporations and their lobbyists who need to be replaced. They’re the ones running the show.
2	Liberal. Used to lean centrist when I was younger. I don't think it has to do with MBTI, but with what we value most. Bias is inescapable.
2	Liberal-leaning centrist, I guess. I'm for gay rights and such, but I also recognize conservatives bring up a couple of valid points too.
3	Fiscal conservative, and I support traditional gender roles in the home. I like the idea of legalizing, taxing and regulating all drugs and prostitution. I believe we’re a sovereign nation with the right to protect our borders. I guess I’m a conservative with libertarian leanings. \n\nI like tradition, which is a known ISTJ trait so these beliefs are fitting. 
1	I'm conservative, leaning libertarian and OK with some moderation for the sake of practicality
1	centre left. 
1	I registered as an Independent voter but my beliefs mostly align with Libertarian.
1	Fiscal conservative libertarian.\nDon what the fuck you wanna do, just do it with your money. Not the tax payers. Please and thank you. 
1	Libertarian/Conservative/Old-School Liberal\n\nI know thats a lot, but i feel a lot a ways about a lot of things
0	Fascist/NatSoc
-2	Yes. I’ve been primarily a republican because I value rules and laws over feelings (something I don’t see from my democratic counterparts)
-1	White nationalist
2	Hard time reading ISTJ, help please	Hello, I’m ESFP (f/27) and recently an ISTJ (m/36) caught my interest (just a few weeks ago). I’ve dated ISTJ and ESTJ before and in my experience they really stare you down when they like you. This new guy though goes to my gym, and when we talk he will barely make eye contact with me. I feel like he is internally having a panic attack and just gets very awkward. This is to the point where I have tried to end our conversations early just to relieve him of the awkwardness. I don’t want to force someone to talk to me if they just want me to go away. Every time I do this though he finds 100 more things to talk about and keep the conversation going. For example, I tried to make my exit after a 10 minute convo and he ended up talking for another hour and obviously trying to be funny—but looked past me the whole time. I have never experienced this before. I cannot read him at all. \n\nDo ISTJ do this when they don’t like someone but want to be polite, or when they do like someone and don’t know how to act? I don’t want to be full on high energy, touchy, talkative ESFP on him if he’s not into it, but I also know from experience that an ISTJ could hide their feelings for decades if they felt it was necessary. \n\nJust wanted to get some opinions before I go too deep into my analysis. Not really into making an ass of myself at the gym that I have to return to on a daily basis. 
3	I don't think he wants you to go away. Maybe he is also interested in you, since he tried to talk to you for another hour. Furthermore, him barely making eye contact can mean nervousness. \n\nHonestly, keep talking to him but maybe invite him to a more "private" place outside of the gym.
2	We do this when we like someone, but are nervous and unsure of ourselves. We are introverts so we sometimes need a lot of encouragement before we can relax and communicate openly and easily. Then watch out! :) Also, I would never talk for over an hour with someone that I didn't like, I would kindly end the conversation.
1	If I'm in a busy place, I don't tend to keep eye contact. I'm always looking around, checking things out, making sure everything is OK, multitasking, or whatever. Go somewhere less busy. And don't try to read us. We're not books. We're really overt so don't waste time trying to flip through our pages. We don't have any. 
17	What are you like when you're drunk?	Some friends prefer me drunk... I get super touchy-feely and silly, make everyone laugh and feel good, then regret it. Drinking ends up depressing me. I feel like it can be a crutch to my social skills, so I haven't had anything to drink in over a year.\n\nDo you think drunk you is the "real" you? I think it opens the floodgates to a side of me that I prefer to let people see over time.
10	I'm a little more goofy/outgoing, but like you, I'm not a fan. I don't go wild like some friends, just a bit more talkative basically. The first (and only time) I've drank to where I thought I was drunk, I just got sleepy and ended up going to bed. Might have had something to do with the vibe of the place I was at as well though 
9	Im relaxed and funny. A little mouthy, in a fun way. What little filter I have is 100% gone and ppl think im joking when I'm not, which is cool. I don't get wild and crazy or anything and I've never done anything I regretted. I have chronic migraines and realized that migraines are a lot like hangovers so I dont worry about drinking the night before I go to work. Seems like if I'm gonna get a headache I might as well earn the damn thing. 
6	Tired. Straight to bed early!
7	I turn into an ENFP. So yes, i definitely turn into the version of myself you dont get to see unless youve known me for a very long time.
5	When I drink, I actually shut down completely. I find a corner, stay there, talk to no one.
6	I couldn't say.  I haven't been drunk since I was a toddler.  Evidently it was hilarious, though.
5	Rarely get drunk. Make some inappropriate jokes and laugh louder than usual. Nothing crazy
4	My ISTJ is usually reserved and quiet, but when he’s drunk, he’s SOOOOOO loud and grabby. It’s fun if I’m also drinking, but it’s annoying if I’m not. 
4	Touchy, more ily’s. Very happy or sad depending what initial mood I am in. Like a cuddle bear really. 
3	I laugh a lot. Like, sitting on the floor in underwear and guffawing over anything and nothing at once. \n\nI also snore very loudly.
4	Sleepy and dizzy. Hate it.
3	I actually feel much better in social settings with 1-2 drinks in me. My internal filter drops and I can socialize without overthinking everything. I get really uncomfortable in large groups if I think I have too much, that’s only happened once. Now I limit myself to that 1-2. 
3	I generally avoid getting drunk, but the last time I did I annoyed my husband a little because I wouldn't shut up. I generally don't prattle on and on.\n\nAlso the drunk me can't be the real me, because drunk me is less intelligent. But she is more open with the right people.
3	When I am drunk or even tipsy, I am a lot hornier. I also get a lot more confidence and actually flirt more when inebriated. Friends had also told me I'm a lot more open, touchy, and goofy. \n\n\nI also feel sad when shit does not go my way.
3	I don't drink. The thought of getting drunk and not fully being in control of myself doesn't appeal to me.
3	Where can you usually find ISTJs?	I think that I’ve probably run into them a lot, given that they are so common, especially among men. However, I can’t pinpoint any I know personally. Where could I usually find them. What do they usually do?
10	I’m often found in my house...\n\nMaybe at a concert\n\nHiking...\n\nOut with close friends maybe at a Friendly’s.\n\nNo place too crazy.
9	Home. Work. Bookstores. Target. Running outdoors. The occasional concert.
7	Find me at: home, grocery stores, home supply stores, thrift shops, coffee/tea shops, concerts, out doing something active, parks/beaches, museums, hip new spots, and libraries. Basically, anywhere I don't have to talk to strangers for extended periods of time... you might not find me because I move quickly... lol
6	I like being comfortable so usually some place relaxed and quiet like my house. I'm also studying a lot bc I'm in college. If I do go out, it's usually a place pretty relaxed. Dont have much desire to go to clubs or bars either, but I'll go if my friends really want me to. I'm usually pretty tired after parties.
3	Home. Work. School. High end bar or crying somewhere 
2	Wherever I need to be....
1	You'll find me at work in the HR Department, having to put my foot down most of the time. 
-2	Idk, church, probably. (Don't take this answer too seriously.)
3	ISTJs, what are your Clifton Strengthsfinder results?	I am curious if any other ISTJs share similar top 5 strengths. To start things off, here are mine:\n\n1. Analytical\n2. Deliberative\n3. Harmony\n4. Responsibility\n5. Learner\n\nIf you don't know what the Clifton Strengthsfinder is: it is a **paid** test that is supposed to show one what their top strengths are out of 34 possible options. It is also designed so one can build their strengths in order to lead a more successful and more satisfying life. Here is the link to the test: [https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/)
2	I took it about 6 years ago and I got:\n\n* Responsibility\n* Restorative\n* Individualization\n* Ideation\n* Delibrative
2	1. Analytical \n\n2. Learner\n\n3. Focus\n\n4. Restorative\n\n5. Achiever 
2	Focus, futuristic, analytical, and significance. 
2	ISTJ here. Did this at work a while back. \n\n1. consistency (execution)\n2. context (strategy) \n3. restorative (execution)\n4. deliberative (execution)\n5. connectedness (relationships) 
2	Individualization, Futuristic, Learner, Analytical, Ideation
2	Achiever (executing)\n\nIntellection (strategic thinking)\n\nResponsibility (executing)\n\nLearner (strategic thinking)\n\nInput (strategic thinking)
8	Trying to understand ISTJs	Hi guys,\n\nSo I’m an ENFJ and have had some, let’s say, less than easy dealings with ISTJs over the years. I’m your typical NF in many ways: I’m open minded, look for the positive in people, think in terms of emotions, emotionally expressive, care about people, people pleaser, all that good stuff. And while I don’t think I know any ISTJs in my inner circle, I suspect that many of the people that I have had a hard time with are ISTJs. \n\nI got interested in the MBTI a couple of years ago and it has really opened my eyes to a lot of things about myself and others around me (including ISTJs). I’ve been reading a lot about you guys and I really want to understand how you think. I’m a liberal arts grad and very much also interested in psychology, so I very often try to relate to others by understanding who they are and how they think. \n\nI really would like to fully appreciate you guys for who you are and how you think. I have tried reading the cognitive functions test to better understand ISTJs, but I think it might help if one of you explains it to me. \n\nCould you explain how you guys think? What do you guys value? Where can I find you? What annoys you? How can I best approach you? \n\nThanks\n\n\n\n
23	Here's a little about me - \n\nI rely a lot on past experiences to predict outcomes of similar situations.\n\nI thrive in routine, the more regular and regimented the better.\n\nI dislike wishy-washy answers, preferring solid facts.\n\nFacts don't care about your feelings and generally neither do I. No offense.\n\nI strive for lethal efficiency.\n\nI work best alone or as part of a very small team, 2-3 at most.\n\nI dislike managing people.\n\nI am fiercely loyal.\n\nIf you come to me - come to me with facts and solutions to problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes this help?
11	There has to be structure in everything that I do, and there must always be some sort of (even if it’s loosely based) plan to any sort of trip, approach, or project I’m doing. I consider myself to be open minded to new ideas, but ISTJs could be considered the most stubborn of the personalities because, if we’ve already done it efficiently (which we probably already have) that way is foolproof and should be done every time, guaranteeing a flawless outcome. There’s little room for spontaneity. For example, my boyfriend is an INTP and he is an amazing cook. Will never follow a recipe, but can make some amazing food just throwing things together, that’s just how his brain works. This drives me insane. I’m more of a baker, as in I will always follow a recipe, to the T, and whatever I’m baking will always turn out the way I expect it to, every time. And I’ll more than likely use the same recipe for whatever it is until the day I die. Probably a shitty analogy, but whatever.\n\nI also loathe when people are late, or forget things, especially if it is habitual.\n\nI think that ISTJs are somewhat perfectionists, and of something doesn’t turn out perfectly, we will blame ourselves (even if it’s in no way shape or form out fault) and berate ourselves for not being able to hammer it in to perfection. I’ve had a couple of ‘catastrophe modes’, and they’re not pretty. It’s very hard to come out of it, because all we’re thinking is ‘if it’s not perfect there’s no point’. \n\nI do not like managing other people or telling others what to do. I am a good co-pilot or assistant manager, but I only enjoy being responsible for myself. \n\nWhen it comes to emotions, I do not like talking about them or explaining them. \n\nISTJs are determined, stubborn, and loyal. Not good romantic partners, though. 
5	Please remember that all ISTJs are different and unique. Even if an ISTJ doesn't portray or show emotion, that doesn't mean they don't have feelings. While I cannot speak of others, for me my emotions are the initial motivation for action. I strongly care about those close to me, and therefore I am motivated to work hard at whatever I do. \n\nSince my job doesn't require a lot of emotive energy, I don't display much of it (I am an engineer). Some I work with may take that as me being a douche/jerk/etc, but that's far from the truth. My entire day is motivated by my emotional drive to do a good job. As I have gotten older I have learned to have more emotive conversational qualities and not take myself too serious, but I have worked with ISTJs that are older and still give off an off-putting air. \n\nReally ISTJs (in general) are task driven "duty fulfillers". I am sure others here would agree that they value those with strong ethics (even when they don't align with their own), annoyed with those that waste their time with non-realistic what-ifs, and have only a select few hobbies that they share with even a smaller group of friends. \n\nIf someone were to approach me (at work since thats where I am lot of the time) would be: "Hey "darth_haterade, I have this problem that I am trying to solve and think you could help me." \n\nClear as mud? 
5	- I reminisce about the past a lot\n\n- I'm serious, most of the time\n\n- I'm private with my life. I don't post on social media often compared to my peer group.\n\n- I like to observe first then engage\n\n- I need a decent amount of down time (aka loneliness time) after exhausting myself\n\n- I want stability and happiness the minimum.\n\n-  I hate drama.\n\n- I use past experiences as a guide to what to do present time \n\n- I hate when people are 15+ minutes late unless they have a valid excuse. \n\n- I do what I say and say what I mean. I hate playing these silly mind games.\n\n- I suck at flirting\n\n- I always come early/on time for all commitments\n\n- I don't mind drinking, smoking, and partying. Just not every fucking day or 3+ times a week. Moderation is the best.\n\n- Very critical of family members and friends\n\n- I feel like every time I feel a positive emotion it feels forced and not natural\n\n- I respect all opinions and try to understand all sides. However that does not mean I immediately like their opinions.\n\n- Registered as an Independent voter\n\n- I need some structure/plan. Logisitcs are amazing.\n\n- I don't like gift giving. Never understood it. Not to mention my parents ruined it for me. \n\n- If you want me to tell a story or about an experience, I'll take a while cause I like to be as detailed as possible.\n\n- It's easy for me to be overwhelmed in situations I never been before. I eventually engage.\n\n- I do take crazy risks from time to time.
3	Hey friend! Im an INFJ who tends to get wrapped up in ISTJs. My man of 8 years is an ISTJbut we are divorcing this year.  Not from hate,  but we just realize we are very very different people. \n\nI love ISTJs for their simplicity, honesty,  and logical thinking. Ive only realized now though that I'm not a freak and that there are other people who think and feel like i do.  He has tried so hard to understand my vagueness or grandness over the years but now he knows he will be happier with someone a little less volatile.  We will definitely stay buddies.
2	Where you say you have a positive attitude about things and look for the positive and all, I have a huge neutral approach and attitude and all. My neutral territory is like the bell curve and it'll take at least 2 standard deviations to make it out of "neutral territory" so most ppl aren't "friends" they're "ppl I know" and the same for ppl on the opposite end of the spectrum. It takes a whole lot to get me upset and I vary rarely get what I would call "angry" and those (any emotions really) emotions last a very short period of time (were talking minutes). I don't think I've ever been "elated" in my life and I can't think of anything that would make me that way. Very strong emotions are true outliers and downright uncomfortable. 
2	I work in an urgent care. 
2	Istjs are the worst match for enfj due to that blind fe so it rubs your fe dominant the wrong way and sadly thats somehow true \n\nIm not an istj but an isfj and i can speak for this because i have an istj friend whos like this. When my enfj bff tells stories, my istj friend gets annoyed because he's not being specific with his stories. She s nice too but thats just the way she is lol\n\n
1	Here's a tip to understanding us: be really specific. For example, asking me how ISTJs think is too vague. I don't know where to begin to answer that. Ask really specific questions and you'll get good answers.
10	Do other types ever find you condescending?	My boss is an ISTJ and very good with certain things (like spreadsheets, and other fact-based things). However, sometimes he gets tunnel vision and really can't see the forest for the trees and gets really caught up on if something is 100% literally factual or not. He's an editor and I'm a science writer. When I turn in pieces to him, he will often compare the two versions and try to point out discrepancies as if catching me in a lie and then use that as a jumping board to say that I have to turn in a factual story, etc. The thing is, none of these stories are wildly inaccurate (and my ESTP coworker has had more beefs with him on this than me so I know it's not just me), it's just that some things turn out to need a little tweak here and there with language to make it more accurate. But I believe that this is part of the revision and editing process. But when he talks to me about them, it feels like he's trying to corner me and shame me into feeling like I did something terribly wrong. And sometimes he will be so stubborn about one of his edits when I try to make the point to him that another way of wording something is better that it feels like I'm talking to a stone wall and I feel completely shut down. He won't even consider what I'm trying to say and immediately goes in with a rebuttal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is up with this? Is this common amongst ISTJs? Have you ever been told you come off this way? Does he mean to make me feel this way? Am I misinterpreting? Or this completely by accident? Or is this not an ISTJ thing? What is he thinking?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!!
11	MY INTP friends ALWAYS points out how condescending I am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI try not to be...
10	I have been told multiple times I come across as condescending.  I like accuracy, I get frustrated when people (repeatedly) don't follow instructions, and I get very frustrated when people are less-than-competent and try to overcompensate by being overly "friendly" or social.
6	I think we like to be factual above all else.  My favorite ISTJ quote:\n\n“You are not entitled to your opinion. You are entitled to your informed opinion. No one is entitled to be ignorant.”\n\n― Harlan Ellison
2	When I give out constructive criticism, I mostly come across as condescending (even when I don't intend to be) to people who aren't familiar with me because I usually deliver it in a straightforward manner. This is a very typical ISTJ trait and we actually make for very good editors and auditors due to our extra careful attention to detail. We're also mostly fixated with the status quo particularly if it's been working very well for the longest time, unless anyone can convincingly debunk that with solid proofs and explanations (this explains your boss' stubbornness especially if he's a veteran in your industry). Trust me, we expect the same candor when we're asking for criticism so don't take it personally. Maybe you can try writing your opinions to your boss next time so you'd actually have a chance to present them rather than expressing them verbally where he can just cut you off mid sentence. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work in the beauty industry and regularly deal with customers firsthand so I've learned to dial down my blunt-ness as it's commonly misconstrued as condescending especially when I deal with women a lot. Even with this conscious effort of reducing the very strong Judgment factor in my personality, it still seeps through the cracks and I'm occasionally called as strict and rigid. I find that I develop relationships with male friends easily too because they appreciate my "say what you mean, mean what you say" approach. I usually come off as intimidating to most females hence I only have a few girlfriends. 
2	Doesn't sound MBTI related TBH.
1	I’m not an ISTJ but my SO is and he is EXTREMELY condescending. I often find myself saying things like, “Yep, you’re right. I’m just an idiot. /s”
1	My brother is ISTJ. I am INTJ. Yes, we are both condescending. :)
1	Stop being dumb, and do it the right way= problem solved. \n\nJk\n\nBut I think what would work on me \n\n“I hear ya. And get your point. But since I am the one writing this, I specifically chose to say it this way. To get MY point across. But I appreciate the feedback. 
1	I've been called pedantic many, many times.  My one member of my PhD committee was pissed when I corrected him on terminology on the field.  So, yeah...
1	So I'm going to devil's advocate for a minute here, and for the record, I agree that the feedback you're getting could and *should* be presented in a better way. \n\nLooking at this from your editor's point of view, he's been placed in a position of trust where his role in this is making sure that the stories you print aren't wrong. In his mind, this position of trust requires that things are printed how *he sees* them as accurate, and he is duty-bound to correct what he sees as errors. He might be frustrated with you and your coworker(s) because you're putting him in a spot where he has to fight you over how things are worded in order to ensure accuracy, most people don't put their pants on in the morning looking forward to fights at work.  \n\nAs an aside, I had to learn to deliver feedback too because I used to come across as confrontational when people couldn't see things the way I needed them to. \n\nI would approach this with your boss in terms of efficacy - let him know that there is a way to provide feedback to you that will get better results, which he will probably be glad to know. No one in a position to lead or supervise others should take joy in making the folks they're supervising feel bad or frustrated, you're on the same team and are working towards shared goals. Make sure you do this at a time when you're feeling calm, if you start with "you're a bad boss and suck at giving feedback, do it this way instead, moron," you won't get very good results.  \n\nBest of luck, I'm sure your boss isn't trying to come across this way, and probably isn't even aware that it's making you feel the way it is. 
1	I get it usually. It's due to tone and directness though I absolutely say it without any kind of intent to be condescending.
9	What are some hobbies you enjoy and why?	
17	Cars, games, financial analyzing, studying and crying  
12	Cars, computers, video games, lifting weights, and snowboarding 
8	Games like dungeons and dragons. It's a both a structured and creative way to socialize.
5	Martial arts, pottery, playing guitar and hiking. The former 3 can take a lifetime to master. I really like things that fall into this category.\n\nSee: [Jiro Dreams of Sushi](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772925/)
5	Guitar - once you learn a few chords and strumming patterns, you can play so many songs that it's fun until you can learn the harder ones. Practicing at something and feeling the improvement on a regular basis (when you actually practice lmao) is a great feeling.\n\nRunning - Same with guitar, it's only really fun once you start being able to go long and fast IMO. Trying to get back into running this spring. It's also particularly fun for me because I'm tall and lean.\n\nDnD - I play with a group of people on an almost weekly basis and it's fun being creative with your character. I also like the idea of an entire world being built from one person's creative drive (and our DM seems pretty into it).\n\nGaming.\n\nA few minor things: Learning another language is cool but so much work. I learned to juggle (just 3 balls) recently and that was surprisingly easy. More people should give it a go, it's a big reward:effort ratio becase it's easy to learn and seems impressive because not many people can do it. I'm also trying to learn how to do a standing backflip and a handstand. And play the harmonica. I've also been bowling a lot recently with a friend and it's a lot of fun trying to put in effort to get better, especially because I've never taken bowling very seriously as a sport. I guess you could say learning minor talents here and there is one of my hobbies.\n\nI've been wanting to get into martial arts and bouldering (I used to climb trees all the time as a kid).
5	Fishing (I’m incredibly patient), gaming and lifting. 
4	^(Disclaimer - ISTJ female here, hello)\n\nReading: I love getting lost in stories and escaping for a bit, but I don't like to sit and read as it doesn't make me feel productive enough. Enter audiobooks and my other hobbies that I pursue while listening to audiobooks so I don't feel like I'm wasting time. Keeps me from overthinking and gives me something to focus on.\n\nOrigami: This is almost a mindless pursuit of mine now. I've memorized several forms and can fold them without paying too much attention. I enjoy the process and the beautiful results. Plus, jars of origami stars make for great 'heartfelt' gifts.\n\nGaming: I play mostly relaxing games like Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, and SimCity. I like the feeling of control that comes from shaping the worlds in these games.\n\nColoring: Helps me 'be productive' when my depression gets bad, and clears my mind when the anxiety gets bad.\n\nBaking: I love using freshly baked goods as a social interaction starter. It's a way to make sure that I don't have to go to people and that they come to me. An introverted win. But again, the process is enjoyable and it fills my home with wonderful smells. (I've been branching into bread lately and wow does it smell fucking good.)\n\nCleaning/Organizing: I don't know about anyone else, but I want my space to be under my control. I enjoy the visual aspect of a clean space that's curated to my tastes. There's also a joy in ridding myself of things I no longer need/things that were taking up space that could be otherwise used more efficiently.\n\nGardening: This is something I'm trying to get myself into more. Plants bring a sense of liveliness to me, and I love the feeling of getting lost in a sea of bright green. I've kept several indoor plants that bring an extra something special my space. I'm currently trying to move more into outdoor gardening 1.) to spruce up my yard so that it's not the eyesore of the neighborhood, 2.) to grow fruits and vegetables that I can eat/give to those close to me, 3.) to make myself go outside more. I'm an absolute hermit, what can I say?
3	Linux, its a puzzle, and I enjoy solving them. 
3	-Playing bass/guitar and writing music, or trying to at least\n\n-DnD and worldbuilding.\n\n-Videogames. Warframe, rocket league, and R6 siege are my most played.\n\n-Tabletop games. Magic the gathering is super fun with a bunch of friends.\n\n-Reading. I love big fantasy novels :)\n\n-Podcasts. Love having one on while working / housework / playing a chill game like Warframe or viscera clean up detail xD
3	Bowling: it is just relaxing to me
2	Rubik’s cubes. Learning and memorizing algorithms; repetition. Joy of solving. 
2	Running & road cycling - The exercise helps me clear my thoughts and anxiety, it keeps me in good shape. It's basically the only way I hang out with other people, so it helps me be a little more social.\n\nReading - I read fiction for entertainment. I love thrillers, adventure and a little fantasy.\n\nHouseplants - I guess I'd call it a hobby. I enjoy taking care of my indoor plants and seeing them grow and flourish. \n\nBoard games - my husband (an ISTJ also) and I are homebodies but we enjoy playing games. We have some that are silly/mindless and others that take more skill. Sometimes we play just to kill some time. 
1	Knitting and reading
1	Crocheting : I can do it mostly be feel. It's passive stimulation for bored hands and I can watch TV while doing a simple project. If I'm doing something complicated, it occupies my mind when I'm anxious.\n\nQuilting : its a skill I'm developing so I can see progress which makes me feel good. Takes a shit ton of planning before I even start, which is satisfying. You can see a large amount of progress in a short amount of time. And it satisfies the tediousness of my personality. 
0	\-creating and implementing systems, mainly financial and life organization\n\n\-gym\n\n\-practicing and deepening my faith.
-12	Farting. Because it smells of rainbows.
6	Do you guys find babies cute ?	
11	Only mine. Most others can fuck right off. 
10	Humans? No. They remind me of those mandrake roots in Harry Potter. \n\nFelines, canines, otters, etc? Abso-fucking-lutely!
10	No they look like wrinkly bags of skin that shit pee and cry. 
10	Not really, but I’m childfree so that probably skews my perspective a bit. 
7	No. Never. They aren’t. 
6	occasionally yeah \n\nside note: but I don’t really want kids in the future 
3	Definitely yes! It’s walking and talking children I’m not here for.
3	Not really. Puppies are much cuter. (I'm Female)
3	The cute ones are cute. Some are ugly.
2	Sure. 
2	Human babies no. Sometimes they can be cute once they have moved past the useless sack of meat stage and can start walking around and being useful. 
2	No
2	No. (33 y/o ISTJ female)
4	Is water wet? Babies are sooo cute...until the crying and diaper stuff
1	Yes
1	Not usually. Sometimes there's one that's just adorable, but that's rare. 
1	Yes. I used to think they were cute but didn’t even kind of want one. Then one day it clicked and I got baby fever and wanted one really bad. I honestly used to think I’d never want one. But now I’m almost 4 months pregnant ;)
4	what makes you feel supported & loved when you have a shitty day?	i know this is person-dependent, to some extent, but am curious about y'alls answers. from nf partners, too, how do you best support your istj partner during their rough times? \n\nthanks!
10	Personally, alone time. Speaking with loved ones and letting them know that I have had a rough day and would like to have time alone to listen to music, watch a show, or play a game. Distract myself for an hour to decompress then talk with them once I feel more   \n like normal. Getting that alone time and having ones that respect that lets me know that they care.
7	When my wife hands me a drink and takes care of cooking dinner. All without pressuring me to talk about my day. And if I do need to vent, she listens without trying to fix the problem or give me any sort of pep talk. 
4	I dont like talking about my day right away. I like it when I can just have some quiet time and lay down, usually in bed. I like it when my partner is next to me but just doing their own thing and not bugging me. After I have settled down I usually go roll over to them and just want to relax and cuddle with them. Just takes me some time to get myself together.
3	ISTJ here. I love it when my partner quietly runs his hands up and down my back. The whole hand, palms, fingers, thumbs. Not masseuse style. Just the weight of his hand rubbing the back. 
2	Beer.   Red or amber ales.  Stouts with coffee or chocolate flavors (or both).  \n\nFor really bad days:  Scotch.
13	ISTJ, I beg you, just return my favorite book	When it comes to sentimental possessions – what is the deal?! I know this sub is overrun with ISTJ former lovers. Sorry to add to it. You are WONDERFUL, mostly. \n\nMy ex, an ISTJ, has one of my favorite books of all time. I’d like him to pop it in the mail. How can I ask him to do it without seeming like I’m looking for a way to reconnect? Previously, even when I was very straightforward, he’s made incorrect assumptions and tries to read between the lines. Even when I’m just communicating matter of factly.\n\nThe reason why I’m overthinking the transaction is because I really really want the book – without getting looped into any other back-and-forth.\n\nI have notes in the margins, highlighted portions. So that copy is way more valuable to me than a crisp, new one. When I let him borrow it, I explained that it was sentimental. Right now, he has a backlog of books to read for work and it’s not a priority at all.\n\n&#x200B;
27	In plain English.\n\n"Hey - please send me my book back".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe tend to respond well to directness.
12	"Look I'm not tryna reconnect, all I want is my book back. Thanks."
4	I considered writing a long sarcastic reply about creating nuclear fusion capacitors but instead Ill just say....\n\nDont make it complicated just ask for the book back... Or... Theres always Amazon.
7	He won’t read into it. \n\nJust say: “I’d like to get my copy of [book] back, should I pick it up or would you prefer to mail it back to me?”\n\nThe end. 
3	Hey a-hole, send me my damn book\n\nThat should make it clear
2	Do you have a mutual friend that can get the book for you?
1	Just ask for it back. And stop contacting him for anything afterwards. 
0	Send him a box with a return shipping label inside, tell him he has a deadline of a week and if he still hasn't returned it get the cops involved.
1	Is it a limited edition/first pressing book or something? I’m curious as to why you haven’t just replaced it.
0	Survey on Personality and Flirting behaviors	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
3	Didn't you submit this same thread a little over a week ago? \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/atzblc/survey_on_flirting_behaviors_and_personality/
1	Wanted to get thoughts on this from ISTJs?	So my boyfriend is an ISTJ and I’m an ENFP and we’ve had many arguments. I don’t think we can go a week or two without arguing about something. Usually it’s because I feel like he doesn’t understand me as well. Last night I brought up how I wanted him to change his tone when he talks to me because he sounds so aggressive and that I’ve been unhappy because of it. When he talks to me in such an aggressive tone it makes me feel like I’m being yelled at or something, especially when I’m going to him to vent about something.... Anyways this convo escalated to the point of breaking up. I was the one that made him break up with me which was stupid of me. I know I’m the one at fault here. I called him back to talk about it and it ended it with him saying that he’ll try to fix it even though it’s been a reoccurring problem. And ever since last night he hasn’t messaged me or anything so it’s making me worry and overthink. I know he probably feels hurt right now over what happened last night and then me literally calling him back right after.... sigh. My emotions took over me and i was just in the heat of the moment. I talked to a close friend about this and she definitely said I was at fault here and that I should apologize. But right now since I know he’s hurt about this whole situation and probably mad and annoyed so I don’t want to bother him. What do you guys think I should do? Should I just give it one or two days to let us cool down or message him now saying I’m sorry? Since I feel so bad I don’t want to bother him even more. \n\ntl;dr
3	> Last night I brought up how I wanted him to change his tone when he talks to me because he sounds so aggressive and that I’ve been unhappy because of it.\n\nDespite your sharing, I suspect we all lack some context for this.  That said, we ISTJs tend to speak very plainly and directly.  I can see how that can be perceived as aggressive, especially when we're annoyed at you.  \n\nI'm not sure how you phrased your request, but the root of it doesn't seem unreasonable.\n\n> But right now since I know he’s hurt about this whole situation and probably mad and annoyed so I don’t want to bother him. What do you guys think I should do? Should I just give it one or two days to let us cool down or message him now saying I’m sorry? Since I feel so bad I don’t want to bother him even more.\n\nYou've covered both of your options (Wait a couple of days and message vs. message now).  Both have their up and down sides, and I'm not going to pro/con those for you because some of that is going to be specific to you and your beau.\n\nWhat I will say is this: If you can't hold back and feel like you must communicate with him right now, acknowledge his potential need for space, apologize, and leave it at that.  Something like "I know you still need some time/space, but I just wanted to say that I'm sorry and I'm ready to talk whenever you are."
2	>"I don’t think we can go a week or two without arguing about something."\n> \n"he sounds so aggressive ... I’ve been unhappy because of it ... it’s been a reoccurring problem ... I made him break up with me(?)/he hasn’t messaged me ... I’m the one at fault/I should apologize"\n\nWhen you envision a happy healthy relationship, is this what you had in mind? Because if not, let him go.\n\nIt sounds like a dead end abusive relationship. You could sort out your communication issues in counseling and continue wasting time with this fuck wad, or you could free yourself up for the guy who won't leave you guessing as to how he feels about you.\n\nRead *He's Just Not That Into You by Greg Behrendt* when you get a chance. Since it's a reoccurring problem it might help you recognize the red flags of a problematic relationship.
2	I dont think this guy deserves to be called a ‘fuck wad’ because we dont know the whole story. \nI have no idea why you or your friend think that you are guilty because him getting aggressive while arguing is pretty horrible and a genuine reason for someone to feel hurt.\n\nSounds to me like an argument that escalated and both of you seem wrong (you only because you said so yourself) \n\nMy advice to you would be to just relax and engage yourself in activities that interest you. And really hold him accountable as well for screaming at you. You seem to be concentrating only on the part where you went wrong which will obviously have you feelin guilty and restless. Remind yourself that he was wrong too and you deserve an apology too. You tried contacting him once, now you can relax and wait for him to get back to you. If he does, talk it out with a sound mind, make sure you let him know where he went wrong and also apologising for what you did. \n\nAlso STs take their sweet time when conflicts arise unlike NFs who start feeling a lot of emotions and want to fix it as soon as possible. NFs come to all sorts of conclusions while STs are just literally keeping themselves busy from thinking about their partners. You are on their mind but in a different way from how they are on yours. So also take this into consideration. 
2	My ISTJ bf often comes off as aggressive and angry with me over things that he would have no reason to be upset over. Now that we’ve been together for over three years, we’ve had lots of chances to address it. I truly believe he doesn’t think he’s being aggressive. He simply thinks he is concerned and making a point. We’ve actually had a conversation where he asked me how I would like him to act in those situations. I explained to him exactly what I would like him to do (listen more, don’t try to solve my problems, and don’t drive issues into the ground). He definitely has worked on it, i have realized his intent and have been more patient and less sensitive, and things have really improved. However, I never felt that he was being abusive. If you feel that your bf’s behavior is abusive, then I would move on. 
3	Is it possible that what's happening is something like this: \n\nWhat he sees as chatter, you see it as discussion. \nWhat he sees as a discussion, you see it as an argument. \nWhat he sees as an argument, you see it as personal attack. \n\nIn my experience, xNFxs are most prone to this.  I had an INFJ former boss and an ENFP friend where I have to constantly think about how I say what I say, rather than just the contents. Which, as an ISTJ, I found extremely tiring and unsustainable. \n\nI'm not saying that this is necessarily bad on your part, but if you're going to make you two work long term you should talk about this so you're not arguing so much in future. Because IMO in a relationship his intention is more important than your perception. \n\nFor now though, give him a couple of days. He'll want to have his mind on things that aren't relationships right now. 
1	>Last night I brought up how I wanted him to change his tone when he talks to me because he sounds so aggressive and that I’ve been unhappy because of it. \n\nContext: I'm not ISTJ, I'm INFJ in a very healthy relationships with an ISTJ. \n\nThat said, I don't think this is at its root an MBTI issue, though some of the surface markers may fall into that. But I think at the core it's something not related to MBTI.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners accept the other for where and who they are. Meaning, requiring someone to change is not healthy in a relationship. Sure, people do change over time however flows for them - but changing something about themselves in order to please the other person should never be a request or demand in a relationship.\n\nAnd specifically in your case - you want your boyfriend to change the *tone in which he speaks?* Really? \n\n>I called him back to talk about it and it ended it with him saying that he’ll try to fix it even though it’s been a reoccurring problem.\n\nand \n\n> we’ve had many arguments. I don’t think we can go a week or two without arguing about something. \n\nThis is not sounding like a good relationship, to me. I know, I know, it has so many good parts and yadda yadda. But really, this kind of fundamental stress is not part of a strong healthy mature relationship. \n\nBest wishes for figuring it out, whatever it is for you.\n\n
1	My question would be this... Does he talk to other ppl with the same tone as he talks to you? Does he have a resting bitch voice or does he talk aggressively to you and kindly to other ppl... If it's the later, then there's a respect issue and your good to let his ass go... If it's the former, give him a couple days to process and then talk to him about it. He does have the right to not want to be in a relationship with someone tho. 
2	Recontact an ISTJ	Hello, \nI was wondering how to reconnect with an ISTJ that I haven't seen or written for more than 2 months? If we have not been part of their daily lives for so long, is it difficult to find a friendly complicity? \nThank you for your feedback.\n\n
10	For me with 99% of friends / acquaintances, regular contact isn't needed. I cherish the meaningful few relationships that I do have. And if I don't hear from you in 6 months I assume all is well...
10	To me, that would be hardly any time at all between contact. So I would just act normal, like there wasn't even a break in your conversation. 
5	I would say to just reach out.\n\nI don't know about anyone else, but for me, I have a really difficult time keeping up with people I don't see every day/week, so if I fall out of contact with someone, it's most likely not because of any animosity I have towards them. It's just that I'm so focused on what's happening that day and then the next and the next, that it easily flows into an "out of sight, out of mind" mentality for me :|
5	I remember you, I think. Didn't you post about this here before?\n*looks around*\n\nYeah, here, from a few weeks ago: [ISTJ ex](https://old.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/ap6je3/istj_ex/)\n\nJust for context so people don't waste time going over the same ground again.
4	For me it’s not a problem.  I have a handful of friends I only see every few years or so and I LOVE how we immediately drop into very comfortable rapport bc we know each other so well.  Feels like no time has passed. 
5	I would be entirely fine with it if I would be on the other end. At times I experience this too, where I want to be back in touch but don't know why or how, or am too focused on other things.
2	MBTI-wise, what type is your “ideal” match?	Obviously it’s just a hypothetical, but I’m just curious to see what other types you’ve meshed the best with?
6	INFPs. Still introverts, same values functions, but different strengths.
4	I’m an ISTJ married to an ISTJ and out of everyone I’ve ever dated, he’s my most perfect match. I feel like ISTJ might be the only combo that really thrives being with another of the same MBTI because of our mutual concern for responsibility, honor, consistency, loyalty, sensibility. Like I’m sure there are other “more exciting” combos out there, but those were better for dating - definitely made me appreciate my ISTJ even more once I found him. And interestingly I didn’t know he was ISTJ til a couple weeks ago when I had him take his test. Also interestingly, we got married in the Catholic Church and had to take their compatibility test during premarital counseling - and we only answered one question differently from each other out of the 150ish questions. 
3	I noticed the best matches for ISTJ would be ones to go for likewise people leaning towards introverts. other ISTJs, INTJ, ISTP, ISFJ I think. Not really into feelers most of all. INTJ is my fav but I'm a bit biased. 
2	Im an INFJ and *somehow* everyone i am interested in ends up being an ISTJ. Its very very strange. I keep telling myself I wanna find another Intuitive.. yet here i am, pursuing one of you again. \n\nSorry its from the opposite perspective, but i needed to share that love haha
2	For some really annoying reason, many of my past interests were in women that are polar opposites (ENFP), which were horrible matches from my experience.\n\nPersonally, I think my ideal match would be any MBTI that is an S and a J, E/I and T/F are don't cares for me. But I think S and J make me very fact/duty oriented, and strongly inclined to plan and do things properly.\n\nN's tend to be abstract thinkers, and they can really frustrate us S types, as they tend to communicate their ideas in a vague manner, as opposed to S, who are much more detailed.\n\nP's, still can get along with them, but not a perfect combo because they tend to like keeping their options open. While I do like them, I find that their lack of commitment to setting a plan in stone can be rather frustrating\n\nWelp that's what I have to share on your question\n
1	My ISTJ friend said “anyone who is clean, honest, and intelligent” when I asked him. Seems like low standards until you consider how many people in your life *actually* fit those criteria.
1	Ideal type for ISTJ is said to be the ENFP. These two types share every cognitive function but in reverse, making them fit together like two peas in a pod. In socionics this is called duality or yin-and-yang, ideally complimentary and balanced relationship:    \nISTJ's functions: Si,Te,Fi,Ne <-ENFP from this end      \nESFP's functions: Ne,Fi,Te,Si <-ISTJ from this end     \nENFPs and ISTJs also seem to marry each other quite often. [Happily married to an ISTJ!](https://old.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/8sbfy7/happily_married_to_an_istj/)    \n     \nOther types that are great matches for ISTJs are those that value either Ne or Fi as their main functions. These are types like INFP, ISFP, ENTP, INTP: [**MBTI type matches for ISTJs**](http://personalitycafe.com/istj-articles/284-love-types-istj-7.html#post3833786)
12	What makes ISTJs feel loved and appreciated?	What makes ISTJs feel loved and appreciated?
18	I think it’s going to vary from person to person. For me, physical touch (holding hands, cuddling on the couch) and quality time (my partner being completely present for me like I am for her [no talk about work or problems that I feel I need to solve], us watching Netflix and then talking/joking about what we just saw). \n\nISTJs need to be with someone who respects their routines and traditions while encouraging them to explore the larger world and the beauty of a connected life. 
14	Everyone has their love language, but a common theme may be when a partner unexpectedly takes care of an obligation for us and does it *to our standard of excellence*.  ISTJs tend to be task and efficiency driven and having something properly taken off our to-do list is a big deal.  For example, coming home and finding that my SO did the dishes or tidied up my living room to my standards is a big deal
8	Answers will vary. No two humans are exactly the same. \n\nWhat would make me appreciate a significant other: \n\n- Lots of physical touch (cuddling, hand holding, etc) and at least a decent amount of quality time with just the 2 of us\n\n- Helping me out w/ problems regardless how minute or dreadful they may be when I tell her about them\n\n- Honesty\n\nThat's all I can say because I have yet to be in a relationship.
4	A listening judgement-free ear. Touching with the whole hand, fingers, palms, thumbs. Feeling safe, both emotionally and physically. A well cooked meal. Joking banter. 
2	Honesty, directness, consistency. \n\nCommunication atleast once a day just so I know things are well. Mind you, I do not want overkill on the communication because I need my space and despise clinginess. \n\nLove physical touch..holding hands,cuddling, etc. \n\nQuality time is also a big thing for me. \n\nI ultimately feel appreciated when there is mutual effort and consideration. 
3	Out of 16 types, 8 are light and 8 are dark. ISTJs are one of the 8 light types:	
3	That's really funny. As an ISTJ I am in the "public sector" for spiritual vocation/career. My INTJ bf is very much a self-employed entrepeneur/self owned business kind of guy.
10	Have any of you ever struggled with your sexuality?	I have always thought I was straight, but lately I'm not so sure anymore. I am currently friends with an ENFP, and I am having these feelings that I have never really had for another man before. I feel ashamed and strange even though I shouldn't. He does so much for me and is an extremely good friend. Has anyone else ever had this for just one other person before? I've never felt like this for any other man...so what is going on?
11	Yes! I'm a lesbian woman who struggled with attraction to women and considered men during her teens. It's perfectly normal to feel strange. Have you considered pansexuality/bisexuality? Take your time. Sometimes platonic attraction and romantic attraction get mixed, but you'll have your answer sooner or later. There's also the chance that he may be the only man you'll ever be attracted to - sexuality operates on a spectrum.
5	It doesn’t matter who you love, as long as you’re happy. One of the things we ISTJ’s struggle with are emotional connections. But if you have this connection with your friend, go for it. As Ron Swanson said, “Nothing ventured, nothing gained.” In any case, I trust your judgment, and support your decision.
2	I'm a gay guy and it's been pretty clear to me since puberty. It's more like I went through awful anxiety and depression because of my sexuality. I just wanted to fit in and do my best to hide it, but I felt like I got cursed with something beyond my control. I was perfectly okay with other people not being straight, but I absolutely did not want to be gay.
2	I’m openly gay, but I knew as soon as puberty hit. No confusion ever really. Though I guess I needed to learn to accept it at first.
2	My bf is bi. He's very quiet about it because basically he's attracted to women and have relationships with women but likes to have sex with men sometimes. He doesn't consider himself anything other than traight because he's not interested in the man. Only the dick (basically). I've met quite a few guys who are on the bi spectrum lately. From guys having sex with my bf so they can have sex with me to a group of guy friends who all have sex with each other with or without their girlfriends. Having a relationship sexual or non sexual with a man doesn't make you gay and you have to give up women forever or anything. It's not a 100% commitment one way or the other. And it's your choice how open you are about it. And it's OK. 
9	How do you recover from a long period of chronic stress?	In the movies it's always wild nights of dancing in Ibiza, driving a motorcycle across Southeast Asia, or a spiritual retreat to the Himalayas.  Do you prefer to do something "crazy" or settle back into a simple and familiar routine?  Would your answer change if you did not have to worry about time and money?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy "chronic stress" I mean any situation that is a constant source of stress and unhappiness and that you cannot remove from your life for whatever reason.  A few examples may include leaving a bad relationship, quitting a job you hate, or recovering from a serious illness.
10	I prefer to settle back into a routine, since routines help me feel more in control of my life. I love being at home, so when I’ve been stressed I like to take time and just clean and organize my home as a way to make my environment more calm. I think if money were no object, I would invest in an expensive item for my home that I could enjoy, like a new TV or furniture. 
6	I too would like an answer to this question. I'm super vulnerable to stress and can never get rid of it for very long.
2	I cut as much of the stress source out of my life as possible then fill that hole with something fulfilling, especially if the bad thing prevented me from pursuing that fulfilling thing.  There's a lot of alone time involved, lots of doing nothing productive.  In my case, that's a lot of time spent enjoying a game with a good story that I can use as a means of escapism.  Eventually when the hole has healed, I get back into a normal routine.\n\nExample: I ended a long-distance relationship about a year and a half ago that was a huge time sink that made me unhappy.  I spent the next several months intentionally single, not going near dating sites or anything, and spent my newfound free time replaying the Mass Effect trilogy and really focusing on my martial arts hobby.  I didn't take any drives longer than half an hour. After a few months I felt like I had "recovered" enough lost time to move on and went back to dating.
2	If the stress is over and behind you, I recommend a long period of chronic home.\n\nIf you're in the middle of it, hit the gym 4 times a week. Or more generally, have a very consistent routine that you enjoy doing.
2	I also play video games. Katamari was my go-to for a while because the game allows you to pick things up with the magic ball you roll. The more you pick up, the larger the ball gets—which feels so soothing to me. 
1	Reading is a good escape and has helped retain my sanity so far. I could read about exotic places and for me it's better than actually being there.
1	With normal stress, I'll spend a day at home or with family and friends doing something relaxed.\n\nWith chronic stress, I spend long periods alone, driving no where in particular just to see the world breathe, spending money on expensive/impractical things, reflecting in nature, writing, and either avoiding home completely or never go out.
1	Studying engineering and ending a relationship was a fun period a couple of years ago. I'll second the guy who said cleaning cause organizing/reorganizing my room and such is usually a good one.\n\nI find what works best for me is shifting all the pent up energy into some hobby, i.e. exercising and climbing has been a good one for me, it's harder to be thinking about day to day details when you're trying not to crush your self with a weight, or hanging above the ground, or running outside etc. \nBut in the short term, it's usually a cup of coffee and burning a few hours on a book/video game/Netflix etc. 
1	Finish everything and anything work related relax by sleeping or something \n\nOnly do something big like going out if I know exactly what’s going on and it’s not a waste of time 
1	I snapped at work Wednesday and Thursday and Friday I was off. Thursday I didn't do anything. I was invited to go somewhere and I told him that I wouldn't leave my house if it was on fire and I meant every word of it. The next day I drove around by myself a bit and then went home to make dinner and veg out some more. The next say after work I went out with a friend. Didn't enjoy it, I still needed more whoosh. Yesterday I went to my bf house and we cuddled all night. I feel much better. 
9	What are some questions ISTJs are open to answering?	ISTJs are usually very reserved, but when asked, what type of odd questions are you guys comfortable in answering among friends and acquaintances?  \n\nEDIT: Some of you guys say this is too broad. What about this: What are some things people have been surprised about when you answered a question of theirs? For example, among friends, I am completely fine with answering sexual related questions if its not crazy detailed. My friends are surprised by this because I don’t seem like the type, but I don’t mind being asked. 
21	I am open to any and all questions, but am hesitant about ones on my emotional state if I don't trust you.
9	How much money I make and my savings and investment strategy. I think the idea that money is taboo is silly and counterproductive. 
3	I like specific questions. (How's that for an istj answer?) If you are specific enough in your question, I can surprisingly go on and on.
2	I am not open to answering this question, because it is too broad.
2	I think we generally enjoy giving advice and talking about our hobbies. Questions where we can answer with either are usually welcome
2	Im totally open a out my sexual practices with the caveat that I don't share anything that would make my partner uncomfortable... He's really open too so theres not much limit.\nI can't think of anything I wouldn't answer honestly (if appropriate) if asked. 
1	It depends who's asking and what is being asked. I'm open to answering more so "superficial" questions such as what am I majoring or what soccer teams I like.
1	anything except very personal and touchy things. 
1	I am open to pretty much any questions and will do my best to answer any of them. Some questions might be difficult to answer, but they do not bother me. For example, my ENTP uncle once randomly asked me “what is your passion?”. It was difficult to answer because it’s such a broad question and I do not tend to have a thing that I am very passionate about, but I was not bothered by the question.
1	I am obviously not an istj. Hahaha! Okay let’s get that out of the way. Entj here, and professionally confirmed.\n\nI think it is really dependent on the person. I notice this istj I know well. And most people if you can get 10 words out of his mouth you’re lucky but I can make anyone get out of their shells. So I talk to this istj quite a bit. As far as I know he talks to me very extensively. 
18	What personality traits attract ISTJs?	What personality traits attract ISTJs?
51	I don't know about other ISTJs, but for me I like when people are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\-honest\n\n\-direct\n\n\-organized\n\n\-competent\n\n\-able to give me personal space when needed\n\n\-interested in talking about music/art/film for extended periods of time without getting bored\n\n\-content with me not changing to their whims\n\n\-not prying into my life if I'm not feeling it\n\n\-not too loud\n\n\-nerdy\n\n\-not shallow (they don't have to be super deep, but yeah)\n\n\-silly (I won't also be silly, but I can appreciate it in others)
3	I like the idea of having traits, strengths, and weaknesses that are different from my partner so that we compliment each other, though there are some things we absolutely need to be on the same page about. I don’t think I’d get along well with another ISTJ, since a lot of my problem areas would be their problem areas (specifically communication). I also like someone who pushes me to improve myself and gently nudges me out of my comfort zone. \n\nSpecific traits I’m attracted to: genuine kindness, down to earth, adventurous, sense of humor, good communicator, laid back, good listener \n\nHave to have in common: views on finances, cleanliness standards around the house
3	Direct\nDisciplined\nClean\nOrganized\nNot afraid to hold their own ground\n
2	Im not too certain about what attracts me but rather what deters me and turns me off from people, being: Invasive to my personal life when I'm not comfortable sharing, Expectant of "lovey-dovey" affection/Clingy(?), Being oblivious or unable to read between lines, Repetitive and boring (conversations being a routine that I'm able to predict what they're going to say), Guilt tripping or when they're not direct with their feelings
2	At the moment I absolutely adore my GF's conscientiousness and high level of organization.  It's nice having someone who *gets* my need to be on top of things.  Her sense of humor and inclination to joke around and tease is also great.  I also appreciate when partners can talk about conflict in a relationship without feeling like criticisms or requests are personal attacks.  Introversion and independence are major pluses.
2	Honest, dependable, funny and a good conversationalist. I hate small talk. 
1	Sense of humor, good hygiene, smells good, has an interest, competence, able to hold a conversation about something important. Confidence. Has a skill and is good at it. 
1	I tend to be attracted to people that have a high amount of neuroticism because I have a low level of neuroticism and I enjoy helping people reduce stress and being a reliable person for them to lean on. I also like people that are not sugar coated at least in front of me. I love when people rant to me and value my advice. I also really appreciate when people notice small things about me or remember things about me or things that I have said. Someone that helps take care of my practical needs and takes the lead
1	Men’s shoes.	Gents - what’s your 1 pair of go to shoes?\n\nI’ve been a Chuck Taylor low-top black or grey guy for awhile and my current pair need replacing.
1	Depends on weather and what's the occasion.\n\nIf it's gonna rain/snow (or is already) then I wear my boots. \n\nIf it's not raining or snowing and I'm doing something informal, I wear either my Jordan or Nike sneakers. \n\nIf I'm going to a more formal event, I wear dress shoes.
1	Sketchers.  Anything else hurt my feet. 
1	Currently, a pair of 4" Danner steel-toe work boots. I do miss my Redwings, but nobody sells them locally anymore.
1	NB 501s, classic look, can go with casual or athletic wear, super comfy
3	How do you recognise when person is ISFJ instead of ISTJ?	There is also mirror effect but I am not sure if I am ISFJ or ISTJ.
5	Your question made me curious so I did some looking. One thing that sealed me as ISTJ was this analogy: A program or product you use at work has been discontinued. An ISTJ will be concerned with how the loss of the program will affect the other processes/projects in the office. An ISFJ will be concerned with how the change will affect the people in the office and how they accomplish their work. 
2	Google and read the differences between cognitive functions Te and Fe and you’ll know right away. They are so different. I don’t mix up isfj vs istj much as they are so polarizing. 
2	Fe often cares a lot about how the group is feeling and wants to make things pleasant for all. ISFJs are big on this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nISTJs who don't value Fe don't give a shit unless it's pointed out to them, but ISFJs pick up on this naturally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, ISFJs, due to being terrible at Te, also don't have much respect for universal facts and ideas typically and prefer to follow their own logic with tertiary Ti. ISTJs re often like this with their personal Fi values as well.
1	ISFJ has fe and ISTJ has te and also istj have fi and isfj has ti.\n\nGenerally because of fe isfj loves and care quite a bit about a lot of people. They are very concerned about people and loving. For example nursing attracts a great amount of sfjs in general, including one i know personally and one I know of who’s a caretaker. An istj definitely feels but comes off a bit colder. They care more about getting stuff done, more goal oriented and a bit less people centered. Also isfj can sometimes be called a little outgoing, and usually very well liked. fe has a very good grasp of social situations and social cues. Te is very much the functions about getting stuff done. A lot of istjs are definitely not in to nursing or caretaking. A lot of them are in technical fields such as computing or logistics.\n\nEven if isfjs are in such field they are the caring one out. A lot of fe users have great emotional connectivity with others.
16	Learning empathy?	I need it for work apparently.   For coworkers.  But how... 
19	We don’t know either. We are ISTJ’s after all. 
9	Whoa, that's a hard one.
9	Find the person you think or is known to be very empathetic and just copy/study the type of things they say.  Try to remember to use some of the phrases once in a while and pretend you know what you are doing.  
7	Ugh.
6	Time to process. It's never too late to go back and show empathy, methinks. Sometimes we get too caught up processing the moment in our heads we forget everything, or everyone, else.
3	I’ll be honest with you. I’m a manager and god id hate to work under myself. I have no idea how to show it, it really reflects on how my employees perceive me and how hard they work for me.I think we just rule with an iron boot to ensure we get it done y’know.
4	Marry an ENFP.
3	I think it takes a lot of willpower to maintain empathy, but at the same time it feels artifical and therefore disingenuous so we might as well do nothing I guess
2	I’m in the same boat. Got great feedback at work barring being empathetic with my peers. Help?
2	First of all, this made me laugh.. am I being unemphatic? Heh. "Put yourself in someone else's shoes". Think how you'd feel about a situation if it happened to you on your best/worst day. If someone says they're scared of something you think is trivial, try not to laugh - there must be something you're afraid of that you wouldn't appreciate being made fun of for. \n\nLet people know you're listening to them by restating what they said or asking questions about what they're saying. It'll help you understand where they're coming from.
2	In most cases you can't really "learn" empathy. \n\nEmpathy is pretty much feeling what other person feels and feeling their pain.\n\nSympathy is feeling pity or caring for someone experiencing misfortune. You don't have to know what the person is going through to know that they suffer, therefore you may feel bad.\n\nLast thing is compassion, so trying to relieve one's suffering. Now the fun part is, that you don't need no empathy nor sympathy to be compassionate. \n\nIt's kind of like this "ok, that person has issues, as social species we need support to feel better, therefore I need to say something nice to make that person feel better and GO BACK TO WORK".\n\nAs much as Te likes to always find solution to one's problem, this is not always needed. It is really just easy as:\n"Oh, he was cheating on you? You didn't deserve that, what an asshole!" \nJust one stupid comment that will show them you are on their side, or at least feel bad for them (even if you don't) and they feel better.\n\nI recommend writing down possible responses to their suffering, so you may have some routine in this. I base my whole social life on scripting. \n\nYou can also try to find someone more socially competent and ask them for possible responses.
1	Just say sorry a lot.\n\nWhy? No idea.
1	I must be a weird ISTJ because I'm highly empathetic. It's just easy for me to feel other people's emotions as if I'm absorbing them from the atmosphere
1	Work with people.
1	You can and do experience empathy daily. You just think you dont because a lot of things dont concern us, but when they do, ISTJs are just as empathetic and caring and concerned as any other person.\n\nYou have tert Fi; when something sparks your value system you feel it, you care about it. If you want to try and practice more empathy, dont "put yourself in their shoes" thats not authentic for us. Instead try "when have i been in a situation similar to this? How did i feel? How might i have felt the way they do? How are we similar and different?" That will give you a jumping off piint for a deeper understanding of someone you may otherwise not want to empathize with.
1	I have a hard time putting myself in someone else's shoes...i guess I feel like those aren't my shoes, I have no business wearing them. I have my own problems why do I gotta try yours on too.... I also know that this is one reason I'm not leadership material. 
1	I'm not sure if what I'm advising completely encompasses all that there is regarding empathy but I would suggest making an intentional effort to observe how you communicate with others verbally and non-verbally and incrementally add new habits to your repertoire. Some of the habits I feel will take you closer to coming off as an empathetic person are: \n*Learning about and practice validating emotions \n*Learn about and practice active Listening \n   this will involve things like: \n-giving appropriate eye contact when others are talking\n-incorporate phrases that encourage the speaker to continue talking like "Tell me more" \n- every now and then you can summarize or repeat what someone has said to get confirmation that you are understanding them correctly like "If I'm understanding you correctly what happened was _____" \nIt's kind of hard to pinpoint all the habits that kind of give off the impression that you are being empathetic but I think in general at least for listening the main things are: understanding (respecting the fact that there are two sides to an issue and truly listening and withholding judgement), Genuine Interest/Attentiveness. \nTo be honest I really feel like it’s just a handful of things you just really need to consistently change like maybe a 20% change in behaviour and that would help tremendously. When I think about empathy I feel like it’s not hard to see that if you do the following people can start to see a shift in behaviour: \nValidate the emotions of others \nGive off the non-verbal and verbal cues that you are interested in what people are saying \nMake an effort to show to people that you truly value their perspective and want to understand what they think and feel\nA big thing as well is to become conscious of what emotional invalidation is and what it looks like and it’s things like: \n “Don’t be so dramatic.”\n “Deal with it.”\n “You can’t be serious.”\n “But it doesn’t make any sense to feel that way.”\n “Why are you making such a big deal over it?”\n “You shouldn’t let it bother you.”\n\nThis may sound silly but another thing that can help is to do some research and notes about emotions and general theories of why and when we feel a specific emotions . And one of the habits, related to emotional validation you can build is offering your suggestion as to what you think the person is feeling. “You seem pretty upset”, “It sounds like you’re feeling pretty disappointed”. At the same time you have to accept that the person is the only one who\ntruly knows how she/he is feeling and if they correct you accepting their correction is a\nvalidation of their emotions. 
0	Need help from matured ISTJ girls	I am sorry that its going to be long. I don't mean any disrespect but just hurt.\n\nI am an ENFP guy recently ISTJ girlfriend broke up.\n\nIstj girlfriend 28 year: Depressed/suffers from anxiety and negetive thinking because of her childhood experiences with bipolar mom\n\nShe was very happy because I was able to understand her depression and was with her after therapy sessions. She was so peaceful that I came into her life.\nIn the beginning of our relationship she and her friends got drunk too much which was a huge turn off for me. I almost wanted to breakup..I was mad at her. She started crying. I told myself to forgive her and never to leave her because I did not want to take away that happiness or peace which she got after years. I never told this to her though but I had to love her more because it is my decision to be with her. I forgave her but also had to love her more so that her value in my heart doesnt go down (its a decision)\n\nI was mad about her friends for couple of weeks whenever she said she is meeting them. Thats it one day she broke up. I literally begged her(not out of desperation but to explain why I didnt break up with her). She blocked me everywhere and its been 30 days.\n\nISTJ's are freaking blind for emotions. Who would want to not breakup with a few extra pounds,durkard, depressed and anxious person? I dont have any benfit from my decision but its my decision to love her bring her out of her pain. It is the worst feeling when your mind doesn't listen to you.\n\n\nYou may ask why I decided?\n\nI wanted to be with her and give her strength because I have been there (anxiousness) and I know the pain.I was optimistic about our life together. \n\nBecause pain is pain for anyone. No one should deserve pain or suffering. Is someone is going through pain it is our responsibility as a human to bring them out of it. \n\nExample : \n"Pain of you breaking your finger, tears, suffering= pain of someone breaking their finger, tears, suffering"\n\nIf you want to avoid your pain then someone should also be helped/helped to avoid breaking their finger.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI met an ESFJ, ENFP(exactly my type and also I really liked), and talked to many girls in this month because ENFP quickly want to avoid/skip breakup pain by replacing it with someone or something. But it didnt work for me this time. I myself told the Esfj, enfp girls that it wont work and disconnected with other girls because I coukdbt take this istj girl out of my mind.\n\nShe unblocked me over fb but not of instagram. I texted her over phone but no response. Istj's see only their way but no other possibilities or alternatives. You are brutal to others and also yourselves but you dont realise that because you don't see it.\n\nI admire your personality type when it comes to planning, decision making and dedication. \n\n\nWhat should I be doing now?\n\n\nIs it time to turn on my T type which makes me ENTP one of the worst personality types which makes me senseless to anything or should I wait for her.
4	Don’t wait for her. \n\nAs someone who struggles with anxiety and self-worth due to my childhood, real peace can only come from within and she needs to work on that without a crutch. Drinking heavily is also a crutch. Your ex needs professional help. \n\nI don’t care for how you seem to use your “love for her” as a way to convey how you’re a good/better person. How you love her despite the flaws. I’m sure you have flaws too. \n\nThere’s nothing to gain by sticking around, hoping your ex will come back around. \n
2	I'm trying to make sense out your story but I cannot. I wouldn't be surprised if part of the story is missing here, no offense.\n\nAnyways, she moved on and you should do the same. She was unstable and you seem like a good person, you'll find someone else. Time will heal! Best of luck my friend.
1	Hey, sorry this happened to you. You really did care for her, but it didn't seem to be enough - someone in poor mental health might not be able to accept your love at all. When I struggle with similar issues myself, loving someone else as fully as I can is simply out of the question. My mental health becomes a glaring problem to me, something I feel like I need to fix on my own. I wouldn't want to cause someone else unhappiness from being with that version of me - maybe she's looking out for you too, in a more, to her, logical way. When I'm down, I have trouble considering other people's emotions and tend to shut them out until I'm okay again. To be honest, I would see your behavior as overbearing.\n\nI think the best thing to do here is move on. If you've let her know you'll be there for her if she needs you, that's all you can do. I hope you take care of yourself in the meantime. I'm sure she wants you to, too.
1	She is taking you for granted and does not sound like she is appreciative of your feelings. Even as an ISTJ, we tend avoid connecting through emotions but should at least be wary of their significant other’s feelings and make an effort to dispel any negative factors like distrust. If I were to be in her shoes, honestly, I would want some space to then realize how special you are to me or have some value to my life.
0	Bottom line is that we sever relationships pretty easily for one reason or another. If you tried to step between her and her friends, that's a real good reason to drop you. We don't bond with people easily and we sure as hell don't want to give up several ppl that we've bonded for one person who may not share the same values but impress them upon us anyway. And really, all she needs to not want you again is to find a shiny new guy to attach to. Ppl are super replaceable to us. It's a defense mechanism and it works like a charm! Find a new lady. Don't try to control her. Don't try to fix her. Don't try to segregate her. 
12	What does flirting look like for an ISTJ?	There’s an ISTJ I know who seems to be almost hiding a smile when I’m around. He and I spend a lot of time around each other one on one and sometimes have deep conversations. I’m not a particularly flirty person though, and I don’t suspect he is; nothing has been outright said or done that would imply interest. How can I tell?
38	ENFP here. A few clues I’ve picked up on throughout the years... If they’re romantically interested in you, there may be a physical attraction but they don’t usually leap in, they take a while to see if you’re a suitable partner. They’re extremely “acts of service” oriented. They’ll do something nice for you but it usually won’t be romantic, so it’s hard to tell if it’s a flirtation or a kind gesture... they may help you with a task at work, or run an errand or ask you if you want anything from the soda machine etc. If they like you, they’ll find reasons to be around you. ISTJs don’t hang out and play nicey-nice w people they don’t like. That shy smirk is adorable and yeah, in my experience it’s a sure sign they’re nervous/excited about being around you. You’ll need to be clear about your interest.. “hey I’m sorry if this is weird, but I just wanted to tell you I really enjoy being around you and if you’re interested in getting to know each other better, I’d love to spend some more time with you... maybe a date sometime. If you’re interested, you know where I’m at!” Give them some time... they (and the other IxTx’s) like to take some time to evaluate the situation and see if you’re a worthy partner. Very pragmatic people! 
12	Without more details, here is my advice: \n\nWell having deep conversations is most likely a good sign unless you are good friends? Then I'd say that is more normal. \n\nFrom my personal experience, and assumption of most guys and other ISTJs, we're terrible at judging if someone is interested in us. Your only hope is if you initiate flirtation which cannot be misconstrued as anything else. But your surest path to knowing would be to just be straightforward. ISTJs can handle straightforward haha. \n\nGood luck. 
11	As one, I don't get it and later discover someone was flirting and I'd be like, oh!\nI like a direct approach to things.
5	Mostly done without you knowing it. ISTJs tend to use social media as a way to learn more about you. They might throw you a like on an older picture. In person they might back away/leave. \nFinding common ground (conversation) is a great way to get one to open up to you, especially someone who is highly introverted. Make them feel comfortable and they will be more likely to show interest in you.
4	I rarely feel comfortable flirting with someone I'm interested in unless I see signs that they like me too. My feelings show through my actions, which can come off as just being nice.. maybe see if he treats you with special care, offering extra help and such. I need to know the other person is interested before I let myself be flirty, out of fear of breaking boundaries (a romantic interest is considered a friend first and foremost - I'll need to observe more interactions before taking steps to the next level). Also, if I'm constantly seeking to spend one-on-one time having deep conversations with someone, there's a high chance that I like them.. watch for consistency and increased comfort. If this tests your patience, look for ways to make your interest known, and don't be subtle :) hope that helps.
2	I go extra mile for people I like. Ill do/make something nice for them.\n\nI wish people fit some magic formula I can plug variables in and get an answer but that not how it works despite MBTI or any other test. Only sure way of knowing, however, is asking. Suggest going out for a coffee or lunch one day... And work it from there. 
2	From what I done:\n\n- Compliment on their appearance or how they smell \n\n- Tried sexting though I do need encouragement \n\n- Spend or tried to spend a lot more quality time with them\n\nHonestly I'm just really uncomfortable with flirting. And if someone flirts with me I don't know how to react other than saying "thank you" and smiling.

2	Hey fellas, INTP asking for help here	Btw my English sucks, but please bear with me\n\nHey, so as the title says, I need help trying to figure out why my ISTJ buddy behaves the way he does, without dissecting him, it would be too invasive, don't you think?\n\nAnyway, we were having a discussion, he stated that the sole purpose of life is just to be happy and enjoy, which triggered my disagreement immediately. We had discussions on this topic quite a few times, but each time it ended up with me explaining why he should be precise with his terms and not mix them up all the time. \n\nThis time I had a lot of spare time, so I decided to finally answer him fully without him interrupting, he asked me why I think happiness is not the purpose of life.\n\nI, being excited to finally be able to articulate my argument fully, wrote a soul crushing argument, and gave him the alternative point of view, to which he responded - I see where you're coming from but I'll stick to my ways, not to say your argument is bad, it's just that we all have a right to our own opinion. I mean sure - we all have that right, but that doesn't make every opinion equally as good.\nNow I honestly would just give up on talking with him about deep topics, but I don't want him to screw himself over, I honestly care about him(Fe inferior)\n\nAny tips on how to deal with this situation? Is this an ISTJ thing, or is it something unique to him perhaps?\n\nThanks a lot in advance!\n\n\n\n\nEdit: formatting, am on mobile
11	I will disagree with you.  On the subject of your own life, your own opinion on how to live it, is the only one that counts.\n\nIf you can provide a persuasive argue, and change someone mind, that is fine.  But you didn't do that, as he was not persuaded.
6	Hmm I would disagree with his opinion to a degree. I definitely think a big part of life is being happy and enjoying it, but that shouldn't be your only goal IMO. I think that making the people you have in your life happy is equally as important, because ultimately, humans are the most important thing in life. Yeah you can live a very hedonistic life and enjoy it, but I don't think it'd bring as much fulfillment as having good people in your life. \n\nI can understand him basically saying to agree to disagree. I do that with my friends a lot. I don't believe certain opinions are better than others, at least with topics like this. He's not really hurting anybody by being happy and enjoying life. But they're are opinions that are actively harmful compared to others, like anti-vax etc. 
5	While I don't necessarily agree with his opinion, I do agree with his response. \n\nI think everybody should live their lives the way they want to, as long as they are choosing the lifestyle willingly and consciously and are not affecting other people.\n\nPersonaly, I don't think I could change a strong opinion I have of something unless provided with a few very strong facts, and those just don't exist on a topic as subjective as one's purpose in life.\n\nIt may be easier to just agree to disagree. Unless he's being self-distructive, which is a different discussion.
5	I'm not ISTJ but in a relationship with an ISTJ. (I myself am INFJ)\n\nI don't understand why you think purpose of one's life is something universal based on your own perspective that you can argue is applicable to everyone.\n\nMy SO and I see different purposes for our respective lives, and we're in a serious relationship! As a couple, our interest is whether and how where we're each coming from might (and/or might not) converge and intersect. \n\nIn relationships of all sorts, whether friendships or otherwise, the ability to listen and connect well across difference - including the basic understanding that this other person is not you and doesn't see or experience or desire things identically to yourself - is actually a sign of maturity and health, IMO. Your approach seems to lack that basic maturity from what I see in the OP.\n\nThat you believe you can and should argue with him about how he identifies his own desires and purpose is mindblowing to me. \n\n>I honestly care about him(Fe inferior)\n\nA great way to express that care is to respect him for where he's coming from, to do your best to accurately understand where he's coming from in the first place, and to support that as well as you can. 
5	How to deal with it?\n\nStop trying to change him or make him have some moment of enlightenment. You’re the problem here. Is reaction is completely on par with his type. \n\nWhat are you even trying to achieve? #rhetorical
3	Maybe your friend had other things on his mind, or wasn't feeling well, or, just for some reason, had run out of fucks to give just now. He might give you a better answer later. 
2	Yes its very ISTJ (very Si dom and Fi tert)\n\nTo convince an ISTJ you must make them believe their way of thinking is what you are saying, or at least similar enough.
2	>  I see where you're coming from but I'll stick to my ways, not to say your argument is bad, it's just that we all have a right to our own opinion. \n\nThis is the correct response. \n\nI recognize you’re giving advice based on what you think is best from a place of caring, but what he does with his life has no effect on yours (provided he’s not your dependent or stealing from you). \n\nWhen I was younger, I was more likely to give *unsolicited* advice because I thought I knew better. While I may still have those thoughts, I find I have mellowed in some ways because what would be imo the smartest decision is not necessarily the *best* decision for that other person for a number of reasons I may or may not be aware of. \n\nOur past experiences define us and how we react in the future. Unless you’ve actually walked a mile in their shoes, just keep your opinion to yourself unless they ask for it, if you want to maintain the friendship. 
2	Didn’t read all the comments, but I cant believe how people doesn’t agree with you! Instead of helping you to help your friend, they try to argue with what you said instead ughh. People, the focus here is HELPING HIS ISTJ FRIEND, not trying to blame this intp for his not properly constructed arguments!\n\nI think the misconception here is, your friend is living his life for the pleasure, which equals to temporary happiness. This is what actually you’re trying to say right? You want him to stop being dependent of the pleasure life can give to him. What I mean by this for those who disagrees is, for example someone who loves eating. He can eat alot of what he loves, it gives him pleasure. If he cannt control the portion , how frequent he eats, then this causes diabetes and obesity. And then eventually death. Pleasure is just a form of escapism of reality, and I think this is what your istj friend is doing.\n\n\nEventhough I said all that, I am not sure what advices to give. But I’ll try. One things to do is to change his environment. I think the little step is to organise his home (if he lives alone) or his room. Make it clean, and let all light enters the room. Make it as fresh as possible. I think this let his mind to clears up a bit from overthinking. \n\nI was also depressed before, and I know how I dont actually listen when people gives me advice because being depressed is how I can enjoy myself, being alone etc. Some change that I do is to try avoid listening to depressing songs, because it makes me becoming more miserable myself. These little things makes a greater change for myself, maybe you can identify whats on him too.\n\nI have a brother who is an istj, and it is also hard to win arguments against him (im intp). My mom told him to stop smoking because it is not good for his health. He does’t care. But somehow, one day he stopped smoking. And that change is due to his determination for a change (he doesn’t have money to buy ciggarete). He cleaned his room, becoming more hygienic himself and actually surpised by some changes he seen from not smoking. And all that is started after watching Youtube videos. He changed himself without any personal human intervention (only the impersonal = someone from the youtube video). So if they have the determination, everything falls out easily as an istj must and will achieve what they want if the set their goals themselves. Maybe dont try to force him or makes him feel forced about something, but make him realize it himself, to make his conditions better (by indirect interventions)\n\nI know I am not really answering your question. But just read what I have, maybe it does help abit. Sorry for my english though and messy thoughts (Ne).
2	If discovering your MBTI type changed your life (as it did mine), how do you handle the (scientific) criticism of it?	Alternate title: Is the MBTI the Thinking Man's horoscope?\n\nMy background (can be skipped): \n\n>!I spent most of my life up to age 25 struggling (and failing) to understand myself and other humans. Fortunately, my 1st employer out of grad school paid for my 1st MBTI test, where I came out as an ESTJ. This helped me somewhat. A failed relationship 3 years later made me realize I'm an \*I\*STJ (I think I answered the original test in a manner that skewed towards extroversion, as only very recently has the stigma around introversion started to go away.)!<\n\n>!Since then, my understanding of myself and others has gone through the roof. I know my limits, exactly which situations and people I'll thrive in and around, etc. My self definition has solidified, resulting in breakthrough confidence, among other things.!<\n\n>!Basically, I'm the poster child for the MBTI: the person who was lost at sea about themselves until they took the test.!<\n\nHowever, in recent years there've been a lot of really well thought out and valid attacks on the test (such as this [one](https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2013/mar/19/myers-briggs-test-unscientific).)\n\nHow do you folks who found the test as life changing as I did reconcile that with it possibly not being accurate or giving useful results?
6	I think that as long as MBTI is just used for observation and a little prediction there is no problem. I mean if you have a person that always rafts the same way to a specific situation it's only reasonable to expect them to act the same way again when you put them in the same situation. So that's the 16 types, basically putting people on categories on how they are propably going to react to certain situations. However the cognitive functions aren't proven and I don't think they should be used much. 
4	A system can have valid criticisms but still hold some meaningful truth.  I'm hesitant to predict anyone's behavior based off MBTI but it's very useful for understanding behavior in hindsight.
4	Still depressed cause Ive been fucking up my entire life but now I know why
3	It's BS, just like horoscopes\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/give-and-take/201309/goodbye-mbti-the-fad-won-t-die](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/give-and-take/201309/goodbye-mbti-the-fad-won-t-die) 
2	Have you taken a learning styles test? I describe it to people like that. How proven is learning styles? But they are useful. You know you are a kinesthetic learner, a lecture learner, a visual learner, a social learner, ETC.... so how do you use that? Easily by understanding how you learn and you understand how you do things and what your strengths and weaknesses are.\n\nSo say you are a hands on kinesthetic learner. You try to take classes like that or do work like that. Or adapt classes with more hands-on experience. If you work try to include more of this in your work.\n\nLikewise here.\n\nIf you are an istj si te fi ne, right? Okay let’s see.\n\nYou have si what does si mean? You are gifted with details and facts, with more concrete type of learning. Probably lecture based. Okay. Fine. That seems useful right? You like to do things step by step. MOre pragmatic. You prefer useful pragmatic information and more trivia based stuff. Si. Good at research stuff. Good at reading and following directions. Very protocol based. Check. Thats also si. Good at applying and using past memories and events. Check. All the things that are si based. Use that to your advantage. Explain it to people like that. I have a gift for these things.\n\nYou are a thinker and you tend to be very much in to efficiency and being pragmatic and productive. Te. Big on accomplishing things, and if needed leadership. Te. You are good at getting stuff done and you are a very competent person. Te. You have the gift of organizing things and such. \n\nTell people it like that. ISTJ sometime doesn’t work for people.\n\nFor example I tell people not immediately about mbti but I tell them this.\n\nYeah, I tend to be a natural leader and have that gift and I have the gift of knowledge. (This is ni.) I am also good at discernment and insight (this is also ni).  So yeah, and you know some people are better at that and some people are more logistical people. Some people are more extroverted and some people are really more introverted. And some people really do well with connecting with others or expressing their feelings and really championing there causes. Some people are great at enforcing moral codes and such, very gifted at keeping in touch with their morals. Some of us are naturally more emotional then others or more in to rational thinking, not that the people who are emotional isn’t rational and vice versa. But they tend to naturally be inclined you know. You see it right?\n\n\nI don’t mention anything about mbti. The things in parens are for you reading this I don’t speak them. But they understand and most people honestly agree with me. I can see that. I think some people in certain roles of my life don’t see the te because I am a low level worker and volunteer as a non-leader role and my fi can be triggered at this place. This was at church today. I am part of the greetings ministry and we actually had a discussion about mbti but I didn’t bring up the name or word mbti to anyone just talked about it. No one could disagree with me. I think a lot of people don’t really see te on the greeting ministry. I am just very enneagram 3 there. I sometimes talk to them about that but honestly haven’t really too much but I’d do the same thing. \n\nDoes this help?.
1	The way I figure it is this: proven science always describes reality, which non-scientific methods work for specific cases (read: people) but not necessarily the population at large. Ergo, it can work for individuals, but that doesn't mean it'll work for others.
1	any ISTJ on paper would understand that "feelings" are not science. if it makes you feel better sure, but the fact that you can score two different things 3 years apart means it's obviously not written in stone. jung and freud had some good ideas but many are pseudoscience. 
12	How do you feel when you thought you had a strong friendship with someone but they move on.	Hello! Just trying to see if its me that only feels that way.\n\nI'm currently in College and thruout the semesters I had made a few connections with classmates. They always seemed enthusiastic to come in and just casually talk before/after classes. Some even stopped me in the hallways to greet me and ask me questions about me. Even shared social media accounts/numbers.\n\nMost of those connections, they have been extroverts. While I understand some are super open and everyone they talk to is their "friend." I feel like they "forget" me.\n\nI just feel like they know a lot of people that I'm insignificant to them and they just say hi cause we just happened to have the same class. \n\n**I just feel everyone moves on so quickly from my life that I can't start friendships.**
4	I get that.. we ISTJs can take some time to get to know, and it can feel like we're left behind for something more exciting. What I've noticed is that extroverts usually want to hang out more than I am used to, and they can sense that from me. I also tend to keep people at a certain emotional distance, so it's easy for people to see me as being "too cool" for them. Best thing to do is reach out yourself, and keep an open mind/heart about their love for you - they may be waiting for you to come around. I know my friends do.
3	I have the exact opposite problem: I'm terrible at maintaining friendships and it's all my fault. I'm not the type to message or call out of the blue, plus I prefer attractive, fashionable, cool, cosmopolitan people. In many ways, I'm a victim of my own elitist BS, but doing otherwise (spending time with people I'm not super into or who don't meet my "standards") bores the hell out of me.
2	I kinda felt the same way in college, at first. While it definitely sucks, there are ways to get past that stage of friendships. The classmates I grew closest to were people I began studying with or would grab lunch/dinner with after class and they were usually from my major classes so I could schedule future courses with them too. I also made several new, long lasting friendships when I began working, since we all saw each other on a regular basis and also hung out to talk about the coworkers/customers we didn’t like. 
2	Honestly, what you described doesn't seem to me like a strong friendship, so I guess they were just being nice to you and you misunderstood it... but you could make an effort to talk to these people and maybe even some other classmates and create an actual friendship. May be hard at first but it generally becomes more natural as you talk to them.
2	A lot of extroverts tend to make rather shallow friendships with a lit of ppl while introverts tend to make deeper friendships with fewer ppl. Most of the ppl you develop a type of friendship with will be at the  acquaintance level. Meaning your friendly with each other, hang out from time to time, follow on social media, etc, but it's not a long term fulfilling friendship, and that's OK. You'll only ha e a handful of ppl who make it to the "friend" level. Ppl who will follow you in life, through thick and thin. Ppl who may not be there every single day, may have long periods of time without a lot of contact, but still love you and care about you, even when they aren't in your ass. Those are the ppl you need to focus on. Keep those aquantances in your back pocket tho, in case you need to happen to need someone who knows someone. 
1	We’re all on our own journey. Occasionally paths cross, but they eventually separate, and that’s okay. Don’t be sad the friendship ended, be happy that it happened. Personally, I don’t expect my college friendships to last. They will end either at graduation or when one of us gets married. It doesn’t keep me from attempting friendship. However brief.

6	Advice on getting along with an ISTJ dad to an INTP son	So my dad and I get into petty arguments that go on until mum breaks them up, I understand that this is sort of supposed to happen in the teenage years but still when we have 5 minute arguments about something as minor as the correct amount of metal to leave on the lid of a can of condensed milk as to make sure it doesn't fall off (this actually happened a few hours ago)
3	I've had many arguments with my ISTJ dad, he is logical but not all his assumptions are correct and up to date! \n\nI'd say before arguing, try to get your facts (and his) straight. ISTJs like to see facts that are coming from a legit source, and they are open-minded about evaluating and accepting them. \n\nWhile arguing, do it with respect. We INTPs can take (even appreciate) a harsh debate, one with heated discussions, calling others wrong, being called wrong by others, full blown and no remorse! ISTJs aren't like that, they prefer calm debate and peaceful exchange. INTPs in Ti mode may see their voices raised without them even noticing, which the ISTJ may (wrongly) perceive this as you becoming angry or pushy! So: calm... and respectful... ;) that is the only way things move forward. \n\nISTJs are extremely impartial and cautious, while INTPs usually choose a side soon even if later we need to change sides with more information coming in. So we are more flexible in debate, while they are less flexible but very open-minded regardless. I've had many cases were the debate did not seem to actually have gone somewhere, but later me or my ISTJ dad would change our perspectives for the better. \n\nINTP and ISTJ are a great personality match, they share Ti and Ne according to model G stack. But Ti and Ne has more energy in INTP, so he should expect to have the upper hand most of the times in the discussions. Yet in your case (and mine) the ISTJ being the dad, has the higher status that needs to be respected, so we INTPs need to be even more flexible and carefully proceeding. It is good to be reminded that we are arguing with a person who loves us and we love them, and the fact that this person also happens to be logical and fair-minded. The situation could be much worse, like having a dark/unhealthy or an emotional/illogical dad. \n\nWish you both have wonderful times together... Peace. \n\n
2	I'm an ISTJ married to an INTP for years. We personally don't argue often but when we do we argue very differently and it's pretty much never productive. I will say we both have a strong need to be right so when we argue one of us usually dismisses the other one because we are convinced they are wrong without actually listening. Try calmly presenting your dad with fact based evidence. If you do it loudly or emotionally he probably won't listen. We absolutely hate being wrong, but that also means that if we are proven wrong we will accept it because otherwise...we would still be wrong and we don't like that.\n\nIf he still won't listen to you when presented calmly with facts... That's probably more of an age thing than an ISTJ thing. I have an ENTJ dad I have been butting heads with my whole life, but it's worse now because he's so set in his ways that he doesn't like to take into account any new research/discoveries/studies etc. done in the last like 20 years that disprove an old way of thinking. 
2	Sounds like you're a teenager who needs to shut his mouth about smalls things because guess what you aren't in charge. If you were having actual arguments about things that affected your life it would be one thing. \n\nRead "How to Make Friends and Influence People"\nYou will learn that sometimes you just need to let people be right, even if they are wrong. \n\nThis is something you should work on now and I don't think this has anything to do with your personality. To me you are young and think you need to assert your intelligence. Learn to be humble and not to bother with the small stuff. 
3	Curious INFP	Hey all! I've been dating a guy for about 3 months  who I'm fairly certain is ISTJ (I'm not 100% sure as he's not taken the test). I'm curious to learn more about your type, & was wondering if any of you had insights into what you believe makes a relationship work well for you? Anyway, thanks for the advice! Hope your day is going well 
6	Personally, I take a very practical approach to relationships.  What works is if the relationship checks all the boxes of "must-haves" and none of the boxes of "deal breakers".  I appreciate level-headed, rational approaches to solving problems and a lack of drama.  Throw in a spark of adventure every now and then and talk to me in my "love language" and I'll be happy!  I'm sure your partner has his own quirks and preferences but the above should cover some of the ISTJ traits.
2	Hi! I've dated an infp for about the same amount of time. Things I looked for were consistency and direct communication - due to my perceived coldness, my infp became fearful of expressing their feelings. Admittedly, I would be baffled by them at first - but please continue putting your feelings into your guy's head, even if he misunderstands them at first - he may need time to reflect. If you ever feel like he isn't expressive enough, say so - he will appreciate it and should take action. I needed to know what my infp needed, and vice versa. For me, a relationship works well when I know what my person wants, they recognize my actions, they're happier for it, and show me they love me in ways I can understand (and like said above, know each others' love languages!).
1	As an ISTJ who is married to an INFP, I will say that we usually balance each other out well. We do have our clashes at times, but we talk through any problems we’re having to come to a mutual understanding (which is important for any good relationship!) and agree on any behavior changes needed. I often forget that I need to be sensitive in my wording, but a gentle reminder now and then is all I need to rephrase things before I say them. We ISTJs can be very blunt with our opinions and forget how easy it is to offend others. More often than not, our opposite ways of thinking benefits the other. If he has a problem at work, I’m quick to come up with a solution that he may not have thought of. When I bring up issues, he explains what the other person (or people) may have been feeling in the circumstances and why I may have angered them. It’s also great to hear all of the ideas he comes up with, because I can determine the steps needed to achieve them and push for it to happen.\n\nThe most important advice I can give is to COMMUNICATE! You will have misunderstandings, but my husband likes to use analogies with me so that I have a direct and clear way to understand his feelings without any need for interpretation. Be specific and be as rational as possible!
2	What should I do when an ISTJ is huffy with me? (She's my sister)	 Today my ISTJ younger sister asked me to do something for her but I refused because I was busy. She kept saying and saying it again do I got angry at her and shouted... Now she behaves like shit and she's on my nerves every seconds of tonight...\nWhat should I do to her? I really want to refuse any fights but she's still on my nerves with the things she do.
2	I feel the age dynamic may complicate things between you. She’s probably still learning how to communicate her feelings. For me as in istj if I asked my sibling or parents for help- I needed it. Being independent and driven, I often don’t like reaching out in any form, so if I asked for help and didn’t get it I may even have felt embarrassed for asking. 
2	We don't feel strong emotions for very long so leave her alone for a while and she'll get over it. Trying to address it while she's still pissy will just make her pissy. I know I have a hard time finding words when I'm upset and that makes me even more upset because I feel like a stuttering babbling idiot. In my head it looks almost like a moving van gogh masterpiece of nonsense.... How do you find words for that? Especially when it's happening in the moment? Also, a lot of the time, when I get THAT upset.... I am almost never really upset about what just happened, that's just the point where I cracked. I'm really bothered by 500 other smaller things and 7 medium sized things that's just making me overwhelmed. So I wouldnt really focus on what upset her today, it may be more along the lines of the whole fucking month has been bullshit for one reason or another and she snapped today. And she'll be over it tomorrow. And you'll both be ok. Because if there's anything an ISTJ is good at, it's being ok after a blow up. 
1	That's fine too. I mean, she's your sister, it's not like she's going any where. And if she does open up, hear her, she may not need advice or solutions, she may just need to be heard. Ranting is good for the soul. I don't have a sister but I hear they make good rant partners. Just spewing whatever bullshit you want to without fear of judgement or ridicule, getting all that "stuff" off your chest so you can approach it again with a fresh mind and heart. 
1	you will argue, because you are 2 different ppl with two different minds, and if any two ppl always agree, that means one of them isnt thinking. And I assume your both thinking ppl. It's not uncommon for 13 yo girls to have depression... I had it, my daughter had it, my mom had it, hell, I think everyone I know was depressed from age 12 to 16. And those depressed girls make sure everyone in their house is depressed too. That's not ISTJ, that's teenage girl. Of course, severities differ and all, but some depression is normal. 
1	wish i knew this would resolve so many arguements with my ISTJ dad
11	Is this potentially ISTJ guy interested (ENFP Female)?	Confused as to whether this (possibly) ISTJ guy I like is interested in me. For some background, when we first met, I had to be the one to introduce myself to him. Managed to do some small talk where he asked questions about myself back, but I felt as if I had to be the one to extend the conversation. Later that night, I asked a friend of his what he thought of me, and my friend promised to ask him. So, the second time I see him, my friend tells me that apparently he thought I was really attractive, and says that he's probably interested and that I should give it a shot. We all go out to a club, and I notice that this guy I like is sober and sort of lingering in the back by himself. Eventually, my friends decide to leave the both of us alone and he asks if I'd like to get a drink with him. When we get our drinks we go outside to have a conversation, and this is where things start to get confusing....\n\nI'm used to guys being the one to lead you around, and initiating most of the action (For instance, I do think its worth noting that earlier I had to be the one to ask if he had instagram and he enthusiastically gave me his account and followed me back immediately... Moving on tho...) I noticed that as we were walking to the smoking patio he kept following me around rather than the opposite... (generally speaking most guys I've interacted with would be the one to lead the way, hold your hand, or lightly drag your shoulder across the room from one end to the other).... So then, the conversation I had with him is like our very first where it's me just asking him questions about his interests, basic life story, and all this nonsensical small talk, and he occasionally gave some lengthy answers but once again he seemed rather silent and unemotional.. \n\nEventually I sort of get closer to him, like lightly lean against his arm as we're conversing (mainly because some guy rudely interrupted our conversation and tried to talk to me... wanted to give this stranger a signal that I was with someone else)... and he doesn't seem repulsed or seems to retaliate against my touch or anything... but there was no emotional response or reaction to the physical contact... I don't think I made him uncomfortable or anything because we continue the conversation as it was.. but later on when we're alone again and back at our halls (I'm in uni)... we decide to sit on the couch just to chill, I decide to lean my head against his shoulder and the same response... no reaction whatsoever... never asked me to stop cuddling, but he didn't reciprocate the physical contact either (with other guys usually more light displays of physical affection are returned like an arm around my waist or shoulder or something, but with this guy it's nothing...) I couldn't tell if I made him uncomfortable or whatnot? Maybe I came off as too strong with the light physical contact... but in the past I've never had a problem with guys feeling hesitant about that...
15	As he doesn't push you back when you touch him, I'd say he probably likes you and is just really nervous because he probably doesn't know how to react. It remembers me when I (an ISTJ) acted like a statue while a guy I used to date started touching and kissing me. I really wanted to do something but I just didn't know how to cope.\nSo I guess you could ask him why he doesn't do anything when you touch him and he will probably, over time, start acting like an actual human being and less like a fucking sculpture.
3	Yeah, we're not great at reading social cues, and the more subtle they are, the worse we miss them. We're also not great with small talk.\n\nIf you like him, tell him so, and be direct. If you want him to reciprocate the physical touching, tell him. Again, be direct.\n\nAnd when I say "be direct" I mean "if you're worried that it might be too blunt, say it."
2	This all seems perfectly normal to me. SOP for an ISTJ is to be reserved and stoic in all things, as emotion tends to get in the way. Not to say we're robots, inside his head things were probably going mental.\n\nIf you want this train moving faster, be more direct. Social queues and games aren't very effective with us. It's also worth noting that we make a big deal about relationships and you shouldn't push harder if you aren't serious.
2	I'd trust what his friend say.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nISTJs tend to be EXTREMELY nervous when someone shows interest in them that's beyond the friendship level. And if he is inexperienced in this "department" it'll be even more evident.  ISTJs are also honest and most of the time have no reason to lie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe doesn't push you back when you touch him or are close to him. It could be either due to not being familiar with the situation or that he genuinely likes you or both. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHim also following you is probably his way of showing interest. I think I did that when I show interest in a lady at a party and want to take things further than grinding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHim enthusiastically giving you his insta is actually relevant because he probably thinking that you're into him if you asked for contact, though phone #s would be better imo. Make sure you actually message him and text him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're gonna have to be initiating a lot at first until he gets the hang of things. Then he can take it over from there. Be gentle and soft cause dude's probably nervous as hell and don't want to fuck things up.
1	If i were you, to kinda chip away at his wall and find out more about his interest level in you, I would rely on texting. We don't read social cues or body language, small talk is unbearable, responding appropriately, especially to someone new, can be really hard for us. We are, however, really smart, interesting ppl, who have a lot to say. Texting takes out the social stuff that were no good at. You can get to know him better, and you can be open (blunt) with him about what your looking for and he will take those conversations and follow through whe your together.... But right now... He dont know what his next move should be. He's still shocked he got past the "staring til she talks to me" stage. 
1	I am ISTJ and from your description he seems interested. However you need to be more blunt and direct if you want a reaction out of him. On the other hand its totally understandable if his lack of reaction is turning you off. ISTJ and ENFP is as opposite as it can possibly get
2	What is your mbti and love style?	
1	ISTJ, 1. Quality time, 2. acts of service and 3. words of affirmation
1	I'm an INFP. My primary love languages are quality time & words of affirmation
1	ISTJ. Craving my presence, unconditional kindness, humor, amazing sex. 
0	just wondering how ISTJs would respond to this	If we count judgments of *moral obligation* out of the equation,\n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded.\n\nEDIT: phrasing
3	Without morals i don’t think you can objectively say murder is bad or wrong. It’s a bit like asking what makes [insert color here] the best color. You can’t answer without an opinion with the color question and you can’t answer without morals with the murder question.
2	My thought is that murder is fine if it prevents a more serious event (burglary, car jacking.) and not find if it is without due cause (killing unjustly just to kill) \nObviously if there is a less violent way to resolve a problem I’d explore that first. 
2	Maybe\n“fine” because we’re on a piece of dust floating around the cosmo and we’re all going to die. \n\nNot okay because you’re deciding when that person dies when it’s not your decision. 
1	The use of deadly force is allowed when used in the defense of the nation (invasion), in the defense of others (hostage rescue), and in self defense. Use of deadly force against the innocent and unarmed is never allowed. In addition to these three conditions, use of deadly force may be used by agents of the gov’t to prevent an escape, to prevent damage to property, or to prevent a terror attack.
1	1. Murder can be logically fine, if the end results are of greater impact ie killing one individual to save multiple lives. Or as self-defence and a few other reasons I agree with others have posted. \n\n2. Religion I guess idk and to maintain society and not become chaotic 
1	Murder is fine is when it's evident that someone wants to kill your ass and you kill that person in self-defense, or when a person is a really big threat to society and will not comply with police orders, or to prevent a more tragic event (i.e. terrorist attack, school shootings, from the opposition to win the war, etc.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMurder is more so morally wrong, unless the situation is one mentioned above. You're taking someone's right to live away from them. You're taking them away from their friends and family. However, sometimes it's warranted. There's really no logic to murder since in the state of nature, that wouldn't exist.
1	"Thou shalt not murder."\n"Love your neighbor as yourself."\nI believe morality is based on a transcendent being. That's it, really.
8	Any ISTJs dating or married to ISFJ? Does it get too boring?	Getting closer to ISFJ female, and it’s really up to me to move the relationship forward - if I would want to. One thing that makes me think is we are quite similar, with both being introverts, with both leading Si....\n\nFor those that have this kind of relationship- does it get boring? How do you overcome that? How do you grow & go out of comfort zone? Do you sometimes wish you were with someone more spontaneous? \n\nThanks ahead for the replies! 🙏🏼 
4	It doesn't get too boring if you make an effort to try new things every so often.  It's great to have someone else who appreciates having quiet nights in, just make sure you break your routine every now and then!
3	ISTJ here, I dated an ISFJ for 9 months and just started dating an ISTJ last month. It comes down to effort. Little things and big things. Both types notice the little things and see them as being sweet, while putting effort in doing different activities shows big things and helps break routine. Doesn’t have to be life altering, go out for a walk in the park, go out for some ice cream, watch a movie, etc. just go out and have some fun. Like any relationship once one party doesn’t put in any effort it will fall apart, my ISFJ didn’t want to put in the safe level of effort and commitment and it all went to hell fast.
20	ISTJs in group tasks	As an ISTJ still in school, whenever there are group tasks, 3 of the following either happens: \n\na) Do the whole thing myself and have it as a ‘back up’ assignment whilst everyone else wastes time \n\nb) Amongst a group of mostly introverts become the leader and delegate minimal tasks to others or tasks that I can’t do such as animating or keep all the important, big tasks for myself \n\nc) Advise the group leader on what we should do, providing information, research and advice \n\nHow do other ISTJs approach group tasks? \n
9	B mostly. \n\nIf no one wants to step up to lead, I will but I would much rather prefer to be in a supportive role. But if I think the leader isn’t doing it right and isn’t listening, I’ll take over instead with logic to support why. 
5	I opt out of I can, I literally asked the teacher if I could just work by myself. 
2	When I'm at work, usually it's a one person job, but sometimes there's a second person that's technically equal but I usually take the leadership role in those situations. Unless, of course, I'm working with a work beastie, then we just goof off while getting everything done in half the time so we can goof off some more. 
4	I would say I most closely do C. I have only lead a group assignment once, and that was because the leader was chosen randomly by the professor. It was honestly harder than I thought. Just reaffirmed my idea that I'm not the best at leading. I just had trouble simply trusting everyone to do their job and ended up doing more than I needed to. I would say I basically did B during this time, but like I said, tried to "help" everyone doing their part and ended up doing too much honestly. \n\nOverall, I didn't hate doing group projects honestly. I just MUCH preferred being a contributing member and not the leader. 
1	Don’t feel lazy, it’s not a competition. I was simply sharing my experiences. :-) \nMy intended major has been accounting/econ with the hopes of going into finance (either working as an analyst or financial planner) but that’s as far as I have gotten with it. 
1	Mostly C but sometimes A depending on the group. I rather support from the back than lead the project.
1	I have done all 3
9	Survey on Flirting behaviors and Personality	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
4	The bulk of this survey is not about flirting. 3 pages of personality test??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I quit. Too long. 
3	Wow was questioning whether to try this after reading other's comments about it being so long, but it's been very revealing so far. I didn't ever think about how bad I am at flirting frankly haha. Will finish soon!\n\nEDIT: So I'm onto the section on how well these fit my definition of flirting and I'm honestly confused, do people normally flirt with most of these methods? Especially ones like touching their butt/legs, asking if they want to have sex etc? I honestly could never see myself doing this, guess that's why I'm nowhere near the best flirter IMO ha.
1	That was interesting. Thank you.
1	Done! Good luck.
1	Sorry. I couldnt make it past the laundry list of demographic info collection
1	Done!
1	Try mentioning ahead of time that there’s 200+ questions
7	Any of y’all fall for an INFJ? If so, why?	
5	INFJs are getting so much hate recently, I love them as long as they don't get mad at me lmao
5	My boyfriend of 6 years is INFJ. Part of what I like most about him are how different we are in the ways we connect with people and I’ve been able to learn a lot from him and be inspired by him. He’s so considerate of all people and is a great communicator, whereas I am naturally not. He’s also a lot more decisive than I am and isn’t hesitant at all to stand up for what is right.
2	I wish I asked this of the last woman I was interested in. \n(I’m an INFJ)
1	I'll chime in with an ENFJ I just dated, if it helps. \n\nI fell for her because she was so different to me honestly. I had never dated someone so caring, intuitive and we had some of the best conversations of anyone I've dated as well. \n\nIt ended up not working because we were too different IMO. It was very refreshing coming from dating an INFP (I believe that was her type, it's been a couple years) to find someone that felt like we filled in any gaps each of us had. Unfortunately, [there were problems we couldn't agree on](https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/a6dlup/future_cohabitation_problem_with_enfj_so/), and her being flighty on things in general, which led to us basically drifting apart and we recently had an amicable breakup. We're still friends, and I honestly think it'll be nice to have basically my opposite type as a friend. \n\nHope this helped at least a little. 
1	From the other side: I'm INFJ in a 3+ year relationship with an ISTJ. I can't speak to *why* she loves and values me, it puzzles me sometimes. I feel so fortunate to have her in my life and it's hard to see myself from her POV. But there is no question that she loves me and that she pretty deeply values having me in her life. That is quite explicit between us. 
0	Ew no. Too much Fe and Ni.
8	Tips on handling stress as an ISTJ?	I am a teacher and this term I was promoted into the upper grades where the curriculum is different to what I'm used to, parents are a nightmare to deal with and the kids are doing terrible. To make up for my lack of experience I started cutting any fun out of my life and reduced my hours of sleep, that in turn affected my relationship and caused issues, which led to a breakup.\nStill I didn't improve as much, returned to smoking in an attempt to calm my nerves, to no avail.\nI'm feeling under fire, weekends are spent staring at social media unable to move a muscle, and lifting the blanket in the morning to go to work feels like bench pressing a 1000 pounds. \nWhat are the things I can do to reduce the stress levels in my life? Changing my workplace is not an option at this point.
8	I have to force myself to maintain a healthy work life balance otherwise I won't manage my stress well. That means I:\n\n1. Try to stick to a 40 hour work week (except when truly urgent projects need my time) \n2. Actively schedule "fun time" into my routine. "Fun time" has to be spent doing fun stuff, like gaming, working out, building something etc. No work allowed.\n3. Strictly follow my sleep schedule. Getting lazy in that area makes me tired (less productive) and more vulnerable to illness. \n4. Ditch all social media outright.  You can't waste time on Facebook without an account. I still come on reddit to kill time but it's not a problem for me.\n5. Eat right, even though I don't spend much time cooking. \n6. Stay active, including going outside. \n7. Don't worry about things that are outside my control. \n\nSee if you can get counseling. I hope this helps
4	My school district offers free counseling. Can you talk to a counselor? 
3	I've always felt setting up a routine can a bit daunting to begin with.\n Sure, it's someting to strive towards, but first, you need to start somewhere! Anywhere. Somewhere simple preferably.\n\nI suggest you meditate. This helps me when my head gets too fuzzy that I can't think strait.\n\nHide in the bathroom at work for 5 minutes, close your eyes and breathe (maybe find a closet if breathing in the bathroom is not so nice).\n\nDo the same at home, in the evening or weekends. Put down the phone/social media for 5 minutes. Get a meditation app, or set a timer if you must.\n\nAnd remember, meditation is like a shower. It doesn't matter if it was successful, or if you're good at it. What matters is that you do it.
5	It's so fucking cliche, but exercise is your friend in this realm. You'll need to establish a solid 20-30 minute workout routine and build that shit into your weekly activities - do this at least 3 days / week. For me, it's a combination of running and martial arts. I can't think straight unless I sweat a little each day. And it's very noticeable to me days when I don't get any exercise. It is a PITA to establish the habit, but once you're in the groove you will be happy you made the effort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as it being related to MBTI - I know that I am very much a creature of habit and really thrive in an environment heavily moderated by routine. I run M, W and F. And martial arts are T, W, TH and sometime Sat. It's just part of my daily routine now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMake the effort - you will be repaid in spades.
2	As a fellow istj I can relate to your situation. Meditation and breathing exercises helped me a lot. 
2	Cutting back fun was a good option for the time being because even if you go out to have fun, you wont have any with this weighing on you. Cutting back on sleep doesnt help anyone though - get your sleep schedule back on track.\n\nIf the curriculum is not something youre used to, then take time to master it until it becomes something you are so comfortable with you are more an expert than anyone else. \n\nAs for the parents and kids, i dont know what to say besides know your limits and boundries and make them clean. Set expectations and communicate them clearly. Clear regular communication to help the situation with bith the parents and the children.\n\nLastly, i think a therapist would help. You seem to be experiencing extreme anxiety and avoidance
2	Si values what is familiar so when an ISxJ gets a new job, it takes a bit for them to get used to their “new normal.” This uncertainty causes anxiety and stress. When an ISTJ is stressed about stuff, they tend to go catatonic and either sleep or numb themselves to hide from the stressor. The very best thing you can do to combat the nerves and stress is to work out! ISTJs are grounded, down to earth, physical people and they need to exert that nervous energy in order to get good sleep and focus on making the best of the new situation until it becomes Si-normal and you can be comfortable in the environment again. I hope everything works out for the best! I’m an ENFP so I’m all excited for your new opportunity, because of course I am. Haha 
2	Bottle it all up inside and tell no one!! At least that's how I manage.
2	I started consuming cannabis.  It is not for everyone but it has changed me in positive ways and helps with stress levels
2	> cutting any fun out of my life\n\nUnhealthy.\n\n> reduced my hours of sleep\n\nAlso unhealthy.\n\n> returned to smoking\n\nOK getting cancer might help your situation, long term /s\n\n> staring at social media\n\nBad for mental health.\n\nYes, you're overwhelmed. But you're responding to the stress with self-destructive behavior. Since you're an ISTJ, you should be able to set up a routine where you portion out time for yourself, relationships, and your job. For example, during the workday MAX OUT on your job. Once that's done, drop it and move on to the next thing (you time, for example.)
26	Lacking Emotional Connections	It feels like I'm watching people live their lives on a tv screen.\nI interact with the others, but it feels more like talking with non-playable characters in a Bethesda game.\nI suspected lacking empathy, which would indicate sociopathy. Having felt remorse in the past disqualifies this as a factor.\nWhen I read the ISTJ description about our difficulty regarding emotional connections, it hit me like a sledgehammer.\nHow do you maximize the human experience, while lacking a vital component of the human condition?\n\nEdit: I appreciate all of the responses. It's good to see that I'm not alone in this matter. I like the idea to express affection through acts of service. I intend to avoid mind altering substances, but I will definitely adopt a dog.
23	I find it hard to care about people and feel empathy until I know them. That obviously doesn't mean I'm a rude and selfish person, but rather that I do what I do because I think it's right rather than because I feel empathetic.
14	Hello there. \nI’m an INFJ male raised by an ISTJ mom, and just left a relationship with an INTJ female; there are somethings that I would like to share: \n\n1. You are capable of empathy, and expressing emotions, you just need to learn how. \n2. Love and affection are not the same thing. When I was younger, my mom showed love by making sure things were taken care of. She maintained the house, and prepared us for life. She’s not the affectionate kind. In fact I remember trying to cuddle with her as a boy and she would respond as if I was a stranger sleeping next to her in coach, leaning on her shoulder. But I knew that she loved me. She showed she loved by meeting all my non-emotional & psychological needs. \nAfter we took the love languages test as a family, I learned that my mom loves to receive love and give it via Acts of Service. understanding that she was an ISTJ, the emotional dynamics of Te/Fi, with her love language, it was glaringly clear to see in retrospect that she loved her children dearly. So dearly. We just didn’t know it at those times. \nWe all have superior work ethics compared to any of our peers, none of her children are lazy, we all know how to adapt with little, and we can make a dollar out of 15 cents. \nShe sent her love into our future. She made sure she trained us to be capable of training ourselves should the time come when she wouldn’t be around. \nShe did well. \nAll of her children (INFJ, ESTP, INTP) are well developed in Fe (my Fe is quite contagious 😬), so being raised by an iron hand, Te adept, single (dad left the picture, so you know how bitter ISTJs can behave sometimes), West-African mom , it was easy so compare her to some \nmeanie-mom fictional character. \n\nLove the way you know how, even if you can’t say those words, or you don’t like affection. And learn to be okay with hugs and kisses from someone who doesn’t know how to manage their life. \n\nBe aware that if you shun some forms of love (provided it’s appropriate) from some people- it can close that door of affection forever. My mom made that mistake with all 3 of us. \n\n\n3. Know your love language. And practice speaking other languages. \n\n4. Show love as best as you can to those that matter. Do it comfortably, don’t force it. Be honest if you’re in a relationship, tell your SO that you’re trying to learn to love. Ask for patience from them. The seed of such honesty can grow into a forest of expression, understanding, affection, love, gentleness, and kindness so rich that the fruits there of will change your life even if you two break up. \n\n5. Hangout with people you want to be like. Sometimes you’ll have to go through the motions in order to prime the pump.\n\nI don’t know if what I have said helps, but I have expressed all of this with sincerity of heart.\n\n\nI’m happy to answer any questions. \n
10	Yup. It’s so hard for me to care or show empathy. It took me a while to show my closest family members how much they mean to me. 
4	I struggle with showing any kind of emotion, and I struggle with reading others. I've recently been trying to force myself to show my feelings towards my family. My mother has been really supportive recently, and I feel the urge to say "I really appreciate this". But I've just said thanks and so on... it's hard man..
4	1. Quality of friends over quantity.\n2. Get a dog.
2	I struggle with showing any kind of emotion, and I struggle with reading others. I've recently been trying to force myself to show my feelings towards my family. My mother has been really supportive recently, and I feel the urge to say "I really appreciate this". But I've just said thanks and so on... it's hard man..
2	I have a rather strange strategy that I think I can only get away with because I smile a lot and am very non-threatening, but I hug practically everyone I know (other than people at work, though I hug a lot of them too). \n\nFrom the moment I meet them I tend to try to greet people with a hug. I have developed multi-stage and tailored hugs for different levels of friendliness and different ways other people hug back. The amount of comments I get on my hugging skills I wish I could make it a career.\n\nI find it very difficult to warm up to people and that makes it difficult for people to warm up to me. However, by using such a very personal, warm, welcoming gesture and making it a normative, non-invasive, non-judgmental action, I have found that it has lead to people being very warm in return and this accelerates a closer connection to others.\n\nThe closer I feel with others the greater my empathy is and the greater I feel a deep sense of affection for my friends. \n\nThere may also be something to say about doing acid and MDMA and how they may or may not have restructured my brain. I feel I have shifted more towards being an ISFJ over the past few years. 
2	Ask more questions. Get to know people. Dive deep into life and enjoy each bite
2	I find it hard to really care about others beyond sympathy/empathy and giving out solutions. Don't get me wrong, I do care but at the same time I'm too scared to get further involved.\n\nI guess the way I maximize human experience is by putting myself out there whenever I feel brave enough and go from there. If a stranger approaches me asking for directions, I help. If a classmate need help with hw and I'm free, I help. \n\nWith close friends, we have more intimate conversations like goals, political beliefs, etc. But all that feeling and vulnerability topic I try to keep them to myself. \n\nOne of my RAs said "if you can't cry in front of your friends, then you'll struggle with forming bonds" or somewhere along those lines.
2	I felt the same way for a long time, but now, I have embraced the lack of empathy aspect of my life and have become an enthusiastic spectator in most things. I don't miss having expressive emotions and all, most of the time I'm thankful I don't have them. My poker face is my strongest defense mechanism. I do love going out and watching people experience those things that I dont have though. 
2	> It feels like I'm watching people live their lives on a tv screen\n\nSame. It rarely feels like anything (outside of romantic relationship stuff) touches me. \n\n> How do you maximize the human experience\n\nBasically, fake it! Other humans don't appreciate empathy as much as they appreciate *empathetic behavior*. For example, validate people's feelings (usually by listening to them and then replying with "So you feel <insert a rewording of what they just told you>. Makes sense." etc.\n\nThe great thing about this is because as an ISTJ you're basically a robot that happens to be human, you can do this on autopilot.\n\nObviously there's far more to this than what I said, but one step at a time ;)
2	ENFP with ISTJ colleague	Hey Guys, already posted in mbti but my Post doesn't appear. Maybe you can Help me?\n\nSo, this colleague of Mine is usually not very complicated, which is something that I value highly.\n\nBut lately he is trying to tell me something and I really don't get it. I think (!) He wants to tell me that I annoy him in some way. When I approach him about it He says, I should Not worry, it is his Problem (after specifically mentioning, that something is "boiling" within him concerning me and him lashing out at me once because of it. He also mentioned that He didn't like himself doing that).\n\nWell I am greatly confused and ask him If we do have a conflict that needs resolving. He says no, we don't, but He will start practicing something on me.\n\nGuys, I am so confused. This is like the chinese sign room for me, the only thing I can do is stfu about it and I am very Bad at that leaving stuff unresolved. But I really know that to keep asking him now will make everything worse. 😂\n\nSo my Last straw is asking other ISTJs on here: wtf, guys? What's the problem? 😂
4	If I had to guess, I’d say that there *is* probably something about you he doesn’t like.\n\nHe seems to feel that saying it out loud would only make the work situation worse.\n\nHe probably thinks it’s something that you wouldn’t be able or willing to change even if he brought it up, and therefore bringing it up would only make things worse.  \n\nThat, or it’s something small that just annoys him more than it should for some reason and he’s realized that the way he feels about it is an overreaction.  He might think that he would not be being reasonable in bringing it up.\n\nIt would help to know what he “lashed out” at you for.\n\nThis is just a wild guess and there’s no reason to think this about you, but, when I worked with some ENFP’s in the past, I felt like they sometimes pushed off work on other people too much (often in the form of asking favors or for what I saw as unnecessary “help”). 
2	Put on your thickest skin, and then say this:\n\n"I'm pretty sure there is something about me that bothers you. I know you don't want to talk about it, but I want to try to fix it. Please tell me what it is so I know what I need to fix."\n\nHe either still won't tell you, or he will tell you very bluntly and hurt your feelings.
2	Look... Sometimes ppl are annoying as fuck, but it's not that your personally doing anything wrong, there's just something about you that wears on his nerves to no end. It may be the tone of your voice, something super benign like that... And that really isn't your problem. That is the problem of the person who is annoyed. We tend to be really fair minded about things and realize that if we're annoyed about something benign, we need to adjust our attitude rather than expecting you to stop doing something that's not harmful. Hell get over it soon enough. Just give him time.

7	Showing you that you are special to me	I am an infp(f), dating an istj(m). He recently told me that he doesn't see/believe that he is special to me because a lot of the things I do to show him I care, I do for other people, too, in terms of going out of my way to make them happy or hanging out with them. I want to adjust and focus more of my care and attention to him, but idk if that will be enough, and if there is anything more I can do or say to convince him that I do care about him and that I want to be with him. \n\nHe also says he can't believe I would still want to be with him even after the times he has hurt me, and I don't know how to convince him that I have completely forgiven him and that those things don't make me sad anymore because I believed his apologies. I told him these things, and more, but he is still unhappy, and I'm wondering if there is a way, whether that be words or actions, to prove to him that he is special to me and that I'm not going anywhere.
9	mmm unfortunately i dont think this is a personality type thing, its more about the individual and their love language! maybe make him take a love language test? otherwise simple ways i like to be shown affection is when my so takes interest in my life, shares things with me, tells me they love me, spends time with me, maybe some compliments
2	At the most simple level, if he does not want to be happy and is conflicted about his feelings, you can't do anything on your own to help him sort out his inner world directly. If you want him to sort these things out then the best thing you can do is be there for him as support and maybe let him figure it out while he talks to you (or give him space to figure it out on his own if he needs that). It's up to him to be there for himself, trying to rely on someone to feel whole usually doesn't go well.
2	I would say that this is a very internal (Si-Fi) thing. You have completely forgiven him, but he has not completely forgiven himself. Words of reassurance are effective to a point, but what he needs is time. 
2	the previous comment about love languages is certainly something to consider, and on that note, you might want to look at the apology languages as well. some people don't take apologies the same way as others. you might have forgiven him, but if he has a different apology language, then he could still feel guilty (and he might also be holding something against you, perceiving that you haven't "apologized" for it "properly" yet). but yeah, what the others said it also true; and this is an issue he will likely need to work through over time. therapy can be useful for that. 
2	Not sure if this is helpful or not, but I have this conversation with my INTJ husband of 12 years sometimes. He says he shows his love by doing nice things, and I think they are all either things he is responsible for doing or that he would do for anyone because he's a really nice guy. There's nothing that's just for me.\n\n\nI also don't understand why he's still with me. I mean, I'm grateful, but I don't get it. Maybe I will never understand. But I just accept that he is and try to work on being the person he deserves.
9	Jobs for ISTJ teens?	I'm thinking about getting a job this summer and am wondering what would be a good summer job for an ISTJ. Preferably something that doesn't put me in front of customers.
14	I worked at a library shelving books throughout some of high school and eventually at the checkout counter. I loved it!
7	I truly think interacting with people is a skill that needs to be trained and that customer service work can be a humbling but necessary experience for our growth. Now I'm not saying to be a cashier or anything like that - but make sure that you aren't forcing yourself to never grow by the jobs that you choose. For example - I work as a bus driver for my school and it's great. I provide a necessary service and it forces me to interact with people and serve the public - overall a very fulfilling job that has developed me as a person while also not being mentally exhausting (such as a store customer service job). Working these types of jobs also teach you to treat working staff with respect and dignity, which is invaluable 
5	I know you said that you don't want to work with customers, but keep in mind that being able to work with people you don't know or perhaps don't even like is a skill that can really set you apart in any career.  A temporary summer job may be the perfect opportunity to learn this while the stakes are low.
3	I worked at a bike repair/tour shop for a summer and ended up really liking working with my hands to make repairs or do routine maintenance. There was still a customer service element to it (which is pretty much unavoidable for entry level-type summer jobs) but it wasn't as much as something like retail or tutoring. 
3	I hated people until I got a retail job in a photolab. It was a good mix of working in the lab and talking to people. Ended up getting really good at showing old folks through their cameras.
2	So this depends on what you like and what you want out of a summer job - some of my favourite summer jobs involved straight manual labour, because it helped me stay in shape during the school year, but bricklaying isn't for everyone. \n\nIn terms of a job that's a good fit for an analytical personality type, I'm a big fan of tech support work, odds are there's a call centre in your area that's looking for people to answer tech questions. Having done that kind of work, I found that talking to people on the phone was a lot easier than in person, and it feels like solving puzzles. 
2	Working a summer camp for kids? I did it and loved it! 
1	just my two cents, but as a teen that wasn't the biggest fan of talking to new people, the best summer job I had was working a gas station;\n1) talking to customers can be tiring if on till 8 hours straight but it's damn good experience for faking conversation skills in real life.\n2) lots of routines and tasks that needed to be taken care of (stocking, cleaning, inventory etc. )\n3) customers (and often co-workers) can do dumb things and provide you with unlimited anecdotes for all your future social interactions.\n..Spent ~2 years working there, and possibly would have been longer if the old management wasn't replaced by really inexperienced owners.
1	If you want minimal customer interaction and a summer/temp position, try retail or night stocking at any large establishment. You typically work off hours, have days to yourself, get a little bump in pay (shift differential), and might not ever even see a customer only fellow coworkers. 
1	I used to work at my brother’s seafood restaurant. He hired the ISTJ girl that lives next door. Such an exceptional worker. As much as I don’t really click with ISTJs (I’m an INTP), they are terrific employees. If I ever own a business, ISTJs will be at the top of my list when searching for workers. Good luck with the job hunting!
1	I always followed my interests. \nWe owned a bookstore when I was growing up so I could learn about my interests by reading. \nIn my mid teen years I started a job as a photographer for a newspaper. Then as I neared 19 I worked as an admin assistant for a team of real estate agents. After that I worked in law enforcement. My point is follow your interests and you will find jobs/ways to make money doing what you enjoy.
2	"Offense to Truth"	
3	Why did you post this on ISTJ?
14	My boss thinks I'm not honest	My boss is an ENTJ. He thinks that I am trying to pull one over him all the time. For instance, I had a project that I had to work on that involved processing files. It was an urgent project. He asked for an estimate to get the project done and I said a week based on how much time it took me initially. Now, I've always learned to give myself a buffer--it stops me from overpromising and burning out too hard in case trouble arises. The number of files I had to process were in the hundreds as opposed to a handful that I usually get.\n\nI made the process extremely efficient ended up processing those files 2-3 days earlier than expected. I stayed late for 1.5 hours one night just to get some extra work in. When he asked for an update two days later, I mentioned that I finished it and he was surprised--not in a good way. I shrugged it off because I got the work done right?\n\nA week later we have a meeting and he points out this specific scenario as an example that "[you] don't know how to manage your time" and that "[you] don't know what [you're] doing if I'm giving timelines like this". And that he can't trust me on this project because I don't know how to organize myself because my timing appears to be extremely off? I'm paraphrasing.\n\nI don't get it. I got the work done earlier than expected so I can pass it off to someone else to start. What's the issue? Sure, I overestimated, just so I can provide a buffer. And yes, I powered through given the urgency of this project. And I didn't lie.\n\nShould I have just twiddled my thumbs and not doing anything for an extra 2-3 days? Should I just have lied about the progress of the project?
7	Overestimating by 16-24 hours is quite a bit, but you were honest.\n\nHas you boss tasked you with something similar in the past?
8	I was wondering why he only found out it was finished when he asked for a status update. Did you really only finish it a few minutes before he asked? \n\nI get not wanting to over promise and under deliver, but the over estimating the time it takes is an issue as well, especially if you work in a team environment and the manager is trying to balance workload. If it’s going significantly faster than you had anticipated, you can give your boss status updates to keep them in the loop. \n\nIt kind of reminds me of the time we had to go to a house to meet a dog they were fostering. My husband insisted we had to show up **30 minutes** early, because of what his mom drilled into his head as a child, to make a *good* impression as this was essentially the interview. \n\nGuess what? The wife who was responsible for fostering wasn’t home as they were still at soccer with their kid. The husband let us in, but really couldn’t answer any questions and didn’t feel comfortable showing the dog. So she got in at the agreed upon time but by that point it felt like we were overstaying our welcome, so we left 10 minutes after. Needless to say, we never got approved for the dog. \n\nBeing late is disrespectful, so showing up 5-10 minutes early is ok, but showing up too early shows a complete lack of awareness of what anyone else has going on too. 
3	Have you explained to him how you arrived at your estimate and why you were able to complete the work faster than the estimate?
3	If you overestimate by a couple of hours, it's no big deal. If you overestimate by several days, you should let your boss know the next day at the latest. I think it's better to overestimate on hours, but there's a limit; if it's your first project of this sort, it's natural that you could overestimate by a significant margin, but not letting your boss know that you've finished two or three days early feels almost deceitful. What was your rationale for not telling them?
3	Proactively communicate; Dont wait for him to ask for an update. \n\nGive him an update when there is an update because it can be seen like youre sitting on work that still needs to be done even though it doesnt... And that can seem like youre hiding it. I can see where his mistrust is coming from.\n\nInstead of him being upset by thinking he caught you in some sort of lie, communicate and let him be impressed with your progress
3	I'm a developer, I've both under and over estimated by months before.\n\nSometimes it just can't be helped.
2	Out of curiosity is your boss billing someone for your time? Like is this work part of a contract with billable hours or something like that?
2	I don't think you should have lied. I think it's unreasonable that you should have a perfect idea of a timeline. I do think that you should have gone to him as soon as you were done and let him know it was finished, and say "i found out a way to make it more efficient, so it took less time than I thought". That might be some of the disconnect - if you don't tell him when you were done and had waited another 3 days to let him know that you were done, he would think you're being dishonest because you were just trying to get out of doing any work for those 3 days, and clearly didn't understand the urgency of the project.
1	This isn’t a personality issue anymore then your boss just being an unreasonable and backwards asshole. 
1	They’re looking for fault.

4	Am I accurate in my understanding/description of ISTJ "predicting based on past experiences" here? How and how not?	Hi ISTJs. I just posted a comment in another sub [Tangent, actually some of you might be interested in checking that out too, it's new and called r/NoNonsenseMBTI and so far seems way more sane than r/mbti]. \n\nAnyway, as the title says, I'm curious to get your take on my accuracy (or not) of my understanding/description of ISTJ "predicting based on past experiences" in my description. \n\nPasting below some excerpts. The original comment, which includes the compare and contrast with my process as an INFJ is [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNonsenseMBTI/comments/arykeo/weekly_discussion_thread_2182019/egqut2a/).\n\n------------------------------\n\n**Context**\n\n>My SO (ISTJ) and I (INFJ) are entering a phase of figuring out whether we should take a really significant step in our relationship. Typical for us, we're being cautious. Each in our own ways. She's ISTJ enneagram 9 (not sure the wing). I'm INFJ enneagram 6w5.\n\n>One thing that has come up for us both is that we each have our way trying to predict whether it is likely to be okay for us to do this... and in our discussion, the fundamental unreliability of 100% certain prediction of whether it will actually work out for us. Like, there is a point at which deciding based on our modes of prediction doesn't work. Nonetheless, we each have thing about prediction and our own ways of trying to do it.\n\n>We both require information, but of different kinds.\n\n-------------------------\n\n**My attempts at description of what it is for her, based on my understanding thus far:**\n\n>For her, prediction is built on a build-up of everyday experiences with me over time, which in turn is layered on what she has experienced in past relationships. For her, then, trying to predict if this step will be okay requires time for adding more everyday experience with me. I'm not sure if I'm describing it accurately here, doing the best I can though.\n\nand\n\n>So the upshot is - time is important to us both, but for different reasons. ... For her, the time itself is at the core - just having the ongoing lived experience of us together in the details of everyday life and checking internally if that sits well with her for a more serious commitment than we have right now.** \n\nand\n\n>I can't really imagine what it's like internally to try to make decisions in a predictive way based on an accumulation of everyday experience in the past and present. Because for me, the future is just its own part of a landscape and it is arranged however it is arranged - it doesn't naturally arrange itself in past-harnessed terms of what comes before it. There's not a straight line there, in my perception. For her, though, that lived experience is solid and the best way for her to try to predict what is mostly likely to happen. For me, there are links between points in time, but nothing that can reliably be used predictively from the accumulated details of everyday experience. But I see that for her, this is real and solid and important. \n\n\n--------------------\n\nIf you'd be willing to share: What do you think, how am I doing with understanding and describing this correctly? What am I missing or not seeing right? I welcome your thoughts and comments!
8	I don’t really want to say that I speak for all ISTJs, but I relate to her. I don’t really understand how you wouldn’t use past experiences to predict things. \n\nPeople have patterns. It’s easiest to know how to act if I recognize the patterns. The more time I spend with someone, the more I see their patterns. If it doesn’t hold with what I’ve seen previously, it does throw me off. That’s learning though. \n\nI would definitely say that the longer I’m around someone with no red flags, the more comfortable I am. 
2	Whoever that is isn't the 1st person to experience this issue. Many people can't seem to fathom pattern interpolation and extrapolation; it's like describing color to someone born blind.\n\nThat said, ISTJs and other extrapolators have to bear in mind that the future can't be predicted, and just because a situation is *likely* to turn out in a certain way doesn't mean it *will*. In other words, give things a chance.\n\nNow, obviously, there are some life changing events - such as having kids - from which there's no turning back. I've seen quite a few people who weren't cut out to be parents jump headlong into that, and they're just miserable.\n\nThere's no right answer here. You have to find the right balance between extrapolation and giving things a chance. One of the unsung things about relationships is how much negotiation they involve. It can take months or even *years* for a couple to finally be on the same page regarding something.\n\nOne thing I will say is that **BOTH partners must be totally onboard for major life steps**, otherwise you risk creating resentment that destroys the relationship over time. Do NOT proceed if there's any doubt by either partner (this is where the negotiation above comes in.)
1	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)\n\n&#x200B;

8	I’m a homebody. I found my partner through a dating app because I don’t like crowds and spend all my time at home when I’m not at school, work, or running errands. My out-of-the-house hobbies are hiking and choir, so maybe figure out a hobby you want to share with someone and look there? There’s no like one place ISTJs hang out, it depends on their unique personality.
6	ISTJ here. I regularly go out on the weekends... dinners with friends, bars, sometimes clubs.\n\n
3	My hobbies are martial arts and pottery. I see a lot of variety of people in these classes even though the activity itself is mostly solitary. 
3	Pretty much any place where ISTJs need to be, where it involves our hobbies, and maybe hanging out with friends. Work & home are definites.
2	Movies, museums, the zoo, the arboretum
1	I go to the bar, usually alone, and enjoy watching the madness that is everyone else and make snide ass remarks while drinking my beer. I'm also found on dating apps. If you don't get filtered out as creepy or undesirable I'll invite you to the bar with me... But if your super clingy and stuff it won't happen twice. 
1	Here's how to find an ISTJ or ISTJ-like lady:\n\nLook for a woman with a senatorial, hawk-like, or aquiline presence. She'll be standing straight upright, smiling politely (if at all) and apparently detached from what's happening around her. As in, she's fully aware of what's happening, but she's somehow above it all. \n\nApproach her directly. Do not try to hide your interest; ISTJs don't have time for coyness and she'll already have made her mind up about whether to give you a chance within the 1st 30 seconds anyway.\n\nNow to actually talk to her. Do NOT use a pickup line. From your observation of her, there might be something she considers important. If she's wearing a t-shirt with a logo, ask about it ("Is that a CrossFit t-shirt?" "Dell, huh? I didn't realize they're in town, what do they do here?") Keep the conversation about something concrete, but the tone positive and energetic. The point here is to have a stimulating conversation about something of consequence to *her*.\n\nInject parallel details about yourself ("I went to a conference like that too!") etc. At the very least this should get you her number/contact details over the course of 15 min or so.\n\nAll the best!
0	Church . Istj females are big with religion. 
1	What do guys think of Enfp's?	Especially the male ones? 
7	Annoying, to be honest.
3	Have a lot of close ENFPs in my life - my brother, a good friend, and now my SO. Tbh I've never been annoyed by a person's ENFP-ness until my SO. Just because I'm an ISTJ doesn't mean I don't need some air time! And God I wish his friends weren't so important to him. My friends are important to me too, but between us it's like a me versus his friends thing which hurts tbh.
2	Fun and exhausting. 
2	One of my best friends is an ENFP, whom I\`ve known for 3 and a half years. Even though I think of him as unstructured and messy, I\`ve learned to appreaciate our differences. He likes to say a lot of things out of nowhere and tell me what he\`s doing, which I don\`t really know why he\`s telling me all of those things. There are way more examples of how we act different from each other but I am very glad to know him and ENFPs can make for great friends for ISTJs if their natural differences are acknowledged and respected.  
2	I don't think of enfp's
4	I thought male ENFPs were a myth. Like female Dwarves or male Elves...\n\nSeriously, though, my older sister is probably an ENFP, but my only certain exposure to ENFPs has been from trolling y'all's sub.\n\nY'all seem to be very high strung, but y'all wouldn't be too bad if/when you settle down a bit.
1	That answer was to be expected 
6	ENFP here, how to approach an ISTJ?	I recently met an ISTJ, we hit it off really well, I have never met someone so structured in my life, it really piqued my curiosity and things started to speed up in our romantic relationship. But out of the blue, He’s told me that he can’t keep up, so we’ve had a break with no contact this last week. It was honestly really hard for me, but I knew that he needed the space to recuperate. I waited patiently for him to contact me when he’s ready and he did so today and we’re meeting tomorrow.\n\nShould I listen to my gut and stop seeing him, if my ENFP energy is too much for him? Or should I keep exploring the possibility. As complete opposite people, are we too different to make a romantic relationship work? How do ISTJ approach the decisions to become exclusive? Because from what I’ve observed it does not seem to be driven by his feelings.\n\nEdit: we had a really good talk about where we’d like to go from here, and we’ve both agreed we are very different and it would take a lot of work romantically. Oddly enough, we both enjoy each other’s company and have now blossomed our relationship into a savage, brutally honest friendship that I am loving way more than when there was romantic pressure to be super considerate of each other. I feel liberated to express freely without holding back and he feels no pressure to react to my every thought because I don’t put that pressure on my friends. Thank you for all the great insight into this personality! I would say my curiosity for the ISTJ is still not quenched, you guys have so many qualities I admire! I will definitely tone it down if another ISTJ comes into the romantic ring.
16	I'm not going to say whether you should stop seeing him, but maybe I'll give a bit of insight as an ISTJ that'll help you figure it out yourself. \n\nWhen I hang out with an ENFP friend I generally need to "prepare" myself. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but ENFPs can easily be too much for ISTJs. Rather than one significantly changing to accommodate the other, I think the best approach is for the two to meet somewhere in the middle. As the ENFP this'll mean taking things slower than you might normally like, not spending as much time together as you'd like, etc.. \n\nThis may be hard for you, but I'd like to remind you of a few things in preparation for if you do go ahead with this relationship: \n\nISTJs like to take a bit of time to think things through, especially for the bigger decisions in life. Right now I'm in the process of choosing a new phone to buy - I've already spent 3 days researching, and I'm not even done yet. Relationship decisions would take even longer...\n\nSometimes he'll need space. This could mean lots of things, but most of the time he'll want alone time - not that he doesn't want to spend time with you - time with himself and for himself. \n\nWith regards to how an ISTJ might make that decision, it is partly driven by feelings but not exclusively. There are practical implications to any relationship and if I think that our lifestyles/dreams/preferences are different enough then that may be enough grounds for me to reject that relationship. But you've probably thought about that already. 
7	At least for me (fellow ISTJ) I decide to continue to relationship based on how things have gone. Is the person good for as in do they add more than they take from my life? What was/is my initial feelings about them? If I had any moment of “I like them I’m keeping them around” then I decide that I’m in it, I’m not bailing.\n\nEnfp’s ARE too much for istjs lol but one of my most rewarding relationships (although platonic) was with an enfp, changed my life for the better.\n\nAllowed me to view things in a different way at times, allowed me to experience what it was like when you’re a bit chaotic. Made me appreciate differences as well as the way I was. Bc I could not handle being an enfp that’s for sure.\n\nCommunication is important especially bc the thought process used differs and things may be interpreted differently from time to time.\n\nIstj’s are slow, we don’t move as fast as you, we need to THINK a lot before feeling mildly comfortable with something. And we also don’t express or communicate as much as we should and as much as you.\n\nIf you can work with those qualities then go for it! Good luck op
3	Id never advise an ENFP to *not* trust their gut, but I should ask: what are you looking for in a relationship? \n\nQuite a few of my friends and relitives are ISTJ/ENFP couples and the match works out amazingly... But an ISTJ isnt someone an ENFP has a super fun fling with; An ENFP settles down with an ISTJ. If youre still young, you may not be ready for an ISTJ relationship\n\nFor his part, you just need to give him time to process things *internally*... He needs to feel his feelinings, think through them, and come to a conclusion about how he feels/thinks - and he needs time to process all that without distraction
3	The brutal honesty approach may actually be a boon when dealing with ISTJs. Knowing where you stand on matters makes our job of calculating the situation easier. Just remember if you get romantic with one, it's serious business from our side of things. I'm sure hanging out with your friend will make it more apparent after some time.
2	I've had several ENFP friends and even though we hit it off, it doesn't really make for a lasting friendship in my experience. We are simply too different. I don't think opposites attract. You guys really are too much, even though you're great optimistic people, but just as a duo? Seems sketchy. What seem as charming traits at first will get annoying in the long run, and finding you have to suppress yourself is going to turn into resentment. With all that being said, I do think you should go give it a try because not everyone follows mbti stereotypes and there are multiple personality aspects that you two may be compatible with, and it's still possible you share things in common. 
2	For me, when approaching a relationship, I tend to place myself just outside the boundaries of relationship status for as long as I can. I watch all the dynamics between us and stuff. Examine all the feelings, yours and mine. And, really, if I'm satisfied with the quasi relationship status (we're together but not bf/gf) I'll stay there indefinitely. I'll be ok with a status change if it's necessary, but I'm in no hurry to do it. And if I do, ima need a damn good reason to do so. Your gonna have to be Hella special to me to commit to changing my routine and including you in my life everyday. 
2	/u/swaylyn, /u/thekashdaddy, /u/AttackYuuki, /u/amplifiedrain:\n\nI'm not OP nor am I ENFP. But I am quite interested in hearing more about the ISTJ internal process of experience over time as related to decisions about relationship seriousness. My ISTJ SO openly talks with me about this but we're in a pretty intensive phase right now and we have so SO many other things to discuss as well, and I feel like more information from other ISTJs could also help me really grasp what it is internally as info-processing.\n\nI don't want to hijack this thread, and I don't know if it would be annoying for me to put up a separate discussion on r/istj (I mean, all these non-ISTJs asking for the ISTJ perspective here has got to get wearing, yeah? or if PM discussions would be better or what. But I would love to do some brain-picking of anyone who'd be willing to allow that. Would PM or a separate thread work for any of you?\n\nalso, /u/sicamngo, how would you feel about me having a discussion about this in your thread given that it might be of thread-hijacking nature given your initial intent?
12	How to actually get out and meet people as an ISTJ.	I (20 M) want to get out and meet people. More specifically girls. Right now I basically come home from work and do stuff on the internet until I go to bed. Then I wake up, go to the gym, go to work repeat. \n\nOnly time I really go out is when I go grocery shopping. It's not that I'm afraid of people or anything. I just have no interest in doing anything else. I literally cannot think of a single hobby I would be interested in that involves others.\n\nThe only way I can think of meeting girls is by talking to store employees. But, I know this would be seen as annoying after awhile, and they are just trying to do there jobs. There are no girls where I work, so that's off the table. Online dating has yielded a few matches but no dates as of yet. Meeting girls through friends hasn't worked out too well either, as those girls don't really seem interested.\n\nI understand that to meet girls means I must meet people. If I go out to just meet girls, that will get me no results. However my motivation to meet more people is to meet girls. Kind of a catch 22. I heard about volunteering, but I'm not really passionate about a cause, and if I join a group to meet girls, and there are no girls, then it is waste and not something I can commit to.\n\nI work full time (in a career, not just a job.) I'm not in school. I've been told that I'm a 7/10. On a bad day maybe a 6. My work takes up most of my time, and a lot of my experiences are from my job. Aside from doing stuff on the internet I have no real hobbies. Last girlfriend I had was when we were both in middle school.\n\nI was hoping some of you could give me suggestions to meet people, mainly girls, that I may have missed. Something which fits with being an ISTJ.
11	Im on 4 different dating sites. Now, tbh, I'm definitely not an average dating sort of person, but I know how to meet ppl on the dating sites.\n\n 1. Don't try to meet everyone you talk to. You gotta spend some time weeding out the crazies and undesirables. \n\n2. Don't get discouraged if someone stops talking to you. They aren't required to like you anymore than your required to like them.\n\n3. If you do get to the meeting point, don't go in looking for a relationship. Go in looking for a person, a friend, an acquaintance, etc. That's a lot of pressure to meet someone who's sizing you up for wife material. Nor should you accept that from someone else.\n\n4. Don't stop looking just because you start talking to one person. She might not pan out, and that's OK... No reason to start your search from scratch.\n\nOnline dating is great for us. Most conversations are over text. You can talk as much as you want. If they're too chatty and annoying... Block they're ass and never deal with them again. 
10	For some reason, as ISTJs we consider ourselves boring and uninteresting and common, when really we have extremely active inner worlds and our takents only seem ordinary because they are so common to *us* personally. You are more awesome than you think.\n\nWhat are you passionate about? What could you talk for hours about? What are you an expert in? What do you value? ...these are important to know because not only you will want them in a partner, but its a great way to figure out how to find people like you.\n\nIs fitness important to you? Sign up for a class. Nature lover? Join a bird watching community. Avid reader? Bookclub! The next Gordon Ramsey? Take a cooking class. Need to find god? Join a church. Are politics a passion? Is hiking your thing? Join a hiking club. Find your county's local political group. The more you go out the more ppl you see - so go out with your friends as much as possible too.\n\nAlso, remember to be present in everything you do... The ppl you share your daily schedule with share your routine because they have it in common with you. Include them. Be aware of who else goes to the gym with you, who else is at the coffee shop in the morning with you, etc.
3	Have you considered volunteering?  It can provided a way to meet new people with some structure. Your reason for being there will be the volunteering, and you might happen to meet some women.
2	turn 21 and then join your local kickball league
2	You've gotten some really good ideas already, but I'll just interject to say that even if you are working full-time in a "career", you still definitely have to put the time into the dating (or meeting people generally) scene to get any results. It's simple math; input and output. Finding the time is mostly a matter of time management. You say you go home after work and just hang out on the Internet until bed, which is pretty antithetical to meeting anybody.\n\nAre you into board games? In my experience, ISTJs tend to quite like them, and board game meet-ups tend to be pretty easy to attend, *plus* you get to meet a lot of fellow introverts and nerds. I'd suggest maybe committing two hours per night to a board game group. Honestly, it might be good as a form of networking as well, if your career happens to have a social aspect. Therefore, even if you don't meet girls, you at least get to have some fun and meet some potential professional contacts.
1	Make time to go out and be social. \n\nAs a hard core ISTJ, esp the introvert, who works from home, I can go a week without leaving my house. So I know what’s it’s like. \n\nOnline dating is great, but the social skills I lacked, messed up most of them. \n\nI read THE GAME, realized I could learn this stuff and would go out and practice. I would talk to 20 hot chicks a week for starters. \n\nI got so good at talking to women, then coaching other guys how, I actually moved to LA to work for Neil Strauss. \n\nStarted my own company teaching 9 years ago. \n\nI picked an opener and went out and practiced. I then started figuring out how to get the convo to flow in a cool way, to cool stuff, without coming across like bragging. Then, how to smoothly get a phone number. \n\nStill an ISTJ, still love my alone time, but never alone for more than a few days...if I don’t want to be. Pretty awesome. ;)
1	People aren't gonna show up at your door, so something's gotta give. It sounds like you have to figure out what you're about. Everyone's passionate about something, and if you haven't found that something yet, then you need to work on finding it. Once you figure that out, you'll be able to balance it with the necessary work (yes, *work*) of finding/meeting women. Also, your passion will come across in your interactions, and they'll see you as interesting.\n\nThe biggest mistake many men make is thinking that having a job and stability is enough and forgetting to be interesting as well. Don't do that. 
-2	Join a church, Volunteer, Travel.\n\nDo not go clubbing, Waste of time. \n\nSkip the whole bar scene. It is also a waste of time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a few ISTJ mates. All with similar troubles.\n\nJoin a vegan circle, Put up with the smell for a bit. Get in with a vegan girl then slowly bring her out of the fold.\n\nYou are not only doing gods work by saving the vegan but you are also dating. 2 birds 1 stone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut in all seriousness. Just join any community group with a majority of female members. Get cosy and take your pick. Watch out for the other seedy guys doing the same. Hahaha.
7	My child is maddening	I have 4 kids. My younger two boys (13yo and 10yo) are true extroverts. The 13 yo has a bunch of friends that he chats with and games with and does all his extroverted stuff with. My 10yo, however, doesn't have this network of friends yet. This child is the chattiest thing on 2 legs. He's all about the blah blah blah. Small talk is his friend and there isn't a though that has formulated between his ears that hadn't come out his mouth. My other 3 kids, know that when I come home from work, I need about 18 minutes to decompress and get right with the world. My 10yo is completely oblivious to this. I've tried to explain it to him but I think theres so much going from brai. To mouth that nothing goes from ears to brain.\n\nDoes anyone else have a child that they struggle to be kind to because they got way too much to say? And how does one handle this, because I have 8 more years to listen to his blah blah blah and I'm not sure I can do it. 
6	When I got to the “he’s all about the blah blah blah” lmao this post was an interesting read\n\nI don’t have kids but wow you only need 18minutes to get right with the world? THAT is impressive.\n\nCan you bribe the 10yo? Or the 13yo to keep him busy?
3	Every parent feels this way about their kids from time to time. It's ok to vent, but 1) you need to listen receptively so they will continue talking to you through their teen years, and 2) there will come a day when they will be grown and gone and the silence will be deafening. It's hard to imagine that day now, but it will come. Give your chatterbox a hug and then give him some chewing gum. 
3	You sound like a complete and utter entitled child. You being an ISTJ does not magically make you incapable of being compassionate towards your child. If you struggle to be kind to your child, you have issues. Plain and simple. This is your child. If you are the only one he talks to, then you need to help him branch out. As his parent it’s your responsibility to help him, not complain about how he makes it difficult for you to be kind to him. Abhorrent. Absolutely abhorrent. Shame on you. Shame shame shame. 
1	Sounds to me like he doesn't have anyone to talk to. You're the only person who he feels comfortable with talking to. I used to be like this and It drove the few friends I had away. Turns out when you only have one person to dump all of your problems and other interesting things on, they get overwhelmed. In contrast, when you have a group of friends, you can parse out your socialization among them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure how you could help him find some more friends, but it sounds like that is what he needs.
1	I assume you’re an ISTJ yourself?\nThat is so cute and funny to be honest, although I feel your pain. Mind if I ask if the father is a big chatter too? I’ve always wondered if personalities are genetics or completely random.\n\nI don’t have kids myself so it’s hard to give advice. I’m sure there are some parenting subs on reddit who could give practical advice. Maybe find him some sorts of social circle like sports or something ?
1	> I need about 18 minutes to decompress and get right with the world.\n\nStay in your car. Go for a walk. Take those 18 minutes before you walk in the door. \n\nI suspect that’s why rush hour traffic is so bad in the afternoons compared to the mornings where I live. Parents who are expected home but want to delay it so they do 10-20 under the speed limit to increase that blissful “me” time in the vehicle. 
1	This possibility of being stuck 24/7/52 with something that won't shut up for 18 years straight is why I don't have kids.
20	How ISTJs deal with suffering	I noticed that I can easily ignore people that caused me suffering or simply act like the problem never existed. So, if someone is bothering me or making me suffer in some unnecessary way (when I can choose not to deal with it), I am able to simply block the person in my life and/or act as if nothing had happened. Sometimes I keep talking to the person normally and they have no clue I'm pissed or annoyed with them in any way.\n\nIs it an ISTJ thing? Do you identify with that?
16	Yes, but only once I've become convinced that the other person can't or won't change their behavior.  At that point I simply detach myself emotionally even if outwardly I'm still polite.
17	Pretty much.\n\nYou identify the source of you misfortune and you eradicate it with efficiency and finesse.\n\nRemoving emotional cues is part of your personality. Some more observant people can pick up on it, but the vast majority will never notice.\n\nISTJ to a tee.
6	I have definitely done this in the past.\n\nThis may be TMI, but my father, as a "way to protect me", didn't tell me that one of my really close relatives was passing away soon. She was someone that I cherished deeply, but he kept this as a secret from me because he and she were on pretty bad terms for several years even though I had nothing to do with their "bad blood". When I finally learned that she passed, I was so upset to the point that I sobbed for hours, something I normally do not do. But somehow I just got over it. We've never talked about it to this day - I just simply pretend it didn't happen and live about my life. But this is certainly something I'll never forget about him.\n\nIn other situations where people cause me pain and unhappiness, I simply cut them off. There was a guy I was talking to for a while, but he was manipulative and messed with my feelings. He also did some contradictory things that screamed "stupid and immature" to me. At one point we had an awful falling out that I eventually forgave him for. But he kept doing the same, stupid things that I simply didn't want to deal with it anymore. So I blocked him on all social media and that was that.
6	I dont maintain relationships with toxic ppl. I don't allow them to hold me hostage with their negativity, I just turn my back on them and they never hear from me again and I'm om with that. This includes my brother, most of my cousins, all of my aunts. Family, friend, doesn't matter. I have a pretty large neutral territory in my evaluation of ppl, so if someone treats me in such a way long enough that they reach a "toxic" label, they're out. However, ppl have shitty days or go through rough patches and if they say or do something uncharacteristically shitty on Thursday but Friday they're ok. Im not gonna dwell on Thursday because I have shitty days too. 
5	Like the flip of a switch. Especially if I feel like it’s intentional, I have no problem moving on easily. I am very forgiving of misunderstandings or accidents though.\n
3	Awww man why lol I’m an ISTJ and I only communicate and speak up if it’s something that needs to be nipped in the bud. Setting boundaries to prevent further trouble. (This is the only progress I’ve been able to make in the whole conflict suffering area of my life)\n\nBut when it comes to constant people in my life I normally stay quiet assuming I’ll get over it, it’s not worth making an issue over, etc. I just don’t think about whatever it is that upset me until it’s forgotten.\n\nMy friend says I wait until things pile up before getting mad and then it seems like it’s random to others but it’s not to me because it’s a collection of things that I finally decided to stop ignoring. \n\nI’m not afraid to cut someone out of my life if I view them as bad for me. Or to avoid being in their presence \n\n
2	[deleted]
2	ISTJ thing. I’ve been know to do the same. 
2	Depends on the suffering; if it's from someone else's action [or lack of] I either be confrontational and let them know what's wrong or I simply cut it off my mind once I relax and breathe.\n\nIf it's more internal (feelings, bad memories, etc.) it's a lot harder to get over and it takes time. I'd just cry out my feelings when possible and in complete solitude and move on.
2	Yeah, it's a very very very ISTJ thing. Very. And as an ENTJ who is very direct and cold, even I am baffled at how direct and minimal you all are while talking.
2	I remove problematic people from my life with the force and ease of flicking a crumb off a table. There are others I keep at arm's length because they have issues I don't want to contaminate my personal life/home front with.\n\nI've found other people seem to have tremendous difficulty with doing the same. I don't.
1	Nailed it. I identify with that very closely.
1	Jupp I've done it
5	Ideal jobs for ISTJ?	I currently work in medicine in the US- I love what I do, but the constant harassment from higher ups about making more money, cramming more patients into a workday, etc. have made me really start hating my field. I know it's not confined to just my workplace because I am a part of a larger community relating to my occupation and it seems that it's the same everywhere in the US. I'm considering going back to school and starting fresh. Does anyone have job recommendations that suit ISTJ personalities? If you're an ISTJ that loves your job, what do you do and what makes you enjoy it?
5	I work in registration at an emergency room and I fucking love it. However, I enjoyed it so much more when I was at a smaller rural hospital, not because it was slower paced and whatever, but because it wasn't a top heavy, over corporate, beurocratic nightmare that the busy inner city hospital was. Also, I had more responsibilities so it always stayed interesting. I wasn't just a registrar, I was also the HUC, security, and operator. I also worked nights because i am a night person and I knew that I didn't mesh well with the day shift leadership. I don't need to be told how to do my job. I do it every fucking day. I do a damn good job at it. Take your ass back in your office and get off my back. Idk what else you can do... This is the only field I've ever thrived in. 
6	I'm the HR representative for benefits, leaves of absence and FMLA. I also do all of the HR data entry and reporting. Most days I love my job.\n\nI have to give a 25 minute benefit presentation to new employees which caused me a lot of anxiety at first but I know my material so I can handle it now.\n\nHandling leaves of absence and FMLA has given me more compassion for human suffering, instead of being a robot with no feelings so I think it has helped me grow as a person. I also have policies and laws to follow so that satisfies my need to follow the rules. \n\nThe reporting might be my favorite part. I enjoy compiling and manipulating the data. I'm a total spreadsheet nerd.
5	Any type of job where you are assigned a task and can just run with it. No need for a supervisor to watch over you because you will do the job better than most (unless it requires pure creativity...then you are screwed). Things that are task driven really. \n\nI am in IT, an Engineer now but really I have an Ops/admin mindset of 'how things should be.' I sometimes struggle with pure creative thinking so I force myself to play devil's advocate on any decision and constantly ask INTPs (which are prevalent in Engineering roles) for their opinions. 
4	I work in public accounting as an auditor. \n\nI really enjoy it because of the structure and attention to detail it involves everyday. I get to interact with people just enough to where it  doesn’t totally exhaust me. \n\nOverall it’s a steady, organized, and dependable job that really showcases certain strengths of an ISTJ.
2	I currently work as a data analyst for a large HR company. I work in a niche department so my workload is predictable and manageable (most days) so I can efficiently plan my days/weeks to maximize the amount of output I can produce. I am in school for a totally different profession though, looking to work in a medical examiner's office. Healthcare, government, and military roles seem to fit well with the ISTJ personality. It just depends on what interests you in those areas. 
2	Before I left to stay home with my kids I also worked in HR like many have posted, but I managed the culture and communications department, so we did all of the things that make employees feel engaged and informed. It was the perfect balance of HR structure but opportunities for creativity and positive interaction with others. For most of my life I’ve known I wanted to plan parties, not attend them, so this worked out perfectly for me. 
1	In my experience, I've met quite a few ISTJ field engineers who are very happy with their jobs.
1	I’m a manager for a multi billion dollar company. Enjoy the thrill of it but I’m very insensitive towards my subordinates. Which makes the job a lot harder but it’s mainly numbers and people. Studying to be an engineer.
1	I am a scientist (sort of. I just finished grad school and don't have a job yet). I get enough interaction in lab and meetings that I don't feel like a loner but I still spend slot of time with my own thoughts when writing/doing stats. I love it although I frustrate myself sometimes with second guessing and procrastination and I don't ask for help half as much as I should. 
1	ISTJ ex	Hello, \nI haven't seen or contacted my ex ISTJ for a month and a half, because I needed to distance myself after I knew he was back in a relationship. Before we were together, we were friends, if it helps understanding... \nI would have liked to know if the ISTJs were returning to their ex spontaneously or if they were waiting for the person across the street to make the first move. \nI have no idea if this moment of pause and silence, for both of us, can end and return to a healthy foundation or if it is better not to even try. Thank you for your advice\n\n
12	I was married to an ISTJ for almost 20 years. From my experience, they’re highly pragmatic and if they don’t need to talk to you anymore, they won’t. Think: Ron Swanson. 
6	Your post is a little confusing. You broke up and now he’s back in a relationship with someone else? Or you’re just hoping to win him back? \n\nWith my experience with ISTJ’s, once they have closed a door, they are not very willing to open it back up. They will take the time to move on without looking back. I broke up with my ISTJ bf a few years ago on a whim (I was mad at a situation and highly emotional and overreacted). I came back three days later, and we talked. It was very difficult as I already felt that he had moved on. It took time for him to decide he was willing to try again and time to rebuild trust that I wouldn’t just walk away again. I know for sure that if I had waited any longer, he wouldn’t have taken me back because he would have gone through the healing process and closed the door on our relationship. 
4	The ISTJ thing is irrelevant here. He's in a new relationship. It's over. Accept that and move on.
2	ISTJ have a fairly easy time moving on. Once we have moved on and found a new shiny person to connect with, we can reestablish a friendship but there will be extremely strict boundaries that will not be crossed or you will be cut out without a second thought. Those boundaries WILL make you uncomfortable and we're ok with that. 
8	Does anyone here work in a career that's not primarily a desk job? What is it?	I've been poring over lists of careers that are supposed to be a good fit for an ISTJ. However, careers like accounting or financial analysis (typical office desk jobs) sound boring to me.\n\nIf you work in a job that doesn't focus on "flying a desk", would you mind sharing what it is? I'm not saying it has to involve no sitting at a desk, but does minimize it.\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: I appreciate all the responses, they are very interesting and I'm reading them all. Keep 'em coming!
10	Air Traffic Controller
6	I do stage props for a regional theater
6	Prop coordinator for a theatre, lots of walking around with weapons and bossing people around and yelling at them. But getting to figure out the logistics is fun and it’s a good mix of interacting with people and getting to do things however I want as long as it gets done. I also enjoy getting to organize everything however I want. 
3	I know ISTJs who are foremen on construction sites.  There's still alot of desk work, but alot of outside work, too.  
3	Landscape architect.\nDesk job with some variety and site visits thrown in the mix :) 
4	Environmental management, OSHA workplace safety, and careers in that vein. There’s always something to be done, especially if you manage multiple sites. Lots of travel if you have a BS or MS. 
5	I’m a language professor whose teaching persona is very extroverted, which means I need extra alone time to recover after class. 
3	I started my career as a medical technologist.  We are the people who test your blood samples in a medical lab when a doctor orders blood work.  I now am the manager of the lab so I do a fair amount of desk work but I still test specimens.  I also started a small farm that I work on as my personal project https://www.facebook.com/sunnypatchfarmct/
3	Massage Therapist.
3	(Training to be a) Field service technician for a line of electrical industrial equipment. However, I hope to move to a position in electrical utilities within the next 5 or so years.
3	My ISTJ ex husband is in the military, he works on helicopters and can’t stand the desk-jockey life. 
3	Band Director. Having to be extroverted for work can be exhausting, but I only find that for performances. Day to day for my students I don't feel like I have to be someone I'm not, and because I love my subject it's not hard to share enthusiasm about it. :)
3	Project manager. Mostly desk work but lots of human interaction, political maneuvering in the company, facilitating small and large meetings and relationships, networking and schmoozing. I actually have started loving that social aspect to my work and can get a lot of adrenaline from it but I still always need downtime after a few days straight of it.  
2	I'm a screen printer at a family business... pursuing medical school though.
2	My husband is an ISTJ and he works as an analytical chemist - he likes it because he’s up in the lab a lot and able to solve problems while still being pretty analytically thinking in his  work. 
2	Gas company service technician here and also possess a plumbing license. Desk jobs are absolutely NOT for me at all. I am extremely computer savvy and have built a few in the past. But I am blue collar through and through.
2	I'm studying to be a psychologist. Even though I'm not completely sure if I'd be a good therapist, studying people and behaviors really interest me.
2	I run an Engineering testing lab. My technical staff are busy doing a variety of tasks with products, fixtures, data acquisition, control systems.  There's some desk work, but not a lot.  It's indoor work, technical, detailed, and fulfilling.  As an ISTJ it is quite satisfying!
2	I'm a chemist
2	I fix saxophones. It's hard to describe why this is a perfect fit for me and probably other ISTJ. 
2	I teach. It's draining .
2	Marine Canvas fabricator. I make stuff for boats.
2	Nursing. And we’re few and far befween in this sea of Isfjs
2	I'm a nurse. It's actually much more enjoyable than I thought. But that could be because I work at night, so a lot of the time I don't have to talk a whole lot after the first few hours. Currently on a cardiac/med surg floor, but hoping to move to an ICU where the patients are usually unconscious and sedated.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this job if you just can't stand conversation. There are times when I'm stuck talking to a patient/family for an hour or more (this is rare of course since it's night shift. I imagine it happens more during days), and yeah it's pretty exhausting, but I like it overall.\n\nWhen I first got to college I was split between this and engineering, glad I chose this path as there are plenty of avenues to go down with a BSN. If I ever get to where I can't stand talking to patients, I can go to nursing informatics for instance. 
2	Sign language interpreter. Working freelance on a job-by-job basis usually gives me plenty of time to recuperate in my car between appointments.
2	I am a registrar at an urgent care clinic. I love my job. Don't necessarily love my patients every day. Before this job I was a registrar in the emergency room and I loved every bit of that job and plan on going back in the not so distant future. Every day was different, but I was doing the same thing for every patient. So there was the predictability of the registration process but you never knew what was going to come through that door next, a runny nose or a gunshot wound. I live for organizing chaos
1	My ISTJ SO is an economist who made his money with (legal) sports betting. \n\nMy ISTJ ex-bf was an ironworker who had previously been a helicopter mechanic. 
1	I'm a teacher. Yes, that involves a lot of "peopling". But, thank goodness, I'm in a portable, so during my lunch and planning periods I can shut my door and play my music, sing along if I like, or listen to the quiet. I think the ISTJ thing helps me with the "peopling" because it gives me some detachment, which is necessary for dealing with kids. I could not sit at a desk all day, and I don't. I'm up and down and do a lot of walking. My typical day, per my iWatch, is 12 hours of standing and 2.5 miles of walking. I have great organizational skills, and I am able to weed out details that would just bog me down. 
1	Currently in college as a finance major but as soon as I gradate I will start my path to become am commercial pilot.  
1	Machinist, Forktruck driver, and soon a trucker.\n\nMost sources that point you in the direction of a "job that fits your personality" ignore blue collar, skilled trades or smaller name jobs. I think ISTJs can do well in factory work because it requires precision and everything to be within specifications. Driving can also be a nice fit as it keeps you from being dragged into social situations throughout the day.
5	Opinions on Conservatism/Right-Wing Politics	I've seen a hypothesis that SJs, more than any other type, is prone to take conservative/right-wing views in various degrees of intensity more than any other political world view, and I want to test it out in the real world of ISTJs (i.e. all of you). What do all of you think about the usefulness/validity/desirability of any of the varieties of conservative thought out there? 
19	Interesting thought.  ISTJ here, I like to think that I don't take sides and look at everything at an unbiased view but many of my positions tend to fall conservative / right leaning.  Would be interested to see some formal study of Myers Briggs vs political leanings
16	The stereotype of ISTJ's being conservatives or "traditionalists" does actually apply to me. I get the sense that this kind of thought is losing desirability in society. Not much I can do about it though; I really don't like imposing my ideas/beliefs/opinions on others. 
15	I believe people as a whole could be much more responsible, does that make me right wing?  I think life is very manageable if you make the right decisions and make plans.
23	Fiscally conservative, socially liberal. \n\nI don’t care what you do in your private life as long as your actions don’t negatively impact or infringe on the rights of others, and that you don’t feel entitled to have people pay your way. 
7	Another libertarian. 
7	I think you'll get somewhat skewed answers asking here on Reddit.\n\nGenerally, I think ISTJs tend to have the same political affiliations as their immediate community. I do think there is a tendency for small-c conservatism, as ISTJs tend to be tradition-oriented realists who like to see empirical evidence for proposed policies. Anecdotally, I've noticed you guys tend to favour scientists being in charge, rather than businesspeople, lawyers, or career politicians.
16	I generally agree with the conservative side of things now. I'm more of a libertarian. Not in an Anarcho-Capitalist fashion, but I believe the government should be SEVERELY limited. \n\nAt 18, I was pretty progressive, but I believe that's because of the teaching that they do in university. Finding out how the vast majority of our professors were progressive and even outted Marxists kinda pushed me off of it. Now that I'm out of school, I can learn about things from a more neutral point of view. \n\nI definitely don't agree with Conservatives on everything, such as drugs or being pro-life. I believe that drugs should be decriminalized/legalized. I also believe abortions, at least in the first trimester, are much preferred to bringing another child into the world that is likely unplanned for etc. I also disagree with Conservatives on the Military as a whole. I believe we should only have a Military big enough to defend us from attacks. We should pull out of every other country. I also don't agree with the increased survellience they insist is to "prevent terrorism." It has largely been a wash, while reducing our privacy. \n\nOn the flipside, I disagree with some Progressive policies. I believe that guns should be completely legalized. I don't agree with most Progessive's idea of immigration. There are quite a few countries that have a stricter immigration policy and no one seems to mention that. They are pretty successful compared to what's happened to countries that had fairly open borders recently IMO. Another thing I disagree on is healthcare. The ACA was a negative thing for many, including myself. I'm not saying what the Conservatives have offered is much better, but I disagree with the idea of Universal Healthcare as a whole. Generally, whenever the government intervenes in something, it makes it worse IMHO.  
10	Similar to another poster, I found myself leaning more towards the Left in highschool/college. Maybe it's aging, or working, or being a parent, or how much further the left itself has gone, or some combination thereof... but I find myself leaning more towards the right the last 3-4 years (I'm a 29y/o male ISTJ, FWIW), perhaps libertarian at times. \n\nAs much as I need/crave rules and order in my daily life, I think there's too much we try to legislate, versus people taking responsibility their own actions and raising their children to do the same. 
12	Both sides have good and supportive arguments to fix whatever issue. I look at it from an unbiased perspective and weigh the pros and cons. 
5	Constitutional conservative here.
4	Not an American, and while I do have an idea of what stances the left and right take, I did a quick Google search to look at key points of contention between the two.\n\nSeems I lean quite distinctly to the liberal side of things. \n\nI am pro-choice. I am pro-euthanasia. I am pro-healthcare. I am pro-gun-control. I am pro-marry-whoever-the-fuck-you-want-so-long-as-y'all-are-consenting-adults.  I am pro-fix-this-global-warming-shit, pro-oil-isn't-gonna-last-forever-let's-find-something-else, and pro-get-religion-the-fuck-out-of-politics-please-and-thank-you.\n\nMy feelings on the death penalty and the decriminalisation of drugs are...complicated.\n\nISTJs are known for their respect of the status quo. But if tradition means fucking over someone else for the sake of it, then that tradition needs to change. 
18	So I’ll go against the grain. I’m an ISTJ and I am very progressive/liberal. I am very concerned with social justice issues and I think unregulated capitalism has created needless inequality and environmental destruction. I think some form of democratic socialism is the best way to address the externalities that make capitalism unsustainable.
3	I consider myself fairly neutral, if not left leaning.. though I do really prefer to take on traditional roles in relationships which is where the S side comes out a bit. 
4	I’m a libertarian myself. What makes you think that most ISTJs are conservative? Is it because of the old Ben Shapiro meme about facts and feelings lol?
3	ISTJs are very traditional, so that generally leans us towards traditional views in conservatism. However, we’re also easily shaped based on how we were raised, which typically gives us similar views as those we were raised around (family, friends, etc.).
1	Just no. Social Democrat here
1	I suppose it really depends on what views in particular you're talking about. The nebulous left-right system creates a lot of contradiction within the wings. Some right-wing people want more restrictions on x, others want fewer.
1	I would argue that right-wing/conservatives appeal to gut-followers instead of the brain-followers. And some [science actually backs that assertion](https://www.psypost.org/2017/06/study-people-left-right-use-different-cognitive-systems-make-moral-judgments-49187). So I would bet the opposite of you.
-12	ISTJ here. Full blown white nationalist.
7	Is this an ISTJ or INTJ?	Before anything, I'd like to thank everyone in other mbti communities for helping me learn a but more about how the cognitive functions work. Overall I've gotten a good foundation on what type I am. From what I learned, I'm most likely not an INTP mostly due to the fact that I kinda see myself as rigid when it comes to my own way of working, and in general my goals. What made me used to think I was an INTP was of how I tend to be rebellious and outspoken, to the point of sarcasm when i felt that I was treated badly and I was miserable. My best friends who were INTPs were usually huge procrastinators with projects which annoyed me, but I always enjoyed talking to INxPs in general because they and i tend to be on the same wavelength in conversations, but that's as far as it goes. Overall I'm just gonna give a bit of more info about myself and see what vibe you guys get.\n\nBut now with my current job as a Logistics Admin assistant, I pretty much feel more confident and more at home, to the point where i feel more prestigious in my life. I used to work In fast food and always felt like I was constantly seen as incompetent due to me having my "head in the clouds" or focusing on other things other than the menial work I was given. At my new job, it has purpose. Logistics on the other hand is the organization and coordination of everything. Literally my job is to be myself, organized, structured, and factual, which I love! \n\nIn my life, I was always seen as shunning any ideas that I saw as out of place, and viewed my way as the best way. My best friends saw me as very outspoken and blunt, to the point of being openly cruel and heartless about others for selfish gain. And the funny part is that I was a bit immature back then and took pride in that. I'd rather be viewed as cruel and heartless than weak and incompetent. My views on it is that I value being on top of everything, not leaving everything to last, and most of all, work towards the goals that are revelant in your life.\n\nMy mannerisms tend to be of someone who is reserved, but arrogant at times. I don't mind this as I have a reason to be. If I am surrounded by disorganization, I will be anxious and WILL make my voice be heard, or I will have huge anger issues. I like having a calm and clean look, I usually try to look presentable because I want to pretty much show myself as someone who is efficent...and appearances matter especially when you want to prove a point. Most of the time though, especially if I'm somewhere unfamiliar, I become incredibly reserved, to the point where I kind of have to force myself to smile.\n\nAnother thing about me is that I focus more on things than people in all honesty. I like focusing on video games, lore, stories, and things that are considered long-term. I daydream about a future where I own a company and I can finally work in the background while I have everything in control and consistent. Anything that seems late or delayed I can be frustrated easily.\n
13	You've just described an IxTJ.\n\nImagine you get an email from a client, asking if he can schedule a call with you to go over an upcoming project. He's pretty busy, but he asks if you are available Thursday at 6.\n\nAre you more likely to 1) Immediately assume the client means 6 PM, since it would be highly unusual for anyone to schedule work at 6 AM, and besides you know from past experience this client puts in a lot of late nights, or 2) Rush off a quick email to the client asking him to clarify if he meant 6 AM or 6 PM, just to be sure.\n\nINTJs rely so heavily on their *logical intuition* they would be much more likely to do #1. ISTJs are so *methodical* they would be very uncomfortable proceeding until all the details were confirmed and locked down, so they would more likely do #2. 
-2	ISTJ.\n\nConsistency isn't an INTJ value, being a "player" is.\n\nINTJs are ready to justify ANYTHING! ISTJs on the other hand, they care about doing what's right. \n\nISTJs are logical and organized, while INTJs are machiavellian and greedy.\n\nISTJs are open-minded and impartial, INTJs are power-hungry and dominating.\n\nEisenhower was an ISTJ, Nixon (and Trump) are INTJs. 
22	When ISTJs go full psycho	
6	His personality type is one of the more believable aspects of his character. Only an ISTJ would try that hard to stay within the lines.
3	I have no idea who that is, but the look on his face in this picture is very believable to me as an ISTJ's "full psycho" face.\n\nWho is that?
2	As soon as I show the picture I could not help but laugh, my cousin says I act or could potentially be like Dexter 
52	istj managing stress	I went through a bad bout of anxiety 2 years ago (which thanks to therapy and meds I am recovered).  I happened to see this article and it helped me work through it.  I even took it to my therapist because it really helped ground my anxiety and give me a better understanding of it.\n\n[https://howtokillstress.blogspot.com/2016/09/the-inspector.html](https://howtokillstress.blogspot.com/2016/09/the-inspector.html)\n\n**ISTJ – The Inspector**\n\n**What Stresses out an ISTJ:**  \n– Being in an environment that is in disarray  \n– Looming deadlines  \n– Being forced or asked to do things that don’t make sense to them  \n– Being asked to do something without a plan or direction  \n– Frequent change  \n– Having to innovate without any past experience to rely on  \n– Being asked to do something spontaneously  \n– Too much extraversion (excess people contact)  \n– Emotionally charged situations  \n– Unfamiliar surroundings  \n– Dealing too long with abstract or theoretical concepts.\n\nWhen faced with stress overload, ISTJs may fall into “catastrophe mode”, where they see nothing but all the potential of what could go wrong. They may beat themselves up; berating themselves for things which could have been done differently, or duties which they failed to perform. They will lose their ability to see things calmly and reasonably, and can become depressed at what they see as a bleak future. Under chronic stress, the ISTJ may fall into the grip of their inferior function, extroverted intuition, and become a “dramatizer”. They may become intensely angry, rigid in what they’re doing, outwardly critical, pessimistic, and embrace an overwhelming fear of the future.\n\n**How to help an ISTJ experiencing stress:**  \n– Give them plenty of space.  \n– Listen, and provide provable affirmation of how they’ve overcome or done something well in the past.  \n– Break a task down into manageable pieces.  \n– Do not give generalized compliments.  \n– Put things that have to be done in sequential order.  \n– Don’t brainstorm. If they are in the grip of their inferior function, extroverted intuition, brainstorming will only make things worse.  \n– Don’t give them more to do. Give them a break from responsibilities if possible.  \n– Take them seriously. Don’t patronize or judge them.  \n– Encourage them to exercise, unless this would sound like an insult.
12	Thanks a lot for this, so much of it rings true to me!
7	Thank you so much for posting this. As an Ne-dom, my general brainstorming seems to drive my partner nuts (especially when stressed), so this is a great reminder to just STAHP.
6	> – Being in an environment that is in disarray\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDepending on the source of disarray.  I was raised by a hoarder, so I'm used to disarray at this point.  If you disturb my disarray in some fashion, it bothers me far more than the fact that the disarray exists.  Yes, it's chaos, but it's my chaos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  \n– Looming deadlines\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDepends on why the deadlines are looming and if I'm on pace.  If the deadline is looming because unrelated distractions kept me from working or because information wasn't provided until the last minute and thus set me back, then yes, I'll be quite stressed. \n\nIf, on the other hand, I'm on pace, everything is in line, and I'll be finished by the deadline according to my schedule, then no, no reason to stress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>– Being forced or asked to do things that don’t make sense to them\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes.  Especially when those things aren't explained (in other words, make it make sense, and it's far less stressful).\n\n  \n\n\n>– Being asked to do something without a plan or direction\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's add some icing to this cake:  When I create a plan or direction for this thing I've been asked to do, and then you come shit all over me for doing it wrong even though you gave me no indication of the "right way," especially when I'm done or nearly done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>– Frequent change\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan confirm.  Even when the change is for the better, and even when I know that beforehand.  Change is inherently stressful.\n\n>  \n– Having to innovate without any past experience to rely on\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEspecially when, as above, I finally get past my own hangups and innovate, only to have someone come along and whine about how I did it wrong.  If there was a right way to do it, why the <insert preferred expletive here, mine starts with "f"> didn't you just tell me to do it that way to begin with?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>– Being asked to do something spontaneously\n\nCan confirm.  I like having plans.  Sometimes my plans are "stay at home and relax," but they're still plans.  If you ask me what I'm doing tomorrow (or later tonight, whatever) and I say "nothing," don't assume that means I want to go play laser tag or paintball with you.  I already have plans for tomorrow.  "Nothing" is a plan.\n\n>– Too much extraversion (excess people contact)  \n\n\nCan confirm.  I need some time where the only people I have to deal with are my dogs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>– Emotionally charged situations\n\nYes.  Especially when "Here's some logic which should diffuse the situation" results in the emotions blowing up even worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>– Unfamiliar surroundings\n\nYep, although this could just be a specific manifestation of the "change" mentioned above.\n\n>– Dealing too long with abstract or theoretical concepts.\n\nSure, but if we're allowed to apply some SiTe to them and practically apply or solve them, that can be rewarding.  \n\nI'll add another stress inducer, although this might be a personal pet peeve rather than an ISTJ thing:\n\nMoving the goal posts in an argument.\n\nThis is getting long enough, so I'll stop rather than tackling the "how to deal" bit, but it's accurate enough.
2	Thanks for posting! Usually I only see descriptions of the inferior function grip when it is so helpful to have a list of what might cause it and strategies to overcome it. 
2	This is so me.
1	damn daniel, thats me.
1	Question for OP and/or other ISTJs willing to answer on this one:\n\n>Do not give generalized compliments.\n\nWould that be because it codes as a sort of non-specified expectation? Like, *"Great, now I'm expected to keep living up to that, what do I need to do to do that??* ----> more stress\n\n?\n\n>Listen, and provide provable affirmation of how they’ve overcome or done something well in the past.\n\nI freaking love that provable affirmation one and will tuck it away for possible future use with my SO. I can really see how that would be good for her when under stress. Not sure if I've ever done it or not, but if so it wasn't with consciousness about it ... I love stuff like this to put in my "how to support my sweetie" toolbox :).
4	ISTJ-ENTP friendship	Hello boys and girls, \n\nI've just now noticed how well balanced is my friendship with an ISTJ. When I get distracted by the big picture of things my friend brings me back to the details and how they are in that specific instance. \nI love how we are in many levels the opposite and can push each other in some areas. For example his careful organization sometimes makes him exausted and prevents him from enjoying the moment, while my "on the go" approach shatters his rigid regime and makes him go "maybe I should just chill". i have countless examples like this.\n\nDo you have similar stories? What's your take on ENTPs? 
5	My experience with known ENTPs is somewhat limited.\n\nMy general impression of them is that they're like an excited puppy.\n\nI like puppies, so odd as it may sound, that is actually a compliment.\n\nJust stop biting when I say "ow," or I may swat you on the nose and say "NO!"
2	I think my son may be one of those ENTP type ppl and when everything is just chill, he's a pretty cool kid. Funny, bright, always around and cares about others and stuff. I noticed that his perception of the world is so huge and fast that he passes up opportunities to learn from others so he puts himself in a position to fail far more frequently than necessary, which bothers the hell out of me, but doesn't seem to bother him at all. I try hard to teach him to slow down and focus more on things that are important and take one thing at a time, Prioritize tasks and get them done. And I know that those lessons will never take because there's nothing wrong with him, he's a wonderful child who is just fundamentally different t than me and that's OK..... Unless he wants to talk my ear off when I walk in the door from work. That's not ok. He has to shutup for 14 more minutes. Those are the rules. 
2	Yes! I am an ENTP female and am close with an ISTJ male. (I’m like 99.7% sure he’s ISTJ.)\n\nAnyway - yes, I also find that in our differences, we balance one another out.\n\nSometimes the differences are more stark and require adjusting. For example, his meticulousness (and how it impacts speed) at times has driven me nuts. It took some time to get accustomed to this difference. However, now that I understand it a bit more (and even if it’s different than how I would do things on my own), I find these differences to be quite endearing.\n\nWe are both logical, which works well together. though I think we also are often able to offer different perspectives to situations.\n\nI find that his strengths tend to balance my weaknesses, and vice versa. It has seemed like we are able to interact in a way where we healthily push each other outside of our comfort zones.\n\nI also find that interactions are quite enjoyable and stimulating. From all that I can tell, he feels the same way.\n\nHope this information helps!
41	Sleeping is my passion	
11	This post is too real on many psychological levels.
5	I want to do some traveling to different places for different reasons.\n\nI love geology so I want to go to iceland\n\nIm Hungarian so I want to see what my great grandparents left when they came to America.\n\nI want to go to Scotland because I love listening to the language, it's English, but that ain't fucking English, you know.\n\nI want to see Tokyo to experience that vast busy-Ness as a spectator from within.\n\nI want to see the rainbow mountains in China, again, geology. Also want to see where they're making all these amazing dinosaur discoveries.\n\nParis, London, Venice, normal touristy places have very little interest to me, however. I'll still go if somebody else pay for it tho. 
3	The one place I would want to visit is disney world however I fear I will feel depressed when\n\n* I have no sense of direction\n* There's little time\n* We get on 3 rides\n* Ride I wanted is closed\n* Walk very slow due to crowds\n* We leave early due to emergency\n\nI think I'll just hang out at good old disneyland for now.   \n
2	I LOVE traveling and meeting new places. The feeling of being foreign leaves me in awe. Couldn’t relate less to this post 
4	I am an INFP (22m) who likes an ISTJ (22f). I need some advice	Hello everyone. I like this girl for about 3 months now. I've met her online and been chatting with her in Facebook almost everyday. I always initiate the conversations because I'm a really clingy guy. She replies thoughtfully and nice. Most of the time she even adds emoticons to her replies (if that means anything).\n\nThen the communication between us lessened because she got a job that she loves working on. I've been keeping in touch with her sometimes by sending a "hope you have a nice day" in the mornings and asking how her day went when she's home from work. It's been harder for me to talk to her because we don't chat anymore like we used to. Her replies got bland and serious. I just assumed that it was because she's stressed and tired from the workload and the change.\n\nI asked her out to watch a movie with me just recently and l made it clear to her that it was a date. I must say it was pretty successful considering it was my first time asking someone out and I think it's her first time too. We talked about a lot of things and I even gave her a gift. I know how you guys don't like gifts that much but I tried to be as practical and thoughtful as much as possible. It's an earphones cable clip organizer because we were talking about it before and I really wanted one too so I got her too. She said it was really cute (it's her favorite character) and thanked me.  After the date she messaged me online, she thanked and wished me a safe trip going home.\n\nFor a few days after the date we were chatting online normally and then she got busy again from work and returned from her 'serious mode'. So I apologized and asked her if I was bothering her because I keep on trying to chat her everyday. It took her the whole day to think about what to reply (she saw the message in the morning). She said she didn't know what to say and I shouldn't be sorry because she's actually grateful that there's someone who cares about her.\n\nI asked her out again to eat dinner after work. I suggested Monday but she said that she doesn't like that day. So I asked her when does she want and her reply was "no idea yet". My friends says that she rejected it and she's not interested anymore.\n\nI really overthink a lot and it does feel like she's not interested with me anymore. Should I just stop initiating conversations and give her more space?
10	Ah the elusive ISTJ female. They are an interesting type to say the least, and im an ISTJ guy (22) who just started talking/seeing my own ISTJ female and has been dumped by another ISTJ female.\n\nOk bro lets break this down together as I show you my world. So ISTJs are very polite, especially to close friends. First off, text conversations can feel like pulling teeth depending (wether we like you or not) on text proficiency. TBH, if an ISTJ doesn’t like you, we will just not respond to messages and we won’t hangout with you. Emojis are a big thumbs up. Next, what have personal interactions been like since the date? I know you said you haven’t seen each other as much, but, have they been friendly or does she give you a cold shoulder? If you are getting the latter, she doesn’t like you bro. \n\nFinally, you asking her out again. When an ISTJ likes someone, we basically become mini stalkers. We love soaking up as much info on said person (even if we have been friends with them for years before). Our minds become focused on that person, and our minds process about a million scenarios analyzing compatibility and how well you fit in our image of what our future path is. The first rejection to the date isn’t something to worry to much over, ISTJs are very busy especially when we go “get sh*t done mode.” But, the fact she isn’t trying to reschedule and gave an IDK definitely isn’t good. \n\nHonestly bro, I she went on the date out of respect for your friendship and to see how it went and then decided that it wasn’t going to work. She will probably be polite still. Give her some space, try to hang out in a group setting (have someone else invite so it doesn’t look like you are asking her out again) to see how she responds with a face to face interaction.\n\nWish you the best friend
7	>I asked her out again to eat dinner after work. I suggested Monday but she said that she doesn't like that day. So I asked her when does she want and her reply was "no idea yet". My friends says that she rejected it and she's not interested anymore.\n\nConventional wisdom suggests that if someone turns down a date because they're busy, but makes no attempt to reschedule, they're letting you down gently.\n\n&#x200B;
4	I’m an ISTJ female and I’m afraid she’s rejecting you. That’s how I see it. I don’t think I’m that cold. 
3	ISTJ woman here. One of the biggest things that make me lose interest in a guy is frequents texts like "hope you have a nice day".... Like, how am I supposed to respond to that? It falls under the "small talk" category, in my opinion, and we don't do that shit. If I get frequent texts that I can't respond to in an interesting, engaging, and conversational way, my interest drops immediately. It's actually really annoying to me. If you want to try to reignite her interest, give her a couple days, and then text occasionally with something meaningful, interesting, or funny. If you want to ask her back out, send a pic or link to something nonromantic and interest g to her and say something along the lines of "hey, saw this and thought you might like it, wanna go?" and if she says yes, go as friends and have a good time. Make is super easy. She will appreciate that.... And if you buy her anything, make it nachos. We love nachos. 
3	Why not just ask her directly if she's still interested?  ISTJs value clear communication and directness.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut based off what you're posting here, it sounds like she's lost interest.  If there's anything left there, then giving her space is your best bet.  In my experience, clinginess is a turn off--especially when I'm under stress and my emotional/social energy is depleted.  
3	As an ISTJ female (30s), I cringed really hard at the gift and one-sided, short responses. \n\nMaybe it’s just me, but as a female... bros, we can see what you’re doing. Old timey courtship of: talking, gifts, eating out... relationship?! Felt like just that. Like a conveyer belt I don’t want to participate in and was never asked about, but damn, here we are. \n\nI understand that you like her, *but what makes her like you?* Did you guys meet at work? Did you meet at a mutual interest event? Do you have a common interest to share?\n\nI ask because I see dating kind of like a work meeting. Hey now, I am an ISTJ and I love my job (shrug).\n\n1) If I show up to a meeting and the presenter doesn’t have a point, or a PPT, can’t really describe the project, is constantly asking me small, trivial questions... I’m not interested, they don’t have their -ish together, I’ll just walk out and let them know to contact me when they’re actually ready. \n\n2) If I show up to a meeting and the presenter is there already set up and on-time I scurry to not be out of place. If they have a clear presentation that applies to me (my expertise, experience, or interests) then I’m locked in - especially if the person is giving mutual respect - taking time to not just say “what are you thinking” but more detailed “you mentioned _____ and that caught me off guard, do you have experience with ____?” This gets a person talking about their interests, which is a lot easier if you’re actively doing something at the same time. This goes hand in hand with knowing the audience and preparing for the ensuing conversations.\n\nPlease, please keep your self-respect and dignity. No gal wants to be chased alá Pepé Le Pew style. If you feel she’s not interested, and you share no mutual interest, you’ll be hard strapped to find and gain an interest in one of her subjects in the short time and present it to her without the fact that you’re new to the item and it will be woefully obvious you picked it up just for her. While this may seem sweet and I can see nice intentions, it comes off as pretty creepy and you lose yourself. Be yourself. You’ll find someone who likes you back for you, mate. 
1	Lmao when she said she doesn’t like Monday 😂 that is too real. I’m an ISTJ female and I can assure you all of that sounds both familiar and reasonable.\n\nSounds like you’re doing everything right and yes her change in response is due largely bc of the changes happening in her life. Adjusting to a new job and it’s stresses for sure and maybe even some other stressors in her life she hasn’t mentioned.\n\nI’m sure she appreciates you reaching out to her, it’s less anxiety inducing and stressful that way. But if you’re worried if she’s interested (and I’m sure she is) don’t msg her for a day or so and if you hear nothing msg her and act like nothing happened just continue on as usual “hey how are you” (whatever you usually say). \n\nBasically the only way to know she’s interested is if she agrees to go on a date (have her pick the day bc I have a feeling she’ll have a preference) or if she communicates with you on how she’s feeling which... seems unlikely but isn’t impossible.\n\nFor me personally, I don’t like texting if I’m upset, anxious or stressed so I don’t always respond that same day. But I never ignore my msgs. I also don’t like to talk about what’s making me feel that way bc I rather keep things light and good vibes with others. But getting out of your head is a good thing and reminds you of the nice side of things she just needs to remember that.\n\nAnd good job in the practical gift, seriously a lot of ppl don’t understand that. I hate random stuff and then having to act like I like it which will only encourage more smh but give me what I asked for and it’s fine or something practical and functional and It’s a pleasant surprise\n\nGood luck dude! 
3	Interested in talking??	Supposively you ISTJ's are compatible with my type of ESFP and.. Of course.. I love to chat with people. I'm interested in having new people to talk with..  Wanted to see if any of you are? (Through reddit messaging or whatever)\n\nI thought I'd at least try. \n:) 
41	Here’s a tip: we love talking about ourselves and our interests, and we’re great at answering specific questions we know the answers to. However, we’re typically not much for “chatting,” making conversation, or talking about something without a reason to.
17	I hate small talk. I love big talk.
14	The comments in here are exactly why I joined this sub.  I just love knowing people think exactly like I think.  I'm not completely alone in this world.
13	We tend to not enjoy talking just for the sake of exchanging words, but ISTJs can get really carried away if we\`re talking about something we\`re really interested in. Most often we are happy to talk to people who can easily lead conversations, at least that\`s what I think. I can be interested in some "big talk" as mentioned in another comment
7	Don't you know the internet is a dangerous place to make friends?
6	Why are you interested in talking with ISTJs in specific? 
3	It would be helpful to give some info about yourself first. Such as your interest, hobbies, asl, etc. 
1	I have an ISTJ brother. I mean he seems to talk a lot about things he does, things he’s interested, or his strong distaste in some things (rant coming).\nBut I guess I’m close to him he seems to go on about stuff, I just listen.\nHe has even mentioned that he doesn’t think I understand what he says about some things (his bloody maths and charts), but appreciates that I listen.\nHe appreciates genuine people. So be truthful because they will smell the bs.\n\nAs far as actions go....\nHe notices when people are nice and courteous, even opening a door for someone will put you on his good books.\nBut on the flip side seems to get pissed off at rude people who inconvenience others. I mean stuff I could brush off, ruin his day.\n\nI’m not sure what he’s like with strangers but I know he’s quite honest and straightforward but he wouldn’t be purposely rude.\nHe also seems to laugh a lot at silly humour. (Don’t know if this is an ISTJ thing or personal thing)\n\nThats just my experience with ISTJ brother.
1	Sure. Go ahead. 
9	Needing some career advice from the ISTJs who will know me best	I have an engineering degree and a masters to switch disciplines (i.e. chem eng to mech eng). From high school until this point, I had no direction of where I want to go with my career. I went into engineering because it was more of an ego thing (dumb younger me). I'm very apprehensive about continuing with the technical route. But mind you I only did engineering consulting roles, which were not a great fit for me. I ended up going on stress leave because of the way my coworkers treated me and that it was very difficult to complete my job with how things were handled.\n\nI'm currently in a role which combines analysis and art. I do a lot of number crunching, but the other element of the job (I would say 50-60%) involves being strategic and being conceptual and abstract. There are meetings with lawyers involved and even though I have to crunch numbers, there is a defensible side of it that I need to do. It's not my favourite at all. \n\nI had a talk with my boss today (ENTJ) and he mentioned to me that I really need to get the calculations to be perfect and work a lot on strategic thinking. It's a huge pressure for me considering that I had little mentoring in my previous engineering roles, so I never was able to develop strong habits properly check my work. He also wants me to develop my strategic thinking and to get better at coming up with solutions and take charge as opposed to asking for directions all the time. From what he has seen is that it is a bad sign that my colleagues need to double check my work. It is a sign that they don't trust me. To him, it should be perfect and never have to be double checked.\n\nI understand that my boss is giving me a push and part of me wants to be a better team member, but on the other side, I am wondering if I should do a career switch to a job that is more tailored to the ISTJ personality. I heard that actuary is a very good fit.\n\nI still don't know what to do or what direction I want to go. I know that I haven't given engineering a fair chance. But there are parts of me that are very apprehensive about my ability to be in an engineering role due to my past experiences. I know that my strengths are: Process improvement, analyzing data and working on excel. I'm a perfect worker bee and will be happy to do any work, but I get bored very fast if it becomes repetitive.\n\nSo I'm hoping that since ISTJs know me best, what's your take on this? I'm lost in the emotions and details of what I have to do and don't really see the big picture to ensure my success in any job.
7	I am an ISTJ working in process improvement (lean six sigma specifically) and my role is about 30% crunching numbers and 70% implementation and change management.\n\nI'd say that Process Improvement comes quite naturally to me -- I'm all about efficiency and using the least amount of energy and resources to achieve an outcome (being productively lazy), and changing things incrementally outside of work. My job is basically doing exactly that.\n\nCompared to other analytical roles (e.g. actuary) where the numbers have got to be spot on and are an end in of itself, the numbers I work with are a means to an end. (Te likes efficiency and applicability). \n\nHowever, I struggle internally whenever I run into a project that involves headcount reduction. Not all projects will be like that. But trying to balance the accountability to my organisation, and harming others by having a hand in their layoffs still leaves a sour taste in my mouth. (Conflict with Fi values)\n\nI guess the only thing challenging with the role is the self-doubt and dealing with risk. Doing the analysis, coming up with a recommendation, and then implementing always brings things back to inferior Ne -- what if my analysis was wrong, what if this doesn't go to plan, what if... \n\nJust my 2 cents. Depending on the type of projects you are working on, the organisation, and your personal values, your mileage may vary of course.\n\nI suck at strategy and planning. Implementation style roles or even Ops is something I excel much better at.
4	Not to be presumptuous, but i think a therapist would be the most beneficial. If you change jobs  the same underlying issues might follow you there.\n\nWhen i was younger, i had a terrible job that opened up and exploited my worst weaknesses. I was having panic attacks from work stress and asked my doctor if there was sick leave for that. Luckily, my docotor recommended an excellent therapist instead.\n\nWhat was so crazy to me was in so many aspects of my life, ppl looked up to me: i had confidence and i was in control, but work messed me up, i second guessed myself all the time, and i was so worried about screwing up (unhealthy perfectionist)... My boss saw it and she hated it so she only made things worse. And of course all this happening made me more scared of what could happen *the next time* so i was paralyzed of even moving forward on anything and i started procrastinating on my projects and leaving them till the last minute because everything was wrong in my view (or at least, everything could be better) and anything i did myself without help or approval was just going to be bad... Even talking about it now gives me chills thinking about the person i used to be.\n\nTherapy was a godsend
2	> I am wondering if I should do a career switch to a job that is more tailored to the ISTJ personality\n\nI wish I could answer this more directly, but I heard my calling as early as 4th grade, so I've never been able to give good advice about how to figure out what career path is best for any given person.  (When your dream career is basically handed to you that young, you don't have much of a "finding" process to share with others.)  \n\nI will say that you should avoid stereotyping yourself based on your MBTI type, especially with something as critical as a career field.  Actuary work sounds boring as hell in my opinion and I'm an ISTJ.  On the other hand, I don't often see my field (Chemistry) included in "ideal ISTJ career" lists, yet I've never doubted that I was meant for this line of work.  (Then again, I'm mostly doing analysis, so maybe that's a typical ISTJ thing.)  \n\nIt also sounds to me like you have an issue with confidence.  I don't know what you mean by "the way your coworkers treated you", but the impression I get is that you let your coworkers push you around in some manner (justified or not).  That probably reinforced their (apparent) idea that you can't handle your work (which is why they constantly check you) and you aren't helping that notion by always asking for directions (whether that's justified or not).  Your boss wants to trust your work and it sounds like the best way to sell that trust is through confidence.  Be confident (and correct) enough in your work that you don't need your coworkers to check what you did and be confident enough to tell them to sod off when they try to anyway.\n\nPersonally, I gained almost all of my confidence through work experience (knowing I'm competent and can work through problems) and picking up martial arts as a hobby (once you know how to handle yourself in a fight, other people become a lot less intimidating).  Maybe the artsy/abstract part of your job means it's not for you, but try sticking with it long enough to develop a sense of confidence in your work.  Hope this helps!
1	I work in ME as an analyst, also dabble with Environmental Health and Safety (OSHA) and day-to-day 5S, lean, and small project management. \n\nI enjoy my number crunching and directing small groups at a high level to tackle broad problems. I manage the holy Jesus out of Kanban boards and pride in always being on time and on budget for projects. That alone has given me at least a boost of credence to upper management as I’m the only lead analyst and no other analyst does inter-departmental PMs besides me.\n\nWhy does this appeal to me as an ISTJ? Because it forces me to be increasingly agitated with ‘solo checks’. By spending time building in second and even tertiary checks, you build confidence in catching and correcting your own errors and rely less on others for validation/verification.\n\n*E.g. in Excel you might need column C to be column A + column B. It’s easy enough to just make the formula... but that’s one check. Go a step further and verify that IF(C-(A+B)=0,””,”ERROR”).* \n\nJust by double checking you’re reducing your own false response rate and increasing your credibility, at least by a little. This is an incredibly simple use, but consider automated load testing or a number of other tools to validate prior to presenting. All this doesn’t mean to never ask for outside input, but being the person constantly asking other engineers how to engineer (let’s be honest, this is what it feels like with MECOPs sometimes) can be overused.\n\nIf you’re not confident in your abilities, build them up. If you make simple, easy mistakes that kind of make you slap your head - make a second check system! If you’re slapping your head, guess what coworkers who have been pointing out the same issue after multiple projects is thinking. Reduce your issues, reduce your risk of errors, reduce exposure as someone who needs a hand held through projects. \n\nFWIW you sound willing but maybe in a tough work environment. Maybe you can ask for a senior engineer as a mentor?
15	Does anyone else get irritated by nitpicking in arguments?	When I'm in an discussion or listening/watching one, having someone start their (counter-)argument with "well, you see, actually..." is more than enough to make my blood boil, because I know what's going to follow is something that *is* technically correct but misses the spirit of the thing that's being discussed.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this or is it not so common among ISTJs? I guess I'm okay with other kinds of nitpicking, sometimes maybe because I'm guilty of them myself, but this is only about nitpicking in arguments.
21	Not me. I don’t want to be wrong for a second longer than necessary and if they’ve got a valid point that’s fact-based and logical, then I’m all for hearing it. \n\nWhat makes my blood boil are emotion driven arguments. I don’t care how much “kinder” the result - facts are facts and they don’t care about your feelings. 
12	Well, you see, actually, I'm usually the one picking nits in an argument, so no.\n\nI'm more irritated by people ignoring facts and logic that are counter to their argument *because* those facts are counter to the spirit of their argument.\n\nArguments should be decided based on facts and logic, not "the spirit of the argument" or your feelings.
3	I am that person lol
3	I'm the one who usually nit picks in arguments. What irritates me is emotional arguments.
3	I see where youre coming from, but it depends on the "well you see actually" ...are they arguing in good faith or trying to twist the argument into a "gotcha" moment? \n\nI have no time for people who want to play words games to win an argument, but i have all the time in the world to hear a different opinion thats sound and logical and "well you see actually" just might be better than my view ;)
1	It depends. If it's my spelling or pronouncing that's being nitpicked, it may annoy me. But if I said something wrong, even though it's small, I like being corrected. It's important that everyone is on the same page. I correct small things like that all the time.
1	I hate that shit..." Well actually one time 1500 years ago this one armed midget in out space managed to....." SHUTUP! That's not even what we're talking about.\n\nGenerally I can't stand nit picking at all. It's just spending time and energy looking for something wrong and 99% of the time it's insignificant and just makes you look ugly and of poor character.\n\nRant over, your welcome. 
1	My istj husband is always nitpicking, and I don't mind the corrections as I'd like to know if I'm wrong, but I do mind if the entire point of what I'm trying to say gets derailed into a looong group discussion on the semantics :p
1	I'm about to say that an ISTJ that I know of tends to do this to me and I saw a lot of comments saying they're the ones nitpicking, lol.
1	I prefer that the central premise of an argument be addressed. It's why I tend to avoid online debates: frequent decay into tangential disputes.
5	Building confidence at work	I know that I'm good at what I do (analysis type work) and I get along with everyone. I have social anxiety as one of my mental illnesses. I work with an ENTJ boss and a INTJ coworker. They always have an interrogation type approach and it really bumps down my confidence a notch.\n\nThey don't like specifics so when they talk to me it appears complex and hard to follow. I usually get it after they explain it a couple of times more simply or slowly. I feel dumb and they have a condecending tone at times.\n\nI feel like I'm being walked all over. Can any other ISTJs provide some insights on how to improve my confidence?\n\nSwitching jobs isn't a solution for me. I know this situation will come up again and I'm not going to get a new job everytime my personality clashes with someone.
4	I got most of my confidence at work by building up a solid background of experience that I can use as "proof" of competence to myself.  I believe it's clear to my coworkers that I can handle 99% of my job independently so when I do need help I don't feel like a helpless idiot but rather a competent person who's not in their area of greatest expertise.  If someone doubts my abilities it's their fault for being wrong, not mine for being incapable.\n\nIt's also helpful to know your strengths and weaknesses and tell your coworkers (when it matters) so you can both understand each other.  For instance, I have a hard time remembering/processing verbal instructions because I'm not an auditory learner so I just tell people to show me how something is done or I try to get written instructions "because that's just how my brain works".
2	Know what you do - be the one and only expert in what you do. Own ever aspect of your job - work towards better numbers and bigger success and take credit for it.\n\nIts also really good that you can tell how they communicate best so you already know how they would like to be communicated with. Whenever possible, dont be overlly detailed or wordy with them; Keep it short and to the point.\n\nIf you can talk to your coworkers one on one, thats better (so it doesnt feel like theyre ganging up on you) ...dont *react* to them being condecending, instead *take control* of the conversation, let them know how you will receive infomation about a project, ask for specifics and be firm, yet casual - like its an obvious thing to ask for... Give the impression that specifics and details are the most normal thing in the world, and if he answers all vague and obtuse, look at him like he has two heads. Control the conversation. Thing is, its just one communication form over another, his is not better, and needing specifics is not worse. \n\nI have to work with an INTJ at work sometimes and i find when i press him for details the reason he doesnt want to give them to me is because he has no f**king clue. So keep that in mind - what you may be reading as condescendion might actually be their annouce at their own personal inability to be specific.
2	I find myself in a similar situation at work sometimes... My manager explains things to me in a way where I think I get it, but when I start the project it's not at all what I thought. He doesn't seem to give me the right details. This might help, I have learned to do these things when I'm interacting with him.\nFirst, do some research on the project/job before talking to your manager. If I'm walking into any situation with at least a little prior knowledge, I'm likely to get more out of it.\nRestate to your manager/cw what you think they are instructing you to do. Something like, "To be clear, I should do...." Make sure you share the same understanding of your task.\nHere's the thing. If you show that you are trying to do your job in the best way possible, they won't be mad. If you ask a ton of questions and still do it wrong, they will get frustrated. Before you leave the conversation, be sure you have all the info you need to proceed. \nMake sure it's evident you're learning. Ask a question, get an answer, retain the info, use it, and don't ask the question again. \nIf all else fails, talk to your manager and explain that you learn a little differently and that you might need a few more details in the instruction process.
1	I think that remembering that their approach to you doesn't reflect on you, it reflects on them. So when they're being condescending or whatever, that's a character flaw on THEM. Not you. You can't control that and you just have to accept that there's no way to fix that in other ppl.\n\nYou know that they're going to behave that way, you know that you'll understand their instructions eventually, and you know that you'll meet their expectations. So fuck them. Don't let these assholes trigger you anxiety. They do that shit for fun. 
14	Thoughts on venting	I’m just curious of your thoughts on venting. I totally understand letting some things out and then moving on but I often encounter situations where someone presents an issue, someone comments with an explanation or solution and the person replies “oh, just venting” or “I know how it works but just venting.” I’m always left wondering, well did you want a solution? Or, if you know why that happens why did you present it as a unsolved problem. 
19	I vent to myself to release frustration. Venting to others feels like a pointless waste of their time and an unnecessary interaction for both of us
5	I vent to others to possibly garner another perspective I hadn't thought of myself and thus other options to resolve them.
3	This is rampant on r/rant. Like did you just wanna scream at the sky or just find a bunch of people to agree and relate to you? 
3	When I vent, it's to get other viewpoints in on the matter. I welcome solutions or opinions. 
2	When I feel the need to vent, it\`s normally to get another perspective on what I\`m venting about. Sometimes when saying things out loud I can change my view on the matter, but having someone else share what they think is really helpful for understanding
1	Many people are not looking for advice when they vent. When I do it, I’m trying to let the emotions out so I don’t bottle them. I like to hear other viewpoints on the situation as well. \n\nSometimes, I know the issue and how to fix it, but need to vent anyway. Hearing the same solution that I already know doesn’t help in that case. Then, just a sympathetic ear is nice. No blame but just a sincere, “That really sucks,” is enough. Maybe even share a time when you felt similarly and how you dealt with it. \n\nIt’s more about feeling better emotionally than trying to find a solution. Let out the bad feelings and try to keep it calm. If I’m looking for actual advise, I try to phrase it differently. “I have no idea what to do about...” and such. 
1	I vent to a couple close friends and my boyfriend sometimes, whether it's work-related or whatever it may be. I don't expect a solution I just need to get it out and like to have someone there to listen, that's all. Generally the same goes for when people vent to me. I don't try to offer solutions unless they ask what I think they should do. I don't find anything wrong with venting once in a while or listening to someone vent for their own sake.
1	I think venting is all about expressing the emotions, anxiety, and angst that is associated with the problem in a safe way. Meanwhile when you say the things out loud it give you an opportunity to hear the things and register them in a different way than they had been Bouncing around your mind which gives you a chance to organize those thoughts ultimately leading so some semplance of psychological peace. Venting isn't about problem solving. Someone who is venting isn't asking for advice. They're asking for a safe place to be heard. If you have advice to offer, wait til the rant is over and ask if they would like feedback. If they say no, respect them and shutup. 
1	I vent, but rarely to or at others.  Generally, my venting and/or ranting is done in my truck on the way to or from work or when I'm in the shower.  Namely, times when I'm alone.
1	>“I know how it works but just venting.”\n\nI sometimes experience this myself, though I mostly do it in private.\n\n"Yes, I *know* 'why,' but that doesn't make it sound any less stupid. Yeah, yeah, I'll do it/accept it/whatever, but still."
9	Opine: ISTJs may be more prone to PTSD?	ISTJ here. Just curious what others opinion is. Actually, not just curious, I have it. In all other aspects of my life, I have a wall, barrier, tough shell...whatever. It's been over 5 years and I still have counseling.\n\nI was contemplating if (according to my ISTJ) this is normal or if we are susceptible to the diagnosis.\nTia
3	I'd believe it if someone said Si-Fi loops were responsible for making us more PTSD prone. We vividly relive memories on a regular basis. 
2	I guess it could be; when "in the grip" our inferior Ne makes makes us fatalistic, overwhelmed with dread and fear, and paranoid... So perhaps the function we have the least control over is the one running amok with a traumatized part of ourselves we also have little control of
4	Obviously everyone is different, but I have ptsd from childhood trauma. I built a massive wall which I have been in therapy for a long time to deal with. I could see how ISTJs are more prone to wallishness and compartmentalizing which is great for the short term but detrimental long term whereas other personality types might exhibit more in the moment anxiety and stress. 
1	Idk. I worked in the ER for 3 years and saw and experienced some fucked up shit. I don't think I was ever really effected by it because I don't create the bonds with people and experiences that would psychologically scar me. It would take something truly personal and substantial and painful to get me there. 
1	What are your enneagram types.	
3	5w6\nBut the 4 hit home in a violating kind of way.\nWhere did you take that test?
3	5w6 here as well, a whole new world of understanding myself and especially other people opened up when I discovered the enneagram. Of course once I learned about it, I then had to research the heck out of it.
2	Type 1
1	I’m 4w5! Also, Sleeping at Last created songs for each of the enneagram types (he’s in the process of writing the song for type 8 right now) and they ARE SO BEAUTIFUL. His song for type 4 (my enneagram) made me feel so understood but so exposed at the same time. He also has podcasts describing the creative processes for those songs. Highly recommend! 
1	It was a while ago, but i believe my type is 9... Specially 9w1
2	Help with ISTJ husband (separated)	Good evening\n\nLooking for some MBTI-specific input on my current situation. Separated (in-house cohabitation) with my ISTJ husband. He can be quite 'unhealthy' - very rigid, always has to be right about everything, can't admit fault, very childish when angry, quite mean and cruel sometimes, flooded by his emotions in general (both good and bad), very little empathy for other people.\n\nWe separated due to a perceived abandonment /betrayal on my part (no cheating or anything involved - I took a job long-distance and we were hopefully going to move together and it didn't work out). Also due to him finding me overly emotional and irrational. I was angry for a very long time due to ways hes behaved that I perceive as controlling. I am probably an unhealthy INFJ!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, just wondering what works for you in these situations. Healthy or otherwise. I want to reconcile and I'm trying to really let him take it at his own pace (he's said he will try although he keeps prevaricating). I'm struggling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't really know what will happen but I would like to try to understand, better. \n\nI find him very confusing sometimes as I feel like when he's emotional, he isn't this rational person at all and his words and actions don't match up, but he insists they do. Also he gaslights so the whole thing leaves me scratching my head.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer - he is a lovely guy overall and I know the above comes across as harsh but its just an intense situation (separation!).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you 
6	Never been in a serious argument like this having to do with separation/divorce, so take that as you will.\n\nIf I ever have an emotional time, I basically will shut down. I'm trying to work on that, but in the few instances where I feel myself getting overly emotional, I rein it in and just kinda go blank. I'll process them on my own when I have time to myself to think it over internally. \n\nI also have a tendancy to think I'm always right, but trying to work on that as well. I tend to be very logical and don't really care how it makes others feel. My current and previous SO have pointed out that I seem to lack empathy for the other person in an argument, and I agree. I see arguments as a disagreement about something factual, when an argument regarding how I or someone else feels about something, I don't really care to argue about it. \n\nI can't comment on the gaslighting thing, as I don't personally think I do that. Never heard someone mention me doing it either, but no way to positively rule out me doing something like that. 
3	He is leaving threatened by change, he might fear losing you and that's why he is leaving you.\nParadoxical, but at least I function like that. 
2	Either i can see the future or this is a repost
1	We don't process emotional stuff very well and when it gets to a point when we actually do express it, it's usually a whole disjointed mess that doesn't make any sense, and certainly doesn't line up with what we're thinking. I would focus on what he says  when he's not being emotional because that's what hell act on.\n\nWhen I'm an emotional mess, my words may sound like "omg, I hate all of this, and I'm so angry, and everything is so fucked up, and Idk what the hell I'm supposed to do or how to do it" and then ten minutes later, I'm like, "ok I had my melt down, let's fix this shit so that dont happen again" and start making plans to move forward. Don't make too much out of his emotional outbursts because he isn't either. We think that emotions are an inconvenience that's get in the way of the important stuff. Like problem solving
1	If he don't know what the right answer is, then you make the decision. This is your relationship too and he don't get to keep you in limbo while he gets to be cozy. 
14	ISTJs, how often do you develop a serious crush?	female ISTJ here. just wondered how often other ISTJ people have had serious crushes on someone? all my life i’ve had very light crushes on girls just because i thought that they were attractive. usually if they say/do something that i dont like or agree with, the crush is immediately gone. i tend to gush about my light crushes to my online friends so they think i develop crushes easily. \n\nit’s hard for me to develop a serious crush because i don’t have a lot of irl friends and it’s not my thing to crush on someone that i know from online. \n\nthe only person i seriously liked (maybe even loved) was a close friend of mine in high school. she’s an ESFJ so i admired her energy and appreciated how much she took care of me since i’m usually the one that takes care of others. \n\nanyways, sorry for the long post. have you guys ever had serious crushes before? 
18	I don’t get a lot of crushes, don’t fall in love easily. But once I do it takes forever to get over it.\n\nIt seems like it’s every 2-3 years for me, it’s like a cycle...
7	Not often, and never goes further than that. 
7	I'm probably atypical in this regard but I fancy bloody everyone, though maybe only lightly(though that may be due in part to my hatred of being single). Pretty rare I'll be SUPER into someone, but if I am it's almost like an obsession... 
3	When I was in primary and secondary school, I had a crush on any girl that even gave me the time of day. Definitely not love, since I was just a kid, I didn't know what that truly was until later in life. But yeah, back then I was constantly crushing. As for SERIOUS crushes, I usually only got those on someone who I then subsequently started dating. As time went on I got more cautious and selective with who received my affection.
3	Funny enough, I never got them often. I had a few crushes as a kid (every two years, in fact) that lasted awhile. Then maybe 2-3 as a teenager. I had a few periods of attraction in middle school that ultimately faded after a few weeks. Looking back, all my crushes were either long term or extremely short lived (aka: not serious).\n\nAs a young adult, I received the terrible advice to just date someone if I was attracted to them physically. I thought a lot of people were cute, so I ended up in a lot of superficial relationships. A lot, if not all, of my relationships with boyfriends ended after a few weeks because I knew it wasn’t right. I think the longest relationship I was ever in was four months. I was in the middle of one of these types of relationships when I met my now fiancé. We’ve been together eight years and are getting married in September! I think I was always logically waiting for someone who fit me and was as serious as I was willing to be with the right person... if that makes any sense. 
4	I didn’t really start having crushes until the end of middle school or beginning of high school, and they’ve all been pretty light. I think a heavy crush and/or love would only happen if I know the person well as a friend beforehand.
3	33/f ISTJ. I have never had a serious crush on a person that I haven’t known explicitly well. I never thought “oh, they’re hot. I’d like to have sex with them” either. You might want to look into demisexuality. \n\nTurns out r/demisexuality is a thing. Also asexual, allosexual, and a slew of other terms to define sexuality further. For me demisexuality is about establishing a functioning knowledge of the other person, establishing I like them and feel a mutual respect with them, and then I can proceed with ‘normal’ checklists like they’re attractive, we share hobbies, etc. 
3	I don't get them a lot. I have infatuation phases with one or two people a year (unless I'm in a relationship like rn) where it gets a little deeper, like I'll constantly try to talk to them all day via messenger/text.\n\nPeople are typically kept at arms length. I'm very private emotionally, so I lean on flirtations leading up to sex (barring the act itself) to express interest. This cycle usually lasts about 1-3 months before something in me flips it off, and it can be on very minor things (like if they don't wear cologne/deodorant). If my infatuation lasts longer than the first three months, then I'm going to fall in love, but my emotions usually develop quite slowly.\n\nWith my bf it's quite a different scenario, since we've been talking for about 5 months now, and I fell in love with him within the infatuation period and it's only gotten stronger instead of abating.
2	Throughout primary school and now my first year in college I’ve had maybe 2/3.  I don’t ever do much with it, just keep them in mind
2	I don't know about "crushes" per se, but I tend to take a shine to folks (or not as the case may be) really quickly, and it takes a bit to change my mind once I do. \n\nI can acknowledge that people I know are attractive, and that they might be someone I would like to spend time with, or be in a relationship with were the circumstances right, but it's not a case of being in love with them unless we are together. \n\nI think it's a side-effect of the ISTJ tendency for loyalty, where if I'm in a relationship with someone, I have the *hugest* crush on them, but I'm really good about not feeling that outside of my partner. 
2	This is actually a pretty interesting topic I hadn't thought to view through the lense of my personality type before ... it is kind of comforting to know it seems to be more rare based on the few responses here.  I'm 31 and have only fallen for 2 women and only ever had minor crushes which can usually be dismissed easily.  I've dated a lot and I keep waiting to feel this "spark" you hear about.  And I'm like JasonTheRobot, the last woman I fell for was about 3 years ago and I still think of her almost daily.  
8	Need your perspective on a particular ISTJ’s behavior.	I’m not exactly sure if this is type related, Ne grip related, stress related and/or enneagram related (self preservation 6 phobic). \n\nMy father is in his 70s and I (INFP) have moved back in to help out with things. \n\nI understand he’s restless, bored, overmedicated (age and ailments), perhaps a bit lonely, perhaps feeling worn down from lifelong obligation (he’s the first to help *everyone* and has taken quite a bit on his shoulders all his life. \n\nSo he’s been taking on projects. Starting a huge garden project. He will *endlessly* research the ins and outs on how to do things. Almost out of desperation to keep himself occupied. Have all these ideas and questions. Asks anyone and everyone for advice and information.\n\nNow he wants to start an Alpaca farm. Scratch that an Ostrich farm. Repairing and building. Endless research. Calling people incessantly.\n\nHe does lack Fe and Ne is a weak point. I get it, I’m just now becoming aware of my own Te and am doing some work to incorporate that into my own life. I’m more considerate of *not waking people up at 5am* to express new ideas and ask even more questions. \n\nI’ve been blunt but I’ve also been astute enough to see when he’s anxious and how he can get hurt if I bring certain things to light. So I’ll appease. \n\n\nWhat advice can you give (considering all the aforementioned factors) to help my Dad soothe some of this anxiety? Or just help him feed what needs to be fed constructively. He’s driving a lot of people nuts. And he’s told me that if he doesn’t do this *”he will die of stillness”* and I’m not sure if he’s keeping busy to keep shitty feelings at bay. I can’t make this assumption but we are a lot more alike than we are different so... I get that possibility as well.\n\n\nThoughts? I can’t quite articulate clear questions. \n\n* Is this stress behavior and Ne inferior shit coming up? \n* How can I help him *enjoy* the process rather than research out of anxiety, for example.\n\n(Lack of Fe- the blindspot...is just the ISTJ cognitive makeup. C’est La Vie. So calls at 5am waking people up is none of my beeswax!)\n\n**Thanks for your responses. You’ve brought much needed clarity. Please keep the suggestions coming! You’re also giving me ideas to help keep him happily busy!!**\n\n
8	I am not sure if I have much advice or even how type related it is. I know I enjoy having things to do and have always been the "family manager." when I didn't have a job I flitted from idea to idea and couldn't commit to anything. Again don't know how type related that is but his actions sounds like something I would do. Mainly, he needs something to do and probably a routine. I am someone who needs structure. So maybe he needs to volunteer every other day at set hours, read in the mornings, garden (or other activity) in the afternoons. Go for a walk in the evenings after dinner. \n\nAlso, endlessly researching is a compulsion of mine. My fiancé usually just lets me talk /research and he knows I'll come to the right conclusion eventually. 
3	Your dad's situation resonates with me.  My dad recently retired and immediately built a massive workshop and started practicing/teaching Tai Chi (these were entirely justified, by the way, not misguided impulses).  If/when I retire, I plan to do something similar.  I need to *do* things in my free time.  I need projects to work on, new hobbies to master, something to push me out of bed in the morning.  I need to be productive.  I need to *live*.  If I don't, I have to force myself to calm down and actively remind myself that it's ok to do nothing sometimes.  Why is this the case?  I don't know.  Maybe it's an Si thing, maybe it's a Type A thing, maybe it's just my quirk.\n\nIt sounds like your dad has the same drive so you should help him find something to work on.  If he's like me, this drive isn't ever going to go away so it's best to indulge it.  The thing he works on has to be meaningful, it has to relate to his interests, it has to present challenges, and it needs to be time consuming.  Si does mean we like working with our hands and we don't mind being left alone to figure something out.\n\nAn ostrich farm sounds too tedious for what it gives him, will probably be expensive, and is a bit ridiculous to boot.  My suggestion is to see if he'd enjoy woodworking.  It's hands-on, there's a infinitely high skill ceiling, he can be creative with it, and if he really gets into it, he could set up an Etsy account and find productivity in selling nice things to people.  He doesn't need to jump right into a full-on workshop like my dad (he was practically raised in construction), just let him dabble for a bit.\n\nI hope this helps you understand your dad!
1	Can't he just be impassioned? I know after high school I became depressed and REALLY needed an outlet. When people are depressed they need hobbies. I dug out a pond, gardened and learned a lot about it for about 2/3yrs. It was like a safe haven mentally and puts your skills to use. If I was you, I would encourage your father to develop himself and his skills. This is a time in his life where he can focus on himself for once. I would respect your father, join in. 
4	Any professionals wanting to keep their team more in sync and organized?	I've made an app that helps keep your team organized and accountable regarding asks, action items, announcements, etc. Looking for any feedback, positive or negative. If you aren't interested in using this, please let me know why. https://getpigeon.app
1	This is such an ISTJ app.\n\nYou will never track me. I am an ENTP.\n\nNot being accountable for my laziness is the best thing about my job.\n\nHow dare you try and take that away from me.
9	Do some ESTJs annoying the living crap out of you sometimes?	I feel compelled to rant on something that happened tonight.\n\nSo, long story short my ESTJ roommate was driving me nuts tonight. We were hanging out with a couple of friends, and throughout the night she was making some know-it-all comments or some comments that gave me the impression that she felt like she was superior to everyone else. Things like directly chastising other people for making mistakes in board games or trying to tell people what to do when she herself probably didn't have the best idea of what to do in a certain situation.  And there was another situation where her boyfriend and I shared blame in a mistake we made, but she made me feel like I was all to blame in that situation.\n\nLater I introduced a new type of card game to everyone that I used to play as a kid all the time, and she proceeded to make some crass remarks about certain rules being weird and how "this \[particular rule\] is so different from every other card game I've played - this just seems so weird to me." It was as if she was annoyed that there was such a "weird" rule at all. To which I, at that point fed up with her attitude, snarkily replied that, "we're just trying to have a good time here.... it's not like we're playing for money or anything high stakes, so take a fucking chill pill. Shut your mouth, play the damn game once, and deal with it." (paraphrase, but it had that sort of tone :))\n\nMaybe I was just super sensitive tonight and irrational, but I also just didn't want to deal with her attitude anymore. I usually get along with her, but her directness tonight in particular just really made me unhappy.\n\nEdit: sorry about that unfortunate title mistake lol
12	My dad is an ESTJ. Last night he told me to start the gas fire which I have done countless times before. He is sitting in a lounge chair watching me. Tells me to get the matches out of the cabinet. I turn on the gas. He tells me to throw a match into the fire(I’m rolling my eyes like “no duh”). I light a match and throw it in the fire but miss. So I get another match. He is sitting there just berating me; saying “light the match first” and “throw it in” over and over. I pull out another match, light it off of the first one, throw it in, and the gas ignites. Then I turn around and say “would you shut up, I know how to light the damn fire.” We both laugh. That’s just our relationship. But it’s totally characteristic of ESTJ and ISTJ. The ESTJ wants to micro manage and the ISTJ wants to be left alone because it’s perfectly capable on its own thank you very much.
7	[deleted]
5	Sounds about right. My ESTJ friends does just about everything listed in this post\n\nDon’t know if that’s just them or he’s just immature, can’t really tell the difference. 
3	My co worker is an ESTJ, and as much as I love him, he overwhelms me a lot 
3	Oh boy I feel that one. I have a few ESTJs as friends, but one of them (who also is my roommate) can be very annoying. For no reason, like bruh take a chill pill I know what I’m doing.\n\nVery micromanaging. His last roommates listen to him apparently, and when I moved in he tried to force his weird rules on me. That didn’t work. 
2	My dad is an ESTJ.\n\nIf things aren't being done as efficiently or timely as he expects, hoo boy am I going to get an earful!
2	My ex is an ESTJ and there wasn't a thought that went through his head that didn't come out his mouth, no matter how mean, hateful, insignificant, dumb, or crass it was. He would go out of his way to make ppl around him feel awful and small and never had a kind word to say about anything. He'd tell the same story over and over and over again but if I said the same story twice in six months I had short term memory loss and was dumb. We've been broken up for a year and a half. I call his ass out on his lies and patronizing every time now. 
1	I'm ENFP and my life has been only romantically engaging with ISTJs and that's kinda interesting	Our functions are literally opposite one from another.\n\nENFP: NeFiTeSi\n\nISTJ: SiTeFiNe\n\nWhich, in theory, could make me think "oh, that's a good balance", but when one of us (or both) are not well enough... Like a Ne grip in an ISTJ or NeTe loop, for example.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith the 4 experiences I had (and I'm only counting relationships +1yo) I learned a lot, which is quite nice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I just wanted to share this because it's really random but I think the world deserves to know   \n\n\nPS: pls don't hate
4	ENFPs and ISTJs are duels in socionics. Which is theoretically known for easy communication. Especially since you're Si seeking which is our dominant function, and we're Ne seeking which is your dominant function.
1	That’s interesting. \n\nWhat attracts you to ISTJs? What’s your biggest dislike?
4	(Survey) Relationship Between Personality Type and Drug Use	
18	I have never smoked or done any drugs including weed.  (And I live where it is legal.  Even have a drive thru less than a mile from my house.)  I've only had about 10 drinks in my 56 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNever liked the idea of losing control.
6	I'm curious if I'm in the minority of ISTJs that use illegal drugs. \n\nI know many will type us as traditionalists, but I believe I'm not alone in saying we won't follow tradition blindly. This is one of the cases where I believe the tradition makes no sense. 
3	Considering this only posted to 3 or 4 of the other 16 types, re results are going to be heavily skewed. 
2	The question about choice of recreational drug should not be limited to one option. There are people who have multiple choices. Personally I drink and smoke weed.
1	Among the most ISTJ books ever written is [Pihkal (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PiHKAL) in which a pharmacologist and his wife meticulously catalogue their experiences with an expansive repertoire of synthetic psychotropic agents. Would recommend (the book of course)
0	Youtuber C.S. Joseph Concludes That Ben Shapiro Is ISTJ	
13	Shapiro is an ESTJ. CS Joseph is atrocious at typing.
4	Ahh shit, so am i
15	Atheists?	I was raised in a Jewish household, completed all the rituals etc. As an adult (and after being exposed to other communities) I lost my faith.\n\nCurious about the community’s religious beliefs or lack thereof. Logic and reason reign supreme around here so I imagine I’ll see a lot of similar responses, but I’m genuinely curious.\n\nAlso - Happy Friday :)
18	Agnostic atheist checking in. I was raised non religious and called myself an atheist for a long time but eventually found that to be too much of an absolute.\n\nWhile I don't believe in a god or grand design etc, I don't pretend to know for certain if this is true or not. I don't have proof there is and I don't have proof there isn't.
10	Practicing Catholic checking in
7	I was raised non-denominational Christian by my Dad and Methodist by my Mom.  Growing up I only went to church with my Dad on his weekends, but stopped going from my teens-early 20s.  I started going back to church (non-denominational Christian) on my own about the age of 22.  I try to go every Sunday, but I'm not perfect.  So, practicing Christian here.
8	Raised with no religion, became a Christian after meeting my (now) husband (INTP). That was almost 30 years ago. 
6	Being raised as an atheist I (36M) am leaning towards Taoism in the past couple of years. I simply find the notion that real truth can't be spoken rather fascinating. 
5	Brought up Protestant , atheist most of my adult life.
6	Raised in a Muslim household. I lost faith around junior year of HS because I slowly realize that this is not the lifestyle I want to commit to. My mom said that God will answer all of my troubles but It has not and I thought about the kids suffering in Syria, Yemen, and Iraq and how their prayers are not answered. I also read the translation of the Qur'an and found a bunch of messed up quotes (especially with how it slanders Jewish people). Not only that but when I read the translation, Muslim elders questioned me about my motive.
4	My parents half-assed tried to raise me a baptist. I thought for the longest time that my dad was an atheist, but no, just too lazy to wake up that early on Sunday.\n\nWhen I was a small child, <6 years old, I was convinced that there was something wrong with me because I couldn't "hear the voices" or "feel the spirit" when praying. As a result of that and many other things, I was a god-doubting agnostic from about 8 years old until I met my future husband at 15, then atheist since. I'm lucky to have met someone who shares my lack of belief. 
5	My familiy is christian, but they where very good at letting me know I could belive in anything I want. I chose to be an atheist when I was around 15. Got nothing against good people who happen to be religious. I just find any kind of god highly unlikely to exsist.
3	Well I (23m) was raised orthodox christian but when i grow up i became atheist.. 
3	Non denominational Christian checking in, I love information and finding out the why of things. I love science and technology but for me there are still unanswered questions that science can't quite figure out. 
3	I'm an Atheist but not sure how common it is for ISTJs. I was raised without religion (parents are believers but didn't impose any type of religion on me).
3	[deleted]
3	Raised Southern Baptist, deconverted in college. I’ve been an agnostic atheist for about 10 years.
3	From a purely logical standpoint, atheism it's just as illogical as any kind of theism. There is just as much proof for *no* god as there is for a god. \n\nI have more respect for theists who know their are no facts and just believe with faith, and for agnostics who acknowledge that theres probably something, but theres just no way to know for sure
2	I am an atheist; I was raised protestant but stopped going to church when I was allowed to make my own decisions regarding it. On the list of things I'd like to study is theology- just to understand why people put so much trust in something for which there is no proof/ realistic reason to believe. Prayer also freaks me out \[ especially in governmental/work related settings- love the first amendment\]. If you feel the need to ask a non existent being for help to do your job - running a government- maybe you shouldn't be there in the first place. It is more logical in settings when control is really out of your hands, like hospitals (though it is still in someone's hands- a doctor)  The pledge of allegiance runs along similar lines for me. 
2	I've met quite a bit of atheists or agnostics that manage to be less logical or reasonable than a hardcore Ken Ham creationist.
1	Practicing Presbyterian reporting in.
1	You honestly believe that first statement?
1	atheist turned Catholic
1	I converted to Conservative Judaism.  The structure and ritual appealed to me and the openness of my rabbis to answering questions keep me interested.
4	Have any of u dated or are dating an ENFJ?	What are the pros and cons?
3	With an ENFJ (F) right now. \n\nPros: \n\n* Amazingly encouraging. She makes me feel like I can do anything I put my mind to. \n\n* This kinda goes along with #1, but she really seems to balance me out, as I'm normally on the slightly cynical/realism side. She is always so optimistic, we can have endless conversations about just about anything because of this I believe.\n\n* Can read me like a book. I've never had a partner that is able to read my normally emotionless self. (Guess this can be a con as well depending on the situation though)\n\nCons:\n\n* She is very flighty with her goals/ideas. I can't tell you how many things she's told me she wants to do/improve on in the ~9 months we've been together. From quitting cigarrettes (don't get me started on how many times she's tried quitting), getting back into exercising, to things like keeping an actual schedule and being on time etc. \n\n* I don't think this is an ENFJ, but it REALLY grinds my gears. She's religious, but leans towards buddhism (her words), but she is also into spirits and has crystals in her place above the doorways etc. If we continue dating an eventually move in, this would be a dealbreaker for me. I'm an athiest, but I'm generally ok with most religions, like if it was just the buddhism, I'd be fine with it. But the chanting with crystals etc is too out there for me\n\n* Another one that I think is to do with how flighty she is, is her messiness. Everything from her house, to her car, to her phone layout is messy as can be. She occasionally cleans it all out, but she let's it get messy again for several weeks/ months before that happens. 
2	I’m an enfj with an istp partner if that helps!
4	ENFP (M) needing advice on an ISTJ (F)	Taking things slowly with her, I really don't want to mess up things. We've been on 3 dates now, got set up through a mutual however I find it very difficult to read her through texting. We have both accepted the fact that we are terrible at texting so we try to call instead when we can.  I had a 3rd date with her last night, a lovely bonfire on a beach, we did run into a couple of obstacles that had cut the night short and got her stressed, she also had work early morning. Compared to the first two dates we were allot less intimate, maybe this is due to being on a beach? Regardless, she did text to make sure I got back home safely which then I responded to. The one thing I admire about her personality is she is very straight forward, I am currently being left on read. I might double text if she doesn't contact me in the next 24hrs. If she told me that next time we'll do something at my end before I drove back home, the below average night shouldn't be a deal breaker right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe had work today and may have been exhausted, I know I won't see her until next week. Any pointers or advice for a turbulent ENFP Male? She is more turbulent than me though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, she struggles to show emotion which I'm fine with, but I suck at leading and don't know if I should try and be dominant from now on if I want to get more intimate, without sex.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLove your Personality type, Thank you for your time!
5	>I am currently being left on read.\n\nDepending on the exact exchange, she may not think it actually requires a response. For example:\n\nHer: I just want to make sure you got home safe.\n\nYou:  Sure did, love muffin. Thanks for checking.\n\nHer: [No response needed]
6	Confusing... Is the issue the being left on read? Because i think you can tell by now ISTJs dont like to shate their emotions and A LOT goes on inside that never gets shared. So sending us a bunch of tects you expect us to respond to, especially with lovey dovey responses, just gets overwhelming. \n\nENFPs get on real well with ISTJs, and ENFPs are really good at reading people, regardless of how much they freely express... So fall back on your natural gifts to navigate this.
3	I (M) dated an ENFP (F) for about 3 months a couple years ago. Sex was amazing but we clashed over everything else. She loved going out, I wanted to stay in. I relied on past experiences to process information whereas she tried to intuit the future which I find absolutely silly.\n\nIf you read literally any post / forum on this combo you’ll note that it’s a very, very hard relationship to maintain. \n\nKeep in mind we like structure, a sense of fair play and being left alone mostly. If she has an issue expect to hear about plainly. \n\nAs always, people all individuals and don’t expect her personality to align perfectly with any description you read online. \n\nGood luck. 
2	ENFP (M) with ISTJ wife here (been 7 years, married for 1). I’ve been seeing a lot more of this combination on Reddit lately, which is interesting because historically I’ve always read that this was a difficult mix to have. I really have to wonder if things like digital communication has changed the dynamic.
2	Coming from an ISTJ female who is pretty good at "being" outgoing, she may be taking the time to recover from the social interaction, it's nothing personal. I spent a lot of last week with my new partner (ENFP) (we also work together) and by Friday I was stressed out and snappy from not having any alone time. I told him I needed Saturday by myself and he was fine with that. He was amazed at the difference in me on Monday, saying that I was happy and responsive again. She may have just "gone into herself" a bit, give her time - it's nothing personal !
1	Don't try to read her, over text or in person. We are extremely literal so there's really nothing to read. We will either tell you or we won't.... And we won't share it right away. She's not going to initiate things or take a dominant role in the relationship. That's just not what we do. But once we know where things are going, we're on board. 
15	Large Group Events	How do y’all feel about going to events or parties where you don’t know anyone well? For me, I only feel comfortable going on trips or to parties where I know or can potentially get along with at least one other person. I always think of putting myself out there but end up being uncomfortable in these situations
27	My immediate thought upon reading the title, before I even opened it, was "No thanks.  I'd rather not."\n\nAfter reading the post, I'm sticking with that position.
7	No.
4	I love going out to concerts and bars and stuff. I don't care if I know anyone or not. I'm not there for them, I'm there for me, I'm there for the music, I'm there for the beer. Everyone else can kiss my ass. Sometimes I talk to ppl all night and usually never talk to them again in my life, and sometimes I sit there with my beer enjoying the music, watching the crowd and having a great time all by myself.\n\nI feel like needing someone to go with me to feel comfortable ultimately trickles down to asking someone permission to go and I'm a grown ass woman whose served her time staying home waiting for someone else to have a good time so I could have one too. Fuck that shit. 
3	I want to. But I feel like I’m not social enough to meet random people and connect with them. \n\nI also prefer to go with groups where I know at least a few ppl. 
2	I can and actually enjoy doing it for work. If it's purely social, which I have to do a lot for my ENFP boyfriend, it's like fucking mental gymnastics :( Hate it!
2	It depends on the certain variables. What kind of event is it, who's going to be there, what time will it begin, what time will people actually arrive, etc. While I'm definitely one that prefers his alone time I'm not opposed to going out occasionally. While some of us may have similar dispositions I don't think everyone here will refuse to go to a large group event. 
1	Normally, I'd go to events/parties if I know at least one other person. However, if I really want to (and that itself is a rarity) I will go to an event/party where I don't know anyone (or anyone well).
1	I fully agree. A minimum of one person that I know/can get to know is required. Like most other people commenting, it depends on my obligations too. If it's a commitment and I know no one then I don't have a choice, otherwise hard pass.
1	I generally don't enjoy large group events, especially if I don't know anyone. I can put myself out there if I know someone at the party or if the party is with people that share similar interests with me. I try to go to events on occasion, but only when I feel like pushing myself a little. 
14	The 7 Work Habits of Highly Effective Introverts	
6	ISTJ dating an INTP	Curious if anyone has any experience dating an INTP. I am an ISTJ female currently seeing an INTP male. 
8	I am married to an INTP male for 2 years, together for 6. Pros are we both like to stay in and relax. Con is he views the world a lot differently than I, but this is also a pro because it has expanded my mind and his too.
6	I am an ISTJ female who has been with my INTP husband for almost 28 years, 24 of those married. I can’t imagine being with anyone else. 
5	The genders are reversed for us, INTP lady here married to my ISTJ guy. It's the best relationship I have ever had. I feel incredibly lucky to wake up with him every day. 
1	INTP male married to ISTJ female, more than ten years of happy and healthy relationship. We have deep conversations and share many interests, we are open-minded and honest with each other, and our love life hasn't shown any signs of decay! \n\nIt's a best romantic match according to socionics model G, where the two types share Ti and Ne. \n\nISTJ's other best match is ISFP. (they share Si and Te) \n\nINTP's other best match is INFJ. (they share Ni and Fe) \n\n
1	I'll be the odd one and say that I did not enjoy my relationship with an INTP. I was going through severe depression and he made my day to day worse by putting me down constantly. He always convinced me that I was the cause of our problems. I get along with INTPs as friends though. 
6	ENTP with ISTJ parent	Im [21] an ENTP with an ISTJ parent that I just dont get 90% of the time. We get into it constantly, and the other parent has to intervene. \n\nToday is a day I dont work or have any play scheduled. So, Im enjoying a relaxing day of nothing. The ISTJ in my life would rather me use this free day to CLEAN. Like wtf man. I cant imagine a thing I would like to do LESS. \n\nThey tend to be condescending and make little remarks that get under my skin. [Truth is, Im better at cleaning than them. Im just cluttery and disorganised. But I keep things sanitary, esp when I clean spaces like the kitchen Im way more thorough than them. Thats why I hate doing it! It takes forever bc I do a good job] \n\nBut to me, on a day I would love to have unstructured time to unwind, they seem irked. And once theyre irked they stay all mad until I grovel bc thats how they are. \n\nAnd I dont understand how their mind works at ALL. Theyre the complete opposite of me. Im not living here much longer, but Im tired of being stressed. \n\nDo any of y'all who get along with ENTPs know how to make up for the differences? How would you explain why this person is that way? Why are they so tightly wound? Is there a way I can communicate I dont want to do the thing without pissing them off???? Is this how a normal ISTJ acts?  \n\nIm just laid back and never hold grudges [So I dont understand why they stay mad at me all day over a brief interaction]. I think things should be done when people want to do them. And cleaning a superficial mess is not a high priority to me, esp in the privacy of my bedroom. I will clean spaces that are public or need sanitised without complaint [unless Im extremely drained]. And my room is currently much cleaner than usual.\n\nTL;DR- my ISTJ parent stresses me out. How do I understand them and reason with them? How do I get them to understand Im not lazy just bc I dont constantly want to be working on tasks?
6	I wouldn't call us wound up... Highly organized, structured, minimalistic, clutter free, and timely, yes. As an ISTJ parent of teenagers, they do often get upset with me because of the same sorts of things. But here's the deal.... Im not raising children, I'm not raising teenagers, I'm raising adults. I'm raising the finished product. Just like cattle farmers don't raise calves, and chicken farmers don't raise chicks. In adulthood, you gotta get up on your days off and do all the shit you didn't have time to do or want to do on your days on. Being and staying organized, keeping your area clean, having few unnecessary things laying around, etc everyday makes taking care of things on your day off take up less time. We aren't good communicators so it may not seem like that's the lesson being instilled here, but in the long run your being taught adulting skills that you will value one day. This also teaches a strong work ethic, which is important to us.\n\nMy 19 yo daughter HATED this stuff... At the time.... And she's so glad I drilled it into her before she moved out. She thanks me regularly whenever she has to deal with someone her age whose parents didn't teach them this stuff.
2	First off, I am sorry you are having this issue. I am sure its frustrating. My younger brother is an ENTP and had the same problem. My dad and I are both ISTJs and my brother often felt like he was being picked on. I think what you have to understand is that ISTJs are very productive. We tend to feel like there's a million things to do and we just tackle our to-do-list all the time. I think it might be hard for your dad to understand why you wouldn't want to use your time the way he does. He may incorrectly viewing you as "lazy" or "unorganized". Of course that doesn't mean you are any of those things. I think he may be unfairly judging you by viewing your actions through his own lense.
2	I relate more to you than your parent. This might be better explained by enneagram than mbti.\n\nSome people just can't stand to see others relax. It might be envy...
2	It's easier to convince someone a clear surface is sanitary than a cluttered surface.\n\nAnd I'm not saying your wrong. I'm expressing what is going through our minds when we hear your side of things. In YOUR house all this is pretty benign. You can clutter and sanitize and not bother anyone else. In YOUR house, that is. Right now, youre in THEIR house and it's effecting their psychological wellbeing.\n
2	I know ppl say any type can get along blah blah blah, but Ive noticed ISTJs and ENTPs constistantly butt heads. \n\nI have a theroy; ISTJs have the potential to be unintentionally calous and cruel, while ENTPs have the potential to be quite knowlingly calous and cruel. So when an ISTJ is being "mean" an ENTP can interpret it as being completely calculated and intentional and a direct attack... And its like 99.99% of the time not. The ISTJ doesnt even realize theyre coming off as a jerk, or maybe theyre just having a bad day or something.\n\nI dont know why, but of all the T types, ENTPs seem to be quite sensitive to this. They take the ISTJ grump behavior the most personal. Just remember, its not personal. And ISTJs can be reasoned with. They are logical and you are logical... I know ENTPs hate doing this for some reason, but: explain yourself. Erase all emotion and explain your position logically. Dont you love debating? Tell your ISTJ parent why you need a day to relax. Make a case for yourself until *they* are satified. Achieve victory. Done.
3	ISTJ’s. What stereotypes are not true for you?	Hey, I am an ENFP guy, and after having read through socionics theory for 5 hours straight (ENFP’s can be quite thorough once you sparked their interest), I discovered ISTJ’s and ENFP’s have a dual relationship, as in most favourable.\n\nNow I was wondering, what are ISTJ actually like, if they are apparantly so compatible to me in theory. What are they like in real life.\n\nI can read all the descriptions, but I’s rather hear what makes you different from those descriptions. \n\nAs an ENFP I can say, for example, that I love sports. Dancing, surfing, sailing, those things are amazing. I also love ‘doing’ things. This is in contrast to the stereotype of lazy too focussed on thoughts. Of course I certainly have that element, but it doesnt define me.\n\nSo my question for you is what makes you you. Are there ISTJ out there who do art, or are really focussed on sports , on looks, social things as opposed to the stereotypical etc etc
30	Being really focused on sports actually *is* a stereotype for an ISTJ.\n\nThe description isn’t too far from the truth.\n\nSome things that are different for me are that I don’t *like* following rules but I can see their importance.  But if it’s something I think is dumb, I either won’t follow it or will do something that should end up on r/maliciouscompliance .\n\nI also am a big procrastinator.  But only to a point that I know I’ll still be able to get the work done.  But I definitely wait until the last minute a lot.
18	I hate working.\n\nIf i never had to work another day in my life and was an unproductive lazyass with no resposibility... i would be sooo happy. I think ive worked enough already to last me TEN lifetimes 😑
7	I'm a pretty straight forward ISTJ. I'm really into roleplaying games like dungeons and dragons, and music. I play 4 instruments, for fun and in bands. I don't know if those aren't ISTJ things, but those are my only outlet for my creativity.
7	- I procrastinate but to the point that I know I'll still be able to get work done with some time spared.\n\n- I do some songwriting (mostly back in HS but some in university). I also write in my journal my thoughts and feelings.\n\n- If I find a rule stupid I will break it. However, when it comes to doing drugs and drinking I do so moderately.
6	\*ISTJs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMultiples don't get apostrophes. Maybe the stereotype of being a Grammar Nazi isn't true?
4	I'm pretty emotional.  \nI have a strong distrust for authority figures, though I will respect them if they're competent.    \nI draw n stuff.  \nI'm very romantic.    \nI'm significantly goofier than the stereotypes would have you believe. :P 
3	I've played music since I was 8 (it's one of my biggest passions) and find it easy to read and absorb other people's emotions.  The "stoic" ISTJ stereotype only applies to me when I'm not feeling energetic. 
3	ISTJ here, happily married to an ENFP. I can tell you our most important differences: \n\n1. Before making a move or a choice, especially if it's job-related, I need to think of every possible scenario, because I need to picture best- and worst-case scenarios and be prepared in case the latter happens. I become anxious if I don't. My SO just doesn't get my behavior, because unlike me, he chooses to be optimistic and deal with situations as they present themselves. He does plan a little, but not as much as I do.\n\n2. What causes anxiety. For me, anything related to social interactions or people possibly judging me; not being the best at everything I do (this leads to procrastination). For him, toxic environments (he's deeply affected by other ppl fighting in front of him for example); health issues. We calm each other a lot in stressful situations, and usually when I'm anxious, he's not, and vice versa.\n\n3. What we're good at. We're both good at breaking down problems, but he's got creative and practical solutions; I like analyzing more theoretical stuff and finding complex explanations (sometimes just because it's fun). \n\n4. OMG COOKING. We used to fight all the time when we cooked at home, because I just Need To Follow The Recipe (let me rephrase: multiple recipes, which I compare beforehand before choosing according to various criteria), and he just... makes stuff that he hopes will turn out ok (also: likes creating new recipes from picking random stuff from the fridge). \n\n5. I could go on forever...
2	P.s. I am also interested in knowing how to spot ISTJ’s hehe. Would like to do some real life experiments now that I know.
2	Liking reading, but that's probably add
2	My kids call me "extra" all the time. I'm super flamboyant and stuff. Loud hair, loud clothes, loud persona, quiet mouth and body language. I LOVE being out with ppl and going to concerts and bars and stuff, I just do it quietly. I'm super spontaneous and always up for an adventure. But that's my outside of work life. 
2	Not interested in sports. At all.
1	I procrastinate a lot, but like others commenting, it's because I know I can get the job done in a given time so I just put it off. 
1	I’m the listening ear to complainers at work.  They know I’ve been there forever; they know I will listen and not judge; they know I will offer practical advice about the situation if they want me to; they know it will stay between unless I think it needs to go up to the next level (and then I always warn them that I will need to let so-and-so know because it’s important), and they know that I understand their frustrations and the need to just let it out sometimes.  🤷🏼‍♀️ I have no idea how I came to be approachable.    \n\n  “So my question for you is what makes you you”...\n\nI live and breathe routine.  Routines make my life easy because I don’t have to stress about anything...I already know this works, so I’ll just do that.  I work hard and efficiently so that I can be lazy the rest of the time.  I will kill myself at work trying to get things done on time and done correctly, but once I’m on my own time, I’m very laid back.  I’m much harder on myself than I am others.  I don’t really get involved in other people’s situations or care how they live. You do you and just let me do me.  All of these are typical ISTJ qualities, I believe. \n
1	Basically all of them to the point where I stay away from the label in mbti if I can in favour of socionics
1	ISTJ and really wanna be a stay at home mom. All they talk about is how career driven I'm supposed to be and I wish there was more stuff out there for ISTJ women that wasn't just career, wanting to be independent, etc. 
1	I love music and can read it, but like picking up new instruments and learning stuff by ear. I like art, though I don’t care for sports. Love fantasy and RPGs. I’m not religious.  Left-leaning politically. Don’t like traditional gender roles. Great sense of humour (though I’m probably not the best judge of that).\n\nI need my alone time, but make small talk with strangers all the time. I procrastinate with most things, though I’ll always give a great “product” on time. I don’t like change much overall, but will almost always push for change if it means getting something done more efficiently. I work in Information Managament, which really calls to my organizational side, but also requires adapting to frequent change and getting others to let go of “the way they used to do things”. \n\nI don’t like to break rules, but I won’t necessarily follow rules that don’t make sense. Think of it more as a “lawful neutral” personal code. \n\n\nStereotypes that hold true: Don’t like some types of change (especially environmental/physical), love routine, like to plan ahead (and make backup plans), very organized, neat freak, uncomfortable with emotions to a degree (like comforting people), perfectionist, can be hard on myself, can be judgmental of others, hate dishonesty/lack of loyalty
10	How do you communicate emotions (better)?	I have a hard time connecting with people because I seem uninterested like a brick. Other types can convey their emotions very clearly through the way they talk or body language. It's often unnecessary to listen to the exact words because you can see/feel they are passionate or anxious.   \nI can't do that good enough, no matter how hard I try. Stressing words works to a certain degree, but my tone changes just slightly between my most passionate subject and the most boring.   \nPeople often have no idea how I feel about something unless I find words that describe it. But finding those words is so exhausting, takes too long and I'm often misunderstood. It's really frustrating when I actually care a lot and others think I don't.\nEdit: Ok that's exaggerated, but you get what I mean...\n\nDo you know that and what are your tricks to communicate so that others can relate?
4	My best advice would be to parrot their own enthusiasm/can't stand it language back at them.\n\nIf you overhear one of these folks you are dealing with say "God, I absolutely go nuts for Chik-Fil-A Waffle Fries" - you could use the "go nuts" phrase for something you love and they'll understand your passion.\n\nOtherwise you might be using words that have meaning to YOU but not to THEM.\n\nThat would be particularly true for people from different generations.\n\nCan you give a more concrete example?\n\nBecause if you show up in a Star Wars shirt, with a Star Wars phone cover, a Star Wars watch, drinking out of an R2-D2 cup and you say "I'm really into Star Wars" - even if you said it in monotone I think it would be difficult for people to not believe you.
3	I tend to talk a little bit faster and use more adjectives when I'm talking about something interesting to me. I also follow up my statements wit "does that make sense" or something like that, because I know that I don't always communicate well and I want be sure I'm understood, it also gives them a chance to join the conversation (because I forget to include them), or ask for clarification.\n\nOur enthusiasm comes out with active involvement, we aren't really able to fake a convincing bubbly, happy, bouncy personality and that's OK. Leave that to those E people we don't understand, lol. They dont understand us either. 
1	Just be yourself
1	I know we get mis-stereotyped as emotionless robots, but what youre describing here is... extreme. This is beyond an ISTJ quirk
1	I hear what you're saying and I have the same problem where people tend to misunderstand how I'm actually feeling because I'm not expressive enough, I don't have the right words etc.\n\nDon't take this the wrong way but I wonder if you're seeking some sort of validation from the people you're trying to connect with. \n\nWhat I've come to learn (and accept) is that not everyone I meet is going to See Me or be intuitive enough to dig beneath the surface of who I seem to be. And guess what? That is okay. It really is. Because if I base my sense of worth and happiness on other people's ability and/or willingness to validate me, I'm going to be disappointed very often. \n\nAs long as *I* know that I'm not a fraud when it comes to my true feelings about a given topic, I'm good. The people who, for whatever reason, can't recognise that, won't recognise that. The people who can, will. I've learnt to let life surprise me with the latter group of people. You just never know who might show up in your life one day and this person just gets you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	"Emotion status: sad"
3	How can I (20F ENFP) go about asking an ISTJ (22M) whether he has plans to marry me in the future/sees a future with me?	UPDATE: Initially when I asked he said he doesn’t know and doesn’t want to think about this now. But after further asking he said he doesn’t want to give empty promises and wants to take things one step at a time. :) \n\nWe have been together for a little over a year now, and I’ve already met his parents (we’re quite close), and close friends. The reason why I want to ask him this question is because I’m afraid of committing into something that will eventually turn out to be a temporary fling. \n\nWe are young and not financially stable yet (I’m still a student,  he’s currently serving the army which is mandatory for males in our country), but since we have already been together for a year, I want to know whether he has any intentions to marry me in the future someday, be it 5-10 years from now but I’m not sure how to bring it up to him.\n\nHow can I ask him in a serious but non-pressuring way since my ISTJ is not really good at expressing his feelings? \n
11	I concur with asking him directly and plainly. You can always preface it with something like "I'm not trying to pressure you Into anything, I just want to know."
4	Can’t you just ask him point blank? My husband is an ISTJ and we had this conversation like 2 or 3 months into dating. I asked him what his goals were for a romantic relationship, what his values were in terms of things like fidelity, commitment, child-rearing, etc. He took it fine. It was just sort of an orientation conversation, to make sure we agreed about what the best outcome looked like. \n\nAnd as we got more and more serious, we continued to have the conversation, just in deeper ways. Once, my dad told a story about how a former coworker went into a coma or maybe persistent vegetative state, and that it wasn’t clear whether he’d ever recover, and his wife divorced him. I asked my husband what he would do if it had been me in that situation. We disagreed about the morality of the situation and almost broke up over it, because it seemed like we had different opinions about the seriousness of marital commitment. Anyway, we worked it out. \n\nYou should be able to deal with difficult conversations head-on, if your relationship is going to be successful. Just try to address it practically, not emotionally. The goal of the conversation is just to find out if your goals for the future are aligned. 
3	We're straightforward folk here lady.\n\nJust ask him, he'll tell you the truth. It might not be the answer you want, but it'll be honest.
3	You could ask him, but it does seem a little but early to bring up marriage. I (45f)am in a relationship with an ISTJ (38m) and we've been together for over three years. I just recently brought marriage up to him. I just said, "Hey, do you see yourself getting married one day?" And he said, "Sure, when the time is right, I would like to marry you." That was about it. I think asking him point blank would be best. In my experience, my ISTJ prefers direct conversation rather than beating around the bush. 
1	Just ask. Don't drop hints or fish for it. Just sit down and talk. You'll get an answer pretty quickly 
1	I know, for me, I need a direct conversation laying out the terms and conditions of said relationship, almost like a business negotiation. And the relationship definitely does not have to fall on traditional relationship grounds, its whatever makes you both happy. 
1	>UPDATE: Initially when I asked he said he doesn’t know and doesn’t want to think about this now. But after further asking he said he doesn’t want to give empty promises and wants to take things one step at a time. :) \n\nWhen an ISTJ makes a commitment, it is solid beyond solid. This makes so much sense to me. You two have only been together a little over a year. Way too early to be promising to commit  for life IMO.
7	Emotional Intelligence	How are others ISTJ's emotional intelligence? I scored a terrible 57/100 on the Emotional Intelligence 2.0 Talentsmart.com site after reading the book. I knew it would be low but I didn't expect it to be that bad...
4	I have no idea what emotional intelligence actually is, but it sounds like something I would be terrible at. I bought the book a long time ago, but I haven't read it yet. Im still pretty sceptical about the whole thing x)
4	I noticed my empathy went up after I worked exclusively with people. Didnt like it but learned to deal with it and increased my EQ a bit. I dont think we are peoples people per se but we can certainly learn to be.
3	I've always thought of myself as very emotionally intelligent. I think reading a lot, especially at such a young age, contributed to this. But, my dad is also an ISTJ and he is still strengthening his emotional intelligence. \n\nEdit: grammar
1	Hmmmm... I got the book few months ago haven’t read it yet. Gonna have to give it a go and then take a test. \n\nI’ll reply in a year or two 😂😂😂

65	Help me I’m FEELING	
10	I just want to get rid of the strong negative ones. Gotta stay rational.
12	Honestly if someone find the way to do that OR to understand them I wanna know
5	I at least want to get rid of the really strong negative ones. They mess with my rationality.
3	Edgy
5	They take up too much memory
2	Man, I wanna rip the store that forced me to download this crap (I'm on mobile)
2	Am I the only one here who isn't bothered by their emotions? Being rational doesn't mean being a robot. Feelings are great for alerting you to the presence of hidden data points that may affect your decision process and can bring catharsis in difficult situations if you don't let them take over completely. Louis CK had a funny bit about this on Conan
2	I tried that feeling thing once.. I almost died. 
1	Can't find uninstall program. error 402
11	How (bluntly) honest are you?	I’m curious as to where you so called ‘draw the line’ and whether you can give some examples/scenarios.\n\nFor example, if a person you know in prone to crying asks you ‘do you think I’m (insert good quality here)?’ And your answer is no, would you tell them ‘no’ or say ‘you’re a great person yada yada?’ Or do what I do and just remain silent…\n\nAnother example. Would you say something nice to a person, just to validate them if they were fishing for compliments?\n\nHopefully my question makes sense :)\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the responses, upvotes for all haha
25	I don’t like to lie, but I am conflict adverse so I would probably say no but you have this great quality or if you work on x, y and z, you’ll improve. 
6	I would simply say no, and probably wouldn't tell them what a great person they were (unless it was true). The principle of "if you don't have something nice to say then say nothing at all" keeps me silent in such compliment fishing expeditions. \n\nFor example, I know a hypochondriac who veers the focus of any group discussion into herself and her vague ailments. One day she had a group of ailments that closely mimicked the flu, but she had divided into symptoms of Renards, Fibromyalgia and allergies. I told her I thought she had the flu and nothing more, which sent her into a rage. How dare I simplify her self imposed complexity? \n\nIn most such situations,  I keep my mouth shut, not seeking to dampen others social games. But occasionally I will be fed up with lies of appeasement and blurt out some true statement. In a social group, I will be ostracized,  even though privately each individual will agree with me.\n\nWierd.
3	How blunt I am depends on a variety of factors, including but not limited to: who I'm talking to, what we're talking about, etc.  In general, I only lie when I have no respect for the person I'm talking to, or when I'm avoiding discussing my own private issues and I don't consider them close enough to open up to about.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I'm talking to sensitive people or discussing topics that might hit close to home for some people, I am hyper aware of how I word things.  I don't filter my thoughts or opinions as much as I sugar coat my words, phrasing things in a way that a person might feel less attacked by.  For example, this is from an actual discussion I had with someone:  \n\n\n* Default phrasing: I think you sleep around and pretend you're doing it for your own enjoyment because it allows you to pretend you're in control of the situation when actually you really crave validation and closeness but are afraid of being taken advantage of again.\n* Actual phrasing: Do you ever think that maybe you have casual hookups because you want to feel close to someone but you're afraid of getting hurt?  \n\nIn the case someone asked me if I thought they had a specific quality, I would tell them the really great qualities I see in them, providing specific examples, but I would gently tell them why I don't consider them to have that quality.  I would also add the disqualifier that I could be wrong, but that's just my limited observations.   In general, I try to get my idea across without triggering emotions that would cause someone to either resist or shut down without really hearing my thoughts.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I know someone is fishing for compliments, I may indulge them depending on how much I like them.  I have a friend who is transitioning and she's very insecure about her appearance and in general is an anxious person, so while sometimes I do find it annoying, I tend to be very generous when she fishes for compliments.  Someone who I might have less esteem for will probably just be ignored in attempts to fish for compliments.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut sometimes I'm blunt.  I did tell my manager I would be job searching if I didn't get a promotion--and I didn't mean it as a threat or anything, it was just matter of fact since in an earlier conversation he'd asked me to please tell him if I ever started looking for other work and we had already been discussing a promotion for some time anyway.  I also met my current SO online, and after about a 2 days of the usual small talk, I told him the topic bored me and I wanted to talk about something deeper and more personal.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn general, if I'm blunt with someone it's either a sign of tremendous respect (the expectation you understand me at my own level and I can drop social niceties) or it's a sign of impatience and disrespect (fuck your feelings, you annoying twat.  Leave me alone already.).   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
3	I prefer to be honest but either state it in a neutral way or add a compliment sandwich. I'm conflict abundant though so I won't say that kind of stuff unless asked a specific question.
2	I'm a hyper sensitive ISTJ with a chronic aversion to conflict so I'm more likely than not to say what someone wants to hear (unless it's completely untrue) and I'm very wary about protecting feelings.
2	I hear the word "blunt" and the word "rude" a lot by my family members. While I am not being rude or blunt. I just call it like I see it. 
2	I would be honest and explain myself on why. Possibly also give my opinion on how they can change. Even though they may cry, I still have to be honest.
2	I told a friend of mine the other day: If you don't want to hear my honest answer, don't ask me a question.
2	I dont have the right to be unkind to someone for no reason, however, I will not lie to someone, especially if they are fishing for compliments. I usually give a neutral non answer if I don't have anything nice to say. If I do have something kind to say I'll tell them without prompting. If someone continues to fish for compliments and I still can't say anything kind, I'll tell them to stop fishing. 
2	I would say "no" if it does not apply to them and give them possible solutions to improve upon it in the example you asked. I prefer to be honest/neutral.
2	I usually don't say something that I think will make someone upset or cry.. If it's a negative thing I try my best to put it in the most polite way possible. However, I don't really find myself in these situations very often. I tend to avoid lying though.
2	I’m honest, but I try to maintain at least some level of tact.
2	Encouraging word is one of my love languages, and I don’t like to hurt peoples feelings, but I also have a hard time lying.\n\nI try to think of how best to position something to them, that will have the best outcome possible.\n\nSo if they ask me a direct question, that has a negative answer, that WILL NOT go over well, I try to go into *constructive* criticism mode. Use a verbal illustration of some kind, liken it to something I or someone I know is going through.\n\nI deal with my dad who is very sensitive, and he will ask my opinion of his art forms a lot (mostly ‘do you like it’), and if I give a 100% honest answer, he usually gets angry (because his feelings are hurt).\n\nSo I ask if it’s okay to tell him what I think, and I will tell him the things I like, and the things I don’t like as gently as possible, and give the reasons why, and tell him stories about how my own creative process works, and stop to ask “does that make sense?” And also gage his emotional state frequently, sometimes I will preface something with “Okay I really am not trying to hurt your feelings at all when I say this...” if I’m afraid something might catch him off guard.\n\nOn the flip side, I’m known to offend people by mistake, when I’m just joking around and cutting up, with people I didn’t realize were that soft. So there’s that.\n\nI guess it’s all about the person, and the situation.
13	Getting an ISTJ to talk is like...	...telling yourself to bang your head repeatedly against metal walls and then desperately trying to break out of a metal cage using just your hands and battling it out with a stubborn and strong bat. Yes, bats because one ISTJ friend of mine is like one. He doesn't talk much and insists on replying with one word answers and it's decreasing my endurance with trying to continue conversation with him. \n\nI'm kind of giving up right now should I? I've been told that when you guys do that you ain't that interested lol
33	I'm a girl, but yes. If I'm interested I can talk a lot, but I am also perfectly happy not talking if I don't want to.
18	I have no middle ground. I either am so interested I cant shut up or I feel like my mind is blank. When my mind goes blank, I feel like if I try to come up with something its disingenuous or I feel like I'm pulling teeth. 
10	If the question is a yes or no question, I will reply with yes or no. If not, I will answer with a short sentence, for efficiency.  I never chat just to chat, I need a problem or a question or else I'll have problems staying invested in the conversation.
10	If he has no interest in having an actual conversation, then he probably never will.
3	Seriously. 
3	I think my dad and I are both ISTJs. When I visit, it's so hard to get a conversation going between us unless there's a third person.
2	Find out about his interests. Like the others on here, I hardly say anything when J answer, it’s always short and to the point. Find out what his interests are. If he sees you as an acquaintance and not a friend yet, you’ll have to poke and prod a bit at his interests to get him to say more, but he’ll definitely pipe up when he gets comfortable. I’m a really quiet person, but when I talk about an interest with a close friend I talk so much I get winded.
2	I like to talk. However, I suck at maintaining conversations at times. Also if I do not know the topic, I will not be able to contribute much.
2	Is this a romantic interest?\n\nAre conversations in person or over texting/social media?\n\nIt kind of just depends for me.\nIf I really don’t care for someone *at all* I will try to stay polite but keep interactions as short as possible. So they stop talking to me. Because I can’t stand them.\n\nOr I’m really busy and they picked the worst possible time to try and shoot the breeze with me. I’ll keep it short and Sweet and maybe even communicate to them that I’m swamped, or in the middle of a project. Then visit with them later.\nI don’t do major interruptions while I’m trying to get things done.\n\nSometimes I’m just really tired and don’t want to *not* talk with them or reply, because that’s rude, but can’t spend an once of extra energy.\n\nOtherwise I’d say I’m fairly talkative.\n\nBe advised though...some people are just crap at texting/social media, regardless of their type.\nSome people are crap at communicating regardless of their type.\nAnd in my experience guys are generally less talkative then girls regardless of their type.\n
1	Talk to him about one of his interests.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike I'm usually talkative if you bring up music I like or cooking or Geography or something.
1	Lol.. I think I am kind of like your friend when at the workplace.. but I make it obvious when I really don't want to talk.\n\nMy previous boss said I don't reciprocate enough haha. Problem is conversing is kind of like an on-off switch for me, nothing good or meaningful will come out if I'm tired or zoned out.\n\nEdit: ISTJ, that flair is outdated
1	[deleted]
1	Not necessarily, it depends on the topic and the person. 
1	Because it feels I am just saying words if I dont have interest. Its a total waste of time.
1	Gotta talk about something important. When I feel the need to talk I have a handful of ppl I feel comfortable doing that with and if your not on the list, then you'll never get it out of me. I'm not going to talk about surface level bullcrap, like the weather, and I haven't met a comfortable silence I didn't like. Mindless chatter is super annoying and I'm not going to bring up something to you that I don't you to bring up to me. That's not limited to super personal stuff, that also includes insignificant bullcrap. And most things are pretty insignificant. Be willing to have a comfortable silence with him. It's OK it you don't have anything to say. He don't want to hear it anyway. 
1	Sometimes I don't talk... and when my friends text when I'm in that kind of mood I reply because I don't want them to think I'm ignoring them but it's not my usual prep instead it's very responsive to what was said and that's it, to the point. \n\n&#x200B;
1	ISTJs only say what they mean to say and thinks is necessary to say. So they won’t put in fluff in their speech. \n\nIf you want him to communicate more, be direct about it. Like “I noticed that you’ve been giving me short answers. I’m interested in knowing more. Would you be able to share more about xyz?” \n\nISTJs are not great at reading people and will miss cues. So be direct about your needs and wants. They will usually be receptive. 
10	Any ISTJs married or in long term relationships with an ENFP?	If so, what's been the hardest parts of your relationship? The best? I'm a 34(f) enfp who has been married to a (35)m istj for 15 years (together for 17). Just looking for some perspective. For me the worst part is his lack of communication and the best is that we have the same sense of humor and he always can make me laugh. There are so many other things (good and bad) but I want to hear other experiences 
12	As a male ISTJ I've dated several female ENFPs. Drove me crazy, couldn't do it. \nGood luck!
5	ENFP (m) with an ISTJ (f). Together for 7 years and we passed our one year marriage anniversary this August. My wife seems more communicative than most ISTJs in regards to her feelings. We have a good understanding of each other and I don’t believe we have a hardest part, though I now need to work more on myself to be more consistent, organized and on-track. I currently feel like it’s my flaws that bring down our relationship as a whole.
4	Our love languages are also opposite so we've had to spend a lot of time learning to express love differently, as well as communication. I wrote a blog post about our marriage.  \n\nhttp://hotandsourblog.com/2018/03/06/opposites-attract/
3	My ex is an INFP/ENFP. He was very conflict avoidant which made communicating on his end bring our relationship down. lasted almost a decade though. I enjoyed how soft he was, that he was so caring and sympathetic to others - but he ended up relying too much on their acceptance and desire to be liked. It left a bad taste.
2	ISTJ female married to an ENFP male. We really haven't had any complications.   Sometimes he wants a little more freedom to do his own thing which is hard to do when he wants to stay home for that. I'm a stay at home mom so if he's only going between work and home I am not sure how to help him with that. He's gotten much more comfortable with Te as our relationship progressed which has given me the patience for things he does around the house. I've also become more comfortable with his playful nature.   \n\n\nCommunication has always been a big deal for us from the get-go. We don't feel judgement about asking each other the hard questions and we are good about continuing a discussion with more questions or clarifications rather than jumping to a conclusion. 
2	What's happening to make you wonder?\n\nMarried 39 years. I'm the istj. If you (the enfp) are able to talk about money without getting emotional or feeling blamed, your golden. If he is able to manage money long term planning, you'll be okay. He may be handicapped from always living in his little bubble of life in the moment.\n\nAt about 40 years old, she (enfp) started developing istj traits like getting exhausted in social situations. We have become more alike.\n\nOne of our rules early in marriage was if we asked what you are thinking, you couldn't say "I don't know," or "nothing". 
9	How to stop being so high-strung and anxious	Hi fellow ISTJs. As of late I've noticed that I'm incredibly high-strung and anxious about certain areas in my life, namely my romantic life, to the point where I feel like my mental health is going down the dumps.\n\nI recently started talking to someone online, and while we've not yet met in real life I feel like I have a real connection to him. Similar interests, sense of humor, etc. The unfortunate thing is that he's quite far away, and a long-distance thing just isn't a smart choice. However during the whole time I've been talking to him I've been feeling an overwhelming sense of anxiety about the whole situation, stemming from the fact that 1) he's far away and that we'd never be in a relationship until we somehow lived in the same city and 2) the fact that he was seeing other people in a casual setting. We had discussed this, and we both made it clear to each other that we liked each other but it was obviously a little hard that this was kind of a lost opportunity because of our distance.\n\nIn some ways I feel like the anxiety and stress I'm deriving from this experience has really kind of sidelined me from my "normal me". I'm typically not a very clingy person at all, but with him it almost feels like I'm trying to cling onto something that ultimately will be fruitless. For instance, suggesting we try something long distance even though 1) we haven't met and 2) this objectively makes no sense. Or constantly trying to keep a line of communication with him so I know he still actually likes me despite  him seeing other people casually.\n\nI feel like all these actions are incredibly unhealthy, but I'm also at a bit of a standstill in terms of figuring out how to stop this kind of unhealthy behavior (both this time around and potentially any future people I start talking to). Does anyone have any advice surrounding this? Might not even have to do with relationships specifically. Thanks in advance :)\n\n**Edit**: Editing this to make it clear that we're not actually in a relationship. We've only been talking for a relatively short amount of time.
9	Please stop and trust your anxiety when you already feel it might be unhealthy. It will be and already is. People like us need to learn to listen to our feeli- ehr - our thoughts. They are almost always the right and logical choices. \n\nI will continue with my reply but I'm on my way home and wanted to reply before I forget it later because I can relate soo much and understand.
3	Sometimes the chemistry’s correct but external factors like distance or incompatibility in life phases will interrupt what could have been a good romance.\n\nIt sucks, but we’re often quite capable of assessing when something just won’t work for practical reasons. I recently had to break up with someone I truly loved and got along with because she needed to do other things with her life right now.\n\nIt’s unfortunate, and you’ll need to grieve the loss of a potential match, but you have to have faith that there really are others out there for you, and they are local, and they are available. Don’t fixate on something unattainable.
2	First off, if any situation if giving you this much anxiety, listen to youself; its a bad situation. You feel uncomfortable with it. Something is wrong. Get out.\n\nWhen you find yourself in these situations, analyze the situation: why is it making you feel this way? Reestablush what you want and your limits and goals and boundries. Then... remember that you have options!  You can do whatever you like. As ISTJs we sometimes trap ourselves into thinking there is only one right answer. \n\nFor example, it sounds like a LDR is not your ideal relatioship, so dont treat it like it is your ideal, esp if hes not comitted. Its not worth the anxiety. *See the relationship for what it is and try to extract as much fun and joy as you can in the moment with the reality of the situation.* If he said the relationship is casusal and he will date other people, than do the same. Again, it may not be something you want, but its better than trying to change someone else into dating you exclusively before you even meet them, or putting the pressure of that expectation on it. If he wants to treat this casually, then you treat this casually too. Tbh, anyone ive ever dated long distance weve just ended up friends, so keep that open as an option too - you guys might just be friends.
1	Clearly it's not going to happen so you should force-distance yourself from this guy until you've had enough time for rationality to convince you it was a dumb idea (it'll happen once you realize you don't actually need him).
1	I'm in the same boat (anxiety), so I'm following this thread .\nAnd as a person who has been in a long distance relationship before: My advice is to stop for a minute and think (maybe look at your reflection on the screen): You are alone, unless one of you is bridging the Gap, you will be alone. And while it is long distance the breakup pain is real. Don't get in too deep.
1	Look, when your looking at a potential suitor, don't go in hoping for Mr. Right. That's way too much pressure to put on someone, yourself included. Meet someone, talk to them, befriend them, learn about who they are, what they like, what they don't like , what their goals are, etc. Just because your looking for a romantic relationship with someone doesn't mean you should be hoping for a romantic relationship with everyone. There's several types of relationships this guy could filter out to. He could turn into a most dear friend whom you love and care about deeply but isn't boyfriend material, and that's OK. Trying to fit this square peg into a round hole is what's causing your anxiety. Put his ass where he fits in your life and keep searching. 
7	ISTJ struggling in retail banking, finance-related sales	I don't know where to even start with this, it's mostly just a general rant with some questions and looking for advice at the end.\n\nSo I've been pursuing a career in finance/banking for awhile now, it's landed me in a retail banking position I've had for a few years now.  I enjoy the job a lot, but I'm struggling moving anywhere in this career mostly because I have trouble meeting sales goals expected of me by management.  That's not to say I'm bad at my job, I have a great reputation among all of my co-workers and customers because I can fix or find out how to fix just about any issue at my branch.  Co-worker's computer, printer, scanner not working?  Customer has fraud on their account?  Deposit posting error?  Irate customer?  General banking question?  Account history/analysis?  Drawer not balancing?  I can take care of it all because I love problem solving, and I can do it all efficiently and I always follow up with whoever I'm helping to make sure they're taken care of, my customers love me for this.\n\nBut I struggle with finding those conversations to get people to move their large deposit accounts from other banks, following up with people who need loans, or general 'sales' related stuff because I'm a worker, not a salesman.  I just want to help people with their problems and go home.  I can force myself to do the most basic sales stuff, like ask people cashing their weekly payroll check if they'd just like to open an account and maybe setup direct deposit with their employer or something, but it's really uncomfortable for me because I feel that people who want accounts with us would just open them anyways, they shouldn't have to be 'convinced'.  90% of my sales are walk-ins who were already going to open accounts regardless of what I said to them.\n\nFor awhile I searched for other banks and jobs within the company, and just had an interview for a promotion the other week, and one line I hear almost every single time is something along the lines of "I can tell by your attitude and work history you'll go really far in this career!" followed by some reasoning as to why I'm not being hired/promoted either immediately or days later, usually boils down to sales and experience.  I can't tell if these compliments of foreseeing my success are serious or just empty words to make me feel better at this point, apparently a lot of managers see my potential but don't want to take a chance on me.  So as for where I'm going with this....\n\n\n1.  How do I get out of retail banking?  What are my options as far as staying working in finances go?\n\n2.  My ideal job is to eventually be either an underwriter, credit analyst, or community banker/loan officer, do these jobs typically have high sales expectations too?  \n\n3.  Is there anything I can do to suck up my dislike of sales even more and just try to make them?  What do I say, what opportunities should I be looking out for?\n\nThanks
4	Fellow ISTJ that started in banking here.\n\nIt was a small community bank and its initial focus was customer service.  I enjoyed it and became an assistant manager/jack of all trades fill in person for jobs across multiple branches.\n\nAfter they swallowed a few other bank locations, things got serious and there was an intentional cultural shift - to sales.  They wanted us to sell, sell, sell - they also wanted us to get licenses so we could sell annuities, etc.\n\nLike you, hard selling did not come naturally to me, and I also kept pointing out that people banked at a small bank for the friendly, one-on-one service - if we flipped that script to bombarding people with sales pitches every time they walked through the door to deposit a check - we would lose customers.\n\nI eventually bailed and went into programming.\n\nRe: Loan officer.  That might work.  We had a wide range of loan officers at our bank, and while some really weren't heavy "press the flesh" sales people, they were expected to join civic organizations/chamber of commerce/etc to give the bank visibility and help draw in new business.\n\nFrom your description and the very nature of analytical ISTJs - you love problem solving, research, etc.  I think actuary might be another possibility.\n\nBesides the sales culture push there were two other reasons I left banking:\n\n1) To advance any higher, I would have had to get some sort of finance/banking certificate or degree - and that didn't really interest me\n\nand 2) 2+2 will always equal 4.  There wasn't enough creativity for me.  Programming combined creativity & analytical problem solving - which I love.  Have you considered going into IT?
3	Fellow ISTJ Retail Banker,\nFirst off, do we work for the same company? Cuz you just described my bank and what I do in it. My title is Retail Banker II.\n\nIm in the same boat, Im not a sales guy and most of my sales are walk ins. \n\nPersonally I want to rise the management ranks and avoid being a floor salesman at all costs. So ive made it very clear to my manager and regional manager that this is what I want. I can basically run my branch and solve 95% of problems. Ive taken every opportunity to show my skills as a leader, problem solver, and go getter. It has come to the point where many customers think im my branches new manager (my manager and assistant manager spend a large chunk of the day out of office). I travel and help other branches quite often so all the other managers in my area know my abilities and skills. Ill be able to transfer branches soon and I already have other managers making informal offers to be their assistant to try and steal me. \n\nI might not know what exact qualities the positions you want are looking for, but, telling your supervisors what you want and proving how important and indescribable you are to them and the company can go a long way. Remember business isn’t about what you know, its, about who you know, and a recommendation from several managers or a regional manager can go a long way within the company.\n\nPs I believe in you!\n
3	I dont work in retain, per se, but I work in registration in the emergency room for 3 years and part of my job was to collect co-pays and deductibles. Well the ER is a tough place to collect money because 1. I worked nights, and a lot of ppl don't go to the ER in the middle of the night with their money, and 2. I was no good at asking for the money 3. No real consequences for not collecting money because federal regulations require treatment regardless of payment 4. My bosses only offered negative feedback for poor collecting, but never positive feedback for good collecting. Some ppl could collect a ton of money but I just couldn't. Now I work in urgent care, where payment is due at time of service. I've become much more comfortable with telling ppl to pay up, because 1.there are consequences to not collecting the money, and 2. My boss offers positive feedback when I do make the clinic a lot of money.\n\nMy bosses, in the past, always made it very clear that I was NOT leadershipaterial and to NEVER expect any kind of promotion, they didn't even blow wind up my ass. My boss now, loves my collections (of course) but she focuses more on the fact that I organized her office, complete half-assed tasks by the other coworkers, fix stuff they messed up, come to work every day, on time, train new employees, do extra training so I can teach my coworkers to do their jobs. I literally do EXACTLY the same thing as I did in the ER (I LOVED working in the ER and miss it terribly) but the difference in my success in the workplace is my manager. She's different from any manager I've ever worked for and I love her to death. I guess what I'm saying is it doesn't matter what you do, because you know you are damn good at your job, it's who you do it for. Some personality types (extrovert, policy adhering, common sense lacking, do more, think less types) we will never get along with, and they see ppl like is as a threat, so they will never put us in a position to take thier jobs because, quite frankly, we could do their job twice and look for more because we have a good work ethic, great stamina, not easily shaken, not hyper emotional, and are tough as hell to read. So you'll never get a promotion from these ppl because a pion will never be promoted to Manger. So you'll stay a pion for the rest of your life. 
2	I mean this kindly. But I think you should do something else. People who have a kind heart and don’t enjoy pressuring people to do something that makes a company more money than actually helps the customer, isn’t worth it. Bite the bullet and move on. 
2	One thing that I found really helped me in a former position where I had to do sales was actually using the power of being detail oriented and knowing the products we offered - I could see where folks were overpaying for what they used or see better fits for their needs. \n\nThe trick for me was not to think of sales as a thing I *had* to do, but rather a service I could provide for customers, which ultimately helped them out. \n\nObviously, your mileage may vary, but that focus on right-fitting customers and looking at sales as a service helped me to meet my quotas and get promoted out of the front line to somewhere I didn't have to do sales any more. 
1	It seems like finding a banking/underwriter/whatever-related subreddit would be the better place to ask for career advice.
1	I used to work in a financial sales position. I did great when the job focused mainly on retention and had a small asset gathering component. Once that flipped I found myself in danger of losing my job. I have since moved into a position with no sales, no client contact, and it allows me to use analytical skills. I pop my earbuds in and listen to music or podcasts while working to tune everything out and it is fabulous. If you can land a job in compliance or operations you may be happier.
5	Advice for an ENTP (F) who has fallen for an ISTJ (M)	**Background:** my friend and I started spending a lot of time studying in the library together, etc. and over time, I realized I caught feelings for him. We've become good friends, flirt often, and I'm 99.9% sure he finds me attractive and is amused by my antics lol. Basically, we mesh very well together. So, part of me really wants to express how I feel. However, I know school is his main priority right now so I don't think he really cares to date (also, he hasn't dated much in the past either/doesn't seem like he's the type to make the first move). Which now leads me to...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1) Would ISTJs get awkward or distant if someone expressed their feelings to them during a time they weren't ready to date?\n\n2) What are some general signs an ISTJ likes you back?
11	I would totally date someone even if my first priority was school. However, they would need to understand that fact and remember that I can't hang out a whole lot or go on a bunch of dates. I would still pit work into it, but sometimes I won't have the energy.\n\nAs far as signs he likes you? If he is spending a lot of time with you and initiating much of that time, that's a pretty good indicator. Other than that, it can vary a lot.
9	>2) What are some general signs an ISTJ likes you back?\n\nMost reliable indicator? You ask them directly and they give you a direct honest answer of yes.\n\nTrying to read subtle signs from an ISTJ isn't going to get you good information IMO (INFJ in a relationship with ISTJ)
7	Hi! ENTP female dating a male ISTJ for 9 months! We met online, though, so it’s a little different. I’d say ISTJs get awkward and distant when something is too new. Also, be as casual and straightforward as possible. If I want to talk about something relationship/emotion related, I pretty much have to just directly ask. Communication is everything, though. Signs an ISTJ cares for you? Hmm, I guess what immediately comes to mind is making sure things are taken care of. He’s very methodical about tasks and healthy routines, I am very much not. He doesn’t seek new experiences on his own and would rather do the thing he knows and is comfortable with. I push him out of his comfort zone to try new things, because he trusts me, and he helps keep me grounded and really drives me to be the best version of myself. It seems like our types should be complete opposites and not compatible, but honestly we have an amazing dynamic. \n\nEdit: If he makes an effort to make you a part of his regular routine/schedule... in my opinion is an ISTJ way of showing they care. 
4	ISTJs don't understand hints, and are extremely low key. \nIf he likes you he might jump on board but I highly doubt it would be different than what you have now.\nAlso, as an ISTJ I had ENxPs in my life, and talking to them is really frustrating to me at least. So keep that in mind.
3	We stare at ppl we like a lot, we are super unlikely to telly you we like you first, but we will answer honestly if you ask directly. Do t ask something like "what are you thinking about" or "how are you feeling" because we don't know what the right answer is. If you do start a relationship, remember to give him about 20 minutes before getting into a real conversation with him when he comes back from class or work. He needs some time to sort his brain out and decompress. 
2	ISTJs are pretty straightforward people. There’s usually very little guessing. \n\nFrom what it looks like, he does see to like you. Though a dramatic declaration of feelings is not recommended. That may be too much for them, as they are not the most expressively feely.\n\nAnd don’t take it too personally if they reject you. Sometimes it takes them time to adjust to the idea of someone liking them that way. 
2	Theres no one sign that an ISTJ likes you. We're super diverse and it depends on the individual: it ranges from mature and will express interest, to embarassed of their attraction and *appear* even less interested. Even for an ISTJ who prioritzes love and romance, they can be super bad at being the ones to express their feelings or seal the deal. But this guy might just be cool with you as a friend and feel comfortable being himself. If i were you, id test the waters by asking him directly in baby steps... suggest hanging out outside the library just to get coffee and talk, and escalate hang outs from there.\n\nA word of caution: yes your type does not define you, but one stereotype i do continue to find proving true irl is that in general, ISTJs and ENTPs are one of the least favorable matches. So when you do start to spend more time with him, think about if hes a compatible type for you long term, or if its just better as friends for you to each experience each other in small doses ;)
5	ISTJ	Personal question, this is for data so i can reinforce my understanding of  ISTJ.\n\nCompletely disregard functions for a moment and just focus on introspection when I ask this. Which of these two do you resonate with the most.\n\n1. You are highly in tune with your personal experience and seek to create comfort, quality and style\n\n2. You are an arderous producer of logic and structure and you desire to enforce this logic upon your life
10	1.  But you figure out which one
10	Neither really resonates with me fully as written. If I had to choose, #1. #2 would be my choice if it wasn't connoting such rigidity... Logic is great, but I'm somewhat laidback. #1 is not 100% either. I do feel in tune with my personal experience, but I wouldn't necessarily say "I seek to create comfort, quality, and style," whatever that means. Sure, I care about those 3 things, but the importance of each depends on the context.
7	This whole thread is an abomination of accidental formatting errors, lol. #1 is more accurate in that I use my personal experience to guide the pursuit of comfort/quality/etc.
6	Definitely leaning on #1 \n#2 feels like a stereotype.\nWhile I operate in that style it’s not something I’m trying to do, \n
3	2
2	Number 1
2	Definitely 1.
1	Number 1\n\nI wouldnt pick number 2 because im not a *producer* of logic, im a collector of logic. And id never say i have to "enforce logic upon my life" ...that sounds like you struggle with it. My logic just naturally flows into my day to day.
1	Number one.
1	"Arderous?"\n\nIf I loosely interpret the concepts of #2, then I could identify with that.    I favor 'utility' far greater than 'style.'
1	One all the way.
1	Logically, but in comfort please
2	ISTJs have ENFP subconscious?	Supposedly ISTJs have an ENFP subconscious. Does anyone have experience or examples of this? 
4	I’m not an ISTJ, but I am an INFJ with subconscious Se. So lately I’ve been practicing mindfulness, and being more in touch with my environment. I made up a skill where whenever I’m feeling stressed, I will verbally ‘describe’ my environment, to distract myself from my distressing thoughts. So I’ll go around and say to myself, the ground is covered in tarmac, and the fences in the train station are black and spiky. But the train station in the city has red gradated tiles, and the tiles on the street are gray rock. It was amazing how many things I had missed, from being in my head all the time! I hadn’t realised that there were pink flowers just outside my apartment, and that there were signboards around warning that there’ll be no trains in the next week or so. The world is so different when looked at from an Se perspective!\n\nSo, what if you go around ‘interpreting’ everything you see, to practice your subconscious Ne? Like maybe, ‘That couple is fighting, what if he forgot her anniversary? What if they are breaking up? What if it’s over what food to order? What if?’\n\nI think the heart of Ne is possibilities and creativity and what ifs. So instead of seeing things for what they are, ‘Two people are making lots of noise’, see them for what they could be. Maybe you’ll enjoy seeing things from an Ne perspective for a while, and you’ll be amazed how many possibilities you missed.\n\nOther examples -this oddly shaped bottle can be a spacecraft, if I turned it upside down. Or an aeroplane if I put it on its side. etc. etc.\n\nEdit: Something else I just thought of -cloudwatching!\n\nEdit 2: Take note; the verbal part is kind of important, because you’re essentially using Te to pull stuff from out of your subconscious. Without it, it will just remain in your subconscious.
2	I have no idea what that's supposed to mean but it sounds potentially accurate
1	It has been about 3 years for me to figure out my personality type from the inaccuracies of taking the mbti test multiple times. I am unsure whether my personality is correct but I kept testing to make sure of my results. I got ISTJ many times now. I had kept notes of my results since those years and saw I had ENFP before. I'm 19 which feels young to me to be considered knowledgeable since I know theres a lot to learn even during those past years.\n\nWell, I was considering whether I am an ENFP or ISTJ after I thought maybe I should read the "Extrovert" side descriptions. After I did, I felt something familiar. It must be because of the functions. ISTJ having Si-Te-Fi-Ne and ENFP having Ne-Fi-Te-Si, I hope I'm not mistaken of these functions but I'm sure it should be right. I had read that both of these personality are more ambivert than some others too so there should be a reason for that.\n\nFrom my experience during my pre-teen years I was very spontaneous but thats with my closest friends (2 of them) and they thought I was weird in a good way. ( I'd be so comfortable that I'd be running and jumping) I can be silly and weird. I only was like this with my church friends mostly, because for school, I wanted to focus on the teacher and listen (at least tried to). I didn't bother much with interacting with other students since I was occupied with my work, but I did like listening to others' conversations. It makes me want to join in too but I just didn't have time for that. So I'm pretty much very focused on my work but I have a fun side to express too. I can get really creative with words, puns and seems like to others its bad/good? I was asked before "how did you come up with these?"... But it really just comes to my mind. Like I feel like I'm constantly thinking and when my mind gets bored or when I find a really good joke, I'll say it.\n\n\n
15	ISTJs - what other personality types have you partnered up with and how did it work out?	I see a lot of posts on here asking about specific pairings. It got me wondering about how we all respond in relationships with other types as a whole. So why not do a thread that's a bit of a catch all?\n\nI'd be very interested to hear a little about the communities experience in relationships. Perhaps I'm not the only one. Just please let us in on what MBTI type they were (or you suspect they were) for comparison. Including the length of the relationship might be helpful too. \n\nThank you, all. 
10	INFJ (m)- current, engaged. Seriously couldn't be more perfect. \n\nINTJ (m)- on and off 4 years, this guy was the bad boy I couldn't get enough of. Never had actual feelings for him but was always liked his company. \n\nINTJ (m)- 2.5 years, great relationship but he moved away and we didn't make it through long distance. Became friends instead of romantic partners.\n\nENFP (m)- 2.5 years, first serious relationship. Absolutely hated him but still was so infatuated at the same time. Relationship turned toxic, many love affairs from both sides. I grew bitter and resentful. Ended in an explosive fight resulting in a restraining order against him. I've never yelled at someone in my life, until him.  
9	45yo ISTJ male partnered with 45yo INFP female\n\nI feel it works out well so long as we don't try "figuring each other out."\n\nI'll use Christmas decorating for an example; left on my own I am minimalist and functional to a fault, I would probably not bother with a tree and every time we put up decorations all I see is the holes I'll need to patch, in short I'm not so good at doing it. But she loves it. So I leave the decorating to her and concern myself with practical logistics of hiding the power cords.  \n\nBut today was where my personality shined... clean-up,  organizing, storing everything for another year in perfectly labeled boxes. The lights are rolled knot free in separate plastic bags, boxes of replacement bulbs stored in same box.\n\n\n\n
8	INFP(F) - my high school sweetheart I am currently married to for the last 12 1/2 years. Been together 18 years total. She is quite a free spirit at times and while it drives me up the wall, I’ve learned that I need to lighten up and she helps me with that a lot. If it wasn’t for her, I would probably be a lot more of a “schedule Nazi” and an all around asshole. I very much have a “if you’re not right, you’re wrong” mentality that can rub people the wrong way if I didn’t have someone constantly teaching me to stay flexible.
7	INFJ (F) - We generally got along pretty well, it was just my first relationship and I for some reason just loved arguing for argument's sake and that drove us apart.\n\nENFJ (F) - Current relationship. Has lasted longer than my previous, but I feel like we don't have as much in common. We've only had one argument (surrounding the Kavanaugh hearing), but not sure I see myself with her long term. Just too opposite me I think. At first, it was good having basically my opposite MBTI type, but now that the honeymoon phase is over, I can see where some of our differences are too much to overcome honestly. 
2	Figure I may as well join in now I'm awake. I'm an ISTJ female for reference. It's in chronological order, most recent last.\n\nESTP - 8 years. First relationship, most of it long distance. As far as I know he never did the test but this is the only type I could see fitting him. And it fits to a T. We got along wonderfully when long distance, but when we moved in things changed. At the start I was quite tightly strung and he didn't know how to deal with that, I got better at sharing my space and being relaxed about things. The relationship became toxic from his side. Break up was really ugly. Long story short, he trickle truthed me into a breakup and got with my housemate a few weeks later. I didn't abide by it and cut him off. \n\nINTJ - 2.5 years. Probably my healthiest relationship thus far which says something as we didn't get together under the best circumstances. He was recovering mentally from a suicide attempt, and I was recovering from the mess above. Both very recent. Up until the last 6 months or so the relationship was going reasonably well. But then there was a miscommunication. And things started cropping up in his personal life again. He got depressed and broke it off. He didn't want to work on it as he could only see me as a catalyst for his misery. \n\nENFP - 8 months.. on and off. I thought it worked in an opposites attract sort of way. He got me out of the house trying new things, and I grounded him when he started floating away with what ifs. Eventually he broke it off again and I had a serious discussion with him about being consistent. He said we'll keep it "off" as he needs to work on himself. He's tried to kiss me again since then and I told him to go home and refocus himself. He's a strange boy and it sort of gives me a headache, so as shitty as breaking up was it may have been for the better.
2	Even though I don’t believe completely in mbti best pairs entirely, I do think the ISTJ/ESFP pairing to have a lot of potential. \n\nJust knowing an ISTJ friend well kinda gives me the impression that an ESFP partner would make him the best version of himself. He’s rather uptight and rigid. ESFPs are fun, straightforward and refreshingly honest with their feelings. ISTJs will bring some structure and details to an ESFP while an ESFP will bring some spontaneity and color to an ISTJ. \n\nHaha I just always loved this pairing. I guess I relate to ISTJ in the uptight aspect. So I envision a foil type of relationship to be desirable for both of us. 
2	Wow.  I just realized I have almost exclusively \[seriously\] dated NT types.  Huh.  \n\n  \nENTJ (M/23/3 months)  - Was fun as a friend.  Not fun as a relationship.  He was incapable of handling emotions maturely.  In context of us, it turned into him belittling me over mine.  I also didn't like how opportunistic he was.  It ended nasty when he made a jab at me, I responded icily, and he got all butthurt about it and I, for once, gave no shits.  He blocked me after that, and I did the same in turn.  Good riddance.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nENTP (M/28/9 months) - Was a fun guy... when he wasn't suicidally depressed.  Definitely had a whole slew of issues, including drugs and anger issues, and was just an incredibly unhealthy person.  I exhausted myself trying to help him out of what I perceived as a slump.   I eventually realized he was miserable beyond my ability to do anything about it and gave up on him, cutting off all contact.   Unfortunately, not before developing issues of my own from the experience.  But had he been a healthy person, I think it would have been a fun relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINTJ (M/23/2 years on/off) - Another unhealthy individual, though he was good at masking it and making excuses for it.  Former drug addict, but doing incredibly well for himself.  I had never met a more successful person, career wise, and the relationship was a great career move since his own habits rubbed off on me there, resulting in a synergy where we learned new things together.  I liked that a lot.  However, he was also *the most selfish* person I have ever met who had a Jesus complex and figured if he made a big show of helping people, he could prove he was in fact not selfish and was actually the modern day Jesus.  Giant attention whore who needed to be validated through social media, incredibly arrogant, pathological liar, oblivious to everyone around him if it wasn't about him or his field of work.   Upvote for pulling me out of my career complacency and inspiring me to live to my higher potential.  Downvote for everything else.   I don't think I would date another INTJ.  While I do think if he had been a well adjusted person from a wholesome family, we would have been an unstoppable power couple, the INTJs I've met/observed in the public eye seem to skew towards workaholism and away from family values.  I don't think they would bring me happiness in that sense.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nINTP (M/24/1 month) - Current relationship.  Well adjusted individual (thank heavens) with a wonderful sense of humor and shared interests and values.  Seriously.  It's like I met my twin when it comes to values, interests, beliefs, dislikes, goals, etc.   I absolutely adore how direct and transparent we are about things.  It's the least mentally and emotionally exhaustive relationship I've had.  I truly feel like I'm on equal footing here, whereas in prior relationships there was always some imbalance (emotional, financial, career, etc).  My only concern is that I feel like we're a little bit lacking in emotional connection.  This relationship is moving a lot slower than my prior ones have, and he's got to be the hardest person to read their emotions out of everyone I've dated.  But I think my concerns arise from me trying to draw on past experiences and result in a me comparing apples to oranges sort of thing.  
9	ISTJ + INFJ pairing?	How can an ISTJ/INFJ relationship succeed? I'm an INFJ female and I just started dating an ISTJ male who used to be my coworker, so we started as friends. I really like him and want it to work. He's already talking about marriage and kids, which for me, is new because most guys shy away from that. I am excited though because I want that too.
16	people are not their cognitive functions and relationships go deeper than that. compromise and mutual respect/ love are what will make or break it. Don't be afraid to ask for things you feel are important and respect his need for structure and organization. this goes both ways of course. 
10	From ISTJ side - knowing the way your brain works (cognitive functions) would be very helpful for him, as while we tend to be good observers, we don’t connect emotionally as well, don’t read it too good. (Stereotypically of course)\n\nSo learning about each other and compromising and working together 😁
3	Knowing about respective cognitive functions is very useful, as /u/JasonTheRobot says [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/aaz97n/istj_infj_pairing/ecw9n4v/). I'll say, from my experience, it is also extremely useful on the INFJ side as well. \n\n---------------------\n\nI'll paste in something I wrote in another discussion on a theme I see a lot and have experienced:\n\n>I'm INFJ and my ISTJ SO (of a little over 3 years) is pretty opaque to me in the "being able to read people" layers. I've had discussions online with other INFJs in relationships with ISTJs and this opacity seems to be a typical aspect of the INFJ-ISTJ dynamic.\n\n>In my case, I really love and appreciate the opacity, appreciate not being able to see into her. The reason for that is that is that I can relax around her. No need to try to navigate unspoken cues. No need to run that stressful gamut of knowing (without even wanting to) more about the other person's hidden stuff than they dare or care to know about themselves sometimes.\n\n>She says what she means and means what she says. She speaks with her actions as much as with words. It's really really nice, actually.\n\n>We do relationship check-ins once a month. If something is a problem between us, I trust she'll bring it up then (if she hasn't already). As for what she needs from me for support, it is this whole healthy thing where if she needs something, it's her right and responsibility to communicate that to me. Really, it's so nice.\n\n>If I want to know something about what's up with her, I just ask. Directly and clearly. And she generally answers my questions clearly, directly and truthfully. Direct communication in both directions is crucial and utterly possible and that's *healthy* for communication.\n\n------------\n\nDon't shy away from difficult topics related to relationships when they need addressing and clarifying.  In my own experience with the dynamic between the INFJ and ISTJ info processing preferences in our relationship, there is a ton of opportunity for deep and **productive** emotion-level conversations when needed. We are able to both be partial observers of the dynamics at this level and focus together on sharing and understanding information about each other out of basic respect, care and love for each other. We approach such discussions as a team.  \n\nMy ISTJ SO is by far the most caring, supportive, grounded and emotionally healthy partner I have had in my life (and I'm in my 40s and have been around the block a few times). 
2	Hello. I have so much I can say to this. INFJ 32F married to an ISTJ 32M. Ok, separated now.\n\nBut for the longest time we had a great relationship. What I would say is, the arguing/conflict caused problems. I'm very conflict averse and he is very headstrong/head-on. So that may be something to watch out for. Communicating emotions directly/not in detail.\n\nGood things - very grounding, very loving, very very loyal. Good at getting shit done, together. Help each other about work. Easy to trust him. Balance each other out. 
2	Hi! I know I'm super late to this thread, but I've been looking for people in similar relationships and just wanted to contribute. :)\n\nI'm an INFJ in a relationship with an ISTJ. Honestly, I was pretty apprehensive in the beginning, because we are quite genuinely complete opposites in most areas of life— emotions, interests, hobbies, temperaments, etc.. But it's proven to be an incredibly meaningful relationship and I feel that I (and we) have grown a lot.\n\nWhereas I am rather emotional and occasionally overly-self-reflective, she is calm and steady and strategic and practical. Very practical. So she keeps me grounded. And I like to think that I do a pretty good job of forcing her to deal with her emotions. We're both pretty analytical and reserved (but still friendly), so I think we do a good job of both understanding and complementing each other when we're together. I also think we're different enough that there is room for us to grow as individuals, but we're also supportive of/intrigued by each other's differences, so we are able to enjoy watching each other change and improve.\n\nThe key to being in a good place together is definitely communication and honesty. If either of us is ever feeling insecure or concerned about something (it's usually me lol), we definitely make it a point to be honest and talk about it as openly and early as possible, and since doing this, I think our relationship has improved a lot.\n\ntl;dr: INFJ in a relationship with ISTJ. Was nervous at first because we're super different, but it's turned out to be conducive to a lot of healthy personal growth. \n\n&#x200B;
2	I’m INFJ and my husband is ISTJ. We’ve been happily married for almost 14 years. The key with ISTJs is honesty and being open about what you need. I know as an INFJ you will not want to ask for what you want as we tend to be givers. He won’t think like you, but he will want to meet your needs and care for you. The only way this can happen is for you to tell him what makes you feel loved and not loved. ISTJs are very good at learning new things and love facts. He will love learning about you! As an INFJ caring for him will be easy, we are excellent at understanding what the other need to feel loved. It absolutely can work and work well! You just need to both be honest and try to understand how the other person thinks and what they need.
14	How do ISTJ - INTP relationships fare?	Edit: from what I get from the comments so far is that it can go either way; it seems like a mixed result, but can definitely work. 
8	Too much thinking and emotional repression. Not a naturally good pair. 
7	Married to my INTP husband for 24 years, together for 28. I can’t see myself with anyone but him. He mellows me out and I help him be structured. We are a perfect pair. 
5	I am an ISTJ who was married to a INTP for 6 years. The relationship wasn't horrible, but it also wasn't love. We were great roommates. Arguments generally consisted of him trying to stress me out with Ti and in turn I bottled everything up. 
3	Married to an INTP. Works well in the sense we both like to be home and in relaxing environments. But, sometimes my INTP husband and I argue about some concepts because he wants to theorize everything and I only care about what's true. We see the world differently and it helps us each learn and see things from another perspective. Its interesting to hear what his mind will come up with because it's always so different than mine. 
3	I'm an ISTJ (f) exclusively dating an INTP (m) for about a month now.  My experience:  \n\* Pro: We are exceptionally direct and honest with each other.  It's jarring and delightful that we can just drop social niceties and say what we're really thinking and it's not a big deal.  It also calms my own anxieties and insecurities so that's just super.  \n\* Pro: I adore his Ne.  Even if I don't always understand the stuff he's rambling about, I like listening.  But in general I am drawn to people with high Ne.    \n\* Pro: He feels like a really good friend even though I've only known him a few months.   \n\* Con: Our relationship seems to be lacking an emotional intimacy.  Granted, we're still in the early stages, but I find it mildly concerning and I'm not sure how to bridge that gap.  Cuz... honestly, sometimes he just feels like "one of my bros" plus kissing 'n stuff.    \n\* Con: It seems our combined introversion results in us never going out.  Maybe not a con for everyone, but I kind of like the I/E dynamic that helps pull me out of my shell.  
2	I’m in one. It’s the best one I’ve had. Not one argument after two years, I guess because we are both very direct, and don’t take each other’s words (when we have different views) as personal attacks? And for what it’s worth, best and most active sex life/connection out of all my relationships too. 
2	Even the thought of being in a relationship with an ISTJ makes me wince.
2	Im good friends with a couple INTPs. Friendship works great. \n\nI think a romantic relationship would be trying. INTPs are incredibly closed off emotionally, (and if they become emotional, ive found it best not even to acknowledge it - that just makes them more uncomfortable sigh). Also, our two types have quite a different way of looking at the world, and while its cool for discussion, its not really great for someone youre going to share your life with
2	I'm an INTP marries to an ISTJ, for ten years. It's hands-down the best relationship of my life. We are great together. We appreciate our similarities and our differences, almost never argue or hurt each other, and make exceptional problem solvers. He steadies some of my more impulsive moments, and I introduce him to new ideas and experiences he would otherwise miss. We have great conversations, trust, and respect for each other. \n\nI never want to be with anyone else, ever. 
2	Personally it didn't work well for us. We stopped having things in common and even tho I'm introverted I like going for a walk and leaving the house everyday, he was the opposite. I was more organized and had a routine for my studies while he just kinda did his own thing when he felt like it, I dislike meeting new people and having lots of friends on purpose and he would go out of his way to meet new people and attend social events. We had complementary personalities basically, it didn't work well at the end 
1	Been married to my ISTJ for 16 years
1	Pretty good, overall. The shared introversion and logical mindset is a huge advantage. High Ti and high Te occasionally clash with how differently they view and process information, and neither type is great with the emotions of others, but an awareness of this will go a long way.\n\nSource: married to an INTP for twelve years
4	ISTJ dismiss	Hello, \n\nI've been asking myself a lot of questions lately about a relationship. \n\nIt has been a little over two and a half years since I met an ISTJ (diagnosed by an MBTI test, and it fits perfectly) 4 years younger than me. For my part, I test INFP, ENFP sometimes INFJ. \n\nAs colleagues, we spent a lot of time together, even more so as over time we had the same group of friends. For several months we communicated via messenger and sms. He was charming, funny, attentive but like a friend. At the end of several evenings with friends, we usually slept together on site. It was no problem, we were friends and trusted each other. But one night, it got a little out of hand. We were attracted to each other, it was obvious. We asked ourselves some questions and decided to be together for good (even though I was reluctant for several weeks because of the age gap). \n\nHe sent me messages almost every day, sometimes to say nothing (excuses). We met in pairs and in groups from time to time, he introduced me to his close friends. Then he yo-yoed: "I don't know anymore" "did we consider ourselves a couple"... we decided to take a "break" during the summer holidays because he was lost, didn't know yet what he would do as a further study based on the results of competitions. I accepted against my will. \n\nWe went on holiday with friends to Spain. During that week, he was friendly with everyone but didn't pay attention to me. It was hard. An evening at the club, I danced a lot and with tourists present. When he returned to France, he blamed me: "I didn't recognize you" "it wasn't a holiday for me". I told him it was nothing and that I didn't know how to dance with him anyway. He replied that it was just a break for him and that everything would be better when he got his apartment in September. What happened. We started again together, even more so because we had passed another milestone: we made love after 6 months of "couple". Everything was perfect, we met once a week at his place when he had a lot of work for the next day. I felt like we were an old couple, but it was reassuring and good. Most of the time, I would bring back food, he would cook, we would discuss our day, our worries, our plans in the coming days, we would laugh, we would watch a movie while cuddling a little. Then I slept on the spot. \n\nAnd once again, after 5-6 months, the yo-yo. He hardly answered the messages anymore or with "yes" and "no". In our group of friends, he spent more and more time with someone we knew (ENFP). I didn't know what to think anymore and didn't want to make a drama. I was trying to understand him. \n\nAfter the summer holidays of the following year, he was to leave for southern France to continue his studies. He told me he would come back often. This was the case, every 2 or 3 weeks, for his family and our group of friends. And I've been to see him three times since then, in the south, with another friend. When he came up, we spent evenings with friends and nights sleeping together only. \n\nThe new year is coming, we are doing it with friends and it brings someone from the south as we can bring people. Only, apparently it's a girl. I don't know who she is, if she's a friend or more... \n\nI don't know what to think anymore... if he's tired, if he's playing, if he's trying to disappear from my life without breaking up completely just in case, if he's trying to make me jealous... \n\nIf you have already experienced something similar, can you advise me? I try to communicate but either he's busy or he doesn't talk about emotions and says he's still there and that's the main thing. \n\nIs that something that ISTJs do? Are they faithful even when there is no communication? \n\nPlease help me...\n\n
7	I can't figure this guy out.. His behavior isn't coming from a type. 
5	This guy sounds a bit flaky tbh and not giving the due commitment an ISTJ gives to a relationship. Have you guys discussed exclusivity? Also, irrespective of type this is no way to be treated in a relationship so talk it out and see if you can figure it out - else maybe consider ending it given how much mental space this is eating into
2	I'm an ISTJ and I personally have never done or felt like doing anything close to this. If I were unsure l would talk things out. It sounds as if he has issues unrelated to his personality type. Would you be able to tear yourself away from this toxic arrangement before you get in too deep? 
1	Ima say walk... When we are into a relationship, you know it. We are way too literal and blunt to have a whole lot of questions. We say and do what we mean and everything he's saying and doing points to the fact that you want far more out of this relationship than he does. Your comfortable, reliable, and sexually compatible to him, bit he's not committed to you or the idea of a relationship. He's willing to let you call it so that you stick around, but he's not trying to keep you. Move on. 
1	ISTJs are very loyal, so theres a chance hes faithful even without communication. But communication is the cornerstone of any good relationship... ISTJs are also rule-abiding so if he thinks the relationship lacks rules then he wont abide by any.\n\nYou need to speak to him directly, firmly, with authority, and tell him what you want, expect, and what the rules of the relationship are. Apoligize for not doing it sooner, but dont apologize for your feelings. Tell him you care about the relationship enough to confront him about it. Tell him there have been some things that have hurt you (fine if he doesnt want to talk about his feelings - youll talk about yours!) like him bringing a girl to a party you dont know, and to avoid feeling hurt in the future you would like him to do... XYZ\n\n
3	ISTJ complexité	Bonjour, \nJe me pose énormément de questions ces derniers temps concernant une relation. \n\n Cela fait un peu plus de deux ans et demi que j'ai rencontré un ISTJ (diagnostiqué par un test MBTI, et cela colle parfaitement) plus jeune que moi de 4 ans. Pour ma part, je teste INFP, ENFP certaines fois INFJ. \n\nEn tant que collègues, nous passions beaucoup de temps ensemble, encore plus comme au fil du temps nous avions le même groupe d'amis. Pendant plusieurs mois nous avons communiquer via messenger et sms. Il était charmant, drôle, à l'écoute mais comme un ami. A la fin de plusieurs soirées entre amis, nous dormions ensemble sur place en général. Cela ne posait pas de problème, nous étions amis et avions confiance l'un en l'autre. Mais un soir, cela a dérapé un peu. Nous étions attirés l'un par l'autre c'était évident. Nous nous sommes posé des questions et avons décidé d'être ensemble pour de bon (même si j'étais réticente pendant plusieurs semaines à cause de l'écart d'âge). \n\nIl m'envoyait des messages presque tous les jours, certaines fois pour ne rien dire (des prétextes). On se voyait à deux et en groupe de temps en temps, il m'a présentée  à ses amis proches. Puis il a fait le yo-yo : "Je ne sais plus" "est ce qu'on s'est considéré comme un couple" ... nous avons décidé de faire une "pause" pendant les vacances d'été parce qu'il était perdu, ne savait pas encore ce qu'il ferait comme poursuite d'étude en fonction des résultats de concours. J'ai accepté malgré moi. \n\nNous sommes partis en vacances entre amis en Espagne. Pendant cette semaine là, il était amical avec tout le monde mais ne me prêtait pas attention. C'était dur. Une soirée en boîte, j'ai beaucoup dansé et avec des touristes présents. En rentrant en France, il me l'a reproché : "je ne te reconnaissais pas" "ce n'était pas des vacances pour moi". Je lui ai dit que ce n'était rien et que de toute façon je ne savais plus sur quel pied danser avec lui. Il m'a répondu que c'était juste une pause pour lui et que tout irait mieux quand il aurait son appartement en septembre. Ce qui s'est produit. Nous avons repris ensemble, de plus belle car nous avions passer un autre cap : nous avons fait l'amour après 6 mois de "couple". Tout était parfait, on se voyait une fois par semaine chez lui même quand il avait beaucoup de travail pour le lendemain. J'avais l'impression qu'on était un vieux couple, mais c'était sécurisant et bon. La plupart du temps, je ramenais de quoi manger, il cuisinait, on discutait de notre journée, nos soucis, nos projets dans,les jours à venir, on rigolait, on regardait un film tout en se câlinant un peu. Puis je dormais sur place. \n\nEt encore une fois, après 5-6 mois, le yo-yo. Il ne répondait presque plus aux messages ou par "oui" et "non". Dans notre groupe d'amis, il passait de plus en plus de temps avec une de nos connaissances (ENFP). Je ne savais plus quoi penser et ne voulais pas faire de drame. J'essayais de le comprendre. \n\nAprès les vacances d'été de l'année suivante, il devait partir dans le sud de la france pour sa poursuite d'étude. Il me disait qu'il reviendrait souvent. Ce qui a été le cas, toutes les 2 ou 3 semaines, pour sa famille et notre groupe d'amis. Et je suis allée le voir 3 fois depuis, dans le sud, avec une autre amie. Les fois où il remontait, nous passions des soirées entre amis et passions la nuit à dormir ensemble uniquement. \n\nLe nouvel an approche, nous le faisons entre amis et il ramène quelqu'un du sud comme nous pouvons amener des personnes. Seulement, apparemment c'est une fille. Je ne sais pas qui elle est, si c'est une amie ou plus...\n\nJe ne sais plus du tout quoi penser ... s'il s'est lassé, s'il joue, s'il essait de disparaitre de ma vie sans rompre complètement au cas où, s'il essait de me rendre jalouse...\n\nSi vous avez déjà vécu quelque chose de similaire, pouvez vous me conseiller ? J'essaie de communiquer mais soit il est occupé soit il ne parle pas d'émotions et dit qu'il est encore là et c'est le principal.\nEst ce quelque chose que font les ISTJ ? Sont ils fidèles même quand il n'y a plus de communication ?\nAidez moi s'il vous plaît..
2	Merci beaucoup pour ta réponse.\n\nEt bien justement j'ai 25 ans et lui en a 21. Je sais qu'à notre âge c'est beaucoup, surtout quand on sait que l'on s'est rencontrés quand il en avait à peine 19. \nMais c'est tombé comme ça.\nOn se complète beaucoup en un sens où il est très méthodique, introverti et moi beaucoup plus sociable mais moins "pratique". \nJe pense qu'après le nouvel an, je lui poserai clairement la question, même si je redoute la réponse. \nLa chose qui me fait beaucoup de mal, c'est le fait qu'il ramène quelqu'un, une fille, que je ne connais ni d'Eve ni d'Adam au réveillon. Alors que nous ne communiquons à peine.\n\nEn tant qu'ISTJ, dirais tu directement les choses si tu voulais rompre ? Je veux dire, sans attendre que l'autre pose la question "on continue ou pas ?" \n \nJe posterai ailleurs effectivement. Ce n'est peut-être pas dû à la personnalité même si beaucoup de fils de discussion me font douter.
1	Je suis ISTJ. \n\nQuel age as-tu? Car 4 ans d'écart me parait insignifiant (sauf autour de la 20ène évidemment). Je ne me prétends pas expert en la matière et je ne me permettrai pas de donner des affirmations ou des conseils. Je peux juste te dire par expérience que nous ISTJ, nous communiquons peu et l'essentiel de nos relations reposent sur la confiance. J'ai eu beaucoup de problèmes avec certaines relations (non ISTJ) car je ne communiquais pas assez.... mais c'est dans notre nature je pense. Je trouve par exemple que c'est inutile de dire a qqun constamment que je l'apprécie... j'assume et j'espère qu'elle le sait... sinon c'est un échec dans notre relation. J'aime penser (comme beaucoup de ISTJ) que nous sommes des personnes sur qui on peut compter dans les moments où on a besoin de nous  (sauf que sur le côté émotionnel, on reste distant)... et je pense que ça décrit assez ton compagnon.\n\nJe parle pour moi en tant qu'ISTJ et par rapport à tes dernières questions mais je n'exprime jamais mes sentiments à qui que ce soit par exemple. Pose lui une question simple et direct type "est-ce qu'on continue notre relation" par exemple, en laissant de côté les détails. Tu l'as dis toi même, il réponds par des oui/non, un peu comme moi en gros...  Il devrait répondre clairement. \n\nJe ne pense que le problème ne vient pas de la personnalité, tu devrais plutôt poster (en anglais) sur le sub relationshipadvice \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy 2cts
21	Settled on ISTJ as my type. Is there any practical use for this information?	As the title says really. Concluded that Im most likely ISTJ. How can I benefit from this info?
16	Yep, you're an ISTJ. 
12	You can read about things others see about you that you don’t realize. Can look up which ways to grow & improve & expand knowledge. How others thinking/feeling different from you and make changes in your daily life towards other people.\n\nAt least that’s how it’s useful for me. 
4	One of the things that I really liked about learning about typology was the simple revelation that people are fundamentally wired differently - and that's ok. There's a sort of beauty in the differences between people and how everyone can contribute to the whole in accordance with their own strengths. It's helped me to be more compassionate towards those different from me, but also towards myself - because the ways that I am different from others are not "wrong" and they can be very useful.\n\nIn the end, it's not going to make me be any less priggish or opinionated. However, it has allowed me to be more understanding, which can translate to more graceful and harmonious behavior.
5	Read the pinned post
3	Read up the ISTJ page on 16personalities.com I find it to be very detailed and accurate\n\nWhat I like to do is look around the weaknesses and work on them. It’ll be very helpful in ways you couldn’t imagine
1	Not really. 
3	Intellectual and debate discord server	The exercise of the intellect. excessive emphasis on abstract or intellectual matters, especially with a lack of proper consideration for emotions. Philosophy . the doctrine that knowledge is wholly or chiefly derived from pure reason. the belief that reason is the final principle of reality.  \n[https://discord.gg/mYwse4S](https://discord.gg/mYwse4S)
4	Any tips from fellow ISTJs on changing your mind about something that has been deeply ingrained from your childhood?	I'm dating an ENFP who does the very occasional recreational drug. I wouldn't say I grew up anti-drug but drugs were never in the realm of my consciousness. I thought only non-productive members of society did drugs, and when I say drug I'm including weed. So I never had to think about whether I can accept an SO doing drugs. And I'm finding it very hard now.\n\nHe grew up a bit in the US and his parents are very liberal. I grew up solely in Asia, both my parents are also ISTJs and I was a Psych major, did a course on substance abuse, none of my core groups of friends do any drugs or even smoke and most of them don't drink. Basically, I'm a very conservative ISTJ.\n\nI myself won't be open to doing drugs but I'm entertaining the possibility of being able to accept an SO partaking in drugs, for the sake of maintaining this relationship.\n\nI've done some research and talking to friends but my views on drugs are constantly being validated because DUH my friends are like me. I feel like research can go both ways - some drugs are bad, some are safe etc. and it's very much about self-control and I feel like drugs is very risky. I also associate settling down and starting a family as things that one would give up drugs for but he believes that the drugs he does are not bad so there's nothing to "give up" or "grow out" of. Part of my frustration is also that he's turning 40.\n\nHas anyone ever managed to change their own minds about something that is so deep rooted that it's almost hardline and fundamentalist?
8	Instead of trying to change yourself, why not try to figure out whether you can live the rest of your life with him, if he didn't change his stance? \n\nI would also want to know if he's aware of your discomfort and if he dismisses it, or does what he can to make you feel comfortable.

3	Im an ISTJ, I grew up in the US in an anti drug household. I've never done drugs, smoked weed, or anything else. I drink occasionally, and I take prescriptions for migraines as directed. So I understand where your coming from. My point of view on Marijuana is this.... I choose not to do it (although some days my migraines have me considering looking into edibles), I don't mind that you do it, I would appreciate it if you don't do it around me. If he can adhere to such a thing, it's showing respect, which is far more important than a rather benign drug like weed, if he can't, then he is showing disrespect. You guys are grown, you don't HAVE to agree on everything. What's important is that you disagree respectfully. 
2	Disclaimer: I'm not ISTJ but come to this sub because my SO is and I'm interested for that reason.\n\nI think you may be approaching this the wrong way. Instead of looking at it as changing your own mind about drugs, I think you should consider looking at it as a relationship/boundaries issue.\n\nMy perspective is this: In most cases, what one's partner does with their body is their right and responsibility to decide. You don't get say over that - it's your partner's choice. That's a matter of having healthy boundaries, in my view.\n\nThe only time things get blurry around that is if your partner is doing something that directly and clearly affects you. And by that I don't mean, "It may conflict with your personal values." I mean, it directly puts you at physical risk, or it puts them in a state in which they do emotional harm to you.\n\nSo first of all, I suggest you consider the strong possibility that from a healthy boundaries position, you really don't have a vote in whether this person does the occasional recreational drug.\n\nYou do have a say in what you will participate in. And if the use of those drugs affects you directly, you still don't have a say in what they do with their body, but you do have a say in what you do with yours. \n\nA few other things, from one of [your comments](https://old.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/a9yeos/any_tips_from_fellow_istjs_on_changing_your_mind/eco0jd9/):\n\n> He also had a hard time trusting my antidepressants and I eventually went off it (that's a whole other topic).\n\nOn the surface, to me this reads as if you two already don't have very healthy boundaries with each other. Unless he was saying he didn't want to interact with you because the antidepressants had a specific affect on you that in turn was directly harmful/unacceptable to him and gave you the choice of getting off the antidepressants or being with him. But that's not what your description sounds like. Instead, it seems he has some sort of abstract "on principle" values stance against antidepressants that he said you needed to follow. Personally, someone trying to impose their personal values on me like that (if that is what happened) would be its own kind of dealbreaker in a relationship.\n\n>I think there is an element of drugs reflecting a bigger lifestyle difference that we have. So my stance against drugs seem to be multi-layered as well.\n\nI think this is worth digging into. What are some of the elements of this possible lifestyle difference, if you're willing to talk about that.\n\n>Why is this so hard!?\n\nI think this is hard because:\n\n1. You two aren't practicing healthy boundaries and are expecting each other to conform so strickly to your respective values that you're not allowing each other to be a separate person in the relationship as well as part of a couple.\n\n2. There may well be larger lifestyle differences indicating areas of possible incompatibility underneath this specific thing, and so it's also hard because you're not really addressing what's at the root of this whole thing.\n\nHope that is of some use...\n
2	Id go about this as any other topic... Education and research: find out everything about the topic, from all different perspectives, and then come to your most logical conclusion that is backed by fact and research. Where ever you end up, just be sure that you stand strong in knowing you are correct in the science that is avaible to us now.\n\nSecondly, its not about changing your mind and  matching your values to your SO, its about seeing if your values are compatible. Depending on your conclusions from your knowledge drive from step one, you will either be happy with your SO, be happy with a compromise, or need to confront your SO and let them know youre not okay with it. \n\nAt the end of the day, its not about changing your values and beliefs to suit somone else, its about becoming the best version of yourself for the best possible relationship
1	You never said anything about having children but if you ever did would you be ok with those kids thinking that there is nothing wrong with doing drugs?
6	Any minimum wage job ideas?	I need some crappy minimum wage job because it’s not realistic to not work (I mow lawns when seasons allow, make $80 a week in 2hrs work, don’t have to deal with people, so it’s hard for me to get excited about the idea of a minimum wage job I hate where I make $80 in 9 hours of work), but don’t know where to work at. I don’t want food service or retail. But that seems like the only option. \n\nAny ideas? 
4	Try a factory line. Or a machinist/technician position. If you know how to use certain tools and can do a little math, you'll make well above minimum wage. I think you have to pass a test for some of those kinds of positions, though.
5	You could be a stocker if you're not opposed to overnights. It's retail but without interactions 
3	Why minimum wage? How old are you? There's not enough about you too go on here. Tell us more about your situation.
3	Look up local petsitting gigs. You'll make more than minimum wage and not have to deal with people (most of the time).
2	People I know do tutoring, I’ve coached before as well - idk whether that’s minimum wage, but you could give it a shot
2	There are lots of hourly admin/office work jobs that require minimal ecperience and have minamal people interaction. At that level its just organizational stuff, filing, data input, record keeping, etc; an ISTJ wouldnt mind it - but also wouldnt find it rivetting... but it sounds like its fits your description of what youre looking for
2	I loved being a registrar at the emergency room. There was a lot of ppl interaction BUT it's all scripted and data entry. Working nights is great because there's WAY fewer ppl to work with and almost no bosses. And you get 30 second adrenaline rushes. We don't freak out when things get dicey so it's perfect. 
1	I work in a boarding kennel at a local vet where most of my time is spent feeding, walking, and bathing dogs
91	when you are an ISTJ	
22	“When your friend calls you on FaceTime”
7	Very uncomfortable around crying people. 
6	MY ISTJ SO is all about giving warm solid genuine wordless hugs to express her care and support (when it comes to me at least). Best thing ever. FaceTime would suck for that. 
11	I don’t relate to this at all. I’m extremely empathetic and actually pursuing a career as a therapist. Any other ISTJ Highly Sensitive People out there?
3	ISTJs are actually pretty good when I’m in emotional distress. They are good at just listening and even though they don’t say much, I feel that they do a good job of just being there. They try their best and I can see that. \n\nAlthough I would have to say that ISTJs should be careful of giving advice at the moment. Most people just want someone to listen and affirm them. So giving advice is usually not that helpful at an emotional time. 
3	I stare at crying people and make no effort to comfort them, I also make no effort to stop them from crying or judge them for crying. I just wait patiently for them to stop. Best I got is the off handed snide ass remark that may distract them or make them laugh. But I got no comfort. 
1	When emotions come into play I have a difficult time. I look for solutions but fail at dealing with the emotions!
1	I'm not ISTJ and face time itself sounds like a nightmare.
1	I find it very gratifying to help people through difficult times.  Listening to people is a skill, and if you're not interested in them you can't really be very good at it.  I'm also a pretty clear ISTJ type, so I don't think that this kind of social ineptitude is necessarily an ISTJ characteristic.  Or maybe it is, and we're just all endlessly complicated!
1	I was told I was empathetic and a good listener to someone but really, it is umcomfortable for me to deal with someone I don't know too well about seeing them cry. But I just stay with them and I think it's the better solution than dashing my way out. I hear them out and hope things get better. I can't offer them their desired solution. But I could get something or do something for them depending how I think whether it would help them. Well, I had been through similar situations so it's pretty understandable for me to stick around with them, especially how others had for me.
7	An INFJ (F) Dating An ISTJ (M)	TL:DR Have a problem understanding the mind of my ISTJ when I'm a Feeler dating a Sensor and what it does to me.\n\nI don't know what goes on in his mind most of the time. He only communicates when he feels like it's necessary, which is hardly ever about his feelings. I'm a very good reader of people, and I can generally follow his likes and dislikes and his outward behaviors. He jokes about me "reading his mind" when I reach for things he was thinking about, or I bring him an alcoholic beverage while he plays videogames. But that's just the surface, which is easy to read. The rest of his mind is like a maze in a dark dungeon. I continue to run into walls without a way of finding any source of light. \n\nHis feelings are somewhere down there, and they bubble to the surface every once in a while if I poke and prod at the ground enough. As the first ISTJ I have ever encountered, and my strong ability to read into people's deepest parts of themselves with one meeting, I've been thrown for a loop. It's unnerving for me as I feel as what I imagine Super Man would feel to suddenly encounter kryptonite mid-flight. I try to explain my own emotions to him, my feelings about the things I experience, and the things that plague my mind, but he doesn't understand it. He'll possibly try to comfort me from time to time, but rarely does he see the problem I have tried to convey to him. I cut out my heart and splay it out on the table like a gutted fish, and instead of looking at the inside, he tells me how silly it is for me to put it out there. \n\nIt creates anxieties I've never experienced, and heightening ones that plagued me since a young age. Trust issues are battled, and my constant need for information I feel as if I need to gather for something I'm highly interested and invested in (my SO.) \n\nWhat are your relationships with an ISTJ like, or what is it like if there is an ISTJ with an INFJ?
7	I'm INFJ and my ISTJ SO (of a little over 3 years) is pretty opaque to me in the "being able to read people" layers. I've had discussions online with other INFJs in relationships with ISTJs and this opacity seems to be a typical aspect of the INFJ-ISTJ dynamic.\n\nIn my case, I really love and appreciate the opacity, appreciate not being able to see into her. The reason for that is that is that I can relax around her. No need to try to navigate unspoken cues. No need to run that stressful gamut of knowing (without even wanting to) more about the other person's hidden stuff than they dare or care to know about themselves sometimes. \n\nShe says what she means and means what she says. She speaks with her actions as much as with words.  It's really really nice, actually. \n\nWe do relationship check-ins once a month. If something is a problem between us, I trust she'll bring it up then (if she hasn't already). As for what she needs from me for support, it is this whole healthy thing where if she needs something, it's her right and responsibility to communicate that to me.  Really, it's so nice. \n\nIf I want to know something about what's up with her, I just ask. Directly and clearly. And she generally answers my questions clearly, directly and truthfully. Direct communication in both directions is crucial and utterly possible and that's *healthy* for communication.\n\nAs for your needs, I agree 100% with /u/JadeApocalypse's advice to you:\n\n>just tell him directly what you need from him. ISTJ are not mind readers and respond well to directness.\n\nNow, one concern I have in your case. This is specific to your situation and IMO not about MBTI types at all. You wrote:\n\n>I cut out my heart and splay it out on the table like a gutted fish, and instead of looking at the inside, he tells me how silly it is for me to put it out there. \n\nIt's not healthy for someone you're involved with to tell you you're silly to be vulnerable. That is disrespectful and it is not, I repeat **not**, about him being an ISTJ or a sensor or what have you. If in fact that is what he is saying (and not that he is actually saying something else that he literally means and you are interpreting it incorrectly as him saying it's silly) then you have a problem in this relationship that is nothing to do with MBTI types at all. If he can't respect you, even and especially when you choose to be vulnerable, that's a huge problem in this particular relationship dynamic. It is not because he's ISTJ and should not be addressed as if it's about differences in info processing.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
7	I (ISTJ) dated an INFJ for a few months this year. Most of it was good, but only because I'm a very assertive and consistent communicator (it's a learned skill).\n\nLet me tell you something that you may not want to hear. To try to read a deeper meaning is folly, as is to expect surprises. One of the traits you can expect is sincerity and frankness, which means that a lot of the social games that you've invested so much in attuning to over the years are just going to be literally irrelevant.\n\nI believe you're overthinking things and making yourself more upset than you need to be. Listen to how he communicates (understanding the 5 love languages is important for understanding how people communicate affection) and take him at his word literally. That tells you everything you need to know.
5	An ISTJ will share their emotions with you if 1) theyre mature enough to understand their emotions themselves, and 2) if we respect and trust you enough to share our very protected feelings\n\nRegarding how he reacts to you sharing your emotions; what is it that you want from him in those moments? What does he do instead? Tell him directly what support you need from him when you are being emotionally vulnerable. ISTJs love to fix things, so we'll often ignore the feelings aspect and tell you how you can fix your situation so you stop feeling bad. We think we're helping, when in reality, most Feelers would like to be listened to and their feeling acknowleded, not fixed. So just tell him directly what you need from him. ISTJ are not mind readers and respond well to directness.
5	I am an INFJ married to in ISTJ for over 8 years.  If you have any inkling if insecurity about your relationship, it will be hard for you.  For example, sometimes I think he’s upset with me or unhappy because he seems grouchy.  I’ll ask, and he’ll say he’s fine.  But then I read into his tone.  Is he really fine or is he masking something?  Then he gets annoyed because I’m trying to figure him out when he literally told me he’s fine.  \n\n\nAlso, ISTJs can be cold and distant so don’t expect some loving vulnerable relationship.  He’s a rock and stable and consistent and reliable but not warm or nurturing.  
3	Me and my ENFJ (F) SO have certain moments like this.I also notice her being able to read me on how I'm feeling when I think I'm keeping up my (what I thought was) neutral demenure. \n\n\nShe's particularly prone to anxiety over things that I would just brush off. I try to reason with her on somethings not being worth stressing over, and this helps some times. There are other times where she has been able to explain why she's feeling this way and it ends up making since to me, even though it didn't at first. I think the key is being open to at least communicating about emotions. Yeah, we ISTJs don't do that well with emotions a majority of the time, but that's not really an excuse to tell someone their feelings are "silly." \n\nWhen you use that word, I'm assuming you mean that he doesn't think your emotions are valid? I wouldn't ever do that to my SO, even if I don't see eye-to-eye on a lot of emotional situations. \n\nOne thing I think would be helpful is having other, more feeling-based, people to talk to sometimes. My SO has a couple friends she can talk to about things when I can't be that empathetic with her situation. 
3	Maybe this will help. Try being super specific about what you want, each specific time you want it. (Habits don't form overnight.) Ask very, very specific questions if you want him to talk about his feelings. I can't express strongly enough how important specificity is. (ISTJ F)
2	I am a fellow INFJ and my boyfriend is an ISTJ! Please feel free to message me if you want to talk in depth. They can be strange characters (or at least mine is, in his own special way—I will speak for myself) but the heart wants what the heart wants and we love ‘em! 
2	I am an INFP (occasionally test INFJ) and am dating an ISTJ. We have been together for three years, and I have had the same "issues" you have had. My ISTJ doesn't like surface conversation or talking just for the sake of talking. He also doesn't like talking about feelings, mine or his, but depending on his mood, he will listen to me talk about my feelings if he thinks I have some validity behind them. He will also work on things if he thinks they need to be fixed. One of the biggest issue I've found is that if I try to point out something he is doing that hurts me, and he doesn't think it is HIS problem, he can get cold and snippy or sarcastic. As a feeler, this hurts me because I don't understand it. \n\nI guess I don't have any advice for you other than to approach him with facts rather than feelings. There are lots of really great things about dating an ISTJ, so enjoy it! 
2	Don't try to read us. You will fail. We have an amazing poker face, not because we're trying to hide things, but because we don't feel like most things are important enough to share. If we have something to say we tend to be blunt, and sometimes insensitive, and all those feelings your talking about aren't important to us. We don't understand them and we know it. We are confused by outward displays of emotion because we don't do that. We just don't. Trying to make that happen is like trying to get blood out of a turnip. Opening up is super risky to us, and on reason is because it means we have to give you a magnifying glass into parts of ourselves that we don't think are import or examine worthy (think the crumbs in corner of the closet). We don't really care about your open heart and we'd kindly appreciate it if you put it back where it belongs. We aren't going to pry to find your deepest darkest secrets and we'd appreciate it if you respected ours. Your more than welcome to share with us, we'll hear everything you have to say, and offer whatever kind of feedback your looking for. And when we feel SAFE with someone, we will share things that we feel are important. Good luck... Stop reading the poor boy, respect his privacy and make him feel safe with you. Safe usually means free from judgment, opinion, standards, expectations, etc. 
2	How to make an ISTJ know you can change	Tried to link to an earlier thread but didnt work out how. TL:DLR INFJ married to an ISTJ man, we are separated but still living together more or less. I hurt him through some emotional, irrational decisions which happened due to generally being quite upset. He admitted he’s still in love with me. I genuinely think I can change... just wondering how I might show him that? Other than through action and hoping over time he may come to believe it.\n\nWhat needs to change is stuff where I need to grow, INFJ typical stuff, poor boundaries, leading to built up resentment, not communicating well re my needs etc. We are both and maybe me in particular - quite immature but it’s pretty tragic our marriage has got here where we are now when there’s so much love there on both sides.\n\nI think I understand him a fair amount although I still find it hard that he can’t really understand me.\n\nThank you for listening.\n\nInput requested. \n 
25	I don’t know about the others, but I am very much “I’ll believe it when I see it” and it is demonstrated consistently and frequently. 
5	>i genuinely think i can change\n\nYou either can or you cant. Dont try to convince him until YOU are certain that YOU can and will make a change to save your marriage.\n\nAfter that, you talk to him. You explain that you know you messed up, you talk about how you messed up, you understand and acknowledge how it made him feel and how its effected the relationship, you apologize, and then you talk about your new plan: what you'll be doing in your life differently to help it never happen again. Let him know you you might make some mistakes at first but with his love and support you hope together to become a better person from all this.
4	>I genuinely think I can change... just wondering how I might show him that? Other than through action \n\nAction is the only way. It is also the healthiest way. Speak with your actions and deal with what it means to do that or - I'm going to be really blunt here - STFU already. \n\nAlso, I'm INFJ and in a healthy mature a relationship with ISTJ SO and please stop blaming your own whatevers on INFJ info processing preferences. \n\n\n
3	This situation is so eerily similar to one I'm in right now I'm honestly wondering if you're my SO posting under a different reddit alias.\n\nThe best thing you can do to show you're serious about changing is to just do it.  That's it.  Respect your ISTJ's boundaries and actually do the issues you want to improve on, I can't speak for others but the only thing I would want to see are results, I don't care about the semantics of it or believing how serious you are about it, all you really have to do is prove it.
2	Other demonstrating it consistently over time you might be able to work out his "love language" to do things that mean a bit more to him... But yeah it will just mainly take time
2	I'm an ISTJ and I've been in a similar position before to be honest we do normally give multiple chances but I don't personally like confrontational situations so I swept it under the rug until I couldn't anymore. If this is a first or second occurrence try sitting him down and try to talk about it and work things out. If its been building up over some time and he finally exploded about it it'll be pretty difficult, just try to work it out without being too much in his space. If you see he's continuously pushing you away after making attempts it's probably over in my experience.  
1	Sounds like you need to focus on acting right everyday and a little less on the relationship... Because what he's gonna do is stand back and watch you and love you from a distance. He's not going anywhere or he would have bounced by now. Take this time and get your shit straight. Let him watch you grow because he's always watching. That's what we do. 
3	Possible unhealthy ISTJ - help me with typing!	Curious INTJ here. I've been going through some old conversations with my ex (because why not) and I still struggle in typing him, as he was a particularly unhealthy individual. My best guess right now is that he might be an ISTJ, but I've found conflicting info about unhealthy ISTJ behaviour so I figured I might just ask here and see if this rings a bell! So if you've been through an unhealthy phase or have met unhealthy ISTJs your input will be greatly appreciated - like, what would be the telltale signs that are pretty specific to ISTJs in crisis? I've been wondering for a while whether he was ISTJ or INTJ, but having been through the underdeveloped INTJ phase myself I could not find much I can relate to.  I thought of adding what I remember about him to see if you can partially relate to it:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Completely detached from other people**: he clearly never was a particularly social person, but even dating with him was a nightmare. He claimed that going out was extremely stressful for him, even if it was just to meet me. He had two "comfort zones", his university and his home, and would only accept to meet people at the former - so he was ok with studying together with other people in university and we would usually hang out there as well, but most of the times he would avoid any other sort of date. Even though we were dating, I always had the impression that I didn't have much more access to him than any other of his casual acquaintances. He always tended to be cold and distanced  and would put up an excessive amount of walls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Extremely focused on his work**: I would say almost obsessively. I've rarely seen him take an evening off, he would rather try and do something pleasurable while he was working at the same time so that the working could never stop. (I.e. watching putting a movie in background)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Easily angered** by trivial stuff, even when it does not directly touch him. Once he was in a foul mood for two days because someone had accidentally written over a plastic cover he was using to keep some documents. He was extremely jealous and would snap at me if I met with friends (even when we were not supposed to meet because he needed to "work"). He would take any comment or action as extremely personal and disrespectful (even when they weren't), and would react by being extremely offensive and dismissive of other people's point of view, or by putting in place small and petty vindictive acts. At the same time though he'd keep up a gentle and accommodating appearance with his acquaintances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Not a fixer**: while dating I tried very hard to make him feel comfortable but I just found it impossible. Everything I did was wrong in some way, and he never communicated how not to make those mistakes. Apparently there was an extremely specific way to approach a certain topic with him and when I'd get it wrong he would either snap at me or fall into passive aggressiveness for ages. If I tried to address the problems in our relationship he would deny the existence of any problem except that tiny thing that I did who knows how many months before. Needless to say, he never wanted to talk about his feelings and would only express anger. For me it was incredibly frustrating as I'm a natural fixer and he would not allow me to find any solutions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Surprisingly (at least for me) illogical in to arguments**: even though he wanted to present his point of view as logical and distanced, he would blatantly omit certain details that could prove him wrong and his thinking was just flawed. Fighting with him was just like arguing with a deaf person - he would not even reply to me, he'd just keep going with his internal monologue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Since I read a lot of you mentioning "neediness" in previous threads**: I always had the opposite impression about him, but he did have a need to be in constant communication with me when we were not together. At times I also felt like he wanted a bit too much from me (like defend him against other people publicly if he was in a fight), but still don't think he was particularly needy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVery curious about your impressions. I know a lot of the stuff I listed is more related to his being unhealthy rather than possibly ISTJ, but I was hoping you could spot the typing signs in there!
7	To me, these sound like issues not necessarily related to MBTI. Specifically, social anxiety and moodiness can happen to anyone.
6	In my opinion, he is mostly an ISTJ. Some of the traits you've mentioned resonate with me at times but not always. I am aware that I do some these habits because they are part of my or ISTJs' compulsions. But the fact that your ex doesn't admit or even reflect on these habits means that he is indeed, unhealthy.\n\nI would classify myself as a relatively healthy ISTJ because I am emotionally stable and am aware of the changes in my mood, social interactions, work  habits. Besides that, I reflect quite a lot.... \n\nA healthy ISTJ takes care of his or her self even he or she works a lot. We are aware if work is too much or not because we like having time for our hobbies too. As for the social withdrawal, we like being alone, but not to the point that we shut down ourselves from the rest of the world. \n
2	My first thought in the beginning of your post was aspergers syndrome, as I read further into it, sounds A LOT, dare I say EXACTLY like my ex when he relapsed on meth. I would consider drug use as a means to cope with some kind of social anxiety or other mental health issues over and ISTJ douche bag. Good luck with that tho. 
1	These are traits anyone could have, espicially someone going through a very bad time. Im not familiar with how stress effects your MBTI but from what youve written it seems you were with somone with a lot of Fi. Are you sure you werent dating an IXFP with some personal problems?

19	DAE loathe the idea of using a dating app?	I'm a 27 year old female and single. I'd say I'm at least average. Slightly above on my good days. I really only interact with the opposite sex at work. I actually have a crush on a co-worker but he's got a girlfriend. Any other guy I may like, I worry about us working together. I don't have a large friend pool. Maybe one person I hang out with regularly. I've downloaded 2 dating apps but haven't really mustered up the courage to use them again. A few years ago I went on a Tinder date and we ended up talking/hanging out for about a month before he said "I don't do relationships". \n\nThe reason I haven't tried again is the fact that I totally over-analyze everything and each swipe is like life or death to me. I take it way too seriously. Whenever I get a match, it's exciting but I'm like oh shit what now? I'm pretty good at being entertaining/flirty over text. But I get anxiety at the thought of meeting up. What if I don't meet his expectations? What will we talk about? Is he going to play me? What if he's an axe murderer? Ideally, I would just make friends with a guy and have it grow from there but I'm also kind of impatient about it. \n\nDoes anyone else feel the same? What's your approach to dating? I've been told I'm very hard to read so it must be hard for someone interested in me. 
9	I met my ex in college around 1993, and we broke up in 2009. It then took me a while (2 years) to even want to date, but when I was ready, it was a whole different world. I ended up on Plenty of Fish, and it was horrible. I'm a chubby, butch lesbian, so there were long stretches of absolute crickets followed by random bursts of trashy, possibly drug-addled dummies who couldn't string together a simple sentence.  Just as I was giving up hope, I got a message from someone saying, "Your cute." After I was done rolling my eyes, I checked out her profile and found that she was articulate, super hot, and we had a lot in common. I had all the same anxieties as you. I can text flirt, but I'm kinda awkward in person. Long story short, together over 7 years, got married last year. \n\nAll I can say is to be as honest and thorough as possible in your profile. More importantly, be picky about who you connect with. I had some desperate and lonely days, but did I really want to reply to some biker chick who didn't have a job and liked hunting? Noooope. Don't self-doubt even if there are long stretches of silence. Don't obsess, just go about your life and make the app work for you. Oh, and when it comes to conversation, my go-to is to ask questions instead of talking about myself since I tend to ramble. Listen to their answers and ask questions that expand on something that catches your interest. See where it takes you.
6	Relatable ...omg are you sure i didnt write this and forget i posted it?\n\nIve deleted the apps because those connections never went anywhere. Ive now found it so much more useful and fulfilling to go out more and participate with purpose in life doing things i love to do, being places i love being, and enriching values i care about. This puts me around people who enjoy the things i enjoy, for the reasons i enjoy them, and gives us an instant connection. Ive met a lot of cool people doing this and cant wait to see what happens....
4	I hate dating "apps" and much prefer full websites geared towards putting together actual relationships. Sites are great for finding real matches when you're like me and don't have the time or interest for "going out".  Apps are great for talking to vapid people while killing 5 minutes on the toilet.\n\nIe, my advice is to join a site with a pay wall (eHarmony and Catholic Match worked well for me) and be open to a lot of first dates.  The more you go on, the less you'll worry about them. Relationships don't really start until date 2 anyway IMO.
3	Got matched with my wife on eHarmony. She didn't use misleading pictures, we had already had some deeper conversation to get us going just via the conversation prompts that eHarmony provides, and we met in a busy-ish public place.
3	I actually met my fiancé on a dating app. When I first started dating I told myself it was something I needed to get better at so I started using apps. Figured these were people I probably wouldn't run into randomly, I'll never see them if I'm bad at chatting, and if we meet up and go out & it goes badly I probably won't see them again either! \nSome ideas for the date itself: \n- go for drinks, it'll help with social anxiety \n- if you're worried about not knowing what to say, go for happy hour and say you have something to do at 8 (or 7, or whenever) and that way you have a defined end time. If you hit it off you can "reschedule" and if not you can say you have to leave to go to this other thing \n\nAnd if you don't want to use apps, don't! You could meet someone doing some kind of hobby.... But I am much too shy for that. I figured apps would be my best bet 
4	It’s weird at first, but as a girl online dating is easy. The guys work to impress you, and if someone gives you a weird vibe, you just end the conversation and move on. 99% of the people that will message you are not what you’re looking for, but I’ve had some good friendships come from it and met the guy I’ve been with the past year through it, and I swear he’s been tailor fitted to me in every way other than the distance. If you have unique interests or hobbies it’s a really great way to find similar minded people. 🙂
2	I love dating apps. I have 4 on my phone now. I go on a first date about every week or 2. I have a very difficult time making friends. I have always gotten along with guys better than girls and the girls Im friends with are exactly the same way I am. I never meet someone hoping they'll be my Mr Forever, but I go hoping to at least make a new friend. It's way too much pressure to put high hopes on a stranger, he's just a guy as nervous as you are. Also, you hate small talk. We know this.... Don't schedule a date until you've gotten past that phase in texting. Once you can have a real conversation with him, then go on a date. Go to have fun, to meet a new friend, to have a nice meal, to have a couple of drinks, etc. Don't go to try to start a potential relationship. That's a good way to land yourself In a shitty relationship. 
4	Last minute gift ideas for my ISTJ 30F wife	I’m enfp and we are complete opposites. It’s great for the most part but sometimes I feel like I put effort into gifts and she just doesn’t get it. \n\nShe always tends to like practical gifts.  I got a loose change organizer for her car and she probably used that the most last year. \n\nAbout her- \n-Motherly\n-Nurse but works more in legal \n-Into fitness\n-Likes cheesy girl comedies although hard to get her to stop cleaning and relax. \n-Always stressed about cleaning, bills, planning\n-sleeps like a rock while I’m up thinking about the meaning of life\n-she’s a 10/10 when she is all dressed up but don’t really want to buy clothes. I guess makeup is always ok but it is pretty cliche \n\nEDIT: ordered shoes and tattoo voucher. Thank you everyone! Happy holidays!
5	Honestly it’s between something practical or something crazy that she might have thought about but kind of scared to try/do, or thinks it’s not really worth the money . You’d need to know what her crazy ideas are, don’t think she’d keep talking about them often.\n\nExample: I really want to fly in a helicopter, but spending $200-300 for few hours doesn’t sound right to me - I look at it as a waste of money. But if someone gave me that I’d be excited like a little kid, and would remember that forever.
3	I also tend to favor practical gifts that I can use.\n\nIs she working or planning on any projects? What about her hobbies, is there anything older that can be replaced?\n\nExamples: I'm a gamer, so for my birthday my bf got me a really nice gaming keyboard and mouse (i had simply mentioned as I was cleaning my old keyboard that they were like 4 years old). For Christmas, he got me a tattoo voucher so I can get the tattoo finished (it's about more than halfway done, I was going to wait until tax return season, but I don't have to put it off now!)
2	I love practical gifts. Has she mentioned something she needs or wants recently but you know she wouldn’t just buy herself? What kind of fitness is she into? Does she need any new gear like shoes, clothes, equipment? Does she use a planner and need a new one?
2	A water bottle for the gym? Fitness accessories? Just some ideas
1	I am ISTJ too!  May I suggest buying her a planner?  It's so practical and everyone needs to plan something from paying bills to getting your next oil change.  Here's the link to a video on a nice planner (skip to time 3:45 to see the planner) [https://youtu.be/SSBTkcMR-jk](https://youtu.be/SSBTkcMR-jk) .\n\n&#x200B;
1	Practical gifts are the best. My aunt bought me a journal 3 yrs ago just because why the hell not and I used it since (and got a new journal earlier in the year). Either that or some quality time does. \n\n
11	Dating advice with ISTJ woman (and want to give some compliments)	I just wanted to point out that ISTJ people are very independent, conscientious, and sensible people that I know in real life! One of my best friends is an ISTJ and this girl, that I  had a crush for several months who I finally asked out, is an ISTJ. They are some of the most hard-working students in my university and I am glad that you guys are able to bring me down to earth.\n\nThat being said, as an INFP guy, what should I do to make an ISTJ woman happy? What gifts or type of dates do you guys typically like? I understand that not all ISTJs are the same, but I would like to pleasantly surprise her and identify an overlapping pattern. She considers me kind of an adorable dork, but I hear a lot that INFPs weigh or wear ISTJ down easily and I don't want to be a burden to her. Lastly, what flaws do you typically find in INFPs and what do you think works out between two almost completely opposite personality types?\n\n&#x200B;
21	Hmm. I'm not usually a gifts person. Like if you were to get me something randomly and follow up with like "hey I was at this place and saw this thing that means something to you/us" I'd appreciate your thoughtfulness. But just straight up giving gifts and stuff is not my cup of tea. \n\nI appreciate when people think ahead on things I need to get done and help me out by doing them for me without my needing to ask them. I tend to get overwhelmed sometimes just *thinking* of what I need to do, so to have someone notice me and know me well enough to help me out without direction speaks volumes to me.\n\nOh and also, if you were to compliment her, there's a good chance she might play it off/not really believe it. I'm not sure if that's a me thing or ISTJ but I have difficulty taking compliments at face value. So if she does this, she's not thinking you're being insincere, she probably just doesn't know how to receive it.
19	Acts of service is pretty much my #1 love language as an ISTJ. Anything you can do to make her life better or easier would be deeply appreciated. Stuff like doing the dishes, making a meal, running an errand, or simply just picking up her favorite coffee drink or snack and bringing it to her. Pay attention to the things she does to make your life easier and do them back for her. Pay attention to the tasks or things in her life that she doesn’t enjoy and find ways to help her out.\n\nAlso, my bestie is an INFP and I think y’all are great.
11	Acts of service, genuine compliments, and being honest are key. Gifts are difficult for ISTJs. I think we are a bit picky lol. I like gifts with purpose and that can be hard until you really get to know one another. 
10	Im an ISTJ guy talking to an ISTJ girl. Im just as lost you you bro
8	I've never understood the purpose of gifts.  If I wanted something, I would have researched it carefully beforehand and bought it for myself.\n\nInstead of gifts, I appreciate someone going out of their way to make my life easier.  A good example would be bringing me dinner if I've had a long day, even if it's just "I cooked too much so now you have to eat the leftovers."
3	My top love languages are quality time and words of affirmation. You may find not all ISTJs have the same love languages. My husband did a great job winning me over when we started dating by planning dates. It doesn't have to be fancy. A little romance goes a long way. Just figure out what she likes to do or might be adventurous enough to try. Watch the sunset on a lake; plan a picnic and beach outing; go to a festival; wine and paint class; etc. As for words of affirmation, just be genuine and make her feel special, acknowledge her talents, efforts, or areas she takes pride in. For example, I like when my husband tells me that an art/craft/sewing project I made is good, that he likes food I cooked/baked, or that he loves a pun or a joke I made up.
2	For gifts, go do something together - like buy tickets to a concert for her favorite band. Or for a smaller idea, you can never go wrong with food - find out what she likes to eat. I think in general ISTJs enjoy gifts of experience and practical gifts.\n\nFor compliments, keep it genuine and dont gush. Tell her what you appreciate about her... ISTJs appreciate being appreciated. We love to solve problems, figure things out and get things taken care off - and we love it when other peolpe acknowledge and admire that. We sometimes feel we arent heard or understood, and it can feel 10 times better than a compliment to just listen and be understood.
1	My top 3 love languages are physical touch (#1) and then a tie between quality time and acts of service (#2). \n\nAs for compliments, give them sproadically. Personally I tend to have a hard time believing people in compliments because I was hyped up in the past. So less means more. \n\nI don't understand gift giving and am bad at them so if anything, get her something you know she'll love. It could be tickets to her favorite artists or do something thoughtful for her, like a personal message to relieve stress. For dates, well I never been on one yet but I'd like something interactive and hopefully not too many people around (but that's not mandatory).
1	My favorite thing with my bf is spending time with him talking shit while he works on some kind of vehicle. I love watching a person do something they do well (he's a master mechanic), watching a carpenter make something, a glass blower, and musician, an entertainer, etc. Those sorts of things mean far more to me than most typical gifts. I love concerts, shows, museums, bizarres, things like that where you can see individual craftsmanship and talent. I might be weird tho. 
9	ISTJ like parent	I'm ESTP teenage girl. My dad is ISTJ and last days we can't be togethere in one room. We don't have any topics for conversation and we fight about little things. He doesn't listen me and always says, that I'm talking too fast. Or he doesn't care. Is it just my dad or is it because of his personality? 
9	I wouldnt go as far as to say that its a trait shared by every ISTJ, but I kind of do that same thing, although its with my little brother (only him, as i am a lot more polite to others). He is very talkative and I find it exhausting sometimes interacting with him in a conversation. It annoys me often when he doesnt get straight to the point of what he is trying to say or if he is talking about something I dont know/ understand or have no interest in. \n\nThat being said we have kind of found our own 'groove' so to speak when it comes to recreational communication. Typically when we do talk (or I just listen as he rambles), we do it for as long as I feel I would like to, and then I tell him that the conversation is done in one way or another, and he respects that and gives me space. While this may seem a little harsh to some, it has actually improved the quality of our interactions and conversations, as I kind kind of build up energy to have proper and fulfilling interactions (if that makes any sense). \n\nFor you and your father I suggest that when you do talk to him, that you slow down and get straight to the point of what you are trying to say to him. Also, I would suggest calling him out, in a direct and straightforward way, when he is being to harsh with is words. We can often be a little thick sometimes in how our honesty or how we deliver that honesty may hurt someone else. Depending on him, he may not seem to take it very well or very seriously at first- but just give him some time to mull it over. \n\nAlso another thing you can do is just sit in the same room as him and not say anything at all. Just play on your phone (on silent) and just relax. It may sound strange but this counts (for me at least) as a sort of 'quality time' with my family that doesnt drain much if at all. \n\nI hope this helps with gaining a little insight with your parent. 
6	My ISTJ SO hates idle conversation. If you don't have something important/interesting to say, you're better off saying nothing. My 11yo son is a talker and drives SO nuts a lot of the time, but he is getting more patient with him. 
3	+1 for what u/Fennec_Fox3 said about quality time not requiring a conversation.  Personally, I want to spend a lot of my free time zoning out, not talking. I need time to sort through my thoughts from the day and I can't do that while holding a conversation.  Without this down time, I get mentally overloaded which leads to things like petty arguments.  If people want to talk to me when I'm overloaded, I'll put in minimal effort to reciprocate so I don't get pulled too far out of the mental "recovery zone" because at that point I need all the down time I can get. It's not that I don't like the person or what they have to say, it's that my mental CPU is overworked and needs down time. \n\nSpend some time with him in silence and just let him zone out. I don't doubt that he wants to spend time with you but it sounds like he needs some quiet time, too.  He'll appreciate both your presence and the mental space.
0	I have an ISTJ wife.\n\nThey are disinterested in everything. She is like a lifeless empty sack.\n\nMe being an ENTP does not help. But we meld together really well. Especially when bing intimate. But try talking politics with her and she either walks away or shuts down. Any hypothetical conversations are just pure trash to her.\n\nSo your dad is probably the same. They are just like that. Some more than others. You will never change them. They need time to process what you say. being an ESTP or ENTP you are usually quite sharp verbally. Where ISTJ's are not. So there is a disconnect there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wife is cute when she is angry though so its okay.
1	My ESTP friens dad is an ISTJ and they have a great relationship... So i doubt its type based. I know they like to do outdoor activities together and whatever projects it is at the moment they work in the garage on. \n\nMaybe theres a more personal reason you guys are butting heads?
1	Im an ISTJ with 4 kids, 18,17,13,and 10. There are days when I have to send my boys out of the room or go to my own room because they have sooooo much to say. I don't always feel this way. It's not every single day or anything, but I work in Healthcare, it's flu season, when I come home I need 20 minutes of stfu before I can hear anything. And if they start their blah blah blah at 14 minutes in, i can't hear them. I can't process what they have to say because my brain hasn't sorted out all my work shit yet. All my brain gets is blah blah blah and that gets annoying and frustrating because I want to hear them, I just need 6 more minutes to process my work shit and they won't stop with the blah blah blah. Give your dad 6 more minutes. See if that helps. 
1	Conversation is one thing. Blah blah blah is another. It's a damn good way to get caught if your ever in trouble. Anything you say can and will be used against you.. Stop the blah blah blah. 
4	Long term friendships with ENFPs?	I became very close friends with a classmate over the last year. We spent nearly every day together this past summer. I later learned that she is an ENFP, the opposite of me. \n\nFast forward to now. I cannot stand her. She is extremely self absorbed and refuses to do anything with me. She only ever tries to see me when she invites me to run errands with her. We do nothing that normal friends do...no going to dinner, grabbing drinks, hanging out at one of our homes, etc. \n\nHas anyone experienced similar issues with ENFP? It could easily just be that our interests aren't aligning...but I'm hoping there's an explanation to my madness. She drives me CRAZY.  I don't see her very much anymore because of it. 
5	Can't speak to the exact experience of knowing someone was an ENFP but sounds like she's too spontaneous for us. I think she just is the kind of person who only has friends of convenience and probably just isn't going to be a good friend in general and especially for our type. Wouldn't worry about it. 
3	I'm an ENFP married to an ISTJ (which is why I'm in this sub).\n\nWe work it out.\n\nIt can be difficult when we're having a hard time, but I appreciate the stabilizing influence she is on me and she appreciates the spontaneity I bring. We make each other better.\n\nIn your case she may not see the friendship the same way you do. We can appear to be very intensely connected to you from your perspective, but from our perspective we're just acquaintances, casual friends. Especially when I was younger I could be like this. It wasn't that I was a jerk on purpose, but others could certainly perceive it that way. 
3	Aren't you guys supposed to be super compatible? Maybe she just has issues or wants alone time. Maybe you need to spend time by yourself for a while.\n\nMaybe you're in love and want more from a platonic relationship than there is. And and wants less. 🤷‍♂️
2	Well I’m currently in a similar bind but luckily we do the usual friend stuff and hang out. I still find myself wondering why I’m friends with her. Like is it that I like her romantically or am I just that lonely. Im still not sure and we’re going on 6 months of friendship. She cooks me food and I help her with her computer classes so we have that benefit but other than that I don’t think we have much else in common. 
2	Sooo...my best friend from college is an ENFP. At first, I was “obsessed” with her because her life was so much more exciting than mine (going out, having a lot of friends, etc.) \nEventually I realized I was just another friend in the revolving door of friends. I realized that I was the one making the sacrifices in the friendship. When we were together, she would talk about herself a lot and frankly I did not care one bit. But I will say that she *tried* to not be self-absorbed. It just came naturally to her and was hard to overcome. 
2	That is my exact situation. We became friends in college and are still students. The only difference is that she doesn't recognize how self absorbed she is 
2	My little brother (19) is an ENFP, I am an ISTJ (22). What I have learned with him is that sometimes I just have to listen and not always explain what perhaps is the most rationale take to a situation but instead just validate his feelings and be there for him. He gets very defensive and just wants to feel heard and valued. Once he feels that security, he is more open to criticism. But I've noticed with him support goes further than advice does. \n\nEdit for more info: I just want to clarify that I don't believe ENFPs are *all* selfish and self absorbed. I think they can struggle with thinking about how other people may feel and the "bad" ones become quite selfish. I just think it's something they are more likely to struggle with. Sometimes it's hard to tell someone's intentions when they live in such a different world. I have seen this with my brother. Sometimes I felt like he was being selfish but once I talked to him I could see where he is coming from and it helped us both. But when he is selfish he needs to be confronted to see he cannot act that way without consequences. This helps him grow and he has grown a lot in his character this year. 
2	My sisters an ENFP so we're stuck with each other 😁 We're a great balance for each other, and get along really well\n\nISTJs take friendships seriously, and ENFPs are casual friends with everything they see. So be aware youre not on the same page. My advice in your case would be: be unapologetically you. If you dont wanna hang out running an errand, tell her and propose a dinner instead. Say no when something isnt ideal, and reach out with plans of your own that you would prefer. \n\nIf youre upfront about the very basic things you expect out of a friendship, and shes still selfish... Byeee
5	Look at these ENTJs lmao.	
10	Wow the mods had to lock their thread... Do we even have a mod here?
5	Why exactly are some types "popular"? Why would anyone take pride in their type? Why others try to act like they are some type if they really aren't? 
4	I do like to observe chaos, though I'm glad our sub hasn't devolved into that
4	It's so simple, don't feed the trolls! 
2	That was pretty fun reading through x)
1	The spelling mistakes are made that much clearer when seen alongside the claims of being good with language. Pretty sure it's just a troll tho. No news here.
26	Does anyone else have issues with "caring" about people?	What does it technically mean?  How do you know if you have "connected" with a person?  How do you know for sure what you think is "love" for a person is not really "love" as they understand it?  \n\nMuted emotions as an ISTJ are great when you can view the world through a logical lens and tough times don't seem so tough because of tangible facts and figures.  In terms of positive emotions though, it is quite limiting.  I feel like the "connections" I form with people are often lacking, and I am unsure of my ability to form TRUE connections that other types might find easier to make.  
12	Relationships are almost impossible to measure objectively, so I understand your predicament. The best outward measures of connectedness I can think of are positive shared experiences and mutually sharing personal information with acceptance (the latter of which I do with few people).\n\nAlso, check out the five love languages. \n\nOverall, I believe love is an active decision and not a feeling. Feelings come and go, but love is a commitment.\n\nHope this helps.
8	I don’t have issues “caring” about other people.\n\nI think you’re just viewing your emotions through a logical lens.\n\nYou’ll never know whether someone feels “love” the same way as you do, but it may help you to know that there are three components of what psychologist think of as “romantic love:” passion (sex and sexual attraction), commitment, and intimacy (vulnerability and trust).  If you think those three components are strong then you are probably feeling “romantic love.”\n\nI don’t know what you mean by “true connections.”  If you both feel like you have made a connection, then I believe it to be a “true connection.”\n\nYou don’t have to act like the other types act in friendship/relationships to be able to feel the same or very very similar.
3	I don't think ISTJs love like other people. We are so logical so to me what I cared about in a life long partner is everything surrounding her. Obviously after I knew she wasn't just an awful person. We have enough mutual interests and the want to experience new things. We have a great success potential. Modern depiction of love sets up people who are already prone to being dreamy to think love is a magical force and not a job. 
1	I dont have a lot of the love feelers and all. I do, however, have a "bf" for lack of better term, who we both totally agree that we have a connection. We don't have to be in each other's ass all the time, we have our own lives and interests and friends, we've never been on a date, we've never been anywhere together, except his house, we haven't met each others friends or families, it's just us. But when we are together we have amazing sex, and the intimacy afterwards is more soothing and comforting a than any real relationship I've ever been in. I feel a compulsion to touch him all over (and you know we aren't touchy ppl), we lay draped all over the bed and usually don't say anything. Just enjoy and touch each other. That connection I feel with him is strong enough that I've given walking papers to guys who've offered more, but lack that "thing". I also love the lack of monogamy and commitment because I don't have to follow any rules to enjoy him.

11	Do you fear moving to new places?	Lots of ISTJs, and well SJs in general report fear of moving to different states, but I found it easy to move from OK to AZ. One bank person told me I was brave for moving, and I thought that was weird. Moving isn't scary for me at all, and I usually get worked up over uncertainty. But maybe that was because it was college, and I didn't need to look for a job once I got there. Tbh, if I were to move after college, I would look for a job before actually moving. Moving and then looking for a job seems way too stressful.  
9	Like all mbti types; Its not the action, its what motivates that action that defines a type.\n\nISTJs dont hate moving, they hate uncertainty, fear the unknown, and jumping into that void is not a thrilling risk - its a horrifying prospect theyll work to avoid. \n\nIf you remove most the uncertainty, fear, and risk from moving (either through research, already used to moving around a lot, know they have a good saftey net, already have your life set up where youre moving, moving to be around friends and family or other support, etc) then an ISTJ wont fear moving to a new place. They might really love moving if that were the case.
4	Nope. Love moving. I like discovering new places and meeting new people I wouldn’t have otherwise. I was in the Army so I had the opportunity to move often. Suited me well. 
3	I don't fear moving. But with that said, at one point necessity dictated having six addresses in three years between two countries.  So I guess it's just something I'm accustomed to, and with a half-decent internet connection navigating a new area isn't too hard. I don't really get homesick or anything so there isn't any emotional upheaval from that. \n\nWhat I don't like is the process. The finding a place, the inspections, the packing, the lugging boxes up and down stairs (and hiring people to help with that), the unpacking, dealing with utility accounts, the awkward small talk with new neighbours, etc. It's a pain in the ass, and not something that I would bother doing unless there was a solid reason. Work is a solid reason, and has been why I've moved on previous occasions. 
3	I hate moving. It takes away my comfort zone. I moved houses so many times as a child...
2	So I currently live in NYC and I love it here. There's so much going on and so much to explore (and I am not talking about the mainstream areas). It also helps that we have an intricate (though retarded) public transportation system. So I don't want to move out if I don't have to. \n\nHowever, I'm worried about moving out to an area where I need to drive. I have a fear of driving because my dad got into a car accident when I was 7. There's also adapting to the life style there. I dorm in a suburban town and since I don't have a car, I rarely go out of campus. I would use the LIRR to go to Port Jeff (the next town over) because Uber costs add up.\n\nSo if I do move out, I hope it's at another city with great public transport.
1	I’m finding a job before moving. Moving is incredibly stressful for me. I wouldn’t say I fear moving to new places, but I absolutely dread my *home* being uprooted and my daily routine being extremely interrupted. It’s exhausting to move. That said, my last several moves have been generally exciting as it has meant I am moving onward to better things.
1	I live in the same city I (and my INTP husband) grew up in. I have zero desire to move or live anywhere else. We both were away for college and for a little over a year after that so we have lived in other places. 
1	Moved to a different city/state few years ago, and considering moving to a different one. \n\nI just plan it out to make sure I got things covered, no fear, more like excitement \n
1	I've lived in the same house since 1991...
1	I moved from Ohio to Oklahoma and loved it... Came out here on vacation in 2012 and six weeks later I moved out here. Never looked back. I don't have a bunch of nastalgia or loyalty or feeling attached to old places so I have no problems finding a new place to live. 
1	I didn't liked moving as a child because I already made friends and was happy in my neighborhood and wanted to go to the same high school as my older siblings and also see my church friends at that school. First time wasn't bad but the second time was okay. Then third time, I was fine with it. Wanted to start over and there was a good reason to move.
6	Future Co-Habitation Problem with ENFJ SO	I've been dating my GF, an ENFJ, for about 8 months. We're by far the most opposite of any girl I've dated, which should be pretty obvious just by our MBTI being nearly polar opposite. A lot of this I actually have grown to like. \n\nHowever, a couple of things I feel will cause major problems if/when we ever move in. The biggest one is that she lets her place get really messy before she cleans it. Like to the point where you can't see her floor. Now she does clean it once every week or two, and she like deep cleans her place. I, on the other hand, keep my place pretty clean. I'm not OCD about it, but I don't leave dishes on the table or even in the sink, don't leave my clothes on the floor etc. \n\nThe other one is that she is fairly spiritual. She says she identifies as a Christian, but also believes in evil spirits and all that. For instance, she keeps crystals above every door and window seal to "keep out the bad spirits." I'm not religious myself, but I don't have a huge problem with Christian women, as long as they're not dogmatic etc. \n\nIs there some way to reconcile these things? I've really tried to figure out the cleaning thing, because that would be the thing that drives me crazy. When I used to live at home, my sister kept her room the same way, but she never cleaned it until we made her. She tells me I'm too uptight and rigid when it comes to the cleaning issue, because I won't just get up and leave dishes on the table after eating etc, but I think that's rather normal? The majority of people's houses I've been to don't live like that honestly. \n\nDoes anyone else experience problems like this with their SO? I've had disagreemens before with SOs, but this girl has a lot of qualities that I like, so I'd rather find a way to get over these things. 
6	I'm sure there's plenty of couples out there that figured out how to deal with one partner being messy and one being very clean.  If you can both find middle ground and be respectful enough to adhere to it, I don't see why that couldn't be worked out.\n\nThe spirituality difference is a huge red flag, though.  I'm actively religious and dated an atheist once thinking we'd be able to just "not have a problem with each other".  Eventually I realized that to her, my "Jesus thing" was tantamount to worshipping Santa every Sunday which is not only deeply insulting but also wrong.  Clearly you look at her religious views with some level of disdain and would not like it if she followed her faith more strictly.  If I had kept dating the atheist, I'd be with someone who simply didn't get me on a deeper level and I'd have to do without a proper religious wedding (which almost defeats the point of marriage in my opinion).   I'd also have to be ok with my kids' mother being at least a passive influence away from faith.  At this point I don't think it's a good idea for an actively religious person to seriously date someone who's non-religious - it's too big of a deal down the road to ignore.
2	she has a blind Si (details) and that conflict with your dominants Si
2	Her place gets messy enough that you can't see the floor after just 2 weeks?? At least she's consistent and thorough with the cleaning lol.
1	Unfortunately not that many people are open to being persuaded to drop faith. As an ISTJ I'm fairly sure that we are not as staunchly traditional as we're portrayed. I've been an atheist for a while now, and it has less to do with personality or intelligence. It is the depth of their indoctrination which keeps some peoplein these institutions. What persuaded me to stop believing was a correction of my internal logic: That which is real exists in objective experience (otherwise each statement is meaningless) ... if I am to believe in a deity I should require proof that it resides in the universe. No evidence exists as of yet, therefore I cannot be religious and honest about standards of truth. 
10	Any ISTJs here work as any kind of managers?	I’m at the point where I need to decide which way I wan my career to grow, and one of the few ways I have is move towards being a manager. \n\nMost of the managers I’ve met were extroverts, so I was wondering if any fellow ISTJs are managers of any team size, and how do you enjoy that.\n\nThings you like, things you dislike, regret?\n\nAny experience as a manager welcome!
20	You couldn’t pay me enough to supervise people. I’m much more of a worker bee. \n\nI’ll be interested to follow this thread, idk if my opinion is unique to me or if it’s baked into our MBTI. 
9	Yeah IDK if it’s unique to me or an ISTJ trait, but I demand a lot (oftentimes too much) of myself and I’ve noticed I expect the same level of delivery from others, which is rarely the case. \n\nI know this comes off as conceded but I regularly overdeliver and most people just don’t give the same level of effort to their work. I’d be a terrible supervisor because I’d point this out quite matter-of-factly (which I’ve done to coworkers in the past and have been reprimanded for it) and have little patience for complacency and people doing just enough to get by. \n\nStill hoping to hear from others on this one!
3	My ISTJ Wife was a manager at a few food and retail outlets and was an upper manager in a medium sized business prior to having kids.\n\nI have been told many times that she is an unlikeable cunt.\n\nIt is not like she is rude or anything. Just empty and unfeeling. She can't read a room or show any joy or give any validation.\n\nQuite literally a drone.\n\nShe like being a manager. But always eats lunch alone if you know what I mean.\n\nShe does her job in a very authoritative way because thats how she likes to take orders. This does not go down well for other people under her. She is very result orientated. Follow rules and structures and does not like to change them without good reason.\n\nI am the opposite as an ENTP.\n\nI used some harsh words here in jest but when I think about it, It is all true.\n\nWe suit each other very well because she is literally the exact opposite of me so we complement each others strengths and weaknesses.\n\nShe is a great mother but a horrible "friend" if you know what I mean.
4	I’ve fulfilled a team lead position multiple times. Overall I’d estimate that I have about a 50% satisfaction rate. Half of the people I supervise/guide appreciate my leadership style; seeing it as tough, but fair. Whereas the other half inevitably leave the company. This has been the case across different companies.\n\nDo I regret unintentionally pushing employees to leave? Not really. Most of them said that they realized they’re in the wrong career path and found something that suited them better. \n\nA key component of my leadership style is that I won’t ever ask someone to do anything that I wouldn’t do myself and I demonstrate this by doing it; I never explicitly say it. My actions speak louder than my words.\n\nI also make a conscious effort to balance negative reward with positive reward. I try to identify and act upon as many opportunities to compliment my peers as I can. That’s more difficult for me to do than criticizing, which comes naturally. \n\nI try to establish a work environment that makes me and my team peers rather than a supervisor with subordinates. The things that distinguish me as the “leader” are choosing direction and acting as the sword and shield that goes up to bat against higher level management on behalf of my team.\n\nAll that being said, I still suffer the typical ISTJ tropes. When a deadline is looming on the horizon, I can’t bring myself to trust that my team will meet the deadline on their own. I’ll end up putting in extra worker bee hours to make up for any perceived slack. I also have an insatiable need to have some sort of side project that is entirely my own because I don’t want anybody else “messing it up.” 
3	Without giving away too much about where I work or what I do, in my industry, if you're good, you'll either plateau *hard* or end up in charge of a team. \n\nMy move personally was from national SME to team leader, and I leveraged my expertise pretty well - I became a leader that you could ask when you were stuck as a kind of higher tier support, and because I had been around a while, I could provide a historical context for why things worked the way they did. I really liked being the person folks could come to when they were really stuck and if I didn't know the answer offhand, it was a fun puzzle to put together solutions.\n\nA lot of my early struggles came in terms of providing feedback, my trend initially was to be too harsh - I had to be reminded by my leaders that just because something was easy or commonsense for me, didn't mean it would be for everyone. I am a big fan of the STARAR feedback model - I think it's super valuable, because it focuses on the situation, not the person. Another thing I learned was to sandwich constructive feedback between two pieces of praise, I found I was getting much better results. \n\nOne other thing I was told to keep in mind when delivering feedback is that (almost) no one gets out of bed in the morning and says, "I'm going to fuck it up really bad today," 99% of folks are doing their best and want to do good - as a leader, you need to find out what their roadblocks are and help them through it. \n\nA real positive that I found being an ISTJ in leadership was that the loyalty I showed to my team (in one case I pretty seriously lost my shit on someone higher than me who was abusing one of my team members, was pretty sure I was fired, but somehow survived. n another I was able to shield almost everyone from layoffs) came back to me tenfold, anything I asked them to do got done faster and better than I would have believed. \n\nYou are correct that a lot of folks in management positions are extroverts, I think it's because they're better at playing the political game, and they get into management faster. The flip side to this is that introverts can make really good managers as well because we often have valuable experience and insight that someone rocketing up the corporate ladder might not have time to gain. \n\nTo wrap this up (I'm sorry this has gone a bit long and stream-of-consciousness-y) there is no reason that you can't be a great manager as an ISTJ, introverts can make great managers, just be the kind of manager you wish you'd had, and it'll probably work out. If you have any questions I can help with, let me know.
3	I've managed two teams during my career. \n\nOne was in a department of introverts and one was in a department of extroverts. The extroverts were definitely extroverted feelers and it was exhausting to manage them. I also felt like I was constantly on the defensive about my leadership style. There was a fair amount of critical feedback on how I interact with everyone. On the other hand, supervising the introverts was a great experience and they had nothing but praise for me. \n\nReflecting on my work in both departments, I  don't feel like my approach was that different. \n\nI suggest considering the culture and styles of the team you'd be supervising. It could make a very big difference in terms of how you feel as a supervisor.
2	I run my own business and supervise, manage, train 7 people.\nDon’t confuse introversion with shyness, they’re not the same thing!
1	I managed the student workforce at one of my college's dining halls for two years.  It was great for building confidence and finally forcing me out of my comfort zone - I grew a lot as a person because of that job. Many workers seemed to appreciate that I stayed "in the trenches" and didn't use my position as an excuse to slack off or delegate.\n\nI did struggle managing interpersonal relationships, though - I was too friendly with a few people (as in, they treated me too much like a friend and not a manager) and in other cases was probably too distant/detached for any job that wasn't an after school, spending cash job.  It wasn't my leadership skills that would convince people to do things but their own native work ethic. I found it very difficult to ask people to do unlikeable tasks so I mostly wound up doing them myself - that's great for earning respect from your workers but part of leadership is learning how to get your team to willingly carry out undesirable jobs.  In general, I had a hard time being the bad guy (I chalk that up to high agreeableness) and sometimes you have to be the bad guy.  In retrospect, that's where I was most uncomfortable and also where I grew the most. So while it was my weakest area, I also know that given enough time I can develop that skillset and do alright. \n\nIn general, I think ISTJs, like most types, have pros and cons when it comes to management. We are great at leading by example but not so great at managing relationships which happens to be a big part of the job. I think a well-developed ISTJ that knows how to manage relationships would make a great manager, particularly at lower levels where we can still get our hands dirty. I suggest listening to Jocko Willink's podcast for great insight about how to lead.
1	I've been managing small teams, 2-3 people, for the last 5 years at a couple of different jobs. My rules were: get your shit done on time, get it done properly and don't make me look bad. \n\nThe first team I managed was interesting, both were Redditors. I physically moved us into a corner of the open workspace so they could be on here without getting caught. They were incredibly smart and could get their work done in a fraction of the day, leaving a lot of time on their hands. I could have probably gotten rid of one and consolidated, but I'm not a corporate drone and would rather keep two good people employed. I did have to deal with management training and evaluations and all that, but I'm in my 40s and have learned to fake it. It was exhausting at times, but I felt like I had to follow the natural progression of my job. Can't be a worker bee at 40, that doesn't look good at all.\n\nThe second team I managed was 3 people (blog writers). One had a great attitude but needed a lot of coaching, one was awesome and with a little bit of tweaking became my go-to for important projects, and the last was a total bitch and sucked at what she did. Every bit of feedback was questioned, or she demanded examples or she went to my boss and complained that I was being too hard on her. I would have fired her after my first month on the job, but my boss had been friends with her husband who passed away. She was given the job to help her keep afloat. It took me a year, but I finally got rid of her. \n\nDown the road, I see myself continuing to manage people. I've already learned that I hold people to high standards just like I do for myself. I can deal with people that need coaching but if the attitude is shit, they are automatically out. I do actually enjoy teaching people processes and sharing what I know, then seeing them implement what I've passed along and succeed because of it. That's pretty awesome.
1	Only go into management if you like managing.  Don't do it for "more power", or to exercise control, or ego reasons.  It's more work, probably harder work, usually more political, and less of whatever you did that got you into it.  Remember, the orchestra conductor doesn't get to actually play any music!\n\nI've been an engineering manager for over half of my rather long career.  The "I" in my ISTJ is borderline, scoring almost exactly even between "I" and "E".  The other three are like 90% each.  The result is I enjoy the team aspect of our work, I like the people.  At the same time, I definitely still do a lot of the work myself, especially the individual-type efforts.\n\nSlackers really set me off, and I get unhappy with myself when I do that too (happens occasionally).  I've turned myself inside out on a project too many times to count, and it has seldom been of true importance to the company.  But I'm compelled to meet deadlines, to accommodate even unreasonable demands.  The Ayn Rand style super-manager, alone in the office at night to complete some project, has been too much of my template.
1	Which path pays more?\n\nI personally like entrepreneurship. I don't like being told what to do. That said, I don't like going in alone when I'm clueless. If management will give you a similar experience then it might be enjoyable. But I also prefer money.
1	My dad and are are both ISTJs. My dad has worked as a plant manager for over 25 years. Very successfully I might add. \n\nEdit: spelling
22	I just turned 21 with zero interest in alcohol	Is this common for istjs? I just never saw the appeal. I also don't want to drink in front of my dad for some reason. I feel pressured to have alcohol and dont really want it. 
17	I don't know how common it is for others but I don't drink. Never have, don't plan on ever doing it. Not only did I just not see the appeal but I saw firsthand its harmful effects on family members.
15	I hate drinking. Why would I intentionally want to feel like shit??? Like no. 
12	I don't drink alcohol, and I've never actually felt pressured to try it.  I've had a few people try to pressure me, and then I explain why I don't drink and they let it go.\n\nAnd to head off the question, here's why: I have a family history of alcoholism, and I know I have an addictive personality.  I decided the easiest way to not become an alcoholic is to not start drinking alcohol.  Problem solved.
7	I don't think this is specific for ISTJs. We tend to reason with logic which shows alcohol in a bad light (costs money, may give you a hangover, addiction, etc). I say that you do what feels comfortable and makes you happy. If not drinking alcohol does that, then you should 100% do that. \n
4	I also never the saw the appeal, don't really feel pressured though.
5	I only drink socially. I'm not sure how much this has to do with being a product of your environment vs your personality but I can see it being either, or both.
5	I am an ENTP, Drank heavily and did drugs from age 14 - 16 every weekend at parties. Nothing to heavy, LSD and a little coke. Drugs were only a short 3 month sprint.\n\nWised up really quick and quit cold turkey. I don't even eat food with alcohol in it that has not been cooked out.\n\nMy ISTJ wife never drank. And because I never do she never will.\n\nIn fact we defined our relationship to each other. If either one of us even touched alcohol it would pretty much be grounds for separation or a complete distrust of the one who did. Alcohol is as bad as meth in our house and we actively avoid it and make it known we do not participate.\n\nYou know who your real friends are when you can get along without drinking.\n\nA lot of people use it as a crutch in life. Some to wind down, some for liquid confidence, some because it just gets them a little happier than they were. We view it as a weakness.\n\nIf alcohol was invented today it would be illegal.\n\nOnly people weak in self control and are insecure  or unhappy drink. It is self evident.\n\nIf you have a beer after work to wind down the above is not so much true, but for me a glass of milk or a cup of tea is enough to wind down. but being an ENTP it is hard for me to wind up at all. I have very little stress in my life. Almost none.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo OP, Don't feel you have to drink. People pressure you to drop to their level. Drinking is a step down for most people. Why would you want to partake. \n\ninb4 someone says they drink to have fun. If you can't have fun without drinking your just insecure or lack confidence.
4	I don't drink and I am 20 in college. I live with 8 other students who drink almost constantly. I have zero interest, I'd rather be sober and do something or simply stay home and do nothing at all 
3	My family has had a history with alcoholism, so that causes me to keep it at arms lengths. That doesn’t mean that I won’t occasionally have a drink or two at special occasions. I’ll have it at weddings, or at the ballpark, or the occasional holiday. Some of my friends find this amusing since I have strong Irish and German heritage. 
3	I only drink casually to enjoy it (good quality) and know that it’s not a good idea personally for myself to drink much.\n\nNot really interested in it unless I’m trying be a little more loose with friends or really stressed out and need to forget about everything for the evening. \n\nI believe I can have fun without it and never understood why people would get drunk, especially on purpose, not even enjoying it.
3	My parents drink fairly often and rarely get drunk, but I’ve never seen the appeal. Personally, I like a clear head and shy away from anything that alters my mind, including caffeine-heavy drinks. I don’t want to submit to alcohol. When I was 19, my family went to the British Virgin Islands where the drinking age is 18. My dad said he was totally fine if I drank and a bartender even tried pressuring me into it, but I still refused. When I turned 21, my family wanted me to try a drink and my roommates encourage me to buy beer for them but I still won’t. I have yet to get into a real opportunity for social drinking but I know I’ll probably pass on the alcohol.
2	Same. When i turned 21 it was in the middle of finals and i was way more interested in getting my studying done so i could go out and watch a movie that was premiering.\n\nMy roomate ended up dragging me out that night. It was a pretty uneventful evening, but it was nice to have that milestone checked off.\n\nNow I'll drink when i got out with my friends but thats it
2	I didn’t drink before I turned 21. I’m 24 now and only drink socially (which is pretty rare) and have never been drunk or even felt a buzz
2	I drink beer or liqueur sometimes, but only for the taste. The only time I got drunk it was with 2 close friends just to try it. I was 23 at the time. I'm glad I did it, we just laughed at everything. I got a little bit sick the next day, and I kept the memories. But I was home alone with 2 close friends, I would never do it around strangers. If you get the chance to do it safely, consider it just for the future reference:)
2	Third generation of non-drinkers.  Just was never in the house.  I kind of counted it as not wanting to lose control.  I also think I would be a mean, nasty drunk.  
2	I didn’t have my first taste in alcohol until I was 23, and I must stress the word taste. I don’t drink and have no interest in being drunk at all. I occasionally have sips of wine of something a few times a year, but I’ve never been drunk. Never feel pressured, and if someone is pressuring you about it, don’t hang out with them.
2	I felt the same way. I had people that I really respect say shit like “oh 21!? You gonna have a fun night?” 😉😏 As if I’m obligated to get shit-faced drunk. Well, legally I guess. Seems like everyone only drinks to get drunk. \n\nBut I’m now really into alcohol because of the art, craftsmanship, and science (I know, typical for an ISTJ) behind distilling, mixology, bartending. There’s endless amounts of ways to get into alcohol, just go at your own pace.
2	I am ISTJ and yes I do drink frequently on the weekends, it's the only thign that gets me out of my shell, especially around people I don't know too well.
2	When i turned 21, i had no interest in drinking. About 6 months after that, i had started to try some and see if there was anything i liked. I found i really enjoy whiskey/bourbon/scotch. I wouldnt say i drink to get drunk, i just drink it because i like the taste. I dont buy it very often though, and for that reason, i can go months without it and not care. When i have it, ill usually only drink it on the weekends when i dont have anything to do the next day and usually only have 1-3 drinks at a time when i do. Alcoholism is a problem in my family and i actaully resent my mother a bit for her problem with it. I do not want to ever drink to that extreme. I did one time to figure out where i need to draw the line to stop myself but thats it.
1	I only just recently had my first drink at 24. The appeal was never there and I grew up in a dry home. Alcohol-free was all I'd ever known. But my mom and aunt introduced me to those nice fruity, girly drinks while on vacation and I discovered somewhat of an appeal. They're pretty alright, though I never had more than 1 or 2 a day. I do keep some coconut rum at home now, but I rarely find myself drinking it, and even then only when I want something fruity. Still don't understand the mainstream appeal of drunk culture, but whatever. I'll stick to more 'neutral' vices, like soda. Please don't feel as though you have to drink to be normal though, there are plenty of people who don't. It's really a choice that's entirely 100% up to you and how comfortable you feel.
1	[deleted]
1	I like to drink but socially. I like to take my time with alcohol and just enjoy being with great company or dancing on my own (or with friends) if I go to a bar/club/party. I don't mind drinking to get drunk here and there (or getting crossed) but I REALLY hate when people drink to get uber fucked up to the point of blacking out or getting injuries.\n\nI will never drink in front of my parents or let them find out that I drank. They're Muslims and will be crestfallen if they ever find out.
1	Not 21 yet but I have no interest in drinking. I'll definitely buy my first handgun when I turn 21 but that's it.
1	i hate the taste of alcohol. on top of that, it's way too overpriced. so no, i don't drink. but i do love my coke zero
1	I didn't hardly drink at all until I turned 30 and  then I would once in a while. Now I'm 37 and I drink frequently. I go to bars to see my friend play in his band and I like wine so I'll have a bottle at home. I have fun with it. 
1	Same here. Rarely drink, even socially. Never saw the appeal. I am quiet and reserved as an INTJ to start off, and when I drink I first get silly and say or do things I normally would not consider ever doing (but that stage lasts 15 minutes at the most) then I just become sleepy and "disinterested" in pretty much everything that is going on around me. But as for your situation, I wouldn't think much of it. There are plenty of ways to have fun without drinking. Keep it up.
1	And that is okay, you don’t have to want to drink nor feel obligated to. However, if you feel like being part of the conversation with everyone drinking alcohol, just drink soda or juice or something.
7	Chemistry: ISTJ and INFP	How well do ISTJs and INFPs generally interact with each other? I've noticed that they share the same functions in different order, so it seems like they'd either "get" each other well, or they would always sit on the edge of mutual understanding but never truly achieve it. What's your experience been like?
5	My SO is an ISTJ, and we've been together for three years. We are fundamentally very different. We don't fight often, but when we are upset with each other, we handle it quite differently. I get really emotional and withdrawn and he gets cold and sarcastic. This doesn't help things at all. However, he's very open to discussing things, even if his idea of discussing is him explaining why I'm wrong until I agree. Haha I know that sounds terrible, but that is 2 percent of our relationship. The other 98 percent of amazing! \n\nHere is what is great about us: \n\n1. We dislike people in general an equal amount. When one of us complains, the other one gets it. However, We both love those we are close to fiercely. \n2. Since we are both introverts, when one of us doesn't feel like going out or being extraverted, the other understands. We are equally happy staying home together. \n3. We have so much fun together. We laugh constantly and can geek out over anything without judgment. \n4. I don't worry that my ISTJ will cheat on me. Perhaps this is just the type of person he is, but he's very loyal, and once he dedicates himself to something, he makes it his mission to do the best he can. \n5. We balance each other out well. My head is in the clouds and I have tons of ideas that most people would laugh at. He does keep my feet on the ground, but he doesn't crush my dreams in the process. He looks for ways to make my dreams happen. \n\nOverall, I think it is an awesome pairing, but it isn't without its hurdles. We are mature adults, but I don't know how well this pairing would work with younger people?
2	Sit on the edge and never achieve it. Although I only know one INFP. \n\nNo issues, but also different interests
2	My older sister is an INFP. We get along pretty well. We talk about stuff like how annoying our mom can be, our goals, TV shows, how much we dislike Islam and the Desi culture, or how society is. We sometimes go out for walks together.\n\nHowever, we both do have conflicting differences; she's idealistic and sucks at planning things out. I'm more realistic and am great at planning things out. She's a lot more optimistic/happy whereas I'm more content with where things are going. Oh yeah she's imaginative and shows it whereas I tend to internalize all imaginations I have. She believes in Abraham Hix, the Law of the Universe, and is really spiritual. I on the other hand don't believe in the former two and I don't think I'm spiritual.
2	ISTJ Male in long term relationship with INFP female.\n\n\nOur chemistry is great, so long as we don't try to "understand" each other. She completes those aspects of me that I lack, I overanalyze while she allows feelimgs to reign. I am a minimalist while she makes our house look like a home. We pull each other towards a common center, and I love her for it.
1	We get along really well. Compliment each others personality quirks nicely
1	Edging. With a ex ISTJ there was on day to day bases really good dynamic. Very chill and comfortable environment.  I remember that I felt that something was missing sometimes. I don't know about him but that might have been same with him. But I did grow and mature through the relationship and that was awesome. 
1	I'm an ISTJ mom of an INFP daughter. We actually get along pretty well but it has been difficult for me to understand her, but I feel in some ways I'm the only one who ever really will. \n\nFWIW she has said in the past she could never date an ISTJ. Her boyfriend is also INFP.
1	Off topic, but I have to be very ISTJ to think this post is about science... 
1	I have to admit that as an ISTJ I struggle a little to 'get' the INFPs I know and sometimes this has led to a little friction in the communication.\nIt's not really anyone's fault though and eventually we do work through it by keeping an open mind and patience.\n

22	What are some good things about being an ISTJ?	Most of this sub is negative or advice, so let's turn it in a more positive direction
47	We are financially stable and emotionally stable.
31	The threshold to enter "panic mode" is very high, so we're calm and rational in a crisis.
27	We’re good planners, so we often have a spare “whatever” (pencil, notebook paper, tampon, breath mint, etc) for ourselves or others in case of need!
23	Excellent listeners, loyal to those they care about, calm in the face of chaos, and will always show up for something they said they would. ISTJs are also safe bets for the other types 'Who would come bail me out of jail' lists. 
11	ENTJ here, my ISTJ partner is super reliable, loyal, and level headed. He doesn't "freak out", he handles stress well, and I love that he will contribute equally to planning dates and getting stuff done. I also think a lot of ISTJs are actually really sweet softies with a tough exterior. Having dated INFJ/INFPs, who are incredibly manipulative and emotional and irrational and spacey, ISTJs are wonderful partners. 
9	Super consistent. You know what you're getting and who you are dealing with always. 
9	Being a human
8	You actually “just do” what needs to be done like it’s some simple obvious thing. You’re also very consistent, straightforward, and grounded. \n\n\nI also think talking with ISTJs can be very helpful, they can help you sort things into idea boxes and make sense of chaotic things and once that sense is made, help decide how to deal with it. 
7	Aside from the aforementioned perks, I find Si really useful for picking up new skills quickly and retaining them for a long time.  It also comes in very handy for winning beer money through trivia.
9	We're really good at focusing on a task until it is complete.
4	- Excellent planners\n\n- Financially stable/frugal (emotionally that varies)\n\n- Mostly prepared for obstacles\n\n- Mostly composed in the face of chaos and are not likely to do anything reckless\n\n- Our Si teaches us what works and what doesn't
3	If an ISTJ gives you their word, you can bet they'll follow through with it or at least will genuinely try.  We're very dependable and responsible.
3	Don’t know much about being one but ISTJ’s are probably the people that come off as the least intrusive, they also tend to be very respectful of peoples privacy (from my own experience at least).
2	Honestly almost all aspects are beneficial in one way or another. Makes life a lot easier.
2	My ISTJ husband is reserved on the outside but a kind, soft cinnamon roll on the inside. So warm and fun and loving! He loves the love of family. He's a fun parent, and gives his time to our children abundantly. And he loves to be around us all more than anything else. That's the best thing I know about an ISTJ. (ENFP wife) 
11	Question	Do you guys find yourself looking for the "why" in everything? Like "*Why* does a certain trend I'm noticing happen in *this* manner?" Or would this be INTJs?
19	I always look for "why"s because that gives me a better understanding of how everything works so I can better make use of things in my daily life
7	Yes. I absolutely love figuring out patterns like this.\n\nI do this in all sorts of smalk ways, but i remember years ago i read a bunch of popular young adult books to piece together the common thread making them such big hits and so widely appealing
4	I always ask "why" about almost everything. When I was younger, I remember I annoyed my dad so much that he told me to stop asking questions lol\n\nBut nowadays, like others have said, I ask why because I just like to get a better understanding of things. Sometimes when I ask why, people misunderstand and think I'm pushing back and putting up a fight about something when I'm really just curious and thinking out loud.\n\nOr if I'm having a discussion with someone and they present a point of view that's different from mine, I'll ask them why - not in a judgmental or accusatory way, but just to be enlightened. Because I'm not always right about everything and I don't have all the perspectives from all points of views, so if there's another viewpoint I can learn about, that would add to my overall "database" of knowledge.\n\nEdit: as a sidenote, I always thought this was more of an INTJ thing as well, but maybe it's both?
3	Absolutely. I find myself questioning “why” I make the choices I do.  
1	This is a tough question--though I think the toss-up would be between ISTJs or INTPs.\n\nISTJs assess motivation for things all the time, because we have a hard time putting effort into something if our hearts aren't 100% in it. So we have to constantly make sure this thing is worth the effort; it's very logic-driven. But this is usually in regard to situations that directly apply to us (we don't have the energy to wonder why THEY did something if we don't have to do anything about it).\n\nINTPs tend to just be more curious overall, and like to learn new information. This leads them to ask "Why?" and follow those rabbit holes to spot patterns, learn more, etc. It doesn't have to be functional, and it can often not relate to them directly. 
1	Absolutely.  I work in an office environment, and when a new procedure comes out or a new guideline is released for how I should do my job or interact with customers, if I don't understand why things have changed, I'm almost always at my supervisor's desk trying to figure that out.  Once I can understand the why, it means I can explain our procedures and sell to my clients in a way that makes more sense and ends in a better outcome for everyone.
1	If something applies directly to me, I find out the why behind it. It helps me to pull that new concept into my routine. If I can't find out why, I ganerally won't include it, mainly because I'm spiteful af. I've been chastised by managers at work for asking why and for clarification because they think it's rude and back talking. This is also a reason I tend to work night shift or at a place I with minimal supervision. \n\nHowever, I'm not wondering the whys and wherefores of the universe. Idgaf about the big bang or some existentialist bullcrap. As far as I'm concerned it's none of my business. 
11	ENFP here. My [M] very close friend [F] (former ex, ISTJ) just gave me the greatest weekend of my life. I'm kinda speechless...	She's always been very reserved. Quiet. But insightful. We dated for a bit in high school, ended horribly (communication issues, go figure? lol)\n\nBut after a year of blacklisting each other we became great friends. Which has continued until today (6 years later) \n\nI arranged for us to meet this past weekend because I would be in her city. It was the first time in *ages.*\n\nWhat I thought would be a nice Meetup turned into an entire day and a half together roaming the city, her showing me around, taking occaisional breaks to re-charge, and just generally enjoy the company with each other. Waking up next to her was so wonderful (and unexpected tbh) It just felt so real compared to any other person I've been with.\n\nShe came *so far* out of her shell in order to show me a good time. Of course we had our awkward moments, but that's to be expected! And to be honest, seeing her and having this experience has helped me to work out a lot of personal situations I've been overcomplicating. \n\nTruthfully it hit me on a spiritual level I don't really feel often. And I don't know exactly how to convey my appreciation to her... For how much effort she put in, for how she made me feel... just all of it.\n\nCould you possibly help me find the structure for the words she took away? \n\nTL;DR: how do I go about translating all of my touchy feelys into words that are more her language? \n\nI realize I wrote this whole thing very confusingly. I apologise. 
9	Don’t overthink it. ISTJs are one of the most literal people I know. So just say what you mean without using too much metaphors and embellishments. \n\nThey would also appreciate small gestures. You can even ask if they would like you to do anything for them or leave it as an open invitation. They will get back to you. Just make sure to really stick to it and not fail them. Otherwise they would be disappointed. ENFPs are not the best at follow through (just being real here). 
5	I don’t understand what you’re asking.  Are you asking how to say what it meant to you and how to say thank you to her?
4	Somewhat unrelated, but I feel like ISTJs take a long time to emotionally mature but can easily surprise people when they do
2	Idk about anyone else but I have some weird effect of ppl where they feels super comfortable telling me things they won't tell anyone else. I think one reason is because I can listen to the whole sentence from the capital letter to the period at the end and not interrupt, not make fucked up faces, not show judgment, not make comments and really let you get your whole thought out, out loud so that you can hear it as much as I can... Then ask questions based on the information you offered and offer advice or opinion or nothing, based on what ever it is your seeking. Is this the sort of thing she did for you? Because I've been told that it heals the soul. 
10	Which subreddits do you spent the most time on?	I'm interested in knowing which subreddits other ISTJ's spend their time on.  Do like personality types end up with similar interests?
4	r/TheSilphRoad\n\nThe best Pokemon Go resource and community on the net.\n\nr/marvelstudios\n\nMy source of info on the MCU and a great place for discussion.\n\nr/aspergers\n\nOne of the very few places I feel understood and I like helping others with some of the problems I've already dealt with.\n\nDon't spend much time on the next few, but they're subs I love.\n\nr/DaystromInstitute\n\nHardcore Star Trek sub for in-universe discussion of Trek tech. I don't comment.\n\nr/watchpeopledie\n\nLearn what not to do and an appreciation for your luck so far.\n\nr/askhistorians\n\nHistory facts and discussion. I don't comment.\n\nr/askscience\n\nScience facts and discussion. I don't comment.\n\nMost of these subs are HEAVILY moderated and I think it makes them much better than places where you can post freely.
2	Askreddit because I can browse it at work, and learn a lot the lives of other people, their professions, and relationships.  Or just hear a really cool story.  There's just so much information to soak up, I take everything with a grain of salt on whether or not it's true but I still feel as if I'm learning.\n\n[r/2007scape](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/) is the only other sub I'd say I frequent because I love OSRS, even though I haven't really had time to play in awhile.
3	The dungeons and dragons subreddit r/dnd :)
3	late to the party here, i dont post/ comment often on reddit but i spend a lot of time browsing r/animemes, r/me\_irl, and r/greentext. Beyond that, im subbed to a bunch of other stupid shit i just look at from my home page. I spend a lot of time on r/all too.

3	Thrillers/suspense novel recommendations	I love thriller and suspense novels with thick unpredictable plots. Do you guys have any recommendations I could give a gander? 
2	The best I can recommend is And Then There Were None or any Hercule Poirot mystery by Agatha Christie (for example, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd). Idk if murder mysteries count as thrillers but I've been completely baffled by all of those stories so far (until the final reveal).
2	Try these works of nonfiction, they resonated with me:\n\nDark Invasion\n\nIn the Enemy’s House\n\nAnd these too:\n\nGhost Map\n\nThe Taking of K-129\n
2	I really like the surgeon series by Tess Gerritson
2	The Circle by Dave Eggers. 
1	How to let an ISTJ know I haven’t abandoned them	Updated: I took a job in our home town, with my SO’s encouragement, that would have me working away from home 4 days a week. He encouraged me as I’d been unhappy living where we relocated to, far from our home town, and we were thinking of moving home. Anyway, he feels I’ve abandoned him. He’s responded by doing the same, to me. I moved home as I could see he couldn’t handle us being apart and neither could I,  we live in the same house, but he won’t talk to me. I understand it on some level, but it was never my intention to abandon him and I find it confusing - lots of couples go through these scenarios and it’s just work life, not abandonment! Maybe I’m too independent?!Input welcome. INFJ here. 
14	Say to him/her "I haven't abandoned you."\n\nOr give us more information.
4	It may help if you give us the scenario.
2	Idk... When I was done with my marriage I was fucking DONE! I went through seven kinds of hell to get o that point, but when I got there, I was in no way shape or form interested in fixing it. 
2	The relationship problems seem deeper and more varied than whats being explained here. Sorry
2	Agreed with the comments that this seems a little more than just a personality-type question. THAT being said, some thoughts, speaking **very generally** from being an ISTJ myself  & research that I've done into it all:\n\n\- If he's still around (i.e. hasn't actually left yet) there is a chance he's not done done with the relationship. Once ISTJs make up their mind that they're done, they typically just leave; we don't have the energy to waste, well, energy. If he thinks you're in the wrong, he could be waiting for you to initiate a conversation.\n\n\- There's a good chance this was sparked from a "said one thing and did another." ISTJs are very loyal creatures, and we have a high sense of duty to others. But we struggle A LOT if someone says they care about us, but don't act that way. It's confusing and we're very black-and-white people.   \n**Example:** You say you're not abandoning him, but you never return his calls, don't make effort during the four days you're gone. That would be one way to get us to shut down.\n\nThere is so much here, like his past history, what he's going through, his personality outside of MBTI that i don't think there's a simple ISTJ answer here, unfortunately. Maybe instead of repeating to him that you won't abandon him, or weren't trying to -- ask him what he is feeling? or what's going through his mind?
1	I would also like to hear the scenario but just talk to them see how they are doing. Let them know you are here for them. 
1	Show you're there for him. You have 3 days of the week to use to spend time with him. Say to him "I haven't abandoned you." and fucking mean it.
1	I'm confused, is this the person you got involved with during your separation from your ex or soon to be ex husband? Or have you and your spouse reconciled and is that the SO you refer to here? Or am somehow I confusing you with someone else (I did glance at your post history and it seems like I'm not but who knows)?
1	So, he won't talk to you, but will he listen?  If he will, here's what I'd recommend saying (assuming it's all true, cause whatever you do, don't lie to him):\n\n"I know the separation was hard on you.  It was hard on me, too.  I'm back now, and I want to work this out.  I can't do that if you won't talk to me.  So please, let me know when you're ready to stop this passive aggressvie bullshit and talk to me.  I'm here, and I love you."\n\nOr, you know, something like that.

9	MBTI and Writing Style	Recently, I came across an article arguing that J.R.R. Tolkien was not an INFP as many think, but an ISTJ. The article argues that Tolkien's writing style is not in keeping with that of Fi-Ne, but of Si-Te. \n\nNow, I'm no psychologist (so I don't think I can adequately argue one way or the other), but now I'm curious as to how one's function stack comes out in his writing style. I've read widely, but I don't usually look into the writer's psychological profile. \n\nHere's the link, if you're curious: https://mbtifiction.com/2015/11/21/why-tolkien-was-an-istj/\n\n
5	My wife is an ISTJ, She does not have an ounce of creativity in her whole body. \n\nHard for me to believe an ISTJ can be creative after seeing my wife in action.\n\nLet alone a level of creativity as great as J.R.R Tolkien.
4	Developing Fe function.	So people at my job mentioned that I need to be more sensitive to people's feelings...especially at work. I honestly care to get the job done. But my group wants me to play nice with everyone. I have to write nicer emails and chat with people better. This is because our role with other teams in the company...they need to take our advice and listen to us.\n\nIt really drains me to have to reread emails 4x before sending it out or think about what I have to say before calling someone.\n\nAny advice from those who developed their Fe?
8	Get a girlfriend and puppies. Have a kid if possibly.
7	Although you may care most about getting tasks done and making sure things are done correctly, the way coworkers perceive you and the relationships you have with them absolutely affect your ability to efficiently do your job.\n\nHere are some ideas. Did you ask for a specific example of a time when you could have handled things better? Get the details and understand what you could have done differently. Find someone with a similar job role who doesn't get this feedback and ask how they usually word emails, approach conversations, etc. Keep an open mind; if you're like me, it's very easy to assume that you're always right and everyone else is not. That mindset easily can make you come across as a critical asshole. You probably need cooperation and teamwork, so you need to consider the other person's point of view, the skills they bring to the team, and how you need their support to get the job done. Lastly, if it's any interest to you, there is no shortage of solid literature out there on working effectively with others. You can read books like Crucial Conversations, 7 Habits, How to Win Friends and Influence People.\n\nAsk yourself if you trust and want to accept this feedback about needing to be nicer at work. If you don't it's unlikely you'll make any changes.
2	I don’t know much about developing Fe, but have you thought that maybe this position isn’t for you?\nI don’t understand why you have to be nice for people to take your advice and recommendations, at least in a professional environment. But hey, what do I know. Maybe someone else can help you better than I. 
1	 You still get paid for it. It's work afterall, and you make this job a little bit nicer for your colleges\n\nAnd if you just don't care about others and do your job right does it matter either?
1	Powerful psychedelic experiences have helped me immensely in this realm. I’ve learned to be much more empathetic. At the end of the day I still just really want to get the job done, but I’ve slowly learned to listen and take into account my coworkers feelings in addition to their practical knowledge and tangible contributions. \n\nHope this helps. \n\nEdit - am also an analyst. 
1	ISTJ here and my coworkers think I'm the least abrasive person they work with, which isn't really true; I just use my mediator voice a lot at work and in emails. My two tips I follow are:\n\n1. **Explain things**. Not extensively, but if you went with a different option, or if you ran a report slightly different than they asked, explain why you did to them. There's definitely a reason, and most people just like to know the reason because it tells them they were considered.  \n**Example:** "We went picture A because of X and Y" or "I prefer picture A because of X and Y." ***instead of*** "Picture A is the best picture" or "Picture A is  better than the one you suggested."  \n\n2. **Use conflict resolution/mediation speak.** This means more "I" statements and less "you" statements. And it means repeating back what someone is saying to either confirm or clarify.  \n**Example:** "This doesn't make sense to me because of X" or "I'm hearing A, is this correct?." or ***instead of*** "You're not making any sense." or "Could you repeat yourself?"  \n\n3. **Throw the occasional bone** and compliment coworkers when you like an idea, thank them for their help, etc. Not all the time, every time. But acknowledge their effort.\n\nSorry that these are vague and likely unhelpful without context of any emails. But it's less about actively being nice, and more about being neutral. 
1	Is that even possible?
7	What are your views on religion/spirituality, or lack of?	Curious to see how other ISTJs feel about this topic and share expereicnes on how their viewpoints have developed, thanks
14	agnostic. i think i believe in something vaguely but not an “all powerful god” or anything like that. my parents raised me catholic but it’s not for me. i find a lot of hypocrisy in organized religion. 
7	My ESFJ mom is catholic, my ESTJ dad was raised catholic but dislikes organized religion, and I went through the whole Boy Scouts program (by all means a religious organization) from 5yo to 18yo. My mom taught me to believe in God when I was little, but it never really stuck. I’m agnostic by definition, meaning I don’t believe in any gods but I don’t disbelieve either. I’m not a fan of the concept of organized religion but see why some like it. Despite not having one, I believe some kind of religion is necessary for most people to provide followers with proper ethics, morals, and answers to unanswerable questions (like “why am I alive?” or “what is my purpose?”). I grew up around several religions and have a high tolerance as long as people don’t use religion as an excuse or try to force conversion. You do you and I’ll do me.
6	Agnostic, I just can't get on board with atheists /scientists saying the universe has always been here man. OK with that logic your house has always been here no contractors, electricians, plumbers... Nope it's always been there don't question it.\n\nA higher power had to create our universe. Now whether we are a failed fourth grade project of an alien species, a simulation like the matrix, or a dream of a turtle floating through space is questionable but I don't think the higher power is interested in us or our lives.\n\nI think it's more like a game of simcity, a creator just did something. 
5	I’m Catholic and treasure my faith and the Church. I was raised Catholic but didn’t really start really practicing and intellectually engaging with my faith until college. 
3	I have a degree in anthropology and what I learned in anthropology school was that all cultures have a spiritual belief and the type of spiritual belief depends on the size of the society. So band level societies believe in animism, which is the rock and tree spirits, it's impersonal and more of an "it" . The tribal level societies believe in animatism, which is similar, but the spirits become personal, they have genders and personalities, more ghost-like. Chiefdoms tend to lead more toward witchcraft type beliefs. So the individuals in the society are more involved with the religion and can use it to act on others good or bad (think voodoo). There are powers that may or may not manifest as people or animals but certain ppl within the society can try to control them (spells, witchdoctors). Pre civilizations have pantheons, think Greek and early Roman gods. And civilizations have are usually monotheistic with one huge almighty God. This made me realize that there has to be something to this religion thing. No culture has atheism at the root of its belief. I think that whatever it is (and I don't know the right answer to it) presents itself to each culture in a way that they can understand it. A band level society has a very small world and they don't understand a very large God. While a civilization has a large world and can't understand a very small rock spirit. I feel like we know how to live right and the world is, for the most part on auto pilot. And I don't think this God guy is nearly as involved in our day to day lives as some ppl think. I am also very certain that I don't know the right answer and am totally willing to admit that I am wrong and I never ridicule someone for believing something. Because those beliefs do something good for them and do me no harm. 
5	I was indoctrinated into Christianity as a child and adhered to the faith until high school. In high school I learned about other religions, evolution, and all the science I missed at my sheltered religious elementary and middle school. Between gaining critical thinking skills, being exposed to lifestyles beyond Christianity, and dealing with hateful and hypocritical people at church I eventually began to question my faith and ultimately became an atheist by my senior year.\n\nSince becoming an atheist my mental health has improved so much now that I use things beyond religion to cope with life. I am happier and feel like I can live a full and authentic life without the oppressive rules and in-group/out-group dynamics of organized religion. I am so grateful everyday for the teachers who challenged my identity and worldview as a teenager and pushed me to open my mind. Atheism is congruent with my personal values.
2	Born and raised catholic. Started becoming agnostic in high school and I am currently still agnostic. 
2	I'll preface this by stating that I don't have any evidence, historically or scientifically to back up my statement, it's just a personal feeling that I seldom express because I cannot defend it in any solid way.\n\nI think that no culture has atheism as a root belief because at some point in the development of that culture this higher power as described earlier showed itself to that culture and gave it a foundation to grow on. I think that this power, whatever it is, has enough faith in its creation that it doesnt need to micromanage it so its easy for individuals to dismiss it. But the foundation from where those individuals came from are still marked  with that power so that culture maintains itbeven if some individuals don't. 
2	Reformed Christian. I'm a bit of a theology nerd.
3	Not religious myself, but no problem with other people feeling this way if it makes their life better.  Who is to judge.  Of course I am against people who kill based on religion or some other reason to commit crimes.
4	[deleted]
2	I myself do not believe in anything really, but also don't care whether or not other people do. As long as they don't hurt anyone, people should be able to believe in whatever they want. 
2	I'm an atheist. My parents didn't raise me to be religious and never went to church. So I just turned out this way
1	Atheist. My parents are both Muslim and raised me as one. However, in high school, I started questioning religion and saw that it is not the life style I want to live by. I also find a lot of hypocrisy and baloney in religion.
1	Honestly, I don't care. It's a fun entertainment though with some useful theories, depending on what you wanna follow. I mean spirituality/metaphysics mostly. Even mbti is sort of a form of a following/religion. Everyone wants to learn something about life, and information is useful, no matter what form, even if it's "higher education" like college, that is still learning, although if you want to learn something more ethereal, it won't really help you in that case. But all knowledge is basically a following, which is basically a religion. Following as in you will attend school for 16-30 years of your life. If that's not a religion, I dunno what is. 
1	I'm an atheist (although apatheist is probably more accurate). Religion, spirituality, and god(s) don't concern me and play no role in my life. I was raised protestant but more so for the social aspect of going to church and fitting in with all the other WASPs in my hometown.
1	I'm a born and raised Catholic. For a while I was apathetic and then "non denominational" but always went to Church anyway. I'm back to being a regular Catholic now partly because Catholicism seems to be more stable than any other denomination of Christianity
2	ENTJ girl trying to understand ISTJ guy	Entj girl here. I sit next to an ISTJ in class, and he almost never speaks to me other than hey, goodbye or to ask about the subject. He is relatively attractive and I don’t know if he is shy, asocial or just not interested. \nI do not think he likes me much because he never tries to initiate anything and if I say something to him he doesn’t try too hard to keep the conversation flowing. \nHowever he does act a bit nervous and gets weird with eye contact. (He can’t look me in the eyes for more than a split second) is this normal? \nIs there any chance he could be interested in hanging out if I asked him? Right now i don’t wanna put it all on the line since it would be awkward if he said no when we sit next to each other. \nWhat kinds of conversations do ISTJs enjoy?\n
12	Seems really odd to me that you'd know his MBTI considering he can't even make eye contact with you...
7	Even if he does like you, he still won’t initiate anything. ISTJs only have conversations with a specific point in mind (unless they’re talking about themselves or their interests), meaning we don’t do well with small talk. He’s quiet because that’s just how we are. In fact, if he greets you first you when he sees you that means he sees you as more than a stranger or classmate. Avoiding eye contact could mean he’s interested but too intimidated. Flirting won’t get you anywhere, just be direct and let him know your intentions/feelings if you ask him out.
4	He may be intimidated by you, which isn't a bad thing. But yeah just talk to him about something he enjoys and he will talk.
2	He’s an introvert. He may find you obnoxious, as an EN as opposed to IS. He’s silently judging everyone and everything.  \n\nAsk for his advice on something he’s passionate about. He’s likely knowledgeable on a few things, and probably opinionated with regards to those topics. \n\nYou need to be very direct with him. He will see what you see as flirting as just conversation. He will misread signals like crazy or be in denial.
2	> Is there any chance he could be interested in hanging out if I asked him?\n\nI'd say "probably."\n\nSo everything else you describe sounds like exactly what I'd do if I were sitting next to a girl I found attractive.\n\nWe (ISTJs) are not good at small talk (we hate it), so that's probably why part of why he's not trying to keep the conversation flowing.\n\n> What kinds of conversations do ISTJs enjoy?\n\nWe enjoy talking about things we're actually interested in.  "Things we're actually interested in" varies from individual to individual, but generally speaking, if an ISTJ is interested in it, they'll have a conversation about it.
2	ISTJs are introverted and generally private about their personal lives.  He may just not feel comfortable talking about anything unrelated to work in a classroom setting.  Ask him to join you for lunch or grab coffee after class.  Ask him direct questions about things that interest him, but don't get too personal too quickly.
2	If you ask him to hang out, he will probably be interested. He may like you but is just too shy to talk to you. So you gotta initiate.
2	> He can’t look me in the eyes for more than a split second) is this normal? \n\nYes, all of what you described pretty much is spot on how I am too.\n\nI mean it's a spectrum so I am a little more outgoing and have practiced socializing a lot, but it sounds how I used to be.\n\nHe won't open up unless he feels comfortable and that will take time and you won't get there by just talking in class.
1	How do you know some quiet kid who sits next to you in a class that you don't know well is an ISTJ?... I've been seeing the same guy for 15 months and wouldn't feel comfortable guessing his personality type because that seems awfully presumptuous to me. Does anyone else ever feel like these questions are almost like, "there's a kid who doesn't fit in my world perfectly, what is the best way to manipulate the person or situation to make me most comfortable" or is that just me being a shitty person?\n
1	Lol, you're describing me. I guess I can be quite the pain in the ass when it comes to what women think about me. Honestly it really is hard to say. We're very particular and critical. Basically if you're attractive (good looking and chemistry wise) and nice, we will like you. At that point you can ask him to hang out and he'll definitely say yes unless he has some obstacle preventing him doing so, or if he's unsure about you. So don't take it personally if he's unsure, just let him get to know you more, like talk about yourself and your interests. We're very unsure creatures, so if he's not responding to it then give him time. He will like that you're talking to him.
5	How can an ENTP bond with her ISTJ Mother-in-Law?	TLDR: MIL and I seem to clash/butt heads and can't hold conversations/have much to talk about, what can I do to improve the relationship?\n\nI'm a female late 20s ENTP trying to figure out how to get along with my 50-something ISTJ MIL. We are around each other quite a bit and it's important for me to have a good relationship with her. We don't not get along, but we also aren't exactly....friends?\n\nShe never seemed interested in really getting to know me while in the dating stages with her son.\n\nShe's very generous and a good provider, but still don't get a warm feeling. She does a lot of VERY generous things for my husband and I but I just don't feel close or bonded with her, idk. She says I'm unique and different to her and will say this in front of me and other people, which...I don't really know how to take lol. I try to view it positively but...I don't feel we're close enough to appreciate each other that way yet?\n\nOur conversations are...at least to me, very awkward and feel forced. Lots of awkward silence. I'm normally great with getting to know people and keep conversation going, but with her I struggle really bad and am often met with a cringe type smile and nodding for more than I am comfortable with. Like I'll say something like "Me and Husband went to Event and thought you'd like it" to which she'll smile and nod, no response. Idk what to do in those situations cause she just keeps staring at me LOL, is this an ISTJ thing or...?\n\nMy husband says that's just the way she is and that if she didn't like me, she would have told him a long time ago. So at this point I accept we're just different and want to focus on our similarities to make everything smoother and not feel anxious when left alone with her.\n\nSo how can I, as an ENTP, get along better with her? What can you tell me about being an ISTJ that would help me understand her better? It seems like we butt heads a lot and have a disagreeable relationship and I really want to improve it. \n\nHow do you get along with ENTPs?\n\nEDIT: Just want to thank everyone who commented! This insight is exactly what I was looking for and I have a much better understanding now. Much appreciated!\n\n
7	When she says you are different and unique, that’s probably not bad. If she thinks of it as negative, she definitely wouldn’t say it in front of you since ISTJs simply do not play in the passive-aggressive field.\n\nISTJs do not enjoy small talk like most others do. If you’re talking to me, I’d be more comfortable if there was a reason for it. If you two are sitting alone in a room full of “awkward silence,” it’s probably only awkward for you. My roommates are bothered by this too, but ISTJs don’t mind (and usually prefer) silence. It would be more awkward to have a tedious conversation about nothing. The cringe smiles and nods she gives you are probably because she doesn’t know how to respond. If you want a response, try asking direct and specific questions. Instead of “we thought you’d like to come,” try “do you want to come?” and stuff like that.\n\nAs for getting closer, ISTJs value family, honesty, and shared experiences. Try going out and doing things with each other. Find out what your common interests are and talk about that. ISTJs may not be much for talking, but we do love talking about things we care about. Just make sure you’re actually listening, the worst thing is when we start talking passionately about something we care about and realize no one cares. General nodding won’t be good enough, make sure to ask relevant questions. If she’s into, for example, knitting, ask about her favorite patterns and why she likes them over other patterns. Be specific and show that you care. You mentioned that she’s VERY generous to her son, and that’s because he’s precious family. Once you get a spot in that circle, she’ll do the same for you.
3	[deleted]
3	> "me and the husband went to an event and we thought youd like it" \n\n...was that really all you said? Cause if someone said that to me id might just smile and nod too.\n\nThats just a piece of information; Get to the point if you want a response. Or ask a direct detailed question... tell her exactly why you think she'd like it. ISTJs interests are very personal, so appeal to her personal interests. And we're very detailed and orgaized, so be specific and direct.
3	ISTJ here... We hate small talk. We don't know how to do it and as far as we're concerned it's just filler noise and we'd rather have silence. Quiet is OK, quiet is good. I think a lot of E type personifies want a response to everything they say when the response that's in our head usually something along the lines of "I don't give a fuck". And that's not necessarily a negative response. It's more like a "what is the right answer to such a bland uninteresting topic that not even you really care about, you just don't like silence".... Silence is comfortable to us, mindless chatter is frustrating at best. As far as we're concerned, if you don't have something meaningful to say, don't say anything. Also, we don't own tact or empathy so if she didn't like you, she would have told you by now. We aren't binary with people, in terms of like VS dislike, we have a HUGE neutral zone that almost everybody falls into. Get cozy in the neutral zone. 
2	> Like I'll say something like "Me and Husband went to Event and thought you'd like it" to which she'll smile and nod, no response. Idk what to do in those situations cause she just keeps staring at me LOL, is this an ISTJ thing or...?\n\nMy SO is ISTJ (I'm INFJ) and (granted not seeing the cues/vibe in person in your case): It doesn't seem out of the realm that if I made statement to her like this, she would do something like your MIL's response. The smile and nod is acknowledgement that she heard you, and the staring her is being attentive to additional and more specific information or questions for her you may have to share. The statement in itself doesn't say much by way of concrete or actionable information, in my read of it, and ISTJs like concrete and/or actionable information.\n\nedited to add: If my experience with my SO is any guide, ISTJs are really really good listeners when they decide to pay attention. So present and lucidly engaged. And they might not say much or anything back, but check out their eyes and that quiet incisive attention thing they're doing. They're taking it all in as information. 
2	Im an ENTP married with kids to an ISTJ.\n\nJust don't even try to get along with them. They have 0 social ability. They can't make more than 1 or 2 friends at a time. My wife might just be an extra special case, But she is the most unlikeable, unresponsive, disinterested, nitpicking and friendless bitch I have ever met. But I still have 0 regrets and love her dearly, She is honest and loyal and thats all I really care about. (Looks pretty good to which is a great bonus).\n\nWe have the biggest personality clashes of all time. It is almost like out personalities are so repulsive of each other that they loop around and meld together very well.\n\nBut we almost never fight, That might be to do more with here submissive side but arguments are met with sex almost as soon as they start. I used to think this was unhealthy, Then I realised ISTJ's are actually introverted sociopaths. In my wife's case anyway. They literally can not feel, understand or even experience empathy. They are unable to the core of their being to have a "gut feeling".\n\nI hate pretty much everything about her personality. But we get along so well it does not make sense.\n\nIt is like my weaknesses are her strengths and vice versa. To her I am to up in the clouds and to me she is to far underground. I guess we meet in the middle?\n\n  \nMoral of the story is, You will never get along with her. Because how you socialise and how they socialise are very different things. And although ENTP's are good at making concessions for other people. ISTJ's are not.
7	What good is Si?	What is the strength of Si?\nI'm feeling like it can't beat Ti, Te, Ne, or Ni...
16	- Learning from your life. Si lets you access your experiences to gain insight and live well in the present moment.\n\n- Diligence. Si users are good with routine work and rarely procrastinate. Systematic efficiency is a quality that many people wish to have but don’t. Pay r/intp a visit.\n\n- Health. Si users are in touch with their body and instinctly know how to take care of it. Si users are the first to notice when the air quality goes bad. Si users are meticulous with what they eat and drink.\n\nAlso remember, you are an ISTJ, not Si. You also have Te, Fi, and Ne. You can use all four functions to benefit yourself. You can also use other functions that are not in your stack. You have them but don’t use them consciously.\n\nJung said the functions are just some markers he invented to explore the human psyche. They do not define you.
5	Si is incredibly important for us. It carefully catalogs every experience we’ve had and allows us to draw from those experiences at will. This is really good at both allowing us to remember a specific event and giving us a “gut feeling” that’s usually right (because it culminates several experiences and gives us the answer). Si doms tend to have great memories and attention to detail because of this.
5	In my experience, muscle memory (athletics, martial arts) and ability to rapidly learn new skills have been very handy.  I find it very easy to be better than average at any given skill with a small amount of practice. \n\nAlso, I have an easy time recalling information by association, and that's won me a lot of beer money through trivia
13	Introvert's Paradise, 18x24", Acrylic on Canvas	
2	This is me except in a workshop with as many different tools, materials, and other things as there are books
2	Reminds me of the old Burgess Meredith Twilight Zone episode, ["Time Enough At Last"](https://media.giphy.com/media/mpXrmIpdZNBiE/giphy.gif)).
2	I recently had a dream where I was the guardian of a library full of books and knowledge - like WaChi Tong in Avatar: The Last Airbender.
1	Who'd wanna read all those books? That would literally waste your whole life. What good is knowledge if you're not gonna go outside and use it?
0	Just X-posted from r/art. It rang true with me, just wanted to share :)
14	Do you need sound to get you to sleep?	Probably unrelated to ISTJ conversations but, I think I define myself as an ISTJ. During the day, I just want to be alone and unnoticed with the other people and the outside world quiet. I don't want to see people, apart from the 2 or 3 that I like, I don't want to go out and I do not want any contact with the rest of the world, in a way. I'm not the most confident out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, at night, while I also dislike people laughing outside or loud music, I cannot get myself to sleep without having YouTube or the radio on, or without outside noise such as cars or trains. I also cannot get to sleep if the room is totaly dark.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn a way, at night, I feel safe when I feel connected to the outside world, unlike in the daytime. Maybe it is totally not relevent to ISTJs. Or maybe some of you feel the same way.
9	I think this may be because you were trained this way based on some kind of sound that your parents used to lull you to sleep in infancy. Lullabies, for instance, or maybe music on the radio. Today, kids are likely getting to sleep from youtube videos, and they may continue to do so their entire lives. That's interesting to think about, isn't it?
8	For me, the noise I need to sleep is more because I don't trust that my silence will be permanent. I need absolute darkness, stillness, and "silence" to sleep. Not real silence. \n\nIt can be the silence of continuous noise, but it needs to be certain that nothing will interfere with this until I am definitely, soundly asleep. So I have a variety of sounds I listen to so I can be in control of whether a car horn, person talking, or some other disturbance interrupts my process.\n\nMaybe it's the istjs way of being in control of our environment? I need things to not happen unexpectedly, or I can't allow myself to let my guard down enough to sleep. 
4	Wow.  Never put those things together with ISTJ.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI currently live alone, mostly disabled and working on my computer.  I have a helper come 2 days a month for about 3 hours.  Grocery delivery once a month. Otherwise, I see no one. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also MUST have something on to sleep.  I used to listen to talk radio (70's) until there was nothing good.  Then I listened to comedies.  (90's-00's)  I could never sleep to music.  (It makes me want to jam.)  Now I play stuff on my laptop.  Lid is closed but sound is on.  I have several playlists.  One has over 600 episodes of assorted Law & Order, another has over 200 assorted BritComs.\n\n&#x200B;
4	I listen to pandora when I head to bed, I can sleep without music but I just prefer music over silence 
3	Yes. A podcast playing quietly to the point I almost can’t hear it or something similar. I can’t sleep in silence. Or get to sleep in silence. Impossible. 
3	I need white noise. A fan or my AC
3	I usually can’t sleep unless it’s almost dead quiet. Any noise especially repetitive noises like clocks ticking will keep me awake because then it’s all I can think about. Plus it takes me a while to fall asleep so it’s hard to ignore any noises going on.
2	I need all, or nothing:\n\nI can fall sleep to videos, sound of whatever. Or the light on. Or in the middle of the day.... Or pitch black dead silence.\n\nWhat i cant do is *intermittent* light or sound. Car lights suddenly flash through the window? Im awake. Noisey footsteps in the middle of the night? Im awake
2	I don't need sound to get me to sleep. In fact some sounds keep me awake.
2	I like to have a fan running.  The white noise masks the ubiquitous small sounds that are always present in modern life.
2	I need dead silence. In fact..I can't sleep without earplugs.
2	I tend to have something boring on, something that I've seen 100 times so that I know what's going on without paying attention to it... I find that I keeps the "monkey chatter" away. By monkey chatter, I mean the fake conversations of the things you should have said or shouldn't have said and reliving every mistake you've ever made and next thing you know it's 3:27 and your so upset with your third grade self that you know you'll never sleep again. For me, at least, I feel like having that external stimulation in a time when I'm shutting down my internal stimulus helps my brain from self stimulating without restraint. Idk if any of that makes sense. 
2	When I was younger I found it hard to sleep without some background white noise like an air cleaner. A few years ago I trained myself to fall asleep without it since I knew that I probably wouldn't be able to do that later on. \n\nOn this topic: I do experience misophonia often. All sounds pertaining to eating, whispering, and breathing become unbearable if I'm alone in a room with one or two other people. 
2	In the past, I couldn't sleep without the noise of a box fan. Even the creaking noise of an unbalanced ceiling fan would do in desparate situations. \n\nNow, I strangely prefer the quiet! \n\nHowever, I have noticed my preferences seem to be seasonal. In the summer, I still like the white noise of a box fan. But during winter the quiet is nice. Strange!
4	Familial Troubles	Hi there. My dad's an ESTJ and I'm an ISTJ. After he and my INTJ mom divorced in 2013, he abruptly turned from the rock-solid, no-bullshit conservative he'd been all my life, to a perfectly foppish gay guy who eats up every line that MSNBC and CNN throws out without thinking. I don't begrudge most people who have opposing politics to my own--most of my friends are fairly liberal, and we all get along great--but for some reason, we grate so much on each other that we can't really talk anymore. Do you guys have any idea as to why that might be?
2	It sounds to me like he was lying to himself (and his family) for most of his life then reached a point where the dam broke and as a result he swung wildly to opposite behaviors/beliefs in the ensuing tidal wave of pent-up emotion.  I think I've seen someone talk about how this is a fairly common phenomenon for strict worldviews.\n\nSpeaking of worldviews, he sounds like a regular /r/politics poster that takes his political opinions too seriously.  Actually, he strikes me as the type of person to get his worldview from approved talking points rather than introspection and critical thinking, hence why he spends so much time in left-wing echo chambers (CNN and MSNBC).  The far-left has a particularly bad problem with antagonizing anyone who doesn't agree with them these days so I don't think it's a personal problem beyond an apparent preference to be told what to think by talking heads on the TV.
2	Are you able to have a conversation, about anything, with your father at length without discussing politics? It seems now that people are so wrapped up in their political beliefs that it permeates every facet of their life. Perhaps it would be best if you, your father, and others get their confirmation bias in check if you want things to improve. 
3	Lol the way you describe your father - "pretty foppish gay guy" - would probably be an indicator why y'all are butting heads. C'mon it's the 21st century... Using gay as an insult? 
1	I don't know either of you personally but this is my shot in the dark hypothesis just based on my observations of people.  If I'm completely off base, please, feel free to disregard.   I mean no offense by anything and am merely offering an outsider's take, so forgive me if I'm presumptuous or insensitive or in some way offensive.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI imagine your father might be feeling liberated, in a sense.  He might feel free to be his true self and not feel ashamed or angry or negative about it.  He might also feel like your own views attack him personally.  Maybe his extreme change is him trying to find his place in the LGBT community.  Maybe he feels like he's not getting the support he wishes he could.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI imagine you might be feeling or have felt a sense of shock or betrayal in learning someone you thought you knew is someone entirely different.  It's been some time since all that went down, so maybe you feel like you're over it, but maybe you still have some unresolved feelings about it.  Unresolved feelings might manifest as passive aggressiveness.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth of you having Fi as your tertiary and inferior functions, I would suspect that's the root cause of conflict.  Especially if either of you feels your own values or feelings have been attacked or ignored.  I imagine that would also explain why it's different with your friends; you don't have emotional beef with them.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust a thought.  Best of luck.
1	My guess is unresolved issues from the divorce... Feelings or betrayal, abandonment, feeling misunderstood, unsupported.\n\nSounds like its been so long that i guess its only getting progressively worse. (And im sure the election didnt help things). As much as we dont like to gush about our deepest feelings, ESTJs despise it... But it sounds like its an old hurt you guys gotta face and talk through if you want reconciliation.
1	That's normal. No one is the same in marriage as they are without one. Marriage changes you. He's going back to his old/true self now as he was before he was married, since he has nothing going on anymore. Or it's a "midlife crisis," which is also normal.
-1	Sounds like Te-Hero eating-up Newsfeed without verifying it with Ti. I've also seen an ISTJ do the same with consuming their conservative newsfeed from facebook with Te-Parent and not verifying any of it. Both cases are bad, because if you act that way, then you are just a "useful idiot" who spreads misinformation to their family and friends. \n\nI think you are having a hard time accepting his political views since he did a 180. You are also having a problem with his sexual orientation change, which is understandable. ISTJs need someone who can make them feel safe and protected. A gay liberal dad is not the first image that comes to mind when you think of a protector dad.  \nYou just have to set a boundary with him to not discuss politics. I had to do that with my conservative friend. you can't have political discussion with everybody.
9	How do you accept compliments?	I’ve always had trouble accepting compliments, congratulations, and so on. Like when I get a good test score and my friend says how awesome it is, or when I win a game, or even when people are singing Happy Birthday to me. I always just kind of sit there and smile awkwardly but I don’t know what to do, especially when it’s something I take for granted like “of course I did well, I expected to.” I can’t think of how other people act but it looks so much more natural than what I do.\n\nUnnecessary example: A couple years ago in college there was a robot-building competition between 5-10 classes (~20 students each) for a course I was in. My class was falling way behind and the teams in my class weren’t working together very well either, despite a couple students being assigned as “organizers” to make sure the teams worked together. So less than a week before the competition I (after having finished my groups’ part weeks earlier) got 1-3 members from each group to all meet up on the weekend to turn in / finish their parts and I would facilitate the whole thing. After six long hours of helping each group individually when they were stuck, we finished. We were all surprised when we got 1st place and they all literally chanted my name when I walked into class the next day. I understand why, but I had no idea how to “accept” their cheering and thanks in a social way (just smile? say thanks repeatedly? say your welcome? what?).\n\nHow do you guys act in situations like this where you’re the center of attention or people are complimenting/congratulating/thanking you?
21	Say 'thank you' or 'thanks' and move on. If the situation calls for it you can add on some bedazzlers like 'very', 'so', 'aww' or 'thats sweet of you'
6	When i was younger i used to feel a bit awkward recieving compliments.\n\nI think it takes a perspective shift: when i accept a compliment im accepting that someone admires something about me or my accomplishments, and i appreciate that and thank them warmly. (Its harder when i dont believe what theyre complimenting, and i have to stop myself from downplaying it)\n\nIf people are singing happy birthday to me, im smiling happily because everyone got together to sing a silly song out loud for me and light a cake on fire. i think thats really sweet of them, so that makes me feel genuinely good.\n\nI think in terms of your competition example, a good response would be "thank you. It was a lot of hard wirk - we all felt it. i totally couldnt have done it without the team/you for doing XYZ. You guys were great!". (I always keep in mind that i find no matter how much ppl talk to me about me or ask about me... They really just want to talk about themselves lol).\n\nI think its how you interpret it. If you can find a logical genuine reason why you should graciously accept a compliment, it becomes easier. Then you just have to work on knowing which response is right for which one. And like you said, some ppl just look so natural doing it - well then watch those ppl. If theres something about that response you like better than your own, do that.
5	In my first job out of high school, one of my managers pulled me into his office after a few months on the job.  \n\nI was wracking my brain trying to figure out what I had messed up, and assumed I was in trouble for whatever it was.\n\nNope.  He just wanted to let me know I was doing a good job and to keep it up.\n\nWe had a discussion and he explained that it's important to compliment employees on a job well done.  I tried to explain that as long as I was doing my job correctly, there was no need to make a big deal out of it and that doing so actually made me uncomfortable.  It's not like I was going above and beyond or anything, just doing the work.\n\nIt took a few rounds of that before he finally understood and stopped calling me into his office for random compliments.
2	Awkwardly. Quickly change the subject. At least these days I don't always assume they are being insincere (like I used to).
2	If you can do it with sincerity, let them share in the compliment: "I couldn't have done it without you!"  Otherwise, simply thank them and move on.
2	I used to have a really hard time and would always downplay the compliment, immediately finding some way to contradict it. And honestly, I feel you. I hate being the center of attention and would probably be super awkward "accepting" that sort of praise. I think in that situation, I would try to make it funny. Pretend to take a bow, brush the dirt off your shoulders. But also acknowledge the rest of the group since it was a team effort.\n\nBut yeah, I think it also depends on the compliment. If it's genuine (like you don't perceive they're being fake, which happens a lot pertaining to say... haircuts or just saying something to warrant favor) there is value in accepting the compliment, but still doing it humbly! A simple smile and "aw,  thank you" usually works for me in those situations.
1	It depends on the compliment, but in sum I am really awkward in acknowledging it. If it's about an accomplishment I say 'thank you' because it may seem rude not to acknowledge it. But when it comes to looks, like 'oh you look really pretty today' I just go awkward and not say anything. It feels weird when I'm complimented about my looks... I don't want to get recognized because of how I look, but who I am as a person 
1	"Thanks. (*awkward silence*)"\n\n
0	Look at them quizzically, if you have glasses, over those.\nNod and move the topic on.
40	ISTJ, you are awesome.	Hi! I am a female ENFP with a loving ISTJ boyfriend. I know the internet says we are probably the worst pair ever. But you know what, I love your type so much. \n\nWe are always in the clouds and thinking too much in a bad way. My ISTJ makes me come to earth and acts like a solid Rock that holds me everytime I freak out. He is truthful and loyal. Wouldn't change him one bit.\n\nJust a thank you note to you all :) \n
29	Make sure you tell him all of this and tell him often. He might not react with much emotion or make a big deal about it, but being told that we are appreciated and "doing a good job" goes a long way. \n    
11	I love XNFPs. You all are always so sweet. :)
11	ENFP male married to an ISTJ female. We’ve been together over 7 years now. We knew the challenges going in, and we’ve become more balanced people through our relationship. She’s helped me become firmer in my opinions and decision-making, and I live a much more organized life thanks to her as well. 
9	Tell him all of this. He may not react on the outside (probably smile and say thank you and give you a hug) but will probably be gleaming on the inside. At least that's how I'd be.
4	Oh this makes me so so happy! I recently started dating a male ISTJ (i'm also a female ENFP) and have been freaking out over our differences but this gives me hope! 
2	I'm ISTJ (male) and have been with my amazing ENFP for 10 years this new years eve. \n\nWithout her, I would likely have never left the house. We have gone and seen many places I would never have thought twice about. She makes her dreams come true and it just boggles my mind how she does it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	I've had a crush on an ENFP guy before. Funny thing is we were put together for a group project about the Myers-Briggs and I guessed his personality type and turns out I was right.\nBut I won't lie I thought in a practical sense we wouldn't work. To social for my taste, everyone knows and loves him,  and he had no structure in his life which was frustrating as the group leader. It would be cute and challenging at first but I'd be pulling my hairs out when the honeymoon phase is done. But maybe you guys can pull it off. 
1	I feel you as a fellow enfp female, my life partner is an istj pisces bisexual dude, he’s the best thing that ever happened to me...and vice versa. 
1	FYI we are ISTJs...we already know this.\n\nBut in all honesty, thanks...it's still good to hear it from time-to-time. 
1	Enfp (f) married to ISTJ (m), getting close to 18 years of marriage. I love our combo!! We've had our struggles, but we just keep getting closer. At first I had to adjust towards him in the early years. Then I over adjusted and he had to learn to let me be myself and not a version of an ISTJ. \nNow we understand our balance and we are best friends. 
60	Yes!!	
4	Ron is such a classic ISTJ it’s not even funny
2	I don't mind if I am oblivious about other people's affairs, good or bad. I'm almost always out of the loop. But if you do tell me about what's going on, then expect to hear my opinions on them and expect my advice.
0	Sounds more INTJ to me. ISTJs are very much concerned with people.
0	Greetings, fellow ISTJs! Do you notice yourself supporting extremes regarding politics?	My parents raised me as a Republican. Several years ago, I decided to research Marxism on my free time. Subsequently, I converted my entire political beliefs to Socialist. (Yes, real Socialism. Not the lite version, either) However, back in February, I decided I dislike Keynesian economic theory. (Which left-wing politics share similarities with) Now, I'm an American Libertarian (even more specifically, a socially-liberal, Tea-Party Republican). I am very much a futurist. Therefore, I concluded that government-intervention will only lead to unintended consequences that bring technological progress to a grinding halt. I welcome opposing viewpoints, and am looking to hear other's stories/perspectives on the best system to better the human race.
3	I rarely get involved in politics because I hate how polarizing it has become. I even registered as an independent because of it. It's as if everyone believes ALL Democratic views or ALL Republican views. One of my close friends is a Republican and people shame him for his views - and they're not even that crazy. I may not agree with him all the time but I do try to understand where he comes from.  Hell, I voted for the first time this past election day and one of my classmates (who is a Democrat) told me that my vote is meaningless because I voted for a Libertarian governor, a Republican Comptroller, and a Republican Senator (yea ik they were not gonna win but irdc, I just want my voice heard). \n\n\nI have liberal and conservative views. As for bettering the human race, I personally think we as a whole are eventually fucked, so we may as well enjoy our journey so called life doing what we love and want (as long as we abide by the rules and not harm others, of course).
2	When I was younger I found myself leaning toward an extremist side with some healthy and much-needed skepticism of it, now I find myself leaning toward more centrist/libertarian.  I can agree with talking points of both the left and right wing but mostly find myself aligning more with right wing politics.
1	Interesting. My politics switches back and forth. I guess to a large degree I'm an independent. I have been raised with conservative values so I relate to republican on some of those beliefs. I'm not hardcore socialists but I do believe healthcare should be free and that the US should start working towards very low cost if not free tertiary education. So I'm all for govt involvement to a large extent as Democrats tend to lean. So I'm definitely not an extremist as you are. To be honest I don't even really care about the polices. Character is more imprtant to me, and so that probably the only thing that matters to me politically tbh.
1	I have conservative values but a pretty strong contrarian & independent streak so I naturally drift towards libertarian/conservative ("conservatarian") viewpoints like yours.  It's my belief that government gets less crappy as it gets more local especially since geographical location tends to dictate political views so we'd be better served as a country if we minimized the federal government to providing national security and mediation between states and let localities govern themselves.  It's impossible to get such a diverse country on the same side of anything and swinging wildly between increasingly opposed worldviews every 4-8 years benefits no one so we're better off not trying to impose rules on people that live 1000 miles away.\n\nTo answer the question about extremes, I've never felt drawn to extremes unless you count Tea Party conservatism as extreme (I don't think it is).  Actually, lately I've slowly been getting more moderate, mostly as I get away from echo chambers and force myself to take my views less seriously, but also as I start seeing how people can successfully compromise without sacrificing principle.
1	Conservatarian here. I think the government should take a huge step back and let the ppl think, and do our own thing. No matter what laws they pass, criminals will break them anyway, and the more laws they pass the more criminals they're creating (think California's drinking straw policies). I don't think I should have to get a license to  do most of the things you need licenses for (marriage, bartender, massages, etc) and I don't think the fed is my entitled to 1/3 of my gross pay. I think that I am responsible for my health, education, food, housing, utilities, etc and the government is responsible for those things listed in the preamble of the constitution. I also realize that this makes me an ultra right wing racist homophobic xenophobic mysoginistic bigot even though I didn't include any points of view on those topics at all. But I'm cool with that. 
0	Yes. I grew up conservative and turned into a full on White Nationalist.
1	Which type is good at giving solutions? INTP? ESFP?	
6	ENTJ. Or ESTJ.\n\nTe is good under pressure.
19	How do you cope with group conversations?	I usually sit there and only say something if I really have something to say. I don’t feel the most comfortable in these scenarios. I often feel sidelined.
15	I often feel the same way. I never want to speak over someone, and then once there is finally a moment where I feel I can interject, the topic has usually passed.
8	Account deleted, not worth spending time here anymore.
7	Feel no shame and love the sound of your own voice ^.^\n\nNah but seriously though, through a lot of effort. If it's - for example - a group meeting for work with people I generally don't know I continually track the conversation - who's involved, what's the topic, where's this going, have we beaten the horse to ten deaths yet, who's the wildcard in this group who may at any moment yank the conversation to one side rendering my efforts so far useless and how can I prevent that. I'm mentally wrecked afterwards, but if it needs to be done then it needs to be done. \n\nI've made a conscious effort to learn how to be social, how to interact with others, how to converse in groups, how to consider people's feelings, and it's bloody hard work. Probably the only time it's easy is when you know everyone in the group well. \n\nBut yeah, if it's say more than 40% people I don't know (or don't know well) I'll typically stay quiet, especially if I have no reason to speak up. Plus, what's wrong with just listening? 
4	I can't. That's one of the worst situations anyone can put me in.
5	I often feel like I'm just THERE and not in the actual convo. Then again I process whatever people are saying and then chime in. 
4	I usually take in everything that the other ones say, and if there is room for me to enter, I reply with a concise answer. I've gotten better at pushing my way into the conversation after attending many business meetings with people who talk before they think.\n
3	Depends on the group. If the group has a bunch of more E people, forget it, I won't even be able to get a word in as they'll keep talking over me and each other.\n\nIf the group has those who understand me a tad better, they'll tend to notice when I look like I have something to say, and kind of help me out. I've gotten more forceful-ish in jumping in when I want to say something, but sometimes, if I'm caught where I'm already socially drained to where I don't care, I won't try haha
2	I was at one of my best friends house for his birthday a year ago and he had all his other friends over and I sat the whole evening with my thumb up my ass not saying a word
2	Same, I’m always the one who doesn’t talk a lot, and only talks when I have something to say. But most of the time, someone else will say the things I wanted to say.. so in the end, I rarely talked in group conversations. I always feel horrible afterwards. 
1	Same. I feel it’s a waste of my time, and everybody else’s, if I speak for the sake of speaking and not for the sake of making a distinct point.\n\nThe mystery I still haven’t solved is when people will excitedly tell me they had a great time with my company even though I personally felt like I contributed nothing to whatever experience it may have been since I hardly spoke, if at all.
1	I do just that.. don't say much or anything at all. It doesn't bother me. It seems to bother other people when I am quiet more than it bothers me.
1	I immediately abandon ship.
1	As an esfj,I HATE when I notice that someone is not comfortable in a group setting/conversation. We (people collectively) want to hear what you think about the subject we are discussing. If you don't have anything to add then that's fine too, we want you to enjoy yourself, so if you really want to talk, why not interject something that you are interested in? I know istjs tend to dislike small talk and, unfortunately, big groups tend to offer a lot of that, but quite frankly no one likes small talk. Some people are great at handling it and keeping conversations going, but they are usually just doing it to take one for the team. I mean come on, who really wants to talk about the weather and great aunt berthia's hip pain? You have the chance to be the group-hero by bringing up the awesome show you just started or the weird way that sharks eyes roll back in their heads right before they attack... Just forget how you feel and talk about what interests you, and chances are the group will open up about their interests too. Win-win! :D
3	Unhealthy ISTJs, how do you act?	
21	When I don't feel good, I'm generally annoyed with everything, and am usually not subtle about it, and quite honestly, can be quite a dick about it.  
22	What even is this question?
8	Don't leave the house, don't shower. Bored, can't occupy my mind, but also no motivation to do anything. Depression?
6	I think when my anxiety and depression really start to act up, I start acting in what I like to refer to as a frantic mode. I tend to rush things that I would normally take my time on and store stress in my body more than I normally do. I get really snippy and can get upset at the smallest thing. I personally become hyper aware of my body and my surroundings and will attempt to retreat to places I feel are safe. It's like I grow spines and try and lash out when people really annoy me. I become like an angry snake that just wants to go home, that's it. It's not a good look.
5	Well when I was unhealthy, I was portraying a lot of sociopathic and narcissistic personality disorder traits. Cut off completely from any empathy, extremely manipulative, guilt free, etc etc.\n\nHappy to say I'm not at all how it was back then anymore.
4	Now, I retreat away from others until I get myself together because I know that I am capable of possessing a "neutral evil" sort of attitude. One that doesn't necessarily want others to get hurt, but also doesn't really care if you do. So saying hurtful things, acting out on vengeful thinking, basically throwing away what little filter I or integrity that I have and being a dick. I also know that those "unhealthy" times are pretty short lasting, and the consequences for those unfiltered behaviors aren't, so I hide for a while. I wasn't always smart enough to know this tho. 
2	I will silently resent those nearby like a child until a mature adult confronts me about it. It tends to only happen when I haven't had food.
2	Healthy mode:\ngo to bed early \nWake early\nStick to routines\nWork, study, exercise \nMeal prep\nHave time for relationships \n\nUnhealthy mode:\nPlay lots of video games\nDo drugs\nWatch anime\nSex\nEat unhealthy \nBasically just binge on everything \nHave no time for relationships and people annoy me
2	When I'm in a bad way I become a hermit, eat junk food, have mood swings, and lapse into existential OCD.
1	How would we know if we're unhealthy? 
1	Watch pumping iron on Netflix, Start lifting weights 
1	I don't make moves. 
1	When I'm in a bad way I become a hermit, eat junk food, have mood swings, and lapse into existential OCD.
0	whoa this is the most negative response I've gotten to this question out of all the MBTI subreddits I've posted in.
4	How to be more improvement-oriented?	This is more of a career advice kind of post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo at work, I feel that one of my biggest weaknesses is proactively thinking about how to make things better. For example ideas like "how to automate systems" or "how to make the on-call experience less stressful" are suggested by my coworkers, but I feel that I'm never the one to really come up with these ideas. In fact, I don't really find issues with the status quo because I feel like I'm not one to so-called 'complain' about what exactly is bad about the status quo. I can simply adapt without major issues unless it's an issue I really can't overlook. I'm fairly junior on my team (just over a year out of college), so I don't think these kinds of things are 100% expected out of me, but as time passes I think it's more important for me to be more cognizant of these sorts of things. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOutside of this, I'm a really quick worker that finishes things probably a fair amount quicker than most people on my team. But I don't think that I should be reliant on simply this for career growth. Even my manager has mentioned that I should start thinking bigger picture with respect to our team's product, especially since I've proven now that I can actually **do** things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not sure if this is an ISTJ-specific issue, but I imagine dominant Si users can be prone to this. Does anyone have advice on how to become more proactive and "improvements-oriented"?
1	Have a chat with the other people on your team or business area and find out what their pain points are, and take personal ownership and accountability of those issues. What usually happens is that through observing or listening to the issues they are facing, your ISTJ duty-fulfilling tendencies will kick in and you will internalise their struggles -- which will give you the drive needed to action them.\n\nHave the others will tell you their problems (which is what you are struggling to find), so that you can go find a solution (which judging by what you said in your post, will be a piece of cake).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;

4	I mean, “you can’t just...” already sounds like something to prove wrong 😂
1	I've finally given up on two friends that have always bullied me. Every convo from them starts with 'I want' or 'I need'. One is looking for a ride the other is looking for my wallet. And now I'm the bad guy. I feel guilty about it, but it got to the point I felt trampled. They are both married - they are not alone. I am. I have two out of state children. I've been an accommodating doormat for both of them. They have both thrown me under the bus for amusement. I'm done with them for my survival. And yet I feel guilty.  And they never did - its like their entitled to a 'friend' they treat like an employee they're about to fire. So much less stress, but still some guilt.
6	Ever feel overflow of emotions?	What do you do in that case? Wether in relationships or not.\n\nOne of the things I realized that helps me is writing it all out on paper. (If for someone - they will appreciate it too, since we’re not known to be the best communicators...)\n\n\nWhat other ways do you deal with it? 
12	I immediately take evasive action until all threat of emotion has passed. Don't judge me. 
7	Yeah an emotion dump onto paper can get me going, especially a meaningful letter to a loved one. Some movies and songs will get me too.
6	I process emotions best through music. So I get alone (usually in the car), put on songs that really *get me* or I feel pertain to the situation I’m in, and just cry. And let myself feel really terrible, and let myself say and think about all my worst fears etc. all the things I usually glide right past automatically shoving to the back of my mind, or don’t let myself dwell on.\nI let them out. And it’s ugly, and traumatic.\nI don’t do that very often.\n\nBut it’ll help me get over whatever my problem is.\n\n
7	Supress them the second they arise. If they ate particularly strong music can also help. 
5	I often process emotions best through movement so exercise is very helpful or a written brain dump.
3	But you’re a robot. \n\nBut seriously, I second the person who said exercise helps. I used to write but haven’t wanted to for over a year, so exercise helps. But I also go to therapy.
6	I just go somewere and calm down until they are gone.
3	I use the following approaches:\n\n- Write how and why I feel in my journal\n\n- Play some sad music in the background and cry it all out. I make sure I can be absolutely left alone. I suppress them by distracting myself if I am not completely alone.\n\n- Attempt to rationalize\n\n- Go for a walk or run to clear my mind 
3	I do the same. But I have three methods of pouring it out. Too much feelings can drain so much of myself so I feel the need to release it immediately. One is writing it all out on my journal. Second is jogging with the most eclectic music that could buzz out the noise of my feelings. Third is talking it out to a patient and emotionally capable friend.\n\nBut I rarely feel anything like that tho... Most of the time I feel and FEAR my episodes of no emotions or lack thereof... Like you're numb. You feel happy because you're in the moment not because you really ARE. I don't know how to explain it accurately but i don't ever want to experience such a thing again because I feel empty and blank.

6	How to deal with lack of motivation?	I’m in my 3rd year at college and don’t do homework. My grades pull through because I just happen to be good at exams, but I’m concerned that I have no motivation to do homework at all. I realize that it’s probably for these reasons:\n1) It’s boring.\n2) I don’t view homework as a test of my skills (which I love, because I enjoy exams believe it or not) but rather a time sink.\n3) Doing my homework is an obligation only to myself. If it’s a group project or something I work my ass off and generally need to lead the group so they actually work. But since not doing homework only lets myself down, my morality allows it.\n\nIf any of those three aren’t true, I’d have no problem. But unfortunately, homework is almost always all three. Like I said earlier, my test scores pull me through to pass for now, but not doing homework still hurts my grades. Any tips on motivation for ISTJs?\n\nTL;DR How do you motivate yourself to do something you see as boring, pointless, and only affects yourself?
11	When that has happened in the past with a job, it was because I felt undervalued, like the job I did was pointless, managers were stuck up and mean, I was generally fed up etc.\nI would start being late all the time, wearing sweatpants, cutting corners etc. Acting uncharacteristically, and wondering what was wrong with me. \nThen I knew it was time for a job change!\n\nIs it possible to swap some classes around or change your major?\n\nI also struggle with motivation to stay physically fit, or keep the house non-messy. That doesn’t go away for me unfortunately.\n
2	I struggled with this so much when I was in school. How do you motivate yourself on projects outside of classes? I sometimes struggle with not having the motivation to go to work for various reasons. But I found a big thing that helped me was verbally stating what I had done to those around me. It was more of a pride factor? I'd go one week with no call outs and I could say to some of my coworkers 'I didn't call out this week!' Most of them who knew me and knew that I struggled with coming in some days would affirm me and my 'dedication.' I don't know, but that really helped me. A simple form of accountability. And if you're motivated by rewards, try that too. Set a goal, if you reach it to reward yourself or push yourself to double it.
2	I felt the same way my 3rd year. I started motivating myself by not focusing on passing the class but aiming for Dean's List, boosting my overall GPA (which was pretty low because I had 2 kids, gotten married, and worked part time by my junior year), and getting my overall life organized. Those class grades still mean shit to me 15 years later, but having gotten my chaotic life together enough to make Dean's List makes me proud to this day. Aim higher than the  class. You'll be fine. 
1	I experience this too. Probably my biggest obstacle in life.
5	Personality types and underwear types? (x-post /r/MBTI)	Hello there.\n\nI did a bit of research on that topic, but didn't find anything meaningful (searched through google scholar).\n\nI was wondering if I could find correlation (and perhaps causation) from psychological types to the type of underwear worn.\n\nHere's the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Q0O9FFHmOZKay1ztg9g39iEsP9gjGIYwejsnFrjGZ9Y/edit).\n\nFeel  free to comment on those questions aswell (with your MBTI type  identified) if you want. I figured this sort of survey would be okay  since there was a fetish survey a week ago on /r/MBTI. Hope it's alright!
4	Have you posted this to other MBTI groups? It's funny how ISTJ have 10x more responses than the others :D
1	FYI, I wasn't able to skip the second choice question despite it being "optional".  There should be an "n/a" answer
1	"Underwear showing" ...do you mean panty lines or the actual trim peaking out?
1	Tanga? Wtf is that. 
16	How old were you when you met your SO?	I’m 21 and have never had a romantic relationship or anything of the sort. It’s probably because we ISTJs tend to take things slow and develop a friendship first, and I’ve never lived in one place for more than a few years making it difficult. But now I’m 21, halfway through college, and studying engineering, and the closest I’ve been to any girls is the occasional group project. And being an ISTJ, I hardly make contact with anyone, let alone the few girls in my classes. As such, I’m starting to get worried that I might not find anyone anytime soon. How old were you guys when you met your SO, and how did it happen?
11	Doesn't answer your question, but I feel ya man. I'm 24 and haven't been in anything serious either. I'm also queer so my choices are fewer and farther in between. I'm also the type to not usually make the first move, so there's another loss on that part haha. 
10	INFJ married to ISTJ.  We didn’t even MEET until 26.  Moved pretty quickly after that because we both recognized a good thing.  It sounds cliche but good things happen to those who wait.  Put yourself out there in situations where you can meet someone, and just relax.  It will happen.  You’re still very young. Make sure you work on yourself in the meantime so you’re happy with who you are. 
8	You're still really young so don't worry too much about being in a serious relationship. That being said, college is a great time to be meeting people because you're exposed to a bigger group without any of the responsibilities (for example, dating a coworker in the future). Think about your interests or potential interests and join some groups to meet more people outside your circle! Alternatively, just join the group with the best food at its meetings. \n\nDating for EVERYONE is about figuring out what works over time and that usually means putting yourself out there. If you're into a girl, just straight up ask her out for coffee. (Like, "Hey, you seem cool, would you want to grab a drink this weekend?") Most women will respect you for that, even if they're not into you. And just keep trying!\n\nI am an ISTJ woman and I met my now-husband at 30. There were a few failed relationships before that and lots and lots of missed signs and signals. I think we ISTJs need to be proactively thinking about romance and relationships in order to have it. I still have to work very hard in order to make my husband feel loved. :)

3	My current SO? We met on a dating site earlier this year when I was still 27.  I've been dating regularly since 22 and had my first relationship at 18 though if that's what you're actually asking.\n\nOnline dating is great for people like me who don't meet a lot of new women and hate initiating things in person.  You have to weed through a lot of BS though, *a lot*, and I've been improving myself nonstop over the last 6 years to boost my chances.
3	Met my SO when I was 18. Married at 21. 
3	I am my ISTJ SO's first relationship (he had FWB before me and probably some one-night stands before me, though). He was 34 when we met. We definitely took things slower than what I was used to. Became exclusive at two months, exchanged I Love You's at six months, moved in after 2.5 years, and honestly I don't see marriage in our near future. He told me from the beginning that he doesn't really like the idea of marriage for some reason. 
3	23 here, same situation. I'm not really worried, yet. I've never tried anything at all, I'm just sort of waiting for something. Right now I'm stuck between getting a job, or keep studying. When I feel like I have everything under control with my current life, then I'll start trying, I think. :P

2	I don't know is anybody here like me. I am little bit quite and i prefer to stay at home most of free time (to chat with family, playing videos games, listening to music). I do not romantic in family and my relationship too. Most of times i really crush someone and after the period of times, i talking with her and hanging out i do not crush them and relationship will become to friends. Anw i'm 22
2	I was in my first serious relationship right after high school. We broke up about four months ago, amicably and mutually after almost 10 years.\n\nI recently got into another relationship with someone who seems much more of a match for me a couple weeks ago after talking with them for two months.
2	I am a istj and my current SO is my first relationship. Met online when I was 17/18 and started dating when I was 19. 
2	31. Estp. Dating app. \n\nIt’ll happen. There’s no rush. And the first couple will just be practice for the right one that’s coming eventually. 
2	I met my ex when I was 20 and in college. After not really having friends in high school or much of a social life, I forced myself out of my shell in college and ended up with a fantastic group of friends that I'd met either in the dorms or through the campus LGBTQ group. Ended up at a friend of a friend's party one night, met a girl, became friends and it turned into a 16-year relationship.\n\nAfter we split, I spent 2 years recovering before sticking a toe back in the online dating pool. Didn't make many connections and quite honestly, I found most people to be dumb and not worth my time. I thought that at 38 years old I was just going to end up being a celibate, crazy cat lady. Then, out of the blue, I get a message through the dating site..."Your cute." I almost deleted it because of the spelling mistake, but I was curious about who had contacted me. Turns out she was a bit younger, crazy hot and her profile was much more articulate.\n\nWe've been together now for 7 years, married as of last August. She's an ESTJ, so a lot of the same qualities just a bit more outgoing. 
2	I was 28, he was 27

2	I was 22. We met at church and became really good friends for about six months. I wasn't looking for a SO at the time. Then I went away to college (out of state) thinking I might find somebody serious. It was only after coming home for Christmas and then going back to school that I realized she was what I had been looking for all along--she caught on sooner than I did. We married 6 months later and recently celebrated our 26th anniversary. 
2	When I was 20 I met my ex husband, he asked me to marry him after 3 weeks. We got married 8 months later... 100% do NOT recommend. My first significant relationship after my divorce, I met in April 2016 and he proposed in December. He left in July after relapsing on meth. I met someone the following October and he said he was in love about 4 months later... I ghosted his ass. I wasn't tryna do that again. I ain't worried about his feelings, gotta protect my ow. At this point so don't bitch at me about it. \nAt least with my experience, dating is a bit of a challenge, because I don't open up, but when I finally do, they fall in love whether I want them to or NOT. 
1	I've had 2 girlfriends while in college but now I'm single and have been single for like 2 years. I'm about to turn 27. I feel like the older I get the pickier I become.
1	25 yr old female here and I’ve only ever really gotten intimate with one guy I was friends with (when I was 22) that I though was turning into a relationship, turns out I was just a rebound for him.\n\nI had my first kiss at 19.\n\nNever been on any real “dates”. Like I’ve hung out with a few guys once or twice, but we weren’t really dating, or going anywhere fancy, or doing anything official.\n\nI never really start liking someone unless I’ve known them for awhile. I can’t just start dating a stranger, or someone I don’t like prior.\n\nI have to feel an intellectual and emotional connection with a person to get anywhere with them. \n\nMy history is a long string of guys that I’ve *really* liked, but they either couldn’t tell, or *could* tell but didn’t like me back, OR third option, we were both too awkward to make a move.\n\nI always just kind of assumed I have a relationship and get married one day, but things aren’t looking too good for that right now. \n\nNot that I’m just pining for a relationship or anything. Most of the time I don’t care. It’s just when I start liking someone and it doesn’t work out I get BUMMED about it.\n\nMaybe we’re just all late bloomers! Lol
1	I met my current bf online and was 21 :)
1	I’m pretty similar to you as an ISTJ (yes staring the obvious). I met my boyfriend online playing a multiplayer game. I was 18, he was 20. Been together for 5 years. Honestly talking to people online has always been way easier for me as it does allow me to get to know them before pursuing anything. I obviously wasn’t playing video games with the intention of finding a boyfriend but hey it happens. I have very few friends other than that and I’m terrible at making new friends probably partially due to lack of desire to make any. I think the best way to make friends or meet people for me is find mutual interests like clubs or sports and get to know others who share that interest. It’s tough and I’m just incredibly lucky to have met my boyfriend when I did otherwise I’d be flying solo probably 
1	17, married at 26. ESFJ. She's amazing, but her feelings definitely control her!\n\nWhen I was younger I was told to drop my standards or I'd never find anyone. I'm glad I didn't listen to that advice!
1	Met at 15, didn't date until 23. Married at 25. Now 29.
2	Hey ISTJs - I’m an ENFJ who comes in peace. I just have a few questions	I have a good friend who is an ISTJ. As an ENFJ, I put a lot of time into the relationship, and trying to help the person with their issues. However, I have been dealing with issues of my own, and need someone to vent to. However, I feel that this ISTJ friend would be largely indifferent to my issues, and by revealing my issues to him, we may grow further apart. He previously hasn’t shown too much interest in my own life and struggles. \n\nMy question is - Am i mischaracterising this person? Does he actually care, and ISTJs just act in this way? He doesn’t seem too perceptive to my issues. Do I need to just tell him straight out I need help? Or do ISTJs tend to shy away from these kind of situations?
6	It depends how close you are. If your ISTJ friend really values you, they will want to be closer. \n\nMore over, ISTJs more than many other types, love to complain about stuff, so if you can find common ground things to vent about, that will be perfect :) We're honestly not great at sympatizing, but if you engage our Fi we'll be right there with you!\n\nJust know this: sometimes when you vent to an ISTJ (especially in a "woe is me" kind of way) ISTJs might want to just offer you advice, and not connect with your problems on a feeling level and just want to fix your problem. That can feel really  impersonal... Unless you really want advice, then its great :D
3	A few others have said this, but I agree.\nJust be like “is it okay if I rant for a second?” And go from there.\nHe might need to know where the conversation is  supposed to be going to get on same page with you. That he should engage in listening etc. then you might need to ask him for his opinion to let him know you want to know what he thinks.\n\nI know I for one won’t think of things I should have said, or questions I should have asked, until *hours* after a face to face conversation with someone.\nIt just doesn’t occur to me, even if I completely adore them!\nI have to MAKE myself awkwardly ask questions if it occurred to me in the moment... it just doesn’t come naturally to me.:/\n\nI fell like it’s a pretty “ISTJ” thing to come across as indifferent, by the way.\n\nBut so is being honest and blunt, so just be straight about what you want from him, and he’ll let you know!\n
2	I clearly don't know much about your situation, but most ISTJs tend to be pretty honest and blunt (even if it means hurting the other person's feelings), so your best bet might be to ask him if it's okay to rant.
2	Honestly if someone came to me to talk abut their issues, I'd hear the person out. If he values you and enjoys the friendship, he'll listen. If it was me, I would listen to you rant and offer you advice on how to overcome your issues. I suck at verbal affirmation and when I try it, it just sounds fake and superficial. \n\nWe tend to be honest and upfront, so ask him if it's okay for you to rant.
1	If I was him, you'd know I'd care because I'd listen to you vent then offer suggestions on what you can do to fix it.\n\nOtherwise he's probably not at all interested and may simply be a selfish person or an awkward one that doesn't quite know how to show outward sympathy.
1	I'm a pessimistic curmudgeon, so if my friends need someone to commiserate with them, they know that they can unload with me and not be judged for being a Debbie Downer or whatever. The fucking world sucks, life sucks, people are shitty...come and tell me about your woes any time! \n\nNow, here's the best way to get the results you want from your friend (if he's anything like me).\n\nFirst, clarify that he's available and not doing something else. I don't like to be interrupted when I'm focused on work or whatever. Give me a chance to clear the decks, and I'm 100% there for you. If you text, ask if he has a few minutes to talk because you need to vent. You can also suggest going to coffee or getting a drink. Just let him know you've got a lot on your mind and could use a friend. I'm very protective of and loyal to my friends, so that would be a clear sign shit's serious and you need my help.\n\nOnce you have his undivided attention, clarify that you either need help or just someone to vent to about your issues. If you ask me for help, I'll provide practical solutions even be a little too honest - point out where *you* need to change/fix things. If you say that you need to vent or rant, I'm down with that, too. I'm not gonna react like duuuuuuude, that's so fucked up, OMG!! I'll nod and agree that the situation sucks. I may not have an emotional response, but I am listening, and I do care.\n\nGood luck to you!
1	ISTJs aren’t great at empathizing, but will definitely hear you out. If you want advice, you’ll get it! If not, tell them that you just want to vent and don’t want advice and they should listen attentively. Like I said, we aren’t great at expressing emotions so it may seem like they don’t care even if they do. I doubt it would put distance between you though. Good luck!
1	I've found that people will tell me things I have absolutely no business knowing because I don't respond to what they say in a typical way. You can tell me some OUTRAGEOUS things and my reaction is "oh, OK". I'll hear everything they have to say, without judgment, asking questions to clarify but not offer advice unless specifically asked. I never asked for the sharing of Information tho. 
10	ISTJ and Procrastination/Low Effort Work	Not sure if anyone else really struggles with this, but at this point, it's really starting to affect my professional life.I have a really hard time starting on things that I do not want to do, especially things dealing with college. \n\nA little bit of background, I fell into some really deep depression and anxiety in my junior year after a family member passed away during finals week. I did mostly ok that semester: finished my work, took my tests, gave my presentations. The thing that most struck me though, I remember, was a presentation I gave for one of my classes that counted for a significant part of my grade. I was tired, I'd thrown the powerpoint together maybe two hours before. But I gave a flawless presentation from what everyone said and from what I remember (I zoned out for most of it). The professor gave me a 90. Flawless, except for one thing: I didn't speak loud enough.  I had warned everyone before I couldn't speak too loud as I was sick (spending a week in a state of emotional disarray can contribute to a lowered immune system, who knew!) and my professor knew of my situation. Yet, the way she phrased it one the rubric, *"I know you're having family issues at the moment, but you should not let that affect your presence when presenting,"* really got under my skin. That was the ONLY thing she took off for. I remember calling my mom after class and crying and lamenting to her about what had happened.\n\nI don't know. I've never been one to give 100% percent on most anything as I will get too stressed and overwhelmed. Giving what I can has always earned me good enough grades. I'm a perfectionist, half-assed is usually still pretty good. But the way that presentation when down, something I was under pressure to do in a very limited amount of time, I feel like it flipped off some switch in my brain. After that, I could not bring myself to do any more schoolwork. My grades slipped, but I hobbled through. My procrastination became worse than ever. I would wait until the DAY OF and then attempt to research and write a 10+ page paper, all while sobbing. And then I'd just end up turning in something half finished because I couldn't bring myself to spend another minute working.\n\nFlash forward a bit, I'm now a 6th (going on 7th) year senior who has been in and out of classes and dropped out of more than I'm proud of. I've changed my degree track just so that I could avoid taking more classes and get out with the dumb paper. I resent college more than I can even express. I'm in my final 'class,' which is a pass/fail class that determines if I'm eligible to exit my program. I've had since August to work on my portfolio and I just turned in another half-finished thing. As it's a website, I plan on finishing the last things tonight and updating it before I turn in the hard copy tomorrow. But that's only if I can bring myself to overcome my procrastination and actually do the work I need to. I have NO idea what I'm going to do during the presentation and I'm very worried I'm going to fail again and have to go through all of this AGAIN.\n\nDoes anyone else struggle with this type of disruptive procrastination? Sure, I can procrastinate on other things, but nothing as bad as school work. I have a lot of pressure from my parents to finish college too. I'm so sick of it all. Any recommendations/ideas to help me get over myself and get to work would be greatly appreciated.
1	Commitment and sacrifice are the same. To commit you must sacrifice that which is most important to you which is holding you back. This is the worst part of you.

4	How to spot an ISTJ...	I think my little brother might be an ISTJ. \n\nHaving just in the last fifteen minutes googled 'how to spot an ISTJ,' I'm not entirely sure. I wouldn't 100% make the assumption as to how his mind works. I was hoping I could get some advice from the experts.\n\nI know he's stubborn and likes to plan thing all the time, which fits the internet's criteria. I've definitely narrowed down the I and T for sure...\n\nAs an INTP I sometimes have trouble reading people. Are there any more sure-fire ways to interpret the specific functions? What should I look out for?
13	[deleted]
5	> likes to plan thing all the time\n\nWell he is most likely a J as well. You can always ask him to take tests about types and cognitive functions or just ask him how he perceives the world, through his 5 senses or through intuition
8	Talking to yourself	FYI I also have ADHD, so that could be why I do this.\n\nDoes anyone else talk to themselves a lot (especially out loud, like when you're alone in your apartment)? I will occasionally come up with wild scenarios about injustices that might happen to me with being punished or accused of doing X, and how I would argue against them, working myself up over nothing. Sometimes these scenarios are maybe realistically possible if I were to get into an argument with a certain person, but they usually aren't, since you can never really predict how someone will respond to something; and I just caught myself talking to my myself (and writing "myself twice in succession right there) for the past 10-15 minutes, arguing in my head and out loud against something that is literally impossible (and by the way, I don't think any of my scenarios has ever come true), and it all started from one random thought (which was actually positive/fun in this case). I do think this could be from ADHD, though, like I said.\n\nDoes anyone else do anything similar, like worrying about this impossible worst-case scenario stuff (perhaps when you've recently gotten in an argument with someone, or have a lot on your mind)? Like, do these hypothetical situations bug you occasionally? And do you talk to yourself a lot and work out things/rationalize them that way? I do that anyway, whether it's about something good or about something bad.\n\nWhen I checked (briefly), I found a lot of posts in the INTJ subreddit about talking to yourself, but nothing here, so that's why I'm wondering this. I'm always typed as ISTJ (but usually just 1% away from being INTJ), and even though I relate to both, I have always accepted that I'm ISTJ. I don't really care which one I could be said to be (because apparently MBTI and such is a big load anyway), but I'm just more interested in knowing if there are other ISTJs who do things like this. Obviously there's a lot more to my personality than this, but I guess if you feel compelled to chime in just to say "yeah, you're probably INTJ" I won't mind. But I'm more curious about the "talking to yourself" part.\n\nAnyway...ya, or nah?\n\nMan, I need to go to bed...
11	Yes. I do this ALL👏THE👏TIME👏\n\nI dont have ADD so i wouldnt attribute it to that... I just like to be prepared for everything, i like to know how i really feel about everything... Talking out loud in these scenarios helps with both. Ive recently been venting outloud to in hypothetical situations about my work because of issues on the job. It really helps to work through what youre deeply feeling inside and haven't had a chance to say in person so you dont keep things bottled up and get resentlful. It helps you understand your feelings so you can discuss what you feel more logically when faced with it later
4	Only time I talk to myself is when I wonder how a word sounds out loud 
2	I do talk to myself. Whenever I am studying or doing my hw and nothing is adding up I be asking "iftair what did you do wrong? Okay let's take a step back and look at X,Y,Z". Or I'd write down my issue(s) in my journal. I also mutter to myself often. As a result, my friends and classmates ask me if I said anything to them.
2	I do something similar, when I think of something in the past that caused me anxiety or even something I've made up in my head il actually start cursing myself out loud like 'you fucking cunt...' or il make loud moan/ groan sound. I do have a lot of social anxiety in general so living with this for so long I feel I'm moving onto 'phase 2' where I am now making it up in my head even when there's none around ! OMG I'm a fucking nut case.
1	I do not have ADD or anything like that and I do catch myself talking out loud when alone. I'll just be "talking" to someone else about an upcoming situation. I always stop as soon as I notice because it makes me feel crazy if I were to get caught. Also in public but more like things to remember, things I'm looking for, etc 
1	I have adhd and I’m an enfp but I do this all the time
1	I talk to myself when I am alone. Outloud in the car driving when I'm uncomfortable driving home. But in the shower I'm in my head rethinking about my conflicts and experiences and talking in my head to the people I had those conflicts with.
2	Anyone played Red Dead Redemption 2? The protagonist is definitely an ISTJ.	
1	I haven't played it yet but i have played GTA 5. I do this really odd thing where whenever there's a good samaritan option I always do it. Either sparing someones life or returning their money from a thief. My favorite feature from RDR1 was the bandana that let you hide your identity so no social consequences... Hmm i guess it's true what they say about giving a man a mask and he'll show you his true face. 
0	If the drug caffeine was made illegal, would you purchase some from an illegal dealer?	My father, his friend and my grandfather are all ISTJs and major caffeine addicts. They all believe in the rule of law. I have often wondered about the turmoil they would go through if caffeine was made illegal. Would you, my dear ISTJ friends, break the law to have access to your beloved drug of choice?
9	No. It's easier to stop than to go through the effort of buying coffee off the black market. Might be healthier too.
2	I never use caffeine. It makes my anxiety really bad and aggravates my IBS. I prefer to get enough sleep, exercise, and eat a balanced diet to ensure I have enough energy for my day.
2	I like to have coffee in the morning but I could switch to decaf with no change in how I feel about it. I'm old enough that the only time caffeine seems to keep me awake is if I have it in the evening. 
2	I wouldn't bother... I prefer the smell of coffee waaay more than the taste or the caffeine.
1	Shoot... I can't find drugs now and I dont have the money to buy Starbucks. I would stock up A LOT before they law went into effect so I would have some in storage. 
0	INTP in love with ISTJ. Halp😩	\n
3	Omg what a bittersweet story!\n\nId press him for details about whats going on in his life and where hes at with his ex and current relationships. That will give you a good indication of why he suddenly contacted you out of the blue; ISTJs dont break up their life routine for no reason - something big happened, so hes reaching out and changing things up. Find out what changed in his life to make him contact you\n\nYou can joke about your confession, tell him how embarassed you felt; That alcohol makes you do dumb things; Or, wow you were so silly when you were younger... Bring it up and chuckle about it and see how he resonds to it. Bring it up, and leave the ball in his court. \n\nAlso, ISTJs are not about the chase, or games... They just dont always understand what they want or need at the time. I doubt a chase is all hes looking for.
1	TLDR: I’ve loved this ISTJ guy for 7 years and he seems to like me too. He rejected me in the past for “still being in love with his ex” who he has known since he was 5 and is still talks to. He’s finally not in love with her anymore and shows signs of wanting to pursue me, but they’re still friends. Am I just the convenient option since he knows I’ve had a crush on him in the past? Will I ever be more important to him than his ex who he’s known his whole life? And how do I make a move without making a move?
0	I am an INTP/INFP woman and have been in love with this ISTJ/INTJ man, Evan, for over 6 years. The weird part is we've never dated or done anything physical beyond briefly hugging each other, yet to this day I have never stopped being completely in love with him. Of course I've dated plenty of other guys throughout the past 6-7 years, but no one has truly had my heart but Evan. One past boyfriend even broke up with me when he went through my texts with friends and discovered my secret love for Evan. Needless to say Evan has unknowingly had a paramount influence in my life and has broken my heart more times than I can count without ever even dating me.  I believe Evan is my soulmate and future husband. He recently has shown consistent interest in dating me but I am not sure how to proceed. Here is the backstory of why:\n\nWe met when we were assigned as table mates in a biology lab when we were about 19yo in college. I remember the moment I fell in love with him; he did not do anything particularly sweet or funny or remarkable in anyway; I just remember looking into his eyes and seeing a gentle, non-malevolent soul.  One I could trust and did not view as manipulative or scamming like I had viewed most men at this time in my life. I sensed loyalty and trustworthiness in him that I had never sensed in any other guy and this was extremely attractive to me. But his loyalty had its downside, he was still head over heels in love with his ex from high school and still devastatingly loyal to her. She had cheated on him many times throughout high school, told him she did not love him, and even got a new boyfriend in college, but he continued to fight for her affection at the sacrifice of pushing me away. I remember an instance of this exact sort of betrayal: I asked to borrow a textbook for a calculus class that he had just taken that I was about to take. He refused on the grounds of needing to keep it in case his ex decided to ask him to borrow it. He even went so far as to drop it off at her apartment without her asking to which she responded with a text saying she changed majors and did not need to take the class anymore; he was devastated and texted me immediately complaining about his heartbreak and the pain of how she no longer needs him. I was always there for him to listen about his tortuous unrequited love for her, even though he was inducing the exact same turmoil within me. There have been many instances where he demonstrated his blatant preference for her over me throughout the first 3 or so years of knowing him. I am not sure if the agony he caused me somehow made him just that more elusive and attractive in my warped mind, but I never stopped being completely and undeniably his, even when I was in relationships with other men.  \n\nAfter a few years of being pretty close friends, there was a moment when we were both single (not as rare of an instance for him as it was for me as he had not dated anyone since his high school ex) and thought I had been receiving fairly consistent signals that he was interested in me; looking away quickly when I caught him checking me out, being nervous around me in general, making dinner plans with me and then canceling last minute seemingly out of panic.  I thought he was intimidated by the thought of pursuing me as I am considerably more attractive and experienced than he is romantically.  I decided I had to be the one to make the first move even though this was not my style. One day, I had some wine and scrounged up the bravery to tell him I had feelings for him. This was immediately responded to with a very succinct "I don't view you that way at all" response and he stated he was still in love with his ex. I was mortified and devastated; I had spent, at this point, over 2 years being madly in love with this guy who would still not give me a chance. It was extremely confusing and frustrating because I knew he was attracted to me physically and I had tried so hard to be everything he needed emotionally throughout his post-break up depression. I assumed this rejection marked a very awkward end to our years-long friendship and was somewhat relieved he would be out of my life and I could begin to forget him. But the next day to my surprise he acted like nothing had happened and casually started a conversation about a Netflix show he knew I liked. Our friendship returned to normal and we continued to talk every day and confide our truest thoughts in each other. \n\nThings between us sort of petered out once I graduated and he remained in college. We both got busy with our different career paths and simply stopped communicating all the time like we had been for so many years. I eventually even managed to somewhat get over him (never completely, but at least stopped fantasizing about being with him daily) then somewhere out of the blue about a year ago, he wanted to get food and catch up and ever since then we have hung out more and more. As of now I usually see him about twice a week and he is showing signs of being in love with me; he compliments me frequently, he took me out to dinner the other night and made a point of paying and even directly inquired about my current relationship status. He even insulted the guy I have been dating and stated he thinks I could do better.  I feel like he is being about as bold as an ISTJ could be in this situation of trying to transition between years-long friends to possible romantic partners.  I'm sort of at an impasse because I don't know what to do. First of all, I cannot make any semblance of a first move after being rejected by him years ago; how do I show I want to be with him and only him without putting myself out there again? I also want him to work for it like I did for him all those years because I want to know for a fact that he's truly dedicated to me and I'm not just the convenient choice now that he's no longer too heartbroken to date. Second of all, after 7 years of pining after him and being rejected, I have mixed feelings about actually being with him. Is it possible for him as an ISTJ to truly no longer care for his ex? I have read that they highly value people they have known for a long time and he has known her since they were in 1st grade and they still talk to this day. I am worried his past actions and devotion to her may have instilled insecurity and trust issues in me that may be toxic in a LTR. I want more than anything to have an open and honest conversation with him addressing all of the aforementioned concerns but based on his history with his ex, I feel like this dude loves the chase and any hesitation to date him will only make me more attractive to him.  Patience and playing hard to get might be the most strategic course of action, but I'm sick of games and I'm sick of waiting; this dude is my SOULMATE and I just want to finally be with him already. So, ISTJs/INTJs of Reddit, what do I do?
14	ISTJ engaged to an ISTJ	So I am an ISTJ (29M) dating another ISTJ (29F). We both work in very professional financial roles that require us to work long hours at times. I found that our relationship began to work really well, once we both realized that we have very similar ways of thinking about things and need our quiet time from time to time (though our quiet time has just evolved into snuggling with each other and ensuring we just relax - physical touch is both of our love language as well). We went through 12 strong months of dating and have been engaged for the last 6 months. We have never fought and the one thing that defines our relationship is how strongly we are committed to each other. I was wondering some other ISTJ's thoughts on this because I know how rare same personality type relationships are and all people want to do is focus on the negatives of associated with ISTJs. 
8	The other types will tell you that same type pairings dont work... cause they want all the ISTJs for themselves 😤\n\nLol but seriously, Ive had great relationships with other ISTJs; I'll likely end up with an SJ
4	My husband is an ISTJ and I'm an IxTJ (I've tested as both S and N) and our relationship sounds very similar. We don't fight at all, small disagreements occasionally but it never ever escalates to arguments. We've been together for 5 years and it's been great.
3	I'm fairly certain my current SO is also an ISTJ although I make a point of not actually learning her type so I don't accidentally start seeing her as a product of her type rather than a product of herself (if that makes sense).\n\nIf I'm right, that means I'm also in an ISTJ-ISTJ relationship (roughly the same age) and I feel like it's the exact thing I've been looking for for years.  Screw what people say, we are both so ridiculously on the same wavelength that even only 3 months in I consider her my best friend (mind you, I've long since gotten past the point where my feelings get carried away in a new relationship).  I never have to "translate" the things I can't put into words because she thinks the same way I do.  We're both hyper-efficient about everything and enjoy being ridiculously punctual for social events while everyone else shows up late.  Extracurriculars currently take up a huge chunk of our lives (with grad school/fun classes being common ground there) and find motivation watching each other work hard and succeed.  We're also well rounded enough that our deviations from our MBTI type make us unique from each other and give us something to bring to the table in the relationship.\n\nWe haven't fought over anything, either, but it's only been 3 months.  I hope we find some sort of conflict soon so I can see how we work through it together but I don't know what we'd even fight over.\n\nIf you couldn't tell that I'm super happy with her, take note of how a typically stoic and collected ISTJ just spent 10 minutes gushing about feelings in an online message board.  Gosh, she just left here and all I want to do is sit on the couch and replay my entire day with her in my head.
1	In my opinion almost any personality type pairing has the potential to work well together in a romantic relationship. It can even be easy to get along with someone who has similar thought-processes and preferences as you. I would say just go into your marriage together as prepared as you can be. You don't want to avoid crucial conversations. Make sure expectations are discussed and that you anticipate potential areas of disagreement in the future and how you'll handle them. This advice isn't ISTJ specific, but here is some [crowd-sourced relationship advice](https://markmanson.net/relationship-advice) from author Mark Manson.
1	I haven’t  dated or been attracted to same personality as mine just yet, but definitely considered it after each break up with the opposites of mine.... \n\nWould love to hear if there’s other ISTJ-ISTJ relationship, or even ISTJ- ISFJ
1	I'm an ISTJ female too. Can I be your side chick?
1	I went from dating an ISTJ to an INFJ. ISTJ was less than 6 months of dating, with the INFJ we are going on 2 years. Its an interesting phenomenon. With the ISTJ I felt that we were too alike, but with the INFJ I feel more balanced since they encourage my emotional side. Maybe this will change with age since I am in my mid-20s. 
1	I'm an ISTJ happily married to an ISTJ for nearly 12 years now.  We've had the occasional disagreement,  but we usually work it out, likely  because we know what the other is thinking.  🙄  We also have what I call "alone together time" where he'll do his thing, and I'll do mine in the same room, like he'll watch a movie on his iPad and I'll read a book while we're both curled up on the couch.  
11	Am I the only one like this?	I'm an ISTJ raised by an INFP single parent... Now my questions is.. It's either high high or low low for me? \n\nFor example two days ago I worked on a project part, it had a report and I sat there for 6 to 7 straight hours facing my laptop...Making this thing, perfecting it and it was due on time.. It was a group work but I did the majority nontheless..As usual with all project tasks.. My neck hurt so badly afterwards from sitting in such a position for along time...\n\nafter that for two days I didn't touch anything and just went on social media/games and such..(btw I met sooo may ifnps here..just my luck) I mean if I get on the job i'm so focused 110% and my yield is perfect... otherwise I just draw back into my own, shell kinda? and while at it I just feel so stuffed and don't wanna handle or look at any responsibility..\n\nAlthough I'm more than capabale of doing things, I don't know if i'm the only ISTJ with such extreme cases of drive and laziness... it's like 1 day active 4 days lazy or sth..\n\nI made ways around it by binding myself with people but, it's not working.. these days..\n\nWhat are your thoguhts?\n\n&#x200B;
11	I do this too. I will go hard one day and be very productive only to be useless tired and irritable the next. I think certain types of introverts just have lower energy levels and have to become more aware of how to keep a balance. I practice meditation, meal prep, and maintaining healthy routines like sleep schedule. If I can consistently keep doing my good habits and avoid my bad ones(gaming, drugs, caffeine) then it makes a huge difference in my energy levels and as a result in my relationships.
6	If I don't have to do anything, I don't. When I'm at work, I work hard. When I'm home, I chill. If there's housework i do it as fast as possible, so I can chill as long as possible.\n\nOnly work things I tend to delay is things I'm unsure about. When I feel like I don't know enough about how to complete a task, I tend to wait.
3	Im super productive at work when theres work to be done. And i like going out with friends when someones planned something. But i dont like to have to plan an outing, id rather sit at home loving my down time. And when i get home from work, the most i do is cook, i dont like to do anything elese. I'll do housework on the weekends.\n\nMaybe your high-high to low-low swing might just be you gaining energy for activities, and losing it and so you need to recharge again.
2	If I don't give myself a direction in my own pursuits in entrepreneurship or if I am unemployed I am a drunken mess.\n\nIf I believe in something and I work towards something it's great.  Or if I am at a job that has good leadership, I'm fine with that as well.\n\nIt's about balancing having enough structure and having enough freedom to do what I want now. This is all my humble opinion and life experience though.  College is a complete scam btw lol, way too expensive for the return you get.\n\nWhen I was in the 5th grade I started to just game the system to do the least amount of work possible.  It's a bad habit and I don't recommend it. "Lazy" istjs exist and the typism going on in MBTI is a total meme.  Anyone can be lazy, anyone can be super motivated to move forward.  What matters is the reasons that brought you where you are now.  It is YOUR FAULT to whatever position you have in life right now.  
2	This is true for me too. I’ve realized the past couple of years, I have what I call “work mode” and “chill mode”.\nThe two don’t mix, and if I’m in one mode, I can’t just switch it over lickety split.\nWork mode me is driven, focused, sharp, and more likely to be irritated with people who aren’t taking “it” seriously.\nChill mode me is fun, in fantasy land, a airhead, and more likely to be spontaneous.\n\nMy job is really high intensity, and extremely stressful, so it’s like when I’m not in “get it done survival” aka at work, my brain shuts off.\nI can’t even talk about work stuff in my off time, it’s too hard to switch over into sounding intelligent.\nI think some people wonder how I even do anything, because they don’t see work mode me. Lol.\nThere was one friend’s mother in particular, that just treated me like I was stupid for the longest time... until something made her realize I in fact *did* have something going on upstairs. Maybe when I got this last job I earned her respect. Like “oh she can’t be stupid look where she works. “ \n\nThe moment something turns into a “project” though, than needs planning, work mode me can pop out without warning.\n\n
2	My ISTJ SO is very much like this. He does put things off quite a bit, but when he puts his mind to doing something, he's like a well-oiled machine, going, going, going until it is done. However, doing a lot of things is somewhat overwhelming to him, it seems, because it puts him in a bad mood. He currently isn't working, and he has no problem sitting at home listening to podcasts and watching sports for days on end. I'm an INFP and he and I are very similar in our "drives", although I don't get in a bad mood when I have to accomplish things. I feel good about getting it done. 
1	Im almost always super productive at work, but when I get home, unless there's obvious yuck that I can't live with, I can be thoroughly useless. It's not always a bad thing, especially if I been super busy at work, but it does make me procrastinate a lot of things. For example, I pay my bills at work because I never have the motivation to do it at home to the point that utilities would get shut off. 
5	Post Si music in this thread, I will post some Si music	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEspxEte8S8&list=RDMMkMC6c3cQ2ow&index=2\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tm9WbWLsk&index=9&list=RDMMkMC6c3cQ2ow\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRmtgCKCLAA&index=27&list=RDMMkMC6c3cQ2ow\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVo1jRVe-Qk&index=30&list=RDMMkMC6c3cQ2ow\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aSpPHMnZds\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pidsJX4qgik\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8HeF1_v9-w\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxnqSTzq6-w\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MCDGAqXQZc
5	Its very nice, thanks for sharing. \n\nThough i think by definition, every Si dom is gonna have their very own personal taste in music.
2	[deleted]
1	Umm, I don't listen to music like this and I use "Si". 
1	Am I the only one who is really bothered by songs that are slightly off key or dissonant? Like it literally makes me anxious and angry. I listened to the first several bars of the first 4 songs and they all had the same off putting effect. Is this just a me thing? 
14	When you’re turn super spontaneous but then realize it’s just stress 🤔	When you’re ISTJ 5w6 and turn super spontaneous and fun, on pair with ExFPs and ESTPs, just to later research and realize you’re just being stressed that’s all.....\n\nCan’t I always be like that and maintain sanity ? 🤔😝
4	YES. I do this and think, "wow I'm actually not as bad as I thought" but then realize it's just indicative of how stressed out I am. And then once everyone's gone and I'm by myself, I'm so drained I crash :(
3	If youre insane you wont know any better. So there is that.
2	lol!
2	Hmm I never thought about this. I guess for me it’s right after IM DONE being extremely stressed out.\n\nOnce in awhile I feel spontaneous “just because”.\nLike a few time a year, not very often lol
2	I sometimes spontaneously plan to do something, does that count?
2	Creative ISTJ’s?	Are there any other creative ISTJ’s?\n\nI went to school for Video Production, and currently have a video editing position at a news station, but want to work in marketing/advertising or film one day.\n\nI also sing in the worship band at my church.\nI spend my free time drawing fictional characters, and writing about fictional things.\nI enjoy crafting and jewelry making when the opportunities arise.\n\nWhen it comes to tv shows and movies, I prefer sci-fi/fantasy to all other genres.\n\nIt generally seems like I spend a lot of time with my head in the clouds. Thinking about what I’m going to create next...\n\nHowever I don’t have doubts about being an ISTJ, everything personality wise and relationship wise etc describes me to a T... like I would for sure consider myself a Mr. Spock type character like an ISTJ is supposed to be...\n*except* the part about careers and hobbies.\n\nIt’s all numbers-related things, which is like the one thing I’m *the most* terrible at XD\n\nDid I miss my calling or something? Lol
2	No, personality type doesn't determine creativity or the lack thereof. My wife is very stereo-typically ISTJ concerning social interactions, but she plays bass, knits and crotchets, makes shadow boxes, loves escapism fiction, has filled our house with beauty and comfort, wants nothing to do with math or office work, is every dog's friend and generally makes the world around her more pleasant for her being there.\n\nNever worry about what the tests say about your career choices. I'm an INFP and I am an EMS dispatcher, responsible for organizing and directing a team of 50 people. I constantly have to make hard choices about managing resources and balance the needs of my company with the needs of my personnel. And I'm really good at it. \n\nYou can do anything you feel is important for you to do, for as long as you need to do it.
1	You are too wonderfully complex to be distilled into four letters.  These profiles are interesting, amusing, possibly insightful, maybe even helpful, but far from defining.  \n\nI'm about as ISTJ as the tests can show.  Yet, that doesn't completely describe me by a long shot.  No simplistic "test" ever could.  I'll resist my ISTJ impulse to create a list, but suffice it to say there is much in my life that would not fit neatly into that categorization.\n\nEmbrace your life, your indescribably unique existence, and the glorious world around you! 
1	My hobbies are martial arts and pottery. I spend my days at work doing database stuff so it’s a really good balance for me. 
12	Do you ever feel used?	When a family member or friend asks me for help, and I don't have any plans, I struggle with saying no. Even when I'm tired or in a bad mood, I can't find an excuse for not helping. How can I say that I can't help, because I was going to do nothing?\n\nI do like helping people I care about, but a selected few takes advantage of me. Now they don't even wait for an answer, they just assume I'll help. When I say that I don't want to help for a reason, they start guilting me. Does this happen to you, and how do you deal with it?
5	It's not unheard of for me to tell friends or family that I need an "introvert day" or an "antisocial day."  I've had to explain it all to them at some point, but usually only once, and they get it.  It took less explaining for my introverted friends, because they need the same thing from time to time.
2	I used to say all the time "SOS and so wants me to do something and I don't have a good enough reason to say no". I've learned that my mental health and personal time are, in fact, good enough reasons to say no. 
4	You are valuable. your time is vaulable. what you decide to do with you time is worthy. Everyone needs down time and thats okay. What you need is not less than what somone else needs. Giving yourself what you need will only make you a better person in the end\n\nDont let people guilt you, make you feel worthless, or devalued for giving yourself what you know you need... Even if what you need is just time doing nothing
2	I used to struggle with this when I was much younger.\nI’ve asked trusted family members and friends help me “come up with excuses” that also *weren’t* lies (that’s my condition, if I lie it makes me feel bad) enough times that I can now think of excuses for myself.\n\nAlso through having different high intensity high stress jobs, it’s helped me to develop my own back bone, and say no to people.\n\nIt’s all about positioning how you tell them.\n\nI also really hate being manipulated, which is basically what you’re describing, guilting you into doing something *is* manipulation, and absolutely hating something motivates me into action-I don’t know if that’s an ISTJ thing, or a me thing though.\n\nOn the flip you could MAKE plans before you get back with them, and go “Eh sorry have plans!” I’ve done that loads of times too :)
36	Birthdays	Is it only me as an ISTJ that cannot stand birthdays? The whole arrangement of the day, gifts, unnecessary special treatment; everything. It's super pointless and makes me rather uncomfortable. \n\nIs there a way which I could tell relatives and friends that I don't want any kind of celebration in relation to my birthday? 
17	My family has always just done:\n\n1. Choice of restaurant to eat out (no singing)\n2. Go back home for presents and choice of dessert\n3. That's it\n\nAnything more and I'd avoid it but I love family, food, and free crap so it's not a bad deal
12	It's the fucking worst. WORST. Especially since mine is the day after Christmas. Everyone is broke and tired and burned out from the holiday season. Growing up with family either faking or forcing enthusiasm has also made me shun any type of celebration. I even told my wife that if we're ever out for a low-key birthday dinner and she gets the staff to sing, I will divorce her. She said ok as long as that threat goes both ways. She hates birthdays just as much, luckily.\n\nJust tell your friends and family straight up. Tell them it makes you uncomfortable. You can offer a compromise like requesting your favorite meal to be cooked or going out to your favorite restaurant. Anyone who really knows you should realize that making a fuss is not the way to go. 
9	My ex threw me a surprise party once. A bunch of loud drunk strangers, terrible music...I was miserable and frustrated all night.\n\nMy current partner plans surprises I like. This past bday, she took me on a beautiful hike, made my favorite meal and bought me a book by my favorite author. \n\nMy family has learned over the years what I like; simple dinner, board games and just us. \n\nJust let them know you'd prefer something quiet and intimate. If they truly know you and respect you, they'll hop on board. 
10	Free food, gifts, birthday deals, great excuse to be around people you really like... I love my birthday 😁💕💕\n\nIf youre uncomfortable with something, just *say it* ...its your day! 🎉
4	I'm an ISTJ and while I don't like the whole "sing to me at a restaurant" thing, I love, love, love my birthday and would be happy to have my family celebrate it to the max every year. But alas, I am an adult.
3	My birthday is jut a few days before Christmas. I don’t like celebrating any holidays really and especially none that put me at the center of attention...
3	Birthday issue's aren't IMHO an MBTI thing.  A lot of folks would rather avoid the whole thing (either avoid or turn into a safe-setting bender with friends).  \n\nAs kids, they were great; as young adults, they were still fun, some better than others; but as middle-agers or retirees, they just emphasize that your health isn't getting any better and that's a problem you have to deal with *every* day, in addition to your birthday.
3	yeah I usually get super depressed on my Birthday :(
2	My ISTJ SO doesn't like birthdays at all (his or other people's). I think he's already stressed out at the thought of having to buy me a gift next month for my birthday, even though I'm the easiest, most low maintenance person I know as far as gifts are concerned.\n\nLast year for our anniversary, I spent at least 20 hours (probably more) making a custom Jeopardy game about our relationship. All of the clues and answers had to do with something we both like, experiences we've had, places we've travelled, etc. Then each answer had a small gift associated with it (for example, he enjoys coffee, so one of the clues was about coffee and I gave him a cool new coffee mug)  When I showed my friends, they were blown away by it. I was sooooo excited to "play" anniversary Jeopardy with him. When the time had finally arrived, he was resistant but could see I was super excited, so he went along with it, but I could tell he didn't enjoy or truly appreciate the amount of thought and effort I put into it. He is much more practical when it comes to gift giving, and I honestly think he would have appreciated a few packages of his favorite socks instead. Lol Only practical gifts from now on!
2	I don’t mind someone else’s birthdays even if it’s a big group of people - it can actually be quite fun! \n\nI can’t stand celebrating my birthday with big groups - can’t handle too much attention 🤷🏻‍♂️, but totally cool with small group if we go out or get a cabin by a lake for few days. \n\nBuying OR receiving presents is pointless, annoying, and stresses me out cuz I have no idea what to get.
2	Agreed. I told my roommate I do NOT want a surprise party. Then when they threw me a surprise party anyway they were like”why are you not having a good time?” So frustrating. And then I feel bad because they’re trying to something nice and I am a jerk for not appreciating it. Ugh sigh..
2	Not alone.  My ISTJ brother is the same.  It also doesn't help that he has a bad case of seasonal depression and his birthday is near the end of winter.
1	I don't like them either. But with my family, it just feels like we have a excuse to meet each other. When I have gotten through the gifts and hugs, everyone just forgets it's my birthday and go on like it's a normal family dinner. Then it's fine. I do fear the day I turn 30, I bet my parents have huge uncomfortable plans... :s
1	Rofl, I just had a birthday.\n\nI won't say I despise it, but I definitely don't like them. I like that my girlfriend gets me a lemon cake and takes me out to dinner, but I don't like the randos at work telling me happy birthday or asking if I have plans and all that shit. Like, sure, it's definitely kind of them, but it's not a particularly engaging topic of conversation, and I'm sure they don't actually care about my birthday.\n\nFunny enough, one of the few birthdays I've actually enjoyed was a surprised party, so make that what you will.
1	No one cares about my birthday anyway. I get a happy birthday from my kids and that's it. Their dad expects a full celebration for his birthday for the entire month of February and half of March. We all think it's annoying and dumb. I don't do birthday parties for the kids anymore. I used to but I was so stressed out and nervous that I stopped doing it. The kids didn't notice. I just get them a cake and take them shopping or something. If they want more they have to go to their dad. 
1	im sure most people regardless of personality type can relate to this especially is youre depressed, have anxiety etc.
1	I feel the same about my birthday. Celebrating it is too much of a hassle. I find the idea of gifting ridiculous, not to mention I suck at gifting. I'd simply prefer either chilling with friends or a close friend or going out and exploring the city alone, which I do on a normal basis anyways.\n\n\nJust be honest with your family. I was honest with my parents and they respect that wish since. 
1	Same. Im anti-holiday altogether.\n\nIt's just dumb.
10	What are some books that feature realistic female ISTJ protagonists?	ISTJ male here—I'm looking to understand the subtle similarities and differences of thought that exist between both sexes of the same general MBTI personality model. Since I identify as ISTJ, obviously comparing my own thoughts ~~and feelings~~ (plus—more broadly—those I know to be very _ISTJ_ in nature) versus those that I might commonly find within the opposite sex would be both the easiest and most interesting place to start.\n\nUnfortunately—and I hope I'm wrong about this, but it does seem to me that ISTJ women are significantly rarer than ISTJ men. As a very avid reader, it seems that the only book I can recall reading that featured a female ISTJ character is _The Hunger Games_ trilogy with Katniss Everdeen. So I'm looking for some book recommendations with the target being the realistic portrayal of ISTJ women, and of course I'm open to both fiction and non-fiction recommendations—and if the book is a legitimately good read, I guess that would be a plus, too. 🤔
12	As an ISTJ woman, I don’t relate to Katness Everdeen at all and doubt she’s an ISTJ. I would say someone like Hermione Granger is closer to how I see myself.
2	I like how you crossed out feelings. Accurate. :)\n\nTana French wrote the Dublin Murder Squad. I'd be willing to bet she's an ISTJ, or at least knows how to write books that appeal to that type. She focuses on logic, facts, observations, etc vs dwelling on feelings and atmosphere. (Same for Dennis Lehane books IMO). Definitely check out her first two books. The lead detective in those (Cassie) may be ISTJ. \n\n&#x200B;
4	Yes, Katniss in The Hungar Games... Also Susan in Narnia; Miss Perigrine in Miss Pergrines Home for Peculiar Children; Elinor in Sense and Sensibility
3	Katniss seems more like an ISTP to me and Hermione Granger from Harry Potter is quite close but I thought she was an ESTJ. Maybe Susan Pevensie from Chronicles of Narnia or Elinor from Sense & Sensibility but then it depends on whether you can consider them protagonists or not.\n\nOther non-book examples of ISTJ women: Dana Scully from X-Files, Temperance Brennan from Bones.
2	I'm not good at the typing other people thing but [16 personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality) says Hermione Granger and Dana Skully (though not a book character) are ISTJ.  I can kinda see Hermione being one.
1	Kind of an odd choice, but Hannah Baker from 13 Reasons Why.
1	ISTJ females *are* very rare. The majority of characters I relate to are men XD\n\n I would peg Katniss as a very immature or unhealthy ISTJ. (Which with her background it’s not hard to see why)\n\nOne female I relate to *strongly* is Dana Skully from X-Files. She’s also officially typed as an ISTJ.\nI think there are X-Files books? 
1	Not a fictional character, but Candice Neistat (Casey’s wife on youtube) is an ISTJ. RBF is strong with her, she catches so much shit about it in the comments. I just want to scream in the comments... “it’s okay you guys, she’s an ISTJ, they all have aloof eyes!!” Haha 
10	Female ENFP sex with ISTJ male	I have never dated an ISTJ before. I was hotly pursued by the man in now dating. He fits ISTJ description perfectly.  I blew him off over and over until his persistence paid off. I realized after some time, that this guy is amazing...i just didn't understand his lens on life. We just started officially dating, but I think he's pretty awesome. \n\nWe have been together 3 times sexually so far. I can tell he is very attracted to me, and yet he seems hesitant to even touch me in bed. I am very expressive and comfortable sexually. I'm used to partners kissing everywhere, touching everywhere..without reservation. It's almost like he is a bit paralysed and stuck when we have been together. \n\nI like this guy. A lot. Oddly, for the lack of input on his part physically..the sex is still really good. I'm just initiating almost everything. \n\nIs this nerves? Am I being too forward? Will it just take time? I want to please him and be his sex kitten ;) (spoken like a true ENFP). Thoughts? \n\n
16	Sounds like a lack of experience; Hes just trying to be nice. Im not saying he lacks sexual experience overall, but does lack it with you. ISTJs approach anything new with caution until we master it... Then we're confident and take control in that domain.\n\nMy advice would be encouragement: clearly communicate what you love/ want more of.
6	ISTJ, married to an ENFP for over a decade here.  First off ISTJ can pursue relationships, after we decide that is what we really want.  I do choose first though, before engadging in my experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSex with my ENFP was great.  As an ISTJ I began to feel a duty to fullfill her needs in and out of bed, so once my full effort was behind it, it was extremely good.  she was the wilder one at first of course.  And still has certain kinks that may not necessarily be mine, but chemistry was great once we got going. Talking about what you like some time away from the bedroom is likely a good idea.  ISTJ get much more comfortable with things as we get experience with them, and with certain people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust remember, duty, experience, logic when communicating with the ISTJ.
3	 We aren't super expressive to begin with and so the combination of a lot of sensory input coming and enjoying the hell out of it, it can be hard for us to remember to return it.  Often returning many of those gestures is going through the motions or following what your doing, not because we aren't interested in our partner, but because it's just not something that's natural for us to do. Hell get smoother in that department once he really learns your style. Then hell be a lot more fluid with returning those gestures and even initiating them. He just has to learn that part of you.... Also, tell him what to do. We like that. We're blunt, we don't take hints, body language is difficult to understand. We like words and instructions. 
3	Personally, I'd be nervous/hesitant to touch someone due to a combination of lack of experience and I don't know how my partner would react. Whenever I am at a party I always ask "wanna make out?" or "wanna kiss?" before doing it. I tried looking for any verbal cues (though I suck at that) but the room's dark and I don't want to surprise the girl like that.\n\nLast thing I want to do is cross over a boundary and end up retracting and apologizing.\n\nOP, it'll probably take time, lots of clear communication, and practice. It seems to me that he is hella attracted to you; he just does not want to disappoint you or make you feel that your needs are not being fulfilled. Be direct with them. Tell him what you like and want. If he is doing something great, tell him! Eventually he'll get it and be comfortable enough.
2	ISTJ female here.\nHe might be crazy about you and so that makes him really nervous, and so rather than stating aloud ‘I’m really nervous right now, wow this is amazing, ah all my insides are gonna burst with excitement’, he just shuts down a bit?\n\nI had a really weird reaction to a first kiss one time, and I *really really* liked the guy, so I should have been ecstatic, but I got so overwhelmed because he was amazing that I psyched myself out and couldn’t even react like a human. Like I locked up and couldn’t talk. It’s hilarious to even picture, he broke me for like several minutes. And it freaked him out how I reacted, it took several days of talking it out before we had a re-do. XD 2nd time much better, and everything after that lol. I didn’t even react like a weirdo either. But my brain was still screaming the whole time I was just blocking it out.\nThat’s the only guy I’ve ever reacted like that with , it’s like I wasn’t prepared for him to do that ...so I’ve no idea what happened-except I was crazy about him. \n\nOr your man could just lack experience. Or both.\n\nI know I also overthink touching people, like, I don’t want to be WEIRD. So I chicken out.\nI also don’t trust myself in reading people, so I usually don’t initiate, out of fear that they won’t react well.
2	There isn't a chance an ISTJ would "hotly pursue" anyone...another reason these forums can be so frustrating & mis-informed when people think they can guess without actually testing (unless you're a legitimately tested INFJ doing the guessing, lol).
-5	This is why rape culture exists. Women occasionally reward men for being persistent, by teaching men that “no” does not mean no.\n\nSeriously, OP, you need to not do this in the future. 
-2	 >I blew him off over and over until his persistence paid off.\n\n\nFuck is wrong with people? Can't you be straightforward if you do or don't like someone? \n\n\nAll this says is, I don't have any desires or standards of my own, all I see is persistence and anyone with enough persistence can get into my pants. 
26	ISTJ reaction to first liking someone	Is it normal, as an ISTJ, to completely deny (to yourself) that you have started to develop feelings for someone in the beginning?\n\nI do this whole, wanting to flee the country and never speak to them again, thing.\nThis, alright yeah maybe I have a teensy weensy baby crush on them, but I can mostly block it out, thing.\n\nThen something happens to make me fall hopelessly “in like” with someone, and thoughts of them fill my head, and I go a little bit crazy, like it’s Pon Farr, and my whole “mission” becomes THEM.\n\nCalculated moves and all that, it’s like communication from them is the only thing that gives me life.\n\nThen whatever the outcome, I usually start wanting to avoid them at all costs, and deny my own feelings AGAIN because the next steps are just much too traumatic for me.\nEven if it’s good and they want to have some sort of relationship with me.\n\nIt’s like I don’t WANT to like someone, because the whole thing is just such a rollercoaster that never seems to play out quite right anyway.\n\nI hate feelings, I’d rather not have to feel anything at all, ever.\n\nIs this a typical ISTJ thing? What are your thoughts?\n
10	I feel the same way :/
4	As there is no guide book on love, I think I would react similarly to your reaction. Feelings are unpredictable and things don't go as planned. However I haven't had any romantic feelings for anyone since Jr high so I can't confirm what my reactions would be. 
3	Not sure this is something that *only* ISTJs (like us) do/feel/experience, but it does sound like a defense mechanism to avoid re-living previous crushes that ended very badly.  When we start to feel attraction, we fear the pain of failure/rejection and start to toughen ourselves to mitigate what we see as impending (emotional) damage.
3	I guess I tend to ask them questions to try and learn more about them; which many people don't feel comfortable with (not surprisingly).\n\nI kinda wish people would be less afraid of being judged and more brave and outspoken about who they are and what their story is. If I'm going to fall in love with someone, it's important to me that I know who I'm falling in love with after all
3	100%. I do this all the time. When I try and describe this to my friends, they just don't get it. I get anxiety attacks over this crap. It's really debilitating and I wish I could turn off my feelings like a switch lol.
2	Are you a girl?
2	You just described the last 13 months of my life. I'm not sure that it's exclusively an ISTJ trait, but you're certainly not the only one. I even went as far as dating/sleeping with other people to convince myself I didn't have those feels. I ended up feeling guilty every time, as if I'd betrayed the original person I fell "in like" with.
2	Yup! It’s like there is no such thing as CASUAL crushes.   It’s all in! I thought I was the only one! :) \n\nIs this specifically an ISTJ thing though?
1	Yikes 
2	I'm in ISTJ shadow mode right now and want to strangle my ESTJ boss. ISTJs, I need some advice on how to handle ESTJ	
8	Insufficient data.  Until more data is available, my suggestion: Let the Wookie win.
5	LPT - when you're feeling frustrated, just strangle the person who's causing your stress.
2	Take some full spectrum CBD oil and see how you feel lol.  Maybe take a step back and ask yourself why you are feeling this way.  I think some self introspection is in order.
2	I’m an ISTJ and my dad is an ESTJ. They just want submission. Do not talk back. They are always right. Do not offer your ideas. Say yes sir and nothing else. If your boss is an idiot I’d say find a new job because you will always have trouble taking orders from an incompetent person.
1	What's going on with your boss? My wife is an ESTJ, maybe I can help.
16	Regular diet question	I eat almost the exact same thing every day. It makes shopping and meal prep a breeze. I feel great most of the time and my doctor is very happy with my numbers.\n\nDoes anyone else here behave this way? I'm genuinely curious if it's part of our personality trait(s) or if I'm just as weird as I think I am.\n\nCheers.
9	I like variety. There's some things I like routinely, especially breakfast. But dinner is always some thing different. I like browsing recipes and stuff. I also enjoy cooking new things. I try to restrict what I eat to lose weight and I can't do it. 
6	I’m the same. I prefer to have as little change in diet and other areas as possible. I refer to it as “minimizing decision-making”, but it really does make life easier. 
3	Your first function is Si: if it worked before why fix it, the tried and true methods, consistency. ALSO, it does one more thing- it allows one to feel the sensations of the inside of the body. This ability allows one to eat just what one needs to eat, know when to sleep, etc. \n\nIn conclusion, all of your functions essentially run through the Si perception, as it’s the first function, which allows for consistent results- including dieting.
3	I usually buy things at sale, so I stock up, and eat the same thing for a while. Then I stock up on something else the next time :)
2	I'm the same. I'll make a small batch of food for supper and eat that for four or five days. Breakfast and lunch are always the same. 
2	I typically eat the same thing for breakfast and lunch every day, dinner is where it varies. 
2	A few years back, I used to work in a place where I had plenty of lunch options.  I found an Arby's that was easy to get in and out of, so I'd eat there 2 or 3 days a week.  I got to be such a regular that if the cook saw me coming in, he'd start making my order before I ever placed it.  He confused more than a couple of cashiers by putting my order on the counter before they had even greeted me.\n\nA cashier at one of the local QuikTrips I frequent tried to convince me to shake up  my routine by not getting a Barq's and a 3 Musketeers.  I obliged him and got a KitKat instead, but I still got the Barq's.\n\nIf anyone brings it up, I tell them I'm in a groove, not a rut.
2	Okay same. I will eat the same things and try my best not to change it, I usually mix up spices and and carbs. 
1	I don't eat the exact same thing every day, but I do identify with your post because I have a routine that I typically follow. What qualifies as the "same thing" for me are the items on my shopping list. I keep the shopping list in digital format on my phone and the only thing that changes is sometimes adding a product I want to put in my regular rotation. \n\nSo every time I go to the store I work off the same shopping list. However, I only buy the items I need or am out of (aka unchecked items on the list). So I eat a lot of the same items but I have enough variety that I'm not eating the same thing for every meal every day. 
1	I eat the same breakfast everyday, as well as 3 servings of whey protein. Monday - Thursday lunches and dinners are the same, but change every week. Friday lunch is 4 oz of chicken breast and a bag of frozen veggies, and dinner I eat out. the weekend is whatever my girlfriend I feel like cooking.\n\nI like it.
1	Entirely the opposite. I have a rule that I won't make the same meal twice. Every night is a new food experience.
1	That would be so convenient; but itd drive me crazy. I love to be creative when i cook. I have some go-to dishes that i like to remake, but if i ate the same thing everyday, thatd be tourture... I love to taste and experience!💕
1	I do the exact same thing lol
1	I have about 10 meals I consistently rotate through. I like it that way \n\n&#x200B;
3	Another query about my ISTJ love interest.	I have a question regarding my ISTJ. I have been trying to be friends with him for awhile now, and have gathered the feeling that he is interested in me in a more romantic way. A few weeks ago, I finally got the courage to ask him if he wanted to go with a group of mutual friends and I to dinner. He told me that he would like to and he would text me his schedule. He ended up typing my number in wrong, and about a week later, he asked me about it, and it was corrected. That next day, I texted him a couple of possible days for the gathering. I gave him a couple so he could choose which one works best, and I asked him to let me know. I never got a reply back, and its been over a week, and whenever I see him, he seems to act weird. He will say hello to me if I walk past him, but I have been avoiding eye contact because of my own anxiety. The questions are: How should I proceed from here? [I don't want him to think that all I wanted was his number (if that were the case, I would have just asked for it.)] Did I do something wrong? (I know he has been going through some stress lately, but I don't understand why he would just ignore my message.) Thank you in advance.\n\nEdit for accuracy.
11	He's being immature, this has nothing to do with the ISTJ personality. We are, as a rule - very much straightforward, even to a fault (like being brutally honest to the point where someone's feelings are hurt).\n\nJust ask him directly if he's into you, you'll save both of you a lot of heartache.\n\n&#x200B;
5	Go up to him and ask if he has time to talk right now.\n\nIf he does, say something like "Hey, I texted you a couple of possible days for that dinner we talked about but I never heard back.  I want to make sure I didn't goof on giving you my number again.  Can you check the number I gave you again?"  Verify that it's right and then say "That should be right.  Can you send me a text right now just to make sure it's working?"\n\nOnce that's sorted out, say "Great!  Hey, since I have your attention right now, what would be a good day and time for you to do that dinner?"\n\nDirect but polite, and if he gives you something about having to check his schedule, don't pressure.  Just be like "Cool.  If I don't hear from you in a couple of days, I'll send you a text as a reminder, if that's OK."\n\nOr, you could just skip all of the other stuff once you verify he has time to talk right now and say "Hey, I know we talked about that dinner, but I never heard back.  If you don't have time to do it, that's OK.  I just need to know one way or another so I can plan."
1	Im the master at ghosting ppl. I may start having an interest in someone but then if I lose interest because of a turn off or becoming more interested in someone else, etc. I just stop dealing with them. I don't have to be nasty or anything. I just ignore them. If they don't get the picture then I'll tell them, but I don't like explaining myself, especially when feelings are involved. 
4	How to tell ISTJ I don’t want him to go abroad with me?	So I (INTJ) and two friends (ENTP, ISTP)are going to the UK this New Year to visit friends. Now there’s a third ”friend” (ISTJ)whom I honestly can’t stand being around for various different reasons. He’s simply one of those obnoxious people who drains you and just lowers your mood by just being around. And it doesn’t make it better that at times you literally have to act as his personal caretaker.\n\nFor the last year or so we haven’t had the heart to actually not ask him when we’re going abroad or something similar, as he lives with one of my friends it would completely break him if we would go do anything without him. \nHe literally got mad at his room mate (ENTP)for going to see one of his friends without asking if he wanted to go with him.\n\nSo now yesterday we were looking for flights when he weren’t home, as we planned to just book it without his knowledge. But then he comes strutting in through the door and asks what we’re doing, and sees the booking site on the screen. Now today he’s spamming me on messenger about going to the UK.\n\nNone of my friends wants him to go with us, and I’m honestly thinking of skipping UK all together if he’s going there with us. \nNow that we’ve spilled the beans, how do we tell him we can’t stand him being around, without completely destroying him?\n\n\nHere is a thread I posted little over a year ago that explains what kind of person I’m dealing with.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/6z40sl/how_to_handle_istj_friend/\n\nEdit: The difference as of now compared to my older post is that the only reason I even spend time with him is because he lives in the same apartment as one of my better friends. I honestly feel I don’t need him in my life anymore.\n\nEdit: Earlier this year I went to Madrid to watch football with a friend (Whom he had never met), and quite unambiguously told him I didn’t want any other friends with me, as this was a football trip (He’s completely uninterested in football). He proceeded to buy a flight to Madrid anyway.
19	How to tell an ISTJ something? Just literally say, “I don’t want you to come on this trip.” You don’t *have to* be friends with this guy. You say you don’t know why you keep him around other than he lives with one of your other friends, so set some boundaries with him. This issue literally has nothing to do with MBTI, it’s a communication and interpersonal thing. Communicate clearly with him what you want and stick to the boundaries you set. Not everyone is going to like everyone else and that’s okay! It’s okay to tell someone no and let them know you don’t want to be around them that much. Be clear, be honest. 
10	From the way you desscribe him and his behavior, he doesnt seem very ISTJ at all. When we know we're not wanted, we sure as hell don't stick around... Like, id have moved out and away from your group a long time ago; Not kept on trying to insert myself where i dont feel welcome.\n\nIf i were you i guess id just tell him point blank. This person doesnt seem to care that they are being rude or pushing through your boundries.\n\n
7	Regardless of what is personality type is, it doesn't found like you or your friends been a grown ups and told him, "sorry, but you're not invited". 
5	Sounds like a really insecure/immature ISTJ, but regardless, I’d just be direct. It’s not a fun convo to have but if you really want to go to the UK without him, you’re going to have to tell him. 
3	People seem to automatically think whomever they dislike is an ESTJ/ISTJ.\n\n I agree with some of the other posters here: as an ISTJ  I'm very aware of how people percieve me. We are extremely selective of whom we associate with.\n\nIf this person was an ISTJ, they would have clear boundaries and cut your sorry passive-aggressive asses out of their lives a long time ago.
2	ISTJs appreciate straightforwardness and honesty and can't stand when people beat around the bush.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou just gotta tell him. No sugar coating. 
2	Say "Hey, dude, I don't particularly like you, and I don't want you to go on this trip with us."?
2	If you bring him along with you and he picks up on the fact that he is unwanted/invited merely out of guilt, it will hurt him a lot worse in the long run.  A common ISTJ fear is being deceived and not understanding what is *really* going on.  It will hurt him (and you) either way, but please keep in mind that some ISTJs can develop extremely severe trust issues... and if he already has such an issue, you'll actually be confirming his deepest insecurities by stringing him along, which is one of the worst things you can do to an introverted sensor.
1	Lol, I (INTP) completely relate. Have been on a few trips with an ISTJ mate and he is unbearable. Has a sook every time someone wants to do something that isn’t what he wants to do. 
7	ISTJ's: Do you consider yourself to be romantic?	I know everyone has a different definition for "romantic," but I am wondering how many of you ISTJ's consider yourself to be romantic? If you have a SO, would s/he consider you to be romantic? How do you "romance" your partner? And does it come naturally, or do you have to work at it?
15	no, I wish I could be more romantic sometimes 
12	I dont think of myself as romantic. I tend to get that sort of feeling off of things that are probably not co sidered romantic. Laughing and carrying on at dinner. Watching my SO work on something in the garage while he shows me what how and why stuff works. Watching Netflix before bed making snide ass remarks about whatever were watching. Sitting in the same room doing our own thing but being together, etc. Those sorts of things are what romantic type bonding feeling.\nDoing a typical quiet dinner and movies type date with flowers and stuff is like "let's formalize the three or four hours before we have sex". Id rather just boink my guy in his garage. Way more fun! 
7	My ISTJ husband isn't the textbook romantic but as someone stated before it is the little things that he does that I know is him being a romantic in his own way: The texts to let me know he's thinking about me, taking care of me, giving advice, and the like. I think it shows the most as well when we can just sit and cuddle for hours without saying much if anything at all, I know that might sound odd but I find those moments the most romantic, haha! 
5	We're not romantic (adjective), but ironically are by far some of the most hopeless romantics (noun) when it comes to relationships.
6	Not a romantic.\n\nIf it was important to my partner, I would make an effort.\n\nLuckily for me, it isn't. 
5	Not romantic at all. In fact, talking about feelings makes me terribly uncomfortable. I have to make myself be affectionate because it does not flow naturally. I like to just get to the point so a lot of flowery prelude and rose petals just impede that process. It’s the equivalent of small talk, which I think we all hate. 
3	Nope, not romantic.
3	My ISTJ SO isn't romantic, and I'm okay with that most of the time because I love him and know that's how he is. Sometimes I do miss thoughtful gestures, though, even if I don't need them. 
3	Remembering stuff and putting in an effort for things she likes. 
3	Not romantic but I am thoughtful
3	I consider myself very romantic. But then I consider practical help in a crisis emotional support so I don't think that my wife agrees.
2	A bit of the romantic, I like giving flowers and chocolates. Very traditional stuff
2	Not particularly. I like to think I'm thoughtful though
1	Honestly no. I’m no good at flirting or being romantic. They make me feel silly, I don’t think other people are silly for doing those things, but it makes ME feel silly to attempt. It’s an awkward mess.\n\nI’m not sure what to do with myself when presented with flirting or romantic gestures either. I recognize that it’s happening, but either fake-react or pretend it’s not happening.\n\nThe only thing that might be perceived as romantic, is that I’m good at remembering small details, and get enjoyment out of giving someone a thoughtful gift or moment. I live on other people reactions!\n\nI also enjoy witty sarcastic banter, and I substitute that for flirting most of the time, because  I CAN’T DO IT.
1	No... My friends tell me that I am too dense. Sometimes, I wish there is a manual or reading material on how to actually transfer my emotions to romantic actions
1	No, I understand the idea of romance, but most of it is too cheesy for me. (I hate chick flicks and I'm a girl.) Romance has to be really subtle and genuine for me to appreciate, but I can't pull it off to save my life.
2	Istj friend keep giving me the cold shoulder for no reason. Any advice?	(I'm an Isfj.)\nMy istj best friend, sometimes just give me the cold treatment FOR NO REASON at all. I have confronted her about it, and she told me it's because "she's just in that mood sometimes". that is not an excuse to give me the cold shoulder. She has told me that I haven't done anything wrong.\nShe just gets tired of people, even her friends, and starts finding them annoying. Then this phase will fade away. And then it starts again. \n\nNow she has been doing it again, walking away from me, avoiding eye contact COMPELTELY, not even looking at me. I may not have the right to say this, but I think she's an immature istj. She doesn't verify knowledge she picks up.. oh, well that's not what I wanted to talk about.\n\nI have been loyal to her, I am always loyal to her. But when she is being like this, I lose respect for her. I have now come to a point where I don't care, I haven't done anything wrong and she needs to solve this. From past experiences,  I know it is NOT a good idea to ask her if she's okay. I know this will fade out too. But could any of you come to think of ,, maybe why she's acting this way? (she is the most complex person I know.) \n\nThank you in advance.\nupdate: thank you evryone for the great replies! you guys rule:^D
10	I do have the same tendency to get tired of people but I've never avoided eye contact or walked away from someone. This sounds really extreme and there should be some other reason. Confront her about it, we usually appreciate directness. Don't ask is she ok but ask why is she walking away from you, that phase shouldn't be that severe. Of course it could be nothing related to her being ISTJ and could be her just being a bitch or having some deep psychological issues. 
3	I get that way too... Usually when I have a lot of emotional baggage to process. I probably need express it, but as an ISTJ that's NOT going to happen. So I withdrawal from ppl for a few days and get myself together. It's not something for anyone to take personally, it's just how we process feelings and stress. Alone.\nIf you want to be helpful, send a text asking if she's OK. She will tell you yes regardless of what the truth is, but that text means sooooo much. And that's something that helps me get out of my funk. Knowing that somebody notices my absence. It motivates me to get myself together and get back in the game.\nThis happens most often when I'm dealing with a lot of anxiety or hurt feelings. And the withdrawal isn't person specific, it's all the people.

2	Sometimes ISTJs need space and it doesn’t sound like you’re okay giving your friend that distance when they want it.  She may be actually upset with you causing her to avoid eye contact but she doesn’t want a direct confrontation. \n
2	You may not have done anything wrong. You may be an awesome friend. It’s not really about you.  It’s hard for ISTJ’s to get those feelings out, and it can definitely feel like they are being immature but it’s just how they are and something you have to work with if you want to be friends. If you really care and want to keep your friendship going just give her some time and space. Maybe message every so often to let her know you’re thinking about her. She’ll eventually want to come back out of isolation.
2	Im so sorry youre going through this. Its likely a personal problem with your friend, but ots also sad that they wont talk to you about it - thats what best friends are for. \n\nI can get tired of extroverts, but as introverts, we usually dont tire wmeach other out before needing to part any ways. I cant imagine youre being too overbearing. \n\nYoure right: theyre being immature. In the meantime, i would put your positive energy into other, healthier relationships and let your friend work out their issues in their alone time.
1	In my own friendships that I have made in the past, most of them end up as the friend and I growing apart, but most of the time its my fault. I almost see it as they aren't good enough to be my friend (Yes I know this sounds very selfish, but its who I am). As of right now, I don't have many friends because of that reason. I like to find people who seem compatible with my personality (not just their mbti). Personally, I prefer people who are smart, but not smarter or dumber than me. It just creates a good balance if they are about the same intelligence level as me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(I'm sorry for sounding so selfish, but its just the way I think)
4	Any How-To Resources for Living Life?	It's a darn shame there's no official guide on how to live life but at least the internet gives me the next best thing. I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask this sub for any resources that might benefit me. \n\nOne of the best examples would be [Learning How to Learn on Coursea](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).  The course is linear with many great techniques that can be easily followed and repeated. On top of that they give reasons why it works and why you should do it too.\n\n
4	[deleted]
5	How to live life?  Like how to keep yourself busy, fulfilled, get the most out of it?\n\nPhilosophy and Psychology are your best friends for this.  Look into Nietzsche (most IxTJ's seem to like Nietzsche), the existentialists, stoicism, buddhism.  \n\nIntrospection is important.  Reflecting upon your strengths & weaknesses, fears & desires, how your past has shaped you.  Recording your dreams for insights can give a lot of helpful stuff too.
3	10 commandments, the gospel, Magisterium to name a few\n\nAll other philosophies listed here are close but missing a critical piece.
1	Im an auditory learner and an active learner, which means I have to sit through a lecture and participate in the class in order to get it. Online classes are worthless to me because I'm not experiencing the class. I don't need an online course to tell me that
6	Si-Fi - what is that like for you?	ENTP here (Ne Ti Fe Si).  The two biggest functions I need to develop more are Si and Fi (My inferior and blindspot).  Can you give me a detailed breakdown of how Si-Fi operates?  How could I try to think in that domain more?  I generally am terrible with Si because I want to do whatever entertains me, and I find it terribly hard to build a routine and manage my time.  Fi is completely alien to me - I tend to detach from it - it usually feels dissatisfactory for me to value something / make an ethical claim without critical Ti reasoning for why it will be beneficial and logically deductive.  I also rarely know what I truly value & feel, which causes some problems.\n\nWhat is it like for you?  How do you structure your lifestyle with Si Fi?  How does Si Fi affect your worldview?  What recommendations would you give a distracted, indifferent, loose cannon of a prick ENTP like me? :) thanks. 
6	Si-Fi operates more as a first person VR replay of sensory experiences than anything.  It doesn't shape my worldview but it does shape my mood depending on what VR replay came up on my mental information feed recently.  For example, I can hear a song I played at a talent show in high school, then immediately get mentally transported back behind my drum set as if I was there again.  Emotions of the moment (excitement, energy, enjoyment) and sensory input of the moment (stage lights, sound, heat of the room) are baked into that mental trip back in time.  \n\n\nSi dom doesn't mean I'm not impulsive, but it does mean I tend to settle into a simple baseline routine easily.  If you want to build a routine, don't overdo it.  I don't schedule out every moment of my day, instead my routine looks like:\n\n1. Wake up\n2. Breakfast\n3. Morning half of work\n4. Lunch\n5. Afternoon half of work\n6. Self-improvement pursuit\n7. Dinner\n8. Free time\n9. Bed\n\nThat's about as detailed as I get and most things are interchangeable based on when I'm hungry/tired/impulsive.  In this sense, it's more of a checklist of things to do than a timed schedule.  This isn't a hard schedule, either - I practice responsible impulsivity.  I can do whatever I want as long as my stuff gets done (this relies more on practicing deferred gratification and efficient organization, not sure how to explain those).\n\nMy ethical claims are primarily rooted in Ti.  Fi used to be more predominant but I've learned that it's better to base things in rationality.\n\nI hope this helps!
3	In terms of the Si, the best way I can desrribe it as I see a replay of the memory like a projected image on the inside of my forehead. I watch things replay like a drive in movie. I am an auditory learner so I can literally play back conversations and lectures and songs and things word for word but that actually seems to take place in a different part of my brain. I almost never remember things in generalizations, almost all recall is very specific, so the sounds, smells, sights, everything that was going on at the time is replaying in my head in real time. When I read, it's at the speed of speach, I most never skim and it bothers me to do so because my brain isnt absorbing in real time and recall will be significantly altered.\n\nAs far as the Fi, I cannot relate to other people. I don't have empathy or sympathy. Ive worked in the ER and have seen significant tragedy, and I watched it like a spectator, very little emotion involved. My response is more that of "there's a problem, I need to do my role to fix it, somebody else can hug and comfort them". Does that make sense? Or help at all? 
2	As someone who has a lot of SCI-FI on their feed I totally read this title wrong and was very confused when I started reading the post 😅
1	Si-Fi feels like nostalgia.  Certain types of music can trigger certain moods for myself, I love to just get lost in my past experiences before I go to sleep.  It can become unhealthy if I go too deep into it because it doesn't actually accomplish anything other than feeling pleasure from the past, instead of feeling pain from moving forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith Si-Fi, my experience has been that you just gather things slowly in your life, making better sense of the world as time goes on.  You improve the sense of how to shape the world as you want it to be, while aligning with Fi, instead of needing Te reasons to justify Fi, you just do it because that is what you desire.  Then with that life experience, you can put your Te to more personally fulfilling pursuits, instead of just min-maxing some inconsequential idea you don't even like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for advice, focus on development of your Si above all because that is the thing will destroy you over and over in life if you don't confront it.   Take small steps everyday and move towards working on the thing you hate/afraid of doing in your life (which is developing your Si).
5	Is my ex an ISTJ? INFP here.	I am kind of halfway of moving on from him but I am just curious about whether he is an ISTJ or not. So, here is the list of his behaviour.\n\n* Is introverted like me but likes hanging out with people he considers himself close to. On hanging out though, he will not speak much but will observe everything closely. I, on the other hand, don't even feel like hanging out with close friends at times and I will prefer having alone time but this is not the case for him. He also respects commitments a lot. If he has told a friend he will come to a get-together, he will definitely go.\n* Looked right through my happy-go-lucky personality that i show everyone and was very fascinated by the depth of the typical INFP character. He used to tell me that I was the only person he could listen to talk and talk and never get bored listening to.\n* Is incredibly intelligent and has a very good memory of everything. He remembers lines from movies, remembered everything i said or texted him ( I myself hardly remembered what i said) and could also connect things together very nicely. Also, an incredibly good sense of direction (I am terrible at that) ; I generally talked while he would guide us to new places and then somehow know the way back.\n* Is also very hard-working. He never complained about doing work and he loved studying and could work till very late at night.\n* Very punctual and organised. He started projects on the day itself they were assigned even if deadlines are far away and never ever procrastinated, contrarily to me. He also finished much earlier than the deadlines. Also, he always is punctual and takes lateness as a sign of disrespect though during our relationship, he kind of took it well and made jokes about it. ( I only was late by 15 min)\n* Never gives up on anything he sets his mind to. I always found that fascinating. I had him in the friendzone for 1.5 years before dating him and he always flirted with me (in an awkward way) when we texted in the friendzone days. We did not have much contact though then. But he liked me a lot, so he never gave up.\n* Does not feel much for other people. I always felt bad and deeply for people who are sad or are suffering and poor. He always changed topics or said that people are poor because they don't work. Always so rational.(My opinion was people are unfairly born into this poverty in comparison to other rich people and are not to be blamed).\n* Has also a very black and white view of the world. He could appear very judgmental when faced to some gossip about someone and will now have a fixed opinion of this person in the same negative light that was brought to them. I am more likely to think that this is not the whole story to that person.\n* Also, there is this dark side where if he was hurt, he would hurt you back relentlessly and get back at you in any way. There would be this coldness appearing from nowhere from such a seemingly so rational and in control person and it surprised me a lot. \n\n&#x200B;
7	Short answer: very likely ISTJ.
3	A) Yes, he sounds like an ISTJ.\n\n2) Why do you care?  He's your ex.  Move forward.
2	Text book ISTJ
2	I think he is from your description.  \n\nFun fact, the best relationship I ever had was with an INFP, it's that magical Fi-Ne quality that I am weak in, is what I am drawn to.  Never once was I bored.
1	istj yep\n\nhe aint a perfect match to you though. There are other people out there who is more compatible with you dont worry it will get better
3	Any ISTJ that are into IronMan, Bodybuilding, or Triathlon?	Any extreme athletes here? If so, what have been your experiences?
10	Im into IronMan ...but Spider-man has always been my favorite. 
5	While I'm certainly not an extreme athlete, I quite enjoy weightlifting. Particularly seeing physical results in the form of strength gains and muscle mass as a result of systematic programming and dieting. I'm always surprised there aren't more people on this sub that are into lifting.
3	I used to bodybuild before I hurt my back at work. \n\nAlso not sure what you're looking for but I also enjoyed pushing for new goals in weight or planning and weighing my foods and tracking my intake. It was neat to be able to finely control my body and change certain things.  
2	I'm into running and endurance mountain biking events. I plan on getting into tris in the next year or so. \n\nI'm not sure what you are looking for personality wise?\n\nI can say I probably enjoy the planning of my workout schedule each year just as much as I do the training and competing.\n\nI really only care about competing against my own times and I don't really care where I end up in the overall/age group standings. Maybe that'll change as I get faster?\n\nI train 6 days a week and would say I get pretty obsessive about it. When I miss a workout I have to reassure myself it's not the end of the world. On the other hand I hold being consistent to such a high priority that sometimes I have to make sure I'm not sacrificing time with my family or others on my life.\n\n
2	I'm into bodybuilding, but could you specify what you're interested in?
1	I recently got into freediving, which is basically diving really deep for several minutes using just one breath. Don’t know if that counts as extreme for you
8	What does it means if an ISTJ ignores you?	I added them on Facebook on a new account because I forgot the password to it but the friend request wasn't accepted and they didn't even reply to my message. I haven't done anything wrong to them but there was a time they told me "You should care more about your friends". I also haven't seen them for a long time. Does that mean they no longer treat me as a friend?
23	Either they don't care to be friends with you, or they don't use Facebook very often.
11	I'm an ISTJ who hates FB, could go for months without messaging anyone there. \nAnd aside from that remark, you can ask; ISTJs aren't shy to say what's on their minds.
7	I'm engaged to an ISTJ. If you haven't seen them in a long time, chances are they might not consider you a friend anymore. I know hes done exactly this, ignoring friend requests from people he used to know. When my finacé left highschool he deleted himself off their school page and deleted most people from his facebook. Hes since moved countries and we're heading back to his home country soon and hes only seeing/telling about 5 people because they're the only people he feels close to. 
4	It basically means that we don't feel like paying attention to you and investing our time and energy into you. If he hasn't activelh declined you, then there's a chance hell come around, if he has, find a new friend, you've been discarded. 
3	Sometimes we can be judgmental.  Maybe there is a political or lifestyle difference getting in the way.  Its hard to know what the problem might be. Or they just don't use FB much, like others say..
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/mbti] [What does it means if an ISTJ ignores you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9nnjc5/what_does_it_means_if_an_istj_ignores_you/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
1	Orrrrr they know you already have an account, don't know you forgot it's password, and don't know the new account is indeed you and not a fake account.
1	Maybe this person just doesn’t want you privy to their private life. We are selective about whom we let in. 
1	If I told someone “you should care more about your friends”, chances are I no longer see them as a good friend. Especially if we haven’t talked in a long time after that.\n\nBut I would like to add that if that person showed they really wanted to reconnect with me and become friends again, I would be open to it (depending on the original circumstance of why I thought they were a bad friend I suppose)
1	Maybe they thought the new account is a fluke considering they are already friends with you on the first account? Don’t read much into it, but don’t push it as well. After all it’s their call which friend requests they accept or not. :)
1	My ISTJ brother ignores communiques for weeks, months or even years at a time if he has an issue with the person (usually it's because he's secretly taken offence to some aspect of their behaviour/conduct).  However, he will also sometimes ignore people he knows well and even people who he actively *wants* to be friends with if he simply doesn't know how to respond.  I don't know what was in the message you sent him, but anything you can do to minimize "chaos" in your interactions can significantly help.  Be really up front about what your expectations are- and what they *aren't*.  A big source of stress for introverted sensors is not knowing what to expect/what is expected of them.  Starting or restarting a friendship can feel ambiguous and awkward.
1	I'm an INTJ, so maybe my response is useless, but I can sometimes take weeks or a month or more to respond to friends requests, especially if it's from someone I'm not particularly interested in following along with their life, or I know they tend to post asanine stuff (is that you?). My initial response is either a yes or a maybe (not counting strangers/random people).  Then much like a text that I mean to respond to later, it slips my mind. Lol
-4	They’re being rude for ignoring you. Not accepting your friend request has to do with how they define a friend. \n\nEdit: deleted unnecessary information
7	Do you have an excellent memory, or is it average (or even poor)?	So, from what I have researched so far in this theory, I believe I am an ISTJ (in addition to most MBTI tests giving that result). However, I was reading some old posts here and other MBTI forums, and the ISTJs present in these posts seem to have a much stronger memory than I ever could have (it seems like I have an average memory compared to them).\n\nI have read about cognitive functions, and I have read that Si is not memory. Even then, it seems rare to find an ISTJ on these forums that does not have at least a somewhat excellent memory.\n\nSo I have some questions for you ISTJs: could it be that I am taking my memory and Si for granted (and my perception is faulty), or are those ISTJs with excellent memory exceptions? Are there any ISTJs here that would agree to having an average or even poor memory? Any answer is appreciated, especially those who really understand Si and memory.\n\n(PS: This is my first post ever to Reddit, so I hope I wrote this properly and that this question isn't stupid.)
12	I do have good memory, but I can't really decide what I will remember in detail. I can recall small things that happened years ago to great detail, and some I don't recall happened at all.
7	I feel as if having an “amazing” memory isn’t inherent to ISTJs but rather the majority of ISTJs aren’t as absent minded as the rest of the types. \n\nThere was just a post like a day ago about ISTJs remembering very specific details about random things, but with no control or discipline over WHAT you remember. \n\nPersonally, I could be at a social function and be introduced to 15 people. I’ll promptly forget all but two of their names. I have no idea why I remember only two names with nothing uniquely distinguishing them from anyone else’s name. There is probably something subconsciously going on that makes me remember them, but I feel as if it’s just random. \n\nEdit: [The post referenced ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/9n860i/remembering_unnecessary_knowledge_and_information/?st=JN6EDKJU&sh=1c3cdd6b) 
5	There are some things where I have almost a photographic memory. I have a knack for remembering numbers and dates. But stuff like movies, it's like I go to bed and everything is erased. My INTP husband teases me because I have so many movies on Netflix that are partially watched because I get 30-45 minutes in and realize that I've seen it before. 
3	I wouldn't say my memory is spectacular. However I do spend lots of time reflecting on past events personally. If true for other ISTJs, perhaps we do more than others. I bet this would strengthen memory naturally.
3	I’d say I have a average to above average memory. I am a 24 year old male with a Bachelors of Science. As a child, I was involved heavily with my church’s kids program. The program had books from which we’d memorize Bible verses from and get points for doing so. I was the top of my grade section. Both because I had more time to study because I was homeschooled, and also because I had a knack for it. \n\nAs an adult I love to read books, both fiction and non-fiction, and listen to a variety of podcasts. A lot of time in conversation I bring up fun facts I learned recently, or not so recently about in my materials. \n\nAnother aspect to my memory  is the Si-Fi loop. Sometimes it’s nice, and other times it a pain. When it’s useful it allows me to re-feel old memories and feel Nostalgic for that period of life. Sometimes I remember embarrassing or unpleasant events and the negative emotions associated with them. 
3	I'm a kinetic learner, and tend to accurately remember things with sensory details (particularly touch, and sound).  Those memories can be nearly photographic, in a sense.  I write a lot of notes longhand, mostly because the physical act of writing helps me remember the information; typing doesn't work as well.\n\nNames can be quite problematic (it's tagging  a visual image with an abstract sound).  I have to associate something physical about the person with their name to have a chance at remembering.  Lately though, it's getting harder and harder to recall people's names in social situations.  A week later, it's sometimes like I've never met them before.  That's becoming frustrating, tbh.
2	My memory is probably close to average, realistically speaking.  \n\nIt is also largely contextual.  I'm only OK at remembering stuff at will, but given the correct prompt, I can recall some pretty obscure stuff, because I have context from which to pull.
2	My SO is an ISTJ and he admittedly has a terrible memory. I'm an INFP and have terrible short-term memory. Not sure it is related to our MBTI
2	I have an average-good memory, apart from the fact that I randomly remember really useless things from ages ago. Seems like that's the general experience. 
2	I have an extremely poor memory. I'm 23, cannot remember big life events, and cannot place huge, life-changing events in the correct order. I'm going in for in-depth testing about my memory next month. I have always had a poor memory, but I suspect mine was made worse by certain events.
2	I do have a photographic memory. I recall some incidents too vividly sometimes. So yes. We do have an excellent memory, at least in my experience as an ISTJ. \n\nHere's an example from a job interview I had back in 2015:\n\nIt was summer. I was in an interview with two British ladies. One old and kinda overweight. The other younger, like 30, thin, and was wearing this beautiful floral sundress (I think it was blue). I mentioned a peculiar word I heard once, years back. And ironically, I can't remember what it was right now lol. But oh my god, I'll never forget the young lady's reaction after she asked me when did I hear that word, and I answered by mentioning the exact circumstance in which I've heard it. She leaned forward and tilted her head sideways and was like, "What memory do you have?!"
2	I agree with some of the other comments in that I can't choose what I remember. I find that when I *try* to remember something, be it material for a test or something of interest, I never remember it. But then random stupid facts I read on the internet I remember long term. I have vivid memories about random things, but then a lot of my childhood/past experiences are rather fuzzy. I know with certainty that my short-term memory is shit. Introduce me to someone and I'll forget their name instantly.
1	Excellent, and I can even remember small details which seem insignificant to other people!
1	I only have tertiary Si, and yet have a better memory than the ISTJs I know.
11	Istj woman driving me crazy	Is it typical for an istj to deny they're interested in someone even though they are? This istj girl i know claims she's in a relationship every time i communicate my interest or tell her I love her, but then acts jealous and angry every time i talk to another woman or another woman shows intetest in me somehow in front of her. If this is typical behaviour, what's the rrason behind it? I can give more details if it helps.\n\nThanks!
11	ISTJ female here - at least for me I wouldn't act interested in someone even though I liked them very much. My husband wasn't sure I was really into him when we first started dating even though I was genuinely crazy over him lol. I've heard that it is typical behavior, but how do you know she's interested in you? 
6	Sounds like she likes the attention but doesn’t want to return it. I’m an ISTJ. This is something I did when very immature. 
6	ISTJs obey rules. If she is a co-worker, there is likely a fraternization policy prohibiting you two from dating. But maybe she likes you and enjoys your attention.
4	I tell creeper strangers im in a relationship when i want them to bugger off... But i couldnt do that to somone i know - ISTJs dont lie like that. Thats a big lie to keep up around someone you see regularly: Way too troublesome.\n\n\n\n\n\n
2	It was hard for me to tell if my ISTJ SO was really into me at the beginning or if he was just going through the dating motions. Now, however, I know he loves me more than anything 
2	Hi, there's also /r/mbtirelationships that you can post to
2	It's really hard for someone to tell if we have feelings for them. We aren't very expressive and it's a huge risk for us to show those feelings.\nIdk if she really has a SO but, as a single person, I have certain parts of a relationship that I truly crave, affection, sex, taking care of someone, etc., but I am not ready to invest my life into a full committed relationship so I have one person who I do those things with/for and there's an unspoken understanding btwn us that this is how things are. I think this is where you are for her. \n

1	Yep, I agree with what the others said about acting like you’re not interested in someone you actually like. But if you have communicated that you like her and she responds by saying/pretending that she’s unavailable, that CLEARLY means she is not at all interested in you. At least that’s true for me. Sorry...\n\nBut hey, don’t you think you deserve someone who responds more maturely upon learning you’re interested?
0	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/mbtirelationships] [Istj woman driving me crazy](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbtirelationships/comments/9nf7ct/istj_woman_driving_me_crazy/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
17	Remembering unnecessary knowledge and information from years and years back	I have read somewhere that ISTJs are very keen on details but I never thought this would apply in clearly remembering chunks of information and knowledge even from years ago.\n\nLately, my friends have been commenting on how I can vividly recall knowledge from years back like college philosophy terminologies and definitions and sometimes, scientists' full names.\n\nBut it has also put me into a disadvantage because there was time that when my coworkers asked if someone knew the name of a certain person from a different office. I met that person once and remembered his full name. So when they asked, of course, I answered it. But they took it the wrong way and are now teasing me that I am interested in him, which is definitely not true. I just remembered it, that's all.\n\nSo now I shut up when these kinds of questions on people and events pop up, unless necessary circumstances arise.\n\nI don't have photographic memory because I met people who possess this quality and their experience is another level of different.\n\nIs it only me who experience this kind of thing? :(
9	Definitely not you, someone will randomly tell me something once, ill rememeber it and then look weird bringing it up later on  \n\n\nIm also know amongst friends for knowing random facts and what not  \n\n\nWeird thing is, if it is info from university ill often forget the principle and just remember a one or two random things
7	I remember many unnecessary things. So much so that people don't belive me when I describe things that happened a long time ago in detail.\n\nI also have a wierd photographic memory that only picks up small details, like where a certain tool are located. Once my father said he could not find his screwdriver. I said it was under a book in the kitchen. It was, and I did not know I knew before he asked me . If only I had controll over what to remember.
4	Best not to reveal too much to those around you. It’s like when Clark Kent was learning to control his powers. Use your memorization ability for your own benefit. I’ve creeped people out with this ability. For example, I remember the names of people that show up on the suggested friends/people you may know list on fb. When I met a woman on this list for the first time on campus, she got weirded out that I knew her first and last name. Her reaction was understandably, “have we met?” My buddy bailed me out saying she came up in one of our conversations. But I didn’t choose to remember her name. That experience taught me not to reveal too much to others.
5	It can be a little frustrating in conversation with friends or relatives.  I'll remember clearly the exact wording and inflection of some statement because I was there, yet when someone else recounts it they'll get it wrong.  I almost can't resist correcting them, which would usually just annoy them, so it's frustrating.  But still, if the error changes the point I will say something, though I always apologize for doing so.\n\nThat problem must exist to a major degree for those with such ability.  Maybe we're lucky we don't have perfect memories!\n\nMy memory is probably above average, but not photographic by any means (and at my age, and having gone through a type of chemo therapy, my memory is becoming less complete; what I remember I remember clearly, but some things just don't get recorded!).  
3	I have an amazing feelings memory. I can tell you exactly how i felt about a situation, but not exactly what happened... I guess its terribly biased and perhaps an absolutely useless way of remembering things.
2	Everything you said is exactly my experience. Especially the part about withholding information as to not seem like a weirdo stalker. \n\nBut there’s always funny side to this weird trait. \nEarlier this year I was sitting on the couch browsing on my phone while my mother had the TV on. She had on the news or some news like program and they were just starting to move to a new topic. I hear the voice of a female news caster say: *Sphenopalatine Ganglioneuralgia....*\nAnd I say out loud: BRAIN FREEZE! \n\nMy mom was amazed and puzzled as to how/why I would know such a random fact like that. I told her it was from some kids show talking about brain freeze that I watched probably no less than 10 years ago. I have no idea why I remember what I remember, I just do. 
2	I have that too. My memory is pretty limited on the photographic part, snapshots about some random things and stuff like that, however, on an auditory level, it's pretty remarkable. So if I read a name, I'm unlikely to remember it, but I hear it, I'll remember it until I die, however, I'll never be able to match it to a face. So when I'm reading something I need to remember, I'll read it u out loud so it'll go into my auditory file and I'll remember it.\nDoes that sound familiar to anyone else? 
1	With me it's birthdays - I remember everyone's birthday. Obviously it's kinda normal to know family members and coworkers birthdays. But I also remember the birthdays of the friends I used to have in middle school, birthdays of celebrities, of acquaintances from college, etc.  Pretty much if I've met someone and found out when their birthday is, even if I don't remember their name, I remember their birthday. 
5	Si dom and relation with Ne	So as an ENTP I am incredibly curious (heh) to figure out how the hell Si works. It seems opaque to me. Can you please describe how your Si 'operates'? Likewise how does it relate itself to Si? \nCheers.
5	Si feels somewhat like having a library of references that are past experiences that I can automatically ctrl + f based on sensory input. It's great for things that involve muscle memory or detailed recollection.  The library only gets bigger as more references are added, too - most things aren't forgotten as much as they're buried in an old wing behind newer experiences.\n\nI still don't really understand Ne so I can't help you there unless you can help me figure out how it works.  Based on a quick Google search, Ne might function like the Dewey Decimal System, sorting all these references by any given number of categories/relations.  If I pull up one reference, I can immediately relate it to other references simply by seeing what's on the same shelf/aisle/floor/wing.
2	My brain kinda works like a filing system. Super organized, I can find almost anything that I need to. Somethings that are stored as "quick reference" is like a rolodex in my brain. When I get home from work, or from a stimulating experience, I need about 20 minutes to "woosah" and what's happening in that time is my brain is filing away the memories and information in that super organized filing system.\nI tend to describe it at the opposite of dyslexia. I take the input that's all mixed up and sort it all out into something that makes sense.\n\nIdk if that really answers your question or not. You can ask for clarification. 
1	I tend to think more about past memories than future plans. And on holidays I’ll see how far back I can remember how I spent that day each year. Even most of my dreams are like that-reliving a memory so I can process what my emotions towards that event were since in the moment I might not have completely understood my feelings. 
1	First I am not an ISTJ.  So understand I am going to give some insight but I am not going to speak from a personal point of view as an ISTJ since I am not one.\n\nI am an INTJ and thus Si is one of the hardest functions for me to access for it is a shadow function and it is low on the function stack usually slot 8^(daemon / devilish / transformative / daemon here being silent guide like mushu in Mulan.)  Yet we INTJs use Si all the time and often do not even realize we are doing it^(the not realizing we are doing it is why Si is our Daemon).\n\n----\n\nI find this video, I am about to link to, helpful in explaining Si.  3 minute short clip where an ISTJ (Jeff Bezos) is interviewed.   And the youtuber puts up insights in the conversation pattern and narration of how this style of conversation is unique / common to ISTJs.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLvoETlAazA\n\n* Note Si is not a single thing, and how Si works is different in people who have Si in different places in the function stack.  Aka Si is different if its in slot 1, 2, 3, or 4 (Dominant, Auxiliary, Tertiary, Inferior.)\n\n* This article further elaborates the last bullet point.  https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/12/how-each-cognitive-function-manifests-based-on-its-position-in-your-stacking/\n\n* Think of Si and Ne as a pincher which approach a situation from two fundamental different directions but if they work together they come together in the middle (the pincher.)   The Si focuses on concrete details.  We call these sensory details but they are not just limited to the senses.  While the Ne, the extroverted intuition is doing a form of pattern recognition and exploring the possibilities of the concrete details. \n\nNow in an ISTJ there is also the daemon 8th function function which to them is Ni.  The Ni which is doing *forecasting* and *thinking in a systems* to internalize these concrete details and the infinite possibilities that the Si and Ne generate.\n\n* But the daemon function works like this for all types.  For example I am an INTJ and thus my ith function is Si, my daemon and my daemon is providing all these concrete details to how I think, the Si provides the *tangible* while the Ni and Ne works on the abstract.  OP you are an ENTP so your daemon is an Se.
9	I want to bond with an ISTJ!	So there's this ISTJ guy I know who I think is pretty nice. I'm an INFP and sometimes I wonder if I'm bothering him. As soon as I think of that I tell myself to not assume things. For a while of interacting with him I realized assuming things isn't so good. He never ignores my texts. One time we called and he told me he really appreciated me talking to him and that his self esteem felt better. I think that's a good thing right? I would text him and mostly avoid stuff about emotions. My friends and I talk it out and I think he doesn't feel too close to me yet. I'm totally open to talking about emotions though.\n\n One time he told me he got pissed at a guy for no reason, but he only felt it and it never appeared outside. I felt sad for a while thinking about all my thinker friends who told me similar things. What does it feel like to only feel it on the inside? Plus he smiles all the time. One day he said he had to get off his train and stop texting me. I told him to get home safe with exclamation marks. I like to make my emotions apparent, or so I think. He thanked me for the first time.\n\nHe gives me a lot of advice. I find it funny and weird how I'm trying to compliment him, but he doesn't get what I'm trying to say. Then he gives me more advice. I want to bond with him more. Are there ways for me to say things for him to understand? When I get too metaphorical or use emotional terms, he does not fully understand. Thanks!
7	I'm an INFP with an ISTJ SO. It was somewhat difficult for us to communicate in the beginning because of different communication styles. What I've learned is to make sure what I am talking about has a specific point or end game. He doesn't like stories with no purpose. He also likes to give advice when I present him with a problem, but he expects that I will follow his advice. I've learned that if I don't want him to give me advice or I have no intention of doing what he suggests, I'm better off to keep the issue to myself. \n\nMy ISTJ likes alone time and doesn't really enjoy long text conversations. He says texts are for important things. Everything else can wait until we see each other in person. So I would try not to bombard him with random questions about his day, what he's doing, etc. if it seems like he isn't responding with enthusiasm. 
5	We don't do small talk. It's something that we don't really understand and are not interested in, in fact, it makes uncomfortable. We need deeper conversation in order to respond and carry on a good conversation. It can be hard to make friends because we need to skip the awkward chitchat get to know you stage and go straight to talking about real life stuff.\nAlso, we are masters of the poker face. You never know what is going on in our head because we just aren't expressive that way. Doesn't mean that we aren't excited or thrilled or angry or furious or anything else, it just doesn't appear in our faces or our behavior.  Anger only lasts a couple of minutes for us so there isn't really a reason to show it but we can tell you exactly how we feel in no uncertain terms.\nBecause we aren't expressive or chit chatty ppl often think we're rude. We're not. We try really hard to do all the "right things" to make ppl feel comfortable with us. We just can't do it fluently enough to be convincing in any way.\nDoes any of this make sense? 
1	What experience/situation/place do you share? Are you coworkers? Students in the same class? Go to the same meetup? Youth group? Talk about that shared experience, whats going on there, the people there, the changing dynamics. \n\nOne of my best friends at work is a a Fi-dom and we cluck so well because we always complain about how unfair everything thats happening is. Our Fi aligns very well. ISTJs handle being upset easily, so feel free to connect on things that upset you too.\n\nAnother sure way to connect is sense of humour. Start building a library of shared inside jokes with him and youre golden 👍\n\nTo feel something on the inside i assume feels the same, just less chaotic? I working through it on my own, i dont need everyone else to know about it.\n\nHes smiling all the time because overall we appreciate harmony and will engage in direct conflict only when necessary.\n\nHe probably understands your compliments (i guess depending on what youre saying) but we're a bit hesitant when it comes to flattery.
1	You sound like you like him more than a friend or else why would you put so much effort into caring?
0	How do you experience and use Si-Fi interaction in your daily lives?	
5	By reliving certain situations (impressions I took in these situations) in my mind with the same original emotions I've experienced them with. \n\nBasically, an Si stored impression from the past + my emotions at that specific moment. It's part of the photographic memory introverted sensing types are so notorious for. \n\nThe negative side of Si-Fi is to get hung up on negative memories of what should I have said or done. 
2	One example would be me being a total nerd and sharing facts (Si) about my pet interests (Fi). If no one's around I just review it in my head.
1	Im not sure that I do. I might need some clarification. 
103	Yep	
27	I thought it was just me. Can other ISTJ's confirm?\n\nEdit: not to the comical extent suggested in the meme of course, but generally.\n\nEdit: thank you. Please stop confirming.
17	This + going overboard teasing her that it comes off as mean, sarcastic and rude so she thinks you're a dick.
10	I feel personally attacked delete this
3	RIP myself
5	Eh, I used to be this way, but eventually grew out of it. Talking to cute girls is waaay more fun than ignoring them once you develop social skills. That last part took a long time, though...
2	Yup :/
1	Hasn't worked for me so far.  One day, maybe...
1	Using this form of flirting and the using the element is surprise to confess your feelings is the best way of finding a partner. One day it will surely work. 
6	A sub for relationship advice specific to MBTI!	
3	Maybe the mods can sticky this so we get more people over there?
1	That's a good sub. Good luck! Enjoyed the few posts already there so I have high hopes.
4	How to deal with an ISTJ at work?	I'm an INTJ. I don't know what it is about you ISTJs, but something about you guys just rubs me the wrong way. I don't know how to interact with you guys on a level that works for you, and then there's always some amount of miscommunication or tension that builds. It's never really become a problem, but I'd be happier knowing what it is I could be doing differently to make this work better. I recognize that it's not necessarily anyone's fault and that everyone's different but I'm sure there are some things I could at least try.\n\nI work with an ISTJ that I have seniority over, and so it falls to me to teach him how to do things a lot of the time. He's a bit of a slow learner, but also has a bit of an ego. This often leads to situations where he'll make an obvious mistake but not be able to own up to it, and if called out on it he gets incredibly defensive.\n\nAs an INTJ I much prefer to be called out on my mistakes; it's the best way for me to improve on them. How would you folks prefer a situation like this be handled?\n\nHe's also really religious to the extent of being sexist and homophobic, but I don't think there's anything I can do to make that situation better...\n\nI appreciate your thoughts folks. I know you're not all as difficult as this guy, but my issue stands.
48	I’m not sure if it’s an ISTJ thing. The dude just sounds like an asshole... 
14	Your coworker does not sound like an ISTJ.  We usually handle constructive criticism well.  Why do you think they're an ISTJ?  If it's self-proclaimed or result of a single MB test, I'd question it....
5	The only time I dislike critisism, it comes from someone who I think lack knowlegde in the field, or is emotional while doing so, like angry or annoyed.\n\nIf I where in the position this guy is in, I would find advice and critisism from a senior very valuable. 
4	ISTJs don't have a problem being called out on their mistakes... Unless they really dislike the person who's calling them out.\n\nIf this person is an ISTJ, then you've made them resent you on a personal level somehow and its bleeding into your work. Sorry, but your coworker just doesn't like you.
3	If they're not able to do their job without constant assistance from you, I'd consider starting performance management and getting them out so they can find a job that better suits their abilities and mindset. It's for the best for everyone concerned. 
3	Idk if it's an ISTJ thing or just me, but I'm an auditory learner, so showing me how to do something is kinda useless, explaining it to me is far more effect and giving me the opportunity it ask questions to clarify is important. I've had bosses call the "talking back" or "complaining" etc. I just needed to make sure I understood.\nOther than that, sounds like a maturity issue. Not so much an ISTJ issue. 
1	I sympathize with him being a slow learner. How are your learning sessions? Are you like teaching him, and then asking him to do it in front of you? Often if someone is doing that to me, I need time to process the information on my own, and can rarely recreate what was done on the spot. I could definitely see myself getting frazzled and becoming defensive in that case.
1	Lol he sounds like an asshole. I promise we're not all like that. 
1	Maybe you aren't respecting him/maybe you're the asshole.
17	I’m hosting my first housewarming party…pray for me.	Lol,  not a huge deal, or guest list but there’s about to be people in my home!!!!!! Good vibes, please!
14	Haha I can't wait to host my housewarming party.  I love hosting events.  It gives me an excuse to show everyone how optimized and efficient my space is
8	Good luck. You might need wine... Don't share. That's your wine. In your house. And there's too many ppl there. 
5	I'm sure it's a wonderful house and it will go great!  Good vibes on the way!
5	How'd it go?
3	idk if any other ISTJ does this but basically every time there's more than like 3 people over for drinky times, by the time I'm done with them, I just retire to my room. I couldn't tell you how many times I could hear my friends loudly ask "HEY WHERE DID TRUE GO??" and I just laugh and go to sleep all comfy.
4	ISTJ's and cuddling	My partner is an ISTJ (M) and I am an INFP (F), he doesn't really show his affection through physical touch while I do. I love to cuddle and he doesn't love it so much (too warm, uncomfortable, etc). We've spoken about this and I respect his reasons, but I do notice that because I naturally want to show my affection through physical touch I sometimes come across as needy while I'm not really a needy person. \nI was wondering if this is common for ISTJ's and if there are couples that have this same issue and might have some advice for me? 
7	My ISTJ SO is HUGE into cuddling. She gives the best and warmest hugs ever, she is really into snuggling and cuddling as a mode of interaction and communication between us. Which I adore and treasure about her (among many other aspects). She has this grounded sincere solidity to her presence that just - it's really great, on many levels including all the hugs and cuddles and snuggling.\n\nI don't think your partner's preferences are a MBTI-type-related thing.\n\nedited: oh, wait except I didn't quite register this part clearly when writing the above:\n\n> (too warm, uncomfortable, etc)\n\nISTJs (Si-dom, seems to me) are exquisitely aware of their physical state of comfort/discomfort. so yeah I would second what /u/lustigjh is suggesting [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/9kbkuv/istjs_and_cuddling/e6y137q/) with this:\n\n> I get the whole "too much heat" thing. Just make the house cold and now you have a perfect excuse to cuddle for warmth\n 
3	I have become a toucher. If your my person then I feel a compulsion to touch you. But I'm not real cuddly in the holding each other way. I run my nails all over the body and then my hands. Reciprocation isn't necessary but nice sometimes, and for short periods. But I can count on one hand how many people I've felt this need to touch and still have fingers left over. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with love.
4	I'm an INFP and my wife is an ISTJ. She is very physically affectionate and strangely also picky about her temp. I don't like touching other people or being touched. When I initiate physical contact with other people, it's a strong expression of empathy and love. My wife knows this and respects my boundaries, but I also respect her need to be loved by me touching and being touched by her. We've reached an unspoken balance between our differing needs. I allow her to initiate contact without reserve and sometimes I do the initiation either for my own needs or hers. I've grown more comfortable with it as an expression of deep love and respect. In turn, my wife leaves me completely alone, even leaving the room without question.\n\nIf you need physical contact, tell your SO this. Decide upfront where the boundaries/compromises are and respect them without question or reserve, so long as they are healthy ones.
3	I want to do nothing more than cuddle with my girlfriend right now, although I get the whole "too much heat" thing.  Just make the house cold and now you have a perfect excuse to cuddle for warmth
2	I came here to ask something similar. \nI have an ISTJ (f) friend that means the world to me, we click in every way and I know she can run a household (thinking of dating/marrying). \nBut.....\nShe’s not physically affectionate...... zip. \n\nHer love language is Acts of Service and Quality time. \n\nPhysical touch (not sexual) means a great deal to me, it’s a near dealbreaker. \n\n\nI’ve spoken with other ISTJs of different races and they are all generally like that. INTJs are very cuddly, though. \n\nYou should take the 5 love languages test together and talk about it— he needs to know specifically that it means the world to you. \nHow long can you run with a partially empty love tank?
1	He likes it and loves that you want to cuddle with him. He is merely saying that he doesn't because he is afraid his need for physical contact makes him look weak.
1	I hate cuddling with a person but I love cuddling with my dog. 
1	I like to cuddle, but I do not like to be too warm. Sometimes I'll put the sheet over me to protect me from too much body heat.
1	Check out his preffered love language. It varies from person to person.\n\nI dont think its an ISTJ thing either. ISTJ male here, and Im big on cuddling/being physically affectionate with my partner (also INFP female 😂).
7	What do ISTJs find charming?	I've been charmed by an ISTJ and I'd like to return the favor.  What are some things that you find charming in others? 
25	For me it would have to be a witty sense of humor! 
29	People who are general interested in who you are, what you do and how you feel about things and not just talking about themselves. Also the ability to focus and carry on a conversation, not get distracted.
21	I greatly appreciate when someone is comfortable enough to sit in silence.\n\nYou know how sometimes you're like "Oh, man, this silence is *soooo* awkward. I should say something to break it!"?\n\nWell, sometimes it's only awkward for you, and we're just sitting there thinking "Man, it sure is nice that we can just sit here and share a quiet moment."\n\nNot all silence has to be filled.\n\nThat said, if you are going to break the silence, I agree with others.  Interesting, intelligent conversation is nice.  Random (and not so random) acts of appreciation are also nice.
12	Intelligent conversations 😀
15	Self-depreciating humor, quality time, one-on-one conversations, displaying curiosity.
11	Actions speak way louder than words for ISTJs. Do something they will appreciate; even something small. Like leaving a note on there desk that continues an inside joke you guys have. Or if youre both coming in early to work on something, bring coffees.\n\nOr just tell then you really appreciate the advice they gave you and it worked perfectly. They'll love that.
8	Remembering little things \n\nShowing interest in the stuff I like\n\nBeing passionate about something 
7	Someone who can actually cart an intelligent conversation is amazing. Conversation can be about anything. I hate people that try to have intelligent conversations but it is clear they know nothing about anything.
6	Agree on all the comments so far. Interesting conversations and witty humor are the best ones for me :)
4	I love people who have a talent and watching them do it. Doesn't matter how benign. My favorite dude is a master mechanic and I LOVE watching him work on things, cars, motor cycles, arvs, doesn't matter. I can't watch it all day. A musician who can play well, a typist, a cook, doesn't matter, I love watching what someone does well. 
5	Okay, after thinking about it for a bit, my SO shared her answer. As a preface, I want to say thank you so much for posting this, because I learned something about my sweetheart in this discussion on your question. So my post here has two parts: her answer to what she finds charming, and then description/info of our discussion because I think it, too, has useful information.\n\n-----------------\n\nFirst, her answer to the question "What do you find charming?" (in the context of her being ISTJ). \n\nShe said she finds small spontaneous actions of affection for no reason, like getting her a card for no reason or flowers at a farmer's market or baking her cookies, charming.  \n\n-----------------------------\n\nSecond the discussion: We've been together nearly three years and I didn't know this about her. Overall her main "love languages" (and mine) are physical touch and quality time. \n\nIt was extremely useful for me to hear this part about what she finds charming! I was especially struck by it not having occurred to me that having something tangible is such a central part of what it would be for her.\n\nI told her that I sometimes have these particularly intense moments of feelz/love/affection for her and I haven't known how best to express them. We do say I love yous to each other, but not regularly (just how we are, it's not a verbal habit, and that is perfectly fine and doesn't detract from anything). And in general, I've felt like verbal declarations of my regard, affection etc etc, are as likely to put her on the spot and make her feel uncomfortable because it creates a situation of her having to respond to a compliment (which isn't easy for her) on the emotional layer (she's actually very much a softie under the exterior, which I think is true for most ISTJs - but it's also true that intense emotional-level interaction is not necessarily .... I don't know, "easy?" "un-draining?" for her and I am aware of that).\n\nSo I told her that I have these moments of intense feelz and haven't quite known what to do to express myself in a way that feels good to her, and this this is something that would not have occurred to me but is actually something that could fit as a way to do it. \n\nAnd again, I have to say, the difference between something tangible versus just words (for example, a physical card versus me saying something or even writing an email) would not be something that would occur to me. Meaning, I didn't take tangibility as a differentiating factor, if that makes sense, but for her an nice physical card with some emotional declaration as part of it is different from just the emotional declaration in a non-physical form, such a card is in the category of "little spontaneous things" like chocolate or flowers or whatever, whereas for me it's not in that category at all.\n\nSo: it is totally awesome for me to learn this about her, and it solves my low-level dilemma of how to really convey what I'm feeling in those little moments of intense love and appreciation.\n\n------------------------\n\nAnd I'll say two things to you from here:\n\n1. Direct communication is always a good thing with ISTJs. Ultimately, if you want to know something about that particular person, ASK. And ask directly. ISTJs are really really good at direct information-sharing kinds of interactions. \n\n2. Thank you! Your post has enhanced our connection, and I am most appreciative. \n
3	OKAY I'm talking to an INTJ right now, so we're in a bit of a similar boat. \n\nThe things he did that really started to get me to notice him as an interest (besides the great conversation and similar mindsets we have) is the actions. One of my love languages is Acts of Service, which makes sense for ISTJs. So when he gifted me some clothing items (men sizes, so bed time shirts, I always like big baggy tshirts for bed haha) and some juice when I was sick, among a couple other little things, I was starting to get taken by him.\n\nGifts for a purpose like those melt me.\n\nBut definitely questions regarding my career/hobbies, what I'm thinking or how I'm feeling, is great.
2	If she looks like she is enjoying it she probably is.
2	A deep dive into a hobby or other body of knowledge
4	Thoughts on the Si-Fi loop and how it differs from the Ne grip?	Any ideas are appreciated. Especially from personal experience. 
8	Ne grip in ISTJs is commonly expressed by overthinking about all the possible ways things could go wrong or end badly, regardless of facts and details to the contrary. General anxiety of the future and an inability to accurately recall past events for comparison are also common expressions. An overwhelming sense of dread and fear typically occur with the Ne grip.\n\nSource: Married to an ISTJ. Our aux and inferior functions are mirrored, so we get lots of opportunities to teach each other how to better integrate the inferior functions into our lives.
5	What exactly is an Ne grip?  I can say that Si-Fi loop happens to me when I remember a particularly vivid moment from my past and immediately relive the emotions as if it had just happened (embarrassment, excitement, etc.).  It's like being sucked into a first person Top 10/Not Top 10 of something that occurred in my life.
7	What do you do for fun?	I wonder if there are hobbies or themes that ISTJs are naturally drawn to?  \nWhat are yours?  \n
8	-Videogames, alone and with friends.\n\n-Reading. Sometimes I write fiction for fun aswell.\n\n-Music; writing, playing, and listening.\n\n-Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n-Worldbuilding.
5	I workout a lot. I wouldn't describe it as fun, but it's a healthy way to release stress and it's addictive. 
3	I make string/woven bracelets as a hobby. I like it because I just follow a pattern and it’s detailed work that keeps my hands busy. It also helps me feel productive if I make them while watching Netflix (feels more justified than just watching Netflix by itself).\n\nAlong with more standard hobbies like reading, cooking, jogging, etc.\n\nI’m trying to get into indoor rock climbing too
3	Mostly, stuff done alone like reading, listening to music, journaling, watching movies, coffee. And almost always, these are done routinely. Expected. Safe. And planned. 
3	- Birdwatching. I highly recommend all ISTJs try this out. Matching patterns with what you've seen in books, using memory to match calls. Identification and deduction at its finest. \n\n- Video games.\n\n- Reading\n
2	- Gaming\n\n- Listening to electronic music\n\n- Programming \n\n- Cyber security 
1	Flight simulators, video games that involve problem solving (factorio, etc), programming, 3D modeling, listening to music
1	PC games.\n\nGuitar (not well, but well enough for my purposes)\n\nTV\n\nReading\n\nSimple puzzle games (Sudoku, Solitare, Freecell)\n\nGuns, including handloading my own ammo.\n\nRecently took an interest into medicinal herbs (not pot, think tinctures and teas of yarrow, goldenrod, etc.), but this is a very recent interest, so I haven't done much with it yet.
1	Reading with tea and hiking with my dog during daytime. Movies with wine during nighttime. 
1	PC games, reading, driving alone listening to music
1	Crochet, knit, quilting... Things that keep my hands busier than my brain.\nReading\nConcerts\nSinging. 
8	What do you guys think of C.S. Joseph's typegrid V2?	
7	It seems overly simplified and not exactly reflective of truth.  I've never considered myself "past-focused", more "present-focused" using the past as a reference point.  MBTI is itself an oversimplification so that would make this an oversimplification of an oversimplification
4	Why put so much efforts in presentation if you're going to leave a typo like "Artistan" ?  That guy also uses the bad nickname like "Overseer" or "engineer" that don't reflect the truth...\n\nHe also groups people way too much. ENTJ don't live in a world of "what if", but here he is saying it.\n\nThat guy probably started preaching before actually developing a good understanding.  
2	I have a very difficult time understanding tables like this. Is this a me thing or an ISTJ thing? I also struggle with charts, maps, diagrams, and flow charts. Things like that. 
2	Nope! It was confusing for me as well. It’s not linear. I can’t do 5 diff grid areas. 😂
22	[Video] On ISTJ's & Friendship	
3	Great video!! Very accurate about my ISTJ self. Those are certainly good ways to grab my attention and begin a road to friendship! Rules exist for a reason!! Makes my brain hurt why people can’t follow them \n\nEdit: Just watched the part about “loosening up” about the rule thing...insert eye roll here. 😂
3	One thing you forgot don't come to us trying small talk. We don't get it, we don't do it, we don't like it. 
2	Wonderful video 👍
2	Loved it.
5	ENFJ married to an ISTJ	Hi everybody! Just wondering if any of you could explain ISTJ to me from your perspective. I mostly interested in better understanding things about my wife’s demeanor, mannerisms, and general outlook on life.\n\nFor instance, sometimes, usually after a long day, we’ll talk. It’ll be nice from my perspective, pretty casual topics for the most part, but then without much warning, my wife will tell me that she needs to be left alone for a while, or that I need to give her time to decompress.\n\nMy frustration with this as a ENFJ is that to me, it’s just casual conversation about light topics in our daily life that we share. I wouldn’t call it “small talk” by any means. I’m just not sure why it taxes it to the point that she asks me to leave her alone... as an ENFJ, if I told someone to leave me alone, I would mean “forever”, not “for now”.\n\nAny advice on how to better understand my wife’s needs as an ISTJ are greatly appreciated!
15	I’m a female, ISTJ. I’s NEED time alone to recharge. Being at work all day surrounded by people, engaging them in conversation, then coming home and having to have more conversation, that is something that’s emotionally/mentally draining to an I. Don’t take it personally. It’s just how she is. Let her lead when she gets home with how she needs to interact. If she needs 30 minutes, give it to her. She will emerge ready to face whatever awaits. You’re an E, you may not get it ever because you are energized by people and conversation and liveliness, and an I, while they aren’t shy and can still enjoy people and going out, need time to reflect and transition and definitely regain their energy. 
7	Often when I'm tired and/or stressed, especially after work, talking is an absolute burden to my brain. It won't matter if it's someone as close as my SO or just a friend in the same room. My brain is on fire and just forming words for a sentence or sorting through what you're saying is beyond taxing. \nAt this point I need to put myself in a quiet, usually dark, room where I can just focus on decompressing. \nI would not take her asking for alone time personally. Maybe if you can sense she's had a rough day just watch a movie and let her initiate the talking when she's relaxed. 
4	I usually need 20 to 30 minutes after a busy or stressful day to decompress. It's not an hours long thing that you can't talk to me for the rest of the day.... Think about it like a computer Defragmenting. The computer does its thing for a couple minutes and then it's ready to use again. But you leave it alone while it's doing its thing. Not everyone needs that time, but we do. Ice cream helps speed up the process. 
3	In my mind there like a pile of things that need filed and organized and my decompression time is filing all that away. When I'm finished my mind is clean and I'm ready to tackle home stuff. Idk if that is what everyone else has going on. But it's the best way I can explain it. 
3	Hey I'm an istj guy married to an enfj girl. Our days are set up so that I have plenty of alone time just by virtue of working on different shifts. I never tell her I need time alone because I know it would hurt her feelings. It's just something we interpret differently. If I ever get so drained that I feel it becoming a problem, I usually just say I need a nap. Which is true. It's the best thing for me when I get that way. I just don't say the reason why. Sounds like your istj is just a little more blunt. Which we typically see as a good thing.
3	[deleted]
3	I can talk to people I care about anytime mostly. But there needs to be a discussion or some way thay my brain can think critical or logical about the subject. If the subject is something I deem stupid, illogical, or unimportant I can get annoyed by it. Conversations like that drain me.
2	See, to carry your analogy over to an ENFJ, I’d say I’m doing that little by little throughout the day. I take in vast amounts of information through stimulating human interaction, however, I’m constantly prioritizing data, decompressing it, and straight deleting it as it is being processed.\n\nFor example, if I am about to go into a boring meeting with a powerful leader in my company that I’ve never met, I’ll focus on the initial greeting (smiling with the eyes, firm but friendly handshake, and good eye contact), exchange a pleasantry, and then totally plan to only listen for buzzwords from there. I have no problem shutting down and decompressing throughout the day, and because ENFJs are faces, I am able to hide my disengagement by maintaining the appropriate body language, and of course, throwing the occasional buzzword-based question.\n\nIf I’m doing that all day, what is an ISTJ doing? Actually listening to everything? I feel like that would be such a mentally draining experience if I felt compelled to actually maintain engagement like that
2	I work retail, and sometimes I *REALLY* need my breaks for my mental health. When I go in the break room, I want to sit down, put my ear buds in, listen to music, and browse my phone. If somebody tries to start a conversation with me instead of letting me be alone on my phone, I can get extremely frustrated and I'll try to politely end the conversation.\n\nI need that time for myself. I need that relaxation to recharge myself and prepare myself for the rest of my day. If I don't get it, I'm afraid I'll be extra irritable. I'm honestly jealous of people who can go on break and feel mentally okay to chitchat with coworkers. I wish I could do that, but most of the time I mentally cannot.\n\nI feel like the recharge thing is difficult to explain, but my brain just can't handle constant engagement with other people. It gets overloaded.\n\nNinja edit: For myself there's probably a component of mental health issues, and it's probably not merely an ISTJ thing.
2	it's better she tells you that than the alternative...\n\ntwo points about small talk that I run into is:\n\n1) when people talk about their problems, in my head I'm thinking about what they should be doing in their situation to get the outcome they want.  But it's often not polite to do so or worth the effort to go into it or having to justify why I think this.\n\n2) when it's just talking for talking sake or no point to the conversation it can be viewed as pointless and zone out.\n\n3) I feel that casual conversation can be more stressful for an ISTJ so when this piles on to problems elsewhere it's just too much.\n\nWe only have a limited amount of energy and have to be careful how we spend it.
7	ISTJ and hate to play?	I have 3 kids, the one I’m referring to here is 2. I am also a red personality type on the Color Code test, which means I am so driven and task-oriented that anything that deters or draws my attention away from accomplishing that task bothers me tremendously. My problem is that I hate to “play” and “pretend.” I feel so guilty about this too. I have to force myself to get down and play in the dollhouse or pretend the dolls are talking or whatever, it feels like mental torture. I know I should cherish these moments because they will be gone too soon, but I hate playing like that. Reading books, going places, crafts, whatever is fine, it’s the pretending. And I have little patience for my other daughter’s silliness. \n\nI’m wondering if this is just me, or do other “reds” and ISTJs have this problem as well? 
7	My kids are 10,13,16,and 18 and I didn't play with them. They played with each other or with friends. I took them places so they could play and I watched, talked to other moms, ate something etc, but I didn't play with them. A couple years I did help coach my sons soccer team and had a blast. But they were 8 years old at the time. I don't feel guilty about it. They're fine now. 
5	I always responded by sending them off with long things to do. If playing with dolls, “Go change all of their diapers and clothes so they can go bye bye,” for example. She comes back after doing that. “Great job! Now go load them in their car seats.” Comes back done. “Does everyone have their seatbelt on?” Comes back. “Now take them shopping and get all the groceries we need.”  And so on...all day long. Meanwhile, I can still get stuff done between these interactions. Mine turned out okay. And not so needy like I see a lot of kids their ages. 
3	I'm not sure what I am on the colour code test (but I will be looking it up later!).  I think as long as she has someone to pretend with and stretch her imagination with, whether it's siblings or friends or other kids at the park, it's fine.  It sounds like you do plenty of other activities with her, so it's not like you're missing out on bonding time.  I'm awkward as all hell around kids and I think it's for the same reason - I'm not great at pretending and I feel silly.  If a kid wants to read a book or color a picture, absolutely!  But don't ask me to pretend haha.  Funny though, I absolutely remember playing with Barbies and stuff as a kid, and didn't feel silly.  
2	ISTJ here who's babysat a few times. I can totally relate to what you're saying. I've never been good at, nor enjoy playing with kids. Much like you said, I can read to them or do crafts, but playing pretend or what have you is just not for me. I guess I almost feel *silly* doing so. 
1	Appreciate your perspective. You’re right. 
6	Work first and play later? It’s the opposite for - need advice	It’s been said that we similarly to ESTJs work first and then play later. I have hard time choosing to do chores and other tasks if there’s an opportunity to hang out or go somewhere. \n\nExample: need to change oil in the car or take online class to improve work related skill or even clean the house. If my friends text me to go hang out somewhere, even without a plan on what we are gonna be doing - I have a hard time saying no and usually end up postponing chores to the point where they pile up.\n\nAny advices on how to manage chores & tasks vs leisure time?
11	You have chosen to focus on procrastination and seemingly become quite proficient at it.\n\nNow stop it and get back to work.
3	I'm the opposite.  I blame my father though.  He used to make sure I did everything work/school related before I could play, so now as an adult I feel guilty if I'm "eating my dessert before my meat", so to speak.  I just can't relax and enjoy myself if there's still something that needs doing.\n\nThen again, it's never friends pressuring me to do something fun, it's always me denying myself the fun that I personally want.
3	I think that’s human nature to an extent. Set aside a time to take your car in for an oil change. Saturday morning for example. Prioritize. Write down 3-5 things you have to do this week and just do one at a time, write down the day you’re going to do it on your calendar.
2	Eat your frogs first. I put all my shitty tasks early in the day so I'm free to do whatever I want in the evening. 
2	ISTJs have this problem when they ignore their Te, and, usually, are in a SiFi loop. The big problem about loops is that you don't have a magical way to get out of it, you can only nurture your Te like *forcing*  yourself to do the stuff you're supposed to, but also trying to exercise your Fi in a healthy way
1	I do the same thing... It's hard, but gottaakw choices.... Finish your chores quickly and then show up to your friends. 
3	ISTJ Cognitive functions and four sides of the mind EXPLAINED	
3	TL;DL
1	What is everyones thoughts? 
9	Are you more attracted to Ts or Fs?	In both your romantic life and platonic friend life, do you find yourself gravitating more towards Thinkers or Feelers?\n\nI noticed very recently that most of the people I see romantically are Feelers (from observation, not 100% confirmed). Friends-wise I feel the split is more even. My best friends are ISFPs, ESFPs, ESTJs, and ESTPs.\n\nHow about all of you? 
11	Definitely feelers. They make things lighter when I tend to be serious. But I feel more connected to NFs because they have this automatic link to my unspoken instincts. Don't know if that makes sense but that is based on what I experience with my NF friends as well as my dating history. 
4	I married a feeler and I hated it. Been with thinkers ever since. 
4	Feelers feel too much.\n\nI like thinkers who aren't bad at feeling, but aren't a slog to deal with.
4	Romantically it’s always been feelers, friends I’d say about equally
5	Romantically it's feelers because they're the people I feel most inclined to open up to, even as just friends. However, I do have thinking friends too and the distinction between my 'types' of friends and the conversations I have with them is very clear. 
3	Thinkers are the only people I can handle being around.  Attraction is a construct I don't fully grasp.
3	I don't necessarily prefer either T or F--I just like people who are genuine. I do find myself appreciating F's in general though. I'm glad that there's people who will take care of the emotional side of being human when I suck at that.
2	Date thinkers, friends are feelers. 
2	The older I get, the more I appreciate (and enjoy spending time with) fellow Ts. But I’m pretty much surrounded by Fs.
2	When I was a kid, I think I was exclusively friends with Ts. At the time Fs were so foreign to me.\n\nI've had anxiety since my teens, and it makes me overthink and wonder if I'm good enough. I think this has caused me to be drawn to Fs now OR to people who have charisma.

1	Hi
10	Annoying habit of my extrovert parents	Hi everybody,I’m certain that you have extroverted parents (Most of the time) and usually their habits may annoy you in a way.\nWell this happens to me frequently and I find it kinda stupid.\nUsually when I arrive at my house there are people outside the entrance that are friends of my parents and then they salute and keep talking for hours and hours,and that usually becomes super annoying and makes me want to pick my mom up and take her to the door already.\nI’m not saying that you should not say hi to your neighbors if they are outside,but you shouldn’t talk to them that long,especially when you have another person who just wants to go home.\nThey also have other extrovert traits like the wonderful and super kool small talk which sometimes makes me uncomfortable.\n\nAre there any other traits that you find weird on your extroverted friends/parents?
6	I hate small talk. I can't do it. I don't understand ppl who can. My mom doesn't small talk however, she goes and visits people and then nitpicks every little irrelevant thing about them to someone else and when it get back to the first person and they ask her about it she lies and says the other person is the liar so everyone is mad at the wrong ppl and no one knows who the liar is. I wish she'd stay home and be quiet. 
2	When all the heroes fall, the sky is gonna call my name	Those lyrics are what really put the idea into my head.\n\nI've started paying attention to the world around me more recently, and I'm starting to feel more of a responsibility than I had before. Like I should contribute something noteworthy to the world. I have several ideas that I'm churning on and have started, but I'm posting here to get a general idea of other people who feel this.\n\nDo you feel that at all? Like you're going to be called on one day? And you have to be ready?
3	Ha, I joined a martial arts class about two and a half years ago partly because I felt an obligation to my currently-theoretical future family to be able to defend them.  It's weird feeling that that sense of responsibility has only gotten stronger over time.
1	Yes, I understand exactly how you're feeling. I feel it often when I'm at work. I'll be sitting at my desk and then an enormous wave of almost righteous anger comes over me. "What am I doing?" "How did I get here?" "I'm meant to do more than this!" I'm always reminded of that line Loki said in the Avengers, "I am burdened with glorious purpose." I truly believe that and I know that one day it will happen, but until then I must work on bettering and preparing myself for that day, while I wait. 
2	Interacting with an ISTJ as an extrovert without being overbearing	A friend of mine, who is also a peer in one of my classes is an ISTJ.  I want to be friendly and inclusive but I know sometimes it comes off as either off-putting or overbearing to people who are high in introversion.  Is there a good way to bridge that gap that any of you have found with your extroverted friends?
10	I still appreciate being invited to do things even though I don’t always end up accepting. Just keep the invites open ended and non threatening whether they accept or not!
6	We don't do small talk. So talk about things with substance. Sending friend requests first helps. Open invites, we want to go but don't do well if pressured to be there. Helps if we know more than one person otherwise we feel like a clingy nuisance because we aren't going to go mingle and make new friends. 
5	Its only off-putting/over bearing if youre not being mindful of the other person, be inclusive to this person. Most introverts may be reserved, but we like to have fun and enjoy ourselves even if we dont explicitly say it. 
2	ISTJs - Help Me to Understand	I need help getting along with my xSTJ mom. On some days we have cold silent wars. I don't understand why she thinks she is always right.\n\nIt can be over things as mundane as food. For example she thinks that I should eat Food A regularly everyday because it is the 'best' food. I tried reasoning with her (alot of people also eat Food B/C/D, Has science proven that A is the best food? It is boring to eat the same food everyday etc.) \nBut regularly she still asks me if I ate Food A.\n\nThis is just one mundane example but there are alot more examples, small and big -- adding up to a lifetime of vexation. Help!
7	> It is boring to eat the same food everyday  \n\nDepends on what Food A is.  I can eat a hamburger just about every day (I don't, but I have had a hamburger twice in one day or for 2 or 3 days in a row at least partially from coincidence), because I really like hamburgers.  I have a friend who is the same way with chicken and has on more than one occasion, eaten chicken for at least one meal per day every day of a week.\n\nBut I digress, because that's not really your point.\n\nWe (ISTJs) like consistency.  Sometimes that consistency leads us into a rut, which we will happily stay in.  Coaxing us out of the rut is difficult at best.
3	This is not an answer nor advice. I just feel compelled to comment that it sounds ridiculous to argue over what the 'best' food to eat is.\n\nAlso, I love eating the same thing every day. Rice, beans, vegan cheese, and ghost pepper salsa ERRYDAY! NOM NOM NOM
2	Did you ask what her reasoning was for saying it was the best food? Maybe factually, it has a lot of vitamins or is good for your liver or something that isn't necessarily strictly opinion. Maybe she was ill one time and she ate it and it made her better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I honestly believed a certain thing was the best at something, based on studies and statistics, then I wouldn't really care what other people do or that someone did it every day or not at all, so those arguments are moot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: some people just like to argue and are always "right," even if they aren't. my mom will literally argue about anything and be convinced that there should only be one answer: hers. even if I could google it and prove her wrong. that's why I subscribe to /r/raisedbynarcissists...
1	Tough.\n\nI'm pretty set in my ways. I won't change unless there's a good reason. However, if my girlfriend (and be extension, someone I loved) really wanted me to eat foods B/C/D, I'd do it to make them happy. But I'll only change so many things. Is she making compromises with you on any other matters?
1	Omg my XSTJ dad and ISFJ mum does/says the exact thing with food, and ignore by refute of questioning their scientific evidence/basis
7	How to rebuild trust with an ISTJ who loves me but has ended our relationship?	Quick recap. He’s an ISTJ and I’m an ENFP. We met in January of this year and fell head over heels for each other immediately. We were exclusive after our first date and due to a happy circumstance, we moved in together by the end of the month. We both agree we’ve never felt love like this before and were looking at engagement rings in February. The only problem? We would fight pretty frequently - about once every two weeks - and many of the fights went way too far. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fights went too far because of me. I completely admit this. I was way too easily influenced by my emotions and would become a different person the second I felt slighted/threatened/abandoned - leading to many tumultuous arguments that never should have happened. I’m talking slamming the door, me “sleeping on the couch” to get away from him when we both knew I wanted to be near him, not listening to a word he says despite him making a ton of sense… pretty embarrassing stuff. The good part was that we would always discuss right after the fight and each time I would very quickly come to the realization that I was wrong and apologize. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt started with me having to wait until the next day, but a few months into the relationship I was able to stop myself mid-fight and say “I think I am overreacting and not acting myself right now, I think you are right and I am being too much, I’m sorry”. This man helped me realize that for so long (like for my entire life) I have been acting out of fear, and my go-to defense mechanism was to become extremely defensive and dismissive. By talking it through with him and reading a ton about, I discovered I’ve been living life run by my ego - and I have now gotten to the point where I can proudly say I have a grasp on my emotions 90% of the time. I am no longer afraid to admit when I am wrong, which is something I could never do before. I can stop myself from getting upset in a discussion, I can calm myself down when I hear my voice getting high, and lately I can even prevent arguments from even happening in the first place. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThroughout our relationship, we have almost broken up at least 6 times. Each time it was due to my bad behavior and he would say to me “I love you like I’ve never loved anything in my life, but this is too much for me - I don’t see how we can have a happy life together fighting like this”. And each time, we would get back together - because we love each other so much and we thought we could find solutions to make it work (things like me saying when I need a pause, admitting when I'm not making sense, etc). Many of these things have worked and I've improved my ability to remain reasonable and relevant IMMENSELY. But there's still been times where I lose myself again. And the worst part is he doesn’t just “dislike” when I’m in these moods or having these reactions - he literally hates it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are currently broken up at the moment - it has been 2 whole weeks so it’s the longest and most official to-date. We live together and are still extremely couple-y and affectionate. He initiated the break up but only because he doesn’t see how we can possibly work. He still stares into my eyes and tells me he loves me, he still wants to spend time with me and travel with me and maintain our upcoming plans - the dude still loves me, I can feel it. But he’s convinced I’ll never been able to completely stop having bad reactions. He is convinced it’s because I’m an N and he’s an S. He is positive that my shit reactions are an N thing - whereas I am convinced they’re simply me having shit reactions, due to not having a good parenting examples growing up and being slightly immature as far as relationships go. This is the first time I’m acting like a grown up in a relationship and while I am learning, it has taken some time.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don’t blame him for having doubts. I’ve said it will stop many times and while it HAS improved immensely, it’s not completely gone - so in that sense, I can see why he doubts it will ever change. Though I should note that on multiple occasions he's turned to me with the biggest smile and said “you impress me so much with how well you just handled that” over circumstances where the old me would have been a little brat but I stayed calm and relative. He's also said to me on many occasions that if we could get past this, if I could stay calm and reasonable always, he would marry me on the spot. It's for this reason that I am refusing to give up on this relationship.... we have something really special here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere’s my question: How can I regain trust with him? What can I possibly say to him to give us another chance? I don’t blame him for not being confident… I wouldn’t be either. But the amount of progress I have made is substantial, and it’s not just for him! I hate that I turn into a different person sometimes and fixing this is huge to me - and the fact that he has helped me identify the problem and solve it means the world to me, as this has been an issue with relationships and friendships in my past as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love this man and I believe he is my person. I don’t want to lose him. \n\nWhat can I say, what can I do? We’re discussing tonight but I’m afraid his mind is firmly made up.

We would fight pretty frequently - about once every two weeks - and many of the fights went way too far. \n\n.....\n\n\n>Throughout our relationship, we have almost broken up at least 6 times.\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nSo about this:\n\n>We’re discussing tonight but I’m afraid his mind is firmly made up. \n\nI hope he stands firm with a break up. One of you two has to be mature and grown about the fact that this is an unhealthy relationship and actually end it, and clearly it's not going to be you. I wish him the best in sticking to a break-up and hope you can find a reasonable plan for dis-entangling your way-too-intertwined-way-too-soon material lives.\n\n
12	For me, people earn trust but once they burn the trust bridge, I have a very hard (read: nearly impossible) time ever rebuilding the bridge. I relate to people based on actions not words. My rope can be pretty long but if your actions never match your words, I eventually cut the rope. That being said, I also wouldn’t be affectionate still so seems like he’s giving very mixed signals.
12	Not sure if this is an ISTJ thing or not, but when someone (in a relationship or not) feeds me repeated apologies for the same exact thing, the apologies start to seem ingenuine real fast.  To quote David Drake from his novel *"Surface Action"*:  'I don't want you to be sorry; I want you to be in control.'  Has he ever mentioned something like this in your post-calamity discussions?  Have you solicited his help/advice on how to remain in control?\n\n\nIf nothing else works, I fall back on another quote from my favorite US Army general:  "Get mad, then get over it." -- Colin Powell.
7	This sounds incredibly unhealthy for the both of you. Good on you for learning and maturing a bit.  But it Sounds like you need some more time for maturing. I’ve never been in quite the same situation, I am an ISTJ. I was in a roller coaster situation but with a parental figure. That relationship ended last October and I’ve never been happier. I think you both need different people. Don’t you want less fights? If not for you, for this guy. Give him a chance to find a healthy relationship. 
5	This honestly sounds like a gigantic trainwreck of a relationship... Seriously, this can't possibly be healthy for anyone involved.\n\nI'd just like to point out that it sounds like he has an enormous psychological advantage over you in this, in the regard that he seems to be always right and you're always wrong, and it's always you adapting to him. I'm not saying that he is right/wrong, but you seem completely resigned to it. You're giving him the psychological high ground, because you want this to work so badly. This is no bueno in the long run.\n\nHonestly, I'd suggest you asking yourself WHY exactly do you want this to work out so seemingly desperately.
3	> We’re discussing tonight but I’m afraid his mind is firmly made up.\n\nI certainly hope so. You two sound like ~~nuclear waste together.~~ a dumpster fire of nuclear waste together. \n\nCorrection: I understated. 
2	I'm guessing both of you are fairly young.\n\nIt's possible that this relationship is just doomed.  But maybe not.\n\nSaving it, if it's even possible, will require that both of you learn to communicate with each other, and that both of you have patience with each other.  This sounds like pretty generic relationship advice, but it can be applied specifically to your situation.\n\nYou have recognized an issue that you can personally correct, and you are working towards that, which is a good thing.  He even indicates that he recognizes the improvements.\n\nHe needs to understand that you're trying to be better, that it's going to take time, and that he needs to be patient.  He also needs to understand that despite your best efforts, you're probably never going to be 100% in control of your emotions.\n\nYou need to understand that ISTJs suck with emotions, and not just ours, but other people's emotions.  Probably moreso other people's emotions, in fact.  When all we have to deal with is our own emotions, we can usually set them aside until it's the problem at hand is solved and then work through them in our own time.  We don't process them quickly, and we don't usually process them publicly, but we do process them.\n\nWhen we have to deal with other people's emotions, we don't have the option of setting them aside until it's convenient to process them.  We have to deal with them here and now, and we are not good at that.  During a discussion or argument, we usually look to solve the problem at hand, emotions be damned.  When the other person gets so wrapped up in the emotions that they stop dealing with the problem at hand, we get frustrated, and there's only so much of that we can take.\n\nIf you two can understand each other's limitations and learn how to communicate with each other effectively, you have a chance.\n\nIf you can't do that, then you need to try to figure out a way to separate amicably.
2	ISTJs are some of the most loyal and committed partners who will try to make things work at all costs. However, there will be a point where he will be fed up with these emotional rollercoasters. \n\nAn ENFP is often listed as a poor match with ISTJs, so good luck.
2	Sounds a lot like my marriage except my SO blames me for everything because I'm the odd one out. Most people are EF's and introverts can sometimes be seen as broken because we don't fit into your mold. I honestly wish my SO was as insightful and concerned as you. I'm starting to default to not interact beyond surface level because I'm done. I've almost ended it twice now and sometimes I wish she would, seeing as I'm just there to be yelled at for having a mind of my own and not following conventional societal pressures. Not to mention it's getting harder and harder to fulfill her needs as they seem to get more demanding. \n\nI just want to be left alone most of the day if not all day.
1	Hi, you guys sound really cute together. Tbh actions speak louder than words to an ISTJ more than apologies( if it has happened more than once ). I would also suggest a one on one session with him to sort of discuss your situation with him and find an amicable solution one way or the other.
11	Share your routines.	I learned ISTJs are known for their routines. What is yours like?\n\nMine:\n\n- Wake up. Drink 0.5 liters of water. Meditate. \n\n- Work (writing, editing, designing books)\n\n- Exercise for one hour. Drink 0.5 liters of water. Shower. \n\n- Hang out with my cat for one hour. \n\n- Have a meal with vitamins and 0.5 liters of water. \n\n- Do the tasks on the to-do list. (Clean the car, etc.)\n\n- Consume content (books, movies, music, etc.) or hang out with people. Drink 0.5 liters of water. \n\n- Shower and go to bed for eight hours of sleep. \n\nAll day every day. 
5	- Wake up, drink until I'm not thirsty anymore.\n\n- Bathroom visit.\n\n- Set the coffee machine to 1 litre, and boil 3 eggs.\n\n- Eat 3 eggs while watching youtube.\n\n- Wake up properly, and do housework.\n\n- Work while listening to podcasts/music. I drink the coffee and at least 2 litres of water.\n\n- I work out for about 2 hours 3 times a day, the other days I usually chill with a book/game/series.\n\n- Make dinner while listening to podcasts/music.\n\n- Eat while watching series/ documentaries/ youtube\n\n- Drink tea while chilling before I go to bed.\n\n- Sleep.\n\nMy routine does vary, but most of my days where I have no other plans it goes down like that :)
3	My life is chaos, so maybe I’m not an ISTJ. I don’t even know anymore.
3	The only routines I have is lunch time really. The rest of my life is a chaos 
3	6 AM: Wake up, get ready, go to gym. Come back, shower, get dressed \n\n8 AM: Get into work. Work on personal development items for 2 hours.\n\n10 AM: Short break, just enough to get into work mode. I'll usually update my budget if I'm feeling particularly peppy.\n\n10:30 AM: First meeting of the day\n\n10:45 AM: Work on first item of the day until lunch.\n\n12:00 PM: Lunch\n\n1:00-4:15 PM: Work, broken out into 30 or 45 minute chunks. There can be meetings during this time\n\n4:30 PM: Rest of the day activities, usually includes a quick nap, making dinner, and a quick walk. Then I read, play video games, or browse reddit until...\n\n10:00 PM: Bed time
1	Days off work:\n\nWake up. Wash. Breakfast. A cup of coffee. Checking my phone. Reading some pages from a book I'm currently reading. Journaling. Watching a movie (alone). Sitting alone and thinking about stuff. Chat with a friend. \n\nWork days:\n\nSleep early. Wake up early. Go to work. Go back home. Have lunch. A cup of coffee. Reading some pages from a book I'm currently reading. Journaling. Sitting alone and thinking about stuff. Chat with a friend. \n\nSounds robotic I know :P 
2	A doubt ....	As with all novices to MBTI , I read up 16personality.com 's website , and landed up ISTJ. So , there , it's mentioned that we love tradition . We adore , and hold it up. \n\nThis thought is really depressing for me . I personally think that reason should rule , and tradition is meaningless unless it serves a purpose . Will this thinking fade as I grow older ?? Will I become rigid ??\nThis rigidity . Now , people tell me I'm already rigid . But I wanna be open to new ideas , influences ,and take the best out of them . Am I incapable , because I'm an ISTJ ?  Can I be open , remain open , or will become closed up because I'm an ISTJ.\nI really hope you understand what I'm trying to say. I know that with practice , I can make amends . But then , will I be going against my natural self ? I dunno......\n\nEdit: Thank you for all your comments.... I am, just like you, not into tradition. More like effective routine. This was a huge doubt, and you guys cleared it. Thank you so much......

14	A recent post on this topic pointed out that it's not "tradition" as much as "effective routine" that ISTJs are drawn to.  In a way, most "traditions" are routines that are so effective that they've transcended into social norms.  So it's not that ISTJs like tradition for the sake of it being tradition, but ISTJs like tradition because it usually **proves** itself to be the most effective/efficient way of doing something.  Emphasis on "proves" - we're not uncritical robots that unquestioningly adopt anything people tell us is a tradition - we seek out the best ways of doing things and in the end we have a tendency to conclude that the best ways often coincide with tradition.  \n\n\nThe most important thing to know, however, is that we're not bound by our MBTI types.  Yes, a lot of how we act can be explained by the cognitive functions that comprise "ISTJ", but we're shaped by many more factors than just our MBTI type.  Be who you want to be and treat your type like a set of starting coordinates rather than a rigid box.
8	Even though we're all ISTJ's, we're all different. Our personalities will grow in different ways through our lives. If you want to hold on to openess, nothing is stopping you. 
5	Considering that a lot of posts here are people complaining about this very thing, I'd assume that 16personalities may have gotten it wrong. 
5	I'm ISTJ and 44, and I find that I respect tradition less and less as I get older (I didn't even like it that much when I was younger either.) 
4	Yessss to the effective routines comment. I am all for things that function in the best way possible or serve a distinct purpose. Holidays for example, even if I am not into Santa, I still value the tradition of my family gathering and so I find that aspect important and gladly participate. \n\nActual traditions with no significant purpose annoy me. Like being forced to announce an engagement in a news paper that no one reads anymore just because “everyone in our family does it”. \n\nI tend to go against the grain at times when I don’t think the action adds value. I don’t like to blindly follow the masses with rituals. \n\n
3	Gonna add on to others comments here.  Think about if you're an IT manager, and your company has a governance checklist it uses to review new systems before they go live.  But let's say 10% of the questions take a long time to answer and annoy the developers. Other personality types just want to scrap it because it reduces agility and speed to market. But as an ISTJ, you'd probably recall that it's also kept a lot of really bad systems from going into production until they were fixed.  So you'd want to keep the process, but mature it so those 10% are no longer blockers for quality systems. 
3	Your MBTI type does not confine you to a specific personality, it just estimates how you tend to think and behave. If you want to be "capable" and "open", then go ahead and be that person. No personality test is holding you back from that.
2	Your Si dominance will keep you focused and routine. Its part of your cognition, so at its core that will not change. (But there are other types that would give their right arm for Si's level of focus and detail, so... grass is always greener). Being aware of Si side effects is helpful to keep yourself open to new ideas and perspectives that are not our own - especially when we haven't experienced/reseached them ourselves and are trusting the word of others.\n\nTe-Aux is forever looking for facts; it looks at all sources of logic and reson and will consider them all before coming to a conclusion. So don't worry about Si. If your Te hasn't already discovered an objective truth, just knowing you can find it by accepting that you need to "be more open in this case" is a big step in the right direction to understanding yourself
2	Tradition isn't necessarily based around religion / society's tradition. You can have your own traditions with people, i.e. family reunions, thursday bowling with friends, lunch at 11am
12	Military members	Wanted to see if the population of this subreddit has any service members? \n\nI just found this subreddit and it is really interesting.\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know the military is a suggestion for ISTJ. Also, even though most Army Officers are some type of Extrovert most General Officers are ISTJ's. Glad I found this little community.
3	Captain, Army Infantry.
3	Im an istj too, but I'm not in the military. Though I am trying to become a Navy Officer by finishing college.
2	Captain, Air Force, ISR
2	Separated 1LT, Army, FA.  I was in the 82nd before I got out.
1	Retired Navy.  Surface Line.  West Coast.  That should be about enough.
1	I was an Army Officer for 12 years, got out last year. It suited many aspects of my STJ sensibilities: getting to the point, not a lot of need for small talk, telling people like it is without having to walk on eggshells, getting things done, routine, etc. I did struggle with being an I when so many expected me to be loud and boisterous and I just wasn’t. I believe many of the senior leaders are introverts. I always thought the Colonels (some) and Generals were more agreeable, calm, etc so that fits. 
1	I’m an Army Major Aviation for 10 years, now Contracting. This job does suit me for sure. While I do interest with people all day and it’s a very social job, I find it very transactional and easy. Rules and regs for everything you could think of eliminates the uncomfortable gray stuff. For the most part. I love the routine, same outfit every day. I’m sure there’s a lot more that fits with my ISTJness. 
1	Active service Coastguard officer here.
1	I’m out now. Army SGT, 25U (signal) and then 29E (electronic warfare).\nDealing with the lack of common sense and bs drove me crazy. 
1	Was a Captain in the US Army Corps of Engineers.  Just finished 18 months of traveling and pursuing my passions.  Finally looking for jobs again.  Really looking forward to having a routine again, haha.
4	What does being a “traditionalist” mean to you?	Whenever I read the description of ISTJ’s being traditional I find it a bit off-putting. I do feel strongly about duties and obligations and I value logic over emotion. I can see certain ways I prefer reliability over innovation (choosing a “secure” career field, for example). In my personal life, I’m less traditional. I’m female and traditional gender roles are flipped in our home. We eloped. I didn’t take his last name. I’m very much the type to go my own way independently regardless of what other people think of it. I find all that stuff kind of pointless. What does valuing “tradition” mean to you?
18	To me the "traditionalist" thing is less about social conservatism and preserving historical/national traditions, and more about having a set of personal "traditions" like sticking to daily routines or some activity you always do every year. My politics is quite progressive so like you I also don't relate to that stereotype of ISTJ.
5	I look at it from your "reliability" point, rather than a "blindly follow tradition for tradition's sake" perspective.\n\nI know there are plenty of business processes that follow tradition for stupid reasons, but I've also seen cases where new management has come into a situation and tossed practically everything involved in a business process because "That is the old way - we need to do it the new way!" and after a few months they realize that the old way was done for a whole host of good reasons, and they end up switching back to the old way.\n\nI read something about how conservative/traditionalists will always try to get back on their original route if presented with an obstacle, whereas others will simply seek out a different route.\n\n
3	I hate traditions. They're usually just excuses to keep doing things inefficiently or wrong. 
3	Think of it more like, " if it ain't broke don't fix it"; or as relating present moments to past experiences in order to move forward or make decisions
2	I agree with what you said. I do follow traditions for the most part, but things like gender roles and politics, I'm not very traditional.
2	Seems I fit closer to the stereotype than most of the other respondents. I'm an American and I place a very high value in the traditional American values: freedom, justice, family, national/community service, enterprise, self- sufficiency, responsibility, etc.\n\nThen again I was raised Mormon and walked away from it as a 22 year old, fresh off a 2 year mission. Now I'm atheistic.\n\nSocially I'd probably be considered libertarian. I don't care who you are attracted to, how you identify, or how you live as long as it doesn't affect me physically or financially. You don't have to worry about my feelings or opinions on the matter as long as I don't have to worry about yours. 
1	Tradition is crucially important in professions and organizations. Many fields and activities where people's lives are impacted, rely on study of existing knowledge, and following long established protocols and methodologies. It's not all about personal stuff, or innovation, on the contrary, most things that matter are all about dependability. Imagine a hospital, or a datacenter, with people going "their own way" of doing things. You want to be well treated, and you want your devices to work, reliably, then that's a job made for us boring SJ's :)
1	In modern society, being traditional is viewed as a negative and I'm sure that many ISTJ's feel the same way as you.  What is valued is individuality and being equal with others without taking into account the underlying moral structure of why those traditions were established.  Look at the world around you, everything has structure and a natural order and not attempting to understanding the underlying logic behind it is a mistake.
1	I think being "traditional" is just a stereotype. I do plenty of non-traditional things, but I do tend to get stuck in my ways/in my comfort zone. I like predictability but not necessarily social convention.
7	Relationship functions	29/F ISTJ here. Childhood was such that I subscribe to /r/raisedbynarcissists and /r/AsianParentStories and still burdens me painfully every day. Things like Silent Treatment, slamming doors, being told I shouldn't have been born, etc. have negatively affected my ability to understand interpersonal relationships and expressions of emotion. Despite this, bf and I have been together for 1.5 years now, so it's pretty serious, but not without its hardships.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am never more confused than when I'm confronted with emotions, whether they are my own or of others. Every time either bf or I gets upset, I'm overwhelmed by waves of strange feelings that I don't know how to describe or respond to, so I stay quiet, which frustrates both of us further. He's very logical, even more so than I am, but sometimes it doesn't help when I'm struggling with something that seems like it can only be understood in an emotional context. An example would be that I understand logically, it would benefit me to get over my childhood, but emotionally, it's just so painful for me to try to let go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also have difficulty keeping "relationship functions" straight -- I might have to draw out a map or something. For example, he recently got upset because I was out with a friend and didn't text back for several hours because I legit lost track of time. I offered to call him on my drive home, but he said no, and then told me later he would have wanted me to talk to him upon arriving home. I have to think about this in terms of: IF bf is upset, THEN talk in person, NOT on phone.  In addition to things like this, I also have trouble picking up on social cues, so sometimes I don't even know that bf is upset, so the sequence doesn't kick into gear appropriately.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKnowing what to do in relationships is already immensely difficult for the rest of the population, so imagine how impossible it might seem to someone who never learned proper communication or displays of affection or "intuitive" responses to conflict. I keep my physical distance when I'm thinking, to ensure the most effective points of discussion are addressed, but have also been called cold, critical, uncaring, distant, etc. I had to ask my own parents if they could hug me, ffs, and now I'm in my own relationship where I am being asked to show more affection that is so alien to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you struggle with this as well? Or, if you're in a relationship with an ISTJ, does this sound familiar?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf so, how can one improve on this?
6	I don't know how to respond to your first paragraph, so I'm not going to.\n\nDespite the stereotype, ISTJs are not emotionless robots.  We feel emotions just like everyone else.  We just don't process them very efficiently (bad programming? :P).\n\nI prefer to process my emotions in private.  Once I have worked through them, I can deal with whatever issue brought them up.  Getting other people to understand this has been somewhat problematic.\n\nPerhaps that's something you need to point out to your boyfriend ahead of time, so he'll understand why you shut down when the emotions get to the point of being overwhelming.  If he's logical and he cares about you, having that knowledge will help him be patient with you.\n\nAnd maybe in the moment when you are unsure how to process something, just tell him that.  Be like "I don't know how to process that.  I'll get back to you."\n\nAs for relationship functions, a flow chart would be great, but relationships don't usually come with one any more than the people we date come with a operating manual.  Unfortunately, those things vary from person to person anyway, so your relationship flowchart for your boyfriend probably won't work for someone else and their SO, so each of us will have to build it as we go through that relationship.\n\nAnd I just figured out how to respond to your first paragraph, so here goes: You should not measure your worth by what others think of you or how others treat you.  You can measure *their* worth by those metrics, though.  It sounds like you were raised by terrible people.  Put them behind you and move forward without looking back (all easier said than done, but worth doing, I think).  Cut ties with them completely if you have to, and just remind yourself that they're a bunch of narcissistic assholes that treated you like crap any time you start to doubt that decision.
5	I'm an INFJ in a relationship with an ISTJ. From this vantage point, I was struck by this part of your post:\n\n> For example, he recently got upset because I was out with a friend and didn't text back for several hours because I legit lost track of time. I offered to call him on my drive home, but he said no, and then told me later he would have wanted me to talk to him upon arriving home. I have to think about this in terms of: IF bf is upset, THEN talk in person, NOT on phone. In addition to things like this, I also have trouble picking up on social cues, so sometimes I don't even know that bf is upset, so the sequence doesn't kick into gear appropriately.\n\nI don't think it's necessary for you to hold yourself responsible for reading what he wants or needs when he doesn't explicitly tell you that. In other words: you can't read minds and neither you nor he should expect you to.\n\nIf he wanted you to talk with him in person, then it's on him to tell you that directly. If he doesn't communicate that to you, then you lack information.\n\nWhat he does need to know is that direct clear communication about his wants and needs is something that you need from him in communication. This is something my SO needs as well. I don't see it as a problem or something she needs to do differently. I see it as an opportunity for me to practice direct clear communication with my partner.\n\nWe have really good healthy communication with each other. The places where misunderstandings arise are places where one or both of us isn't understanding what is actually going on. Talking directly about it is the way to handle it.\n\nIt's reasonable for you to not know what he wanted in that exmple. ANd it's also reasonable IMO for you to not know if he wanted to talk in person just that one time, or if there are specific contexts in which he would want that or if it really is a more universal "rule-like" parameter for him. The only way to know these things is if he communicates them directly to you. Again, neither you nor he should expect or require you to read his mind. \n\n\n
3	In your case I think you would find therapy very rewarding. You have had a hard life, and having the help of an expert to guide you through understanding and organizing what you went through in you past would benefit your present. \n\nAnd i know i dont have all the facts, but that texting interaction with your bf you describe sounded off. You seem to be trying extremely hard to make your relationship work... Make sure hes trying just as hard: You are not just a burden afterall.

6	Metal musician's	Anyone know of any ISTJ or ESTJ metal musicians?\n\nAll I see online is people making jokes that they'd be just managers or something.
5	Yep, me ;)
3	Some music artists that are xSTJ, but not metal: \n\n*Johannes Brahams (Romantic Period classical) -ISTJ\n\n*Rivers Cuomo of Weezer (power pop/alternative rock) -ISTJ\n\n*Frank Sinatra (lounge singer) -ESTJ\n\n*Martina McBride (country) -ISTJ\n\n\nI also think a lot of non-frontmen in rock/metal bands (like drummers and bass players) could be xSTJ. xSTJs don’t really like the spotlight, despite often loving music.  
3	I am.  Black metal, very traditional and strict lol
2	[Jerry Horton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Horton) of 'Papa Roach'?\n\nNot metal for sure, but certainly Rock. 
2	I am a deathcore drummer and an ISTJ
1	I can name some ISTJ musicians, but metal musicians? Eh... maybe try drummers?\n\nMetal tends to attract a lot of Ni/Se valuers.
1	Yes I'm a metal guitarist. Got 2 song demos on youtube I've written. Here is my channel (including me playing dyers eve by metallica on guitar): [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6lzWS7YwmTMYWdisWNGibA?view\_as=subscriber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6lzWS7YwmTMYWdisWNGibA?view_as=subscriber)
16	Forgetting to reply to text messages?	Or replying too late? Others get angry and you don’t know what to do. Do you relate?
28	I just.. Intentionally don't check my messages, so there's no read receipt. Then at a later time when it's convenient, I reply
13	I tend to either respond immediately (important messages or I'm just bored and have nothing better to do) or take hours to respond (I'm busy or the message isn't important to me).
4	I always read or reply to messages only whenever I feel like it. But as for urgent and professional-related ones, I try to respond immediately. For small talks from some friends, when I see them and they bring up my not replying, I'll shrug it off and make it seem like it doesn't matter.
2	Be honest. Let people know that texting isn’t the best way to contact you or communicate. 
2	I think I just hate small talk. If it’s interesting or useful, I’m on top of it. If it’s just trying to be social-I’m out. Husband HATES it. 
2	I'm guilty of that, I reply in my head sometimes. 
1	Just yes
1	I would rather get text than a phonecall. I usually respond at once. If I see the message, but I'm busy, I just don't read it untill I have the time. 
9	INFJ needing advice on ISTJ	I suppose this isnt too complicated of a situation, so I will get to the point.\n\nI'm an INFJ female, and I find myself very intrigued by an ISTJ male. I don't know him all that well and would like to initiate conversation, but he's usually quick to leave, or he is with his friends and I don't want to interrupt them. I feel like we've had a few "moments" in which there was extended eye contact, or he would find reasons to be around me, but he saw me talking to a male friend (purely platonic friend) and those moments drifted off for awhile. \n\nHow do I talk to him and keep the conversation going with limited awkwardness? (I'm pretty shy, so I get awkward sometimes)\nHow do I tell if he enjoys being around me and is just quiet?\nHow do I know if he is interested in me more than just a friend?\n\n Thank you to everyone in advance (:
13	I’m a female INFJ married to a male ISTJ.  Good luck.  Lol ok but real talk, they tend to like concrete evidence.   They won’t read your cute signs and innuendos.  The first time we hung out in a group setting, I told my future-husband “well I feel like you’re going to end up with my number eventually anyways, do you just want to take it now?” And that was all the encouragement he needed.  Once he was certain I was into him, he did most of the pursuing.  \n\nI’d recommend finding an opportunity to just grab him for a moment and find an excuse to engage.  Compliment a piece of his outfit and ask where he got it, mention you heard him listening to a certain band, just something to get the ball rolling.  \n\nHow do you know he’s ISTJ, anyway?  School setting?
6	ENFJ with ISTJ boyfriend.\n\nBe real, honest, blunt, straight-forward, and spell everything out.\n\nI had to tell my boyfriend that I wanted to be his girlfriend and he was like, “You do?! I want you to be my girlfriend too!” as if he had been waiting forever for me to say it, because my subtle hints and other little signs I tried to show him were unnoticed by him.

2	My girlfriend is an infj and i am an istj.
1	Any way to make an unhealthy ISTJ less dutiful?	So I have a friend who is an ISTJ and I have to imagine has had an "interesting" childhood that as created issue for him that he is not aware of. \n\n'I am involved with him in a college group that deals with international students from Japan. In the last year or so he has become super interested with female students from Japan and it is sort of weird/odd. He will spend hours upon hours with them trying to get them to come to our group. However, I have to mention that your group is religious and IMO he is not trying to sleep with them. He just want to get them involved, but does this to a crazy unhealthy level where he is spending 20+ hours with them on top of school. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is convinced that what he is doing is the best for everyone no matter the costs and has it in his mind that any torture he endures will be worth it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs there any way for him to see the damages he is doing to himself when he has already convinced himself that this is his "duty"
4	How do these female students feel about him obsessing about being around them so much? Are they uncomfortable? Are they not joining the group because he pushes so hard? Is everyone just cool with his behavior?\n\nI would try to tell or show him how following “his duty” is actually a problem and isn’t actually helping anyone or anything. He thinks he’s helping, so show him how he’s NOT. Give him an alternate way to help and fulfill a duty that isn’t spending an absurd amount of time around these random girls.\n\nAlso I know you say it’s a religious group and he’s not trying to sleep with them... but I’ve never, ever met a guy who paid that much time and attention to any woman without having some sort of underlying sexual desire. He might feel ashamed of these feelings or not know what to do about them since he can’t act on them in this religious group. So he’s channeling that energy into being “a really good friend” to all these women by spending so much time with them. I have a few guy friends like this who have no idea how to deal with sexual desire and just spend hours on end making friendships with girls to cope, nearly in the same way your ISTJ friend is. Just something to think about.
7	MBTI & Music Survey (Redesign) - Need respondents!	 I created an initial version of this survey a few days ago, but after receiving feedback and reviewing many of the responses, I restructured it to increase accuracy, depth, and easier data analysis. Even if you've already taken the previously posted survey, please take this new one as well.\n\nThis is a survey searching for correlation between MBTI and musical interests such as genres, instruments, singing, dance, and composition/production. Once I get a descent amount of responses, I will post the results in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) (unless [r/istj](https://www.reddit.com/r/estj) would like me to post them here as well). I've created individual surveys for each of the 16 personality types, and the one below is SPECIFICALLY for ISTJs.\n\nThe ISTJ survey link:\n\n [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JRMGB3K](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JRMGB3K) \n\n​\n\nIf you are not an ISTJ please find the correct link for your type here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti\_music\_survey\_redesign\_need\_respondents/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti_music_survey_redesign_need_respondents/)\n\n​\n\nThanks for your responses! As I said previously, I will post the results and analysis in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) once the survey is completed.
2	You know we'd like to see results for once
1	Much better! Took it again. 
30	Shout out to you ISTJ's! From an ENFP.	Hey everyone!!\n\nI just wanted to post here to say you guys are amazing! I'm engaged to an ISTJ and hes such an amazing influence in my life. Hes hardworking, practical and loyal. He keeps me from floating away with my crazy ideas and emotions but still encourages me. You all are a special group of people who are so down to earth, its refreshing.\n\nI know he doubts himself alot, and I have no idea why. So I just wanted to quickly pop in to say you all enrich the lives of those around you, people appreciate your unique way of supporting them and making them feel loved.\n\nThank you all!
14	LOL I always find ENFPs saying this to all MBTI subs. You are precious people!
10	I'm an ENFP just celebrating 10 years of marriage to an ISTJ.
10	Thank you for sharing these kind words; very much appreciated💕
6	Thank you ❤️
8	Thank you. Now please give us a little space. 
1	What would we do without you ENFPs?? xD You guys are awesome.
12	How are you guys with your close friends?	I value friendship, but I don't like being way too close with my friends. Being super close and having to talk a lot drains me, and I prefer just hanging out literally, and be comfortable with silence.\n\nI end up cutting off one friend, together with everyone else outside my family, (bc I didn't use my social media accounts and I was unreachable through my phone) and after that, when she asked me what happened to me, if I were doing okay, and all those clingy, needy, I-need-you-to-tell-me words --- all these just kinda killed it off for me. Yeah, I'm shitty, but I just rather distance myself from her than having to explain to her how much I value personal space and time. Now she thinks I just cut her off and unfriended her, but tbh I realized how she doesn't really know me then, after all.
8	That sounds extreme to me. To be my friend I have to get to know you & how you act in different situations. \n\nOnce you’re my friend I will not exactly in which areas I can trust you and rely on you and which I can’t.\n\nBut once you’re my friend - it will take an actual conflict or you to do something bad against me/my believes for me to cut you off.\n\nI tend to understand that we all come from different places and have different ways we do things. If you are all over me and don’t give me space I will take my personal space by taking a “day or week off” from hanging out. I will also just let you know I need some time alone too, my extroverted friends learned to understand and respect that.
6	People can't read minds, my dude. If you want her to know, you need to tell her.
5	With myself and a handful of my friends are very close, but none of us talk every day. I mean myself to them. That just isn't me. I never really feel the "need" to keep in constant communication like that with other people unless it's an SO. I'll reach out to them when something particular happens or if i'm planning on inviting them out etc.
4	Out of sight, out of mind for me. Does not mean that I don't care, but for myself it takes a lot of effort on my own end to remind myself to check in with my friends and even family at times. I generally am caught up with my day to day stuff.\n\nWhen I do ultimately talk to those few friends or close family, I find myself able to just talk and talk and talk with them about anything and everything. We just pick up where we last left off.\n\n
3	I’ve always been pretty emotionally unavailable with my friends, up until the last few years when I went to therapy and realized it’s not normal to bottle everything up. Not saying that’s what you’re doing, but it is something to consider. I think as ISTJs we don’t always realize sharing ourselves with our friends is completely normal and healthy, because our default is to keep things to ourselves. 
2	MBTI & Music Survey - Please take!	[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9NYTWQR](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9NYTWQR)\n\n​\n\nThis is a survey searching for correlation between MBTI and musical interests such as genres, instruments, singing, and dance. Once I get a descent amount of responses, I will post the results on r/mbti. Thanks!\n\n​\n\nAlso, I realize that the "Genre" and "Instrument" lists are rather basic and short, but I was just trying to include the most common items for these. There's an "other" field to make them all inclusive!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n   \n**Edit: I am closing the survey for now. After reviewing many of results and receiving feedback, I am going to develop a more accurate and inclusive survey. I am also going to restructure it to ease data analysis. I will post a new and improved survey soon.** 
3	Your inclusion of "techno" which is a very specific genre and your lack of inclusion of "electronic" which is very broad is questionable and I'd fix that honestly.
1	I'm an ISTJ who runs a music and typology themed Facebook group. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd love to take this survey. Maybe I could share it with my members?
5	Where are you guys IRL ?	So what is the ISTJ s natural habitat ? Or places you tend to hang out? Are you volunteering, playing sports? Any typical hobbies? Cant seem to find you;) I have two close ISTJ female friends, and we met yrs ago in school and thru other ppl. ( Sorry for the  spelling- scandinavian F)ESTP )
19	I'm pushing the "elevator close" button rapidly so that I don't have to meet you.
14	My home haha. I don’t go out much aside from work and school. 
11	I pretty much have no desire to socialize with new people when it isn't directly related to getting something done or the natural result of frequent proximity (i.e. teammates, classmates, workmates, etc.). Not that I'm anti-social or overly awkward, but I just don't see the purpose in "making friends" with someone I may never speak to again and it's not something I naturally enjoy.\n\n​Funnily enough, I'm on Reddit because my job is exceptionally boring and would rather not engage my office mate as he is excessively talkative, opinionated, and likes to monopolize conversation.
8	At home.\nIf I'm not at home, it's most likely because I'm actually at work.
6	Probably looking at you from a distance and wanting to come talk but have no idea what to talk about.... Notice me and start a conversation damn it 😩😂
2	[deleted]
1	In the PH. Studying Public Administration but reconsidering ibto getting into ComSci or InfoTech. Nonetheless, I aspire to work in legal services or a gov't agency.
1	In the office,\n\nat my desk,\n\nmaking todo lists.
1	At the same place everyone is, chances are you interact or see reguarly.
1	Home or school
1	Home, church, social gaming, a park. That's basically it. 75% is at home.

4	ISFJ or ISTJ? Please settle once and for all, please.	I took a bucket load of MBTI tests online, and it's always between ISFJ & ISTJ, I need your help to settle this once and for all.\n\nI would describe myself as someone honest, down to earth and totally hate drama and nagging, I can be skeptic, sarcastic and slightly passive aggressive at times. \n\nPersonal life\n\nIn my personal life I'm often described as being detached and careless at times, those who know me best know that it's not entirely true, I just keep to myself a lot, that's why. I'm also described as harsh and inconsiderate when telling people what's on my mind or how I react to a certain thing, I just call things as I see them.\n\nConflict management\n\nI dislike conflict (family especially) and I hate drama, I would go out of my way to eliminate drama so I can maintain peace, I don't like sudden change such as change of plans or something going in an unexpected way, my dislike of conflict doesn't mean I won't fight for my right or stand up for myself.\n\nI have troubles dealing with emotions (mine and others), and usually fail to understand hints and what not, unless if it's communicated clearly, chances are I'll miss it.\n\nLove and relationships\n\nIn relationships I'm the loyal one, hard working and devoted, always trying to make my partner happy, I expect to get as much as I give in a relationship and when that doesn’t happen, I get really frustrated, I try to communicate my frustrations and how I feel but it’s difficult and never quite as I imagine it in my head, I tend to shutdown after fights / big arguments and I would stop talking to them for days on end.\n\nWhen I see that things are heading towards a dead end, I try my best to rescue what can be rescued, then walk away when all efforts are futile.\n\nFriendships\n\nI have a lot of acquaintances but very few friends, I enjoy a lot of alone time reading or browsing the internet, socializing is a grueling task to me, which I avoid often, I either go silent or talk a lot, sadly I have no medium there, mostly talking about past experiences, I suffer from anxiety and OCD (not sure if relevant or not).\n\nI’m formal even with my close friends and appreciate the smallest effort.\n\nI'm an organized person, I keep detailed notes of everything: journals, expenses, notes, and I vent on paper, my room isn't always tidy but I clean it often (once a week at least).\n\nProfessional life\n\nAt work I go by the book most of the time, I'm strict and orderly and often described as the tough teacher, I prefer to go by the rules and regulations, unless they make no sense to me, then I will bend them, that's when something seems to be out of order. I put a lot of effort into work and make sure it's done right, then do some more. If I'm not convinced by a task or if it's contradicts with a value of mine, I won't do it, I would go as far as quitting a job if I feel it doesn't satisfy my goals or that I'm not going forward or being held down by management, despite following rules and regulations I'd rebel if I feel that I'm being treated unfairly and would walk away if my rightful demands aren't met (I am usually reasonable and realistic in my demands and I don't go overboard with them).\n\nDislikes and pet peeves\n\nIn life in general I value order, I hate traffic jams, loud noises, whiny children, inconsistent people – this ranks up pretty high on my pet peeve list -, I also dislike contradicting people. I always think of ways to solve problems and make things run more smoothly, even if I don't voice them out clearly.\n\nHow I get things done\n\nI tend to experiment with stuff (methods of doing things, computer software, etc), once I'm set with a good way of doing things I keep repeating it until I master it, and it would take something better for me to drop the old way of doing things and migrating to something new.\n\nI learn by doing, I usually would skip checking the manual until something won't be resolved, I guess I learn by trail and error.\n\nI like being productive and finding the best way to do things, best being sometimes easier, done in less time or costs less.\n\nI don't mind routine in certain things but generally like to keep things fresh, like when I'm teaching a subject I like to use new examples and ways to keep the topic interesting rather than repeating the same material over and over every semester.\n\nShopping\n\nWhen shopping I always hunt for affordable items and rarely break the bank for something, I'd go as far as saying that I'm a minimalist, as I hate stockpiling things without putting them to use, I also like hunting for the best deal available and try to make use of sales when possible. I also enjoy fixing old things and maintaining things running for as long as possible, even more than shopping for new things.\n\nLife overview\n\nI have a darker perspective on life which many people consider pessimistic or down right depressing, I'm just being realistic, that's all.\n\nI tend to point out the negative things and it’s hard for me to see the positive side of things (possible with effort, perhaps due to upbringing or current living conditions?).\n\nI compare my life to the past a lot, and often reminisce about things that happened, I somehow think it's better than the present.\n\nI'll cross post this to /r/isfj as well.
6	My SO is ISTJ and a good friend is ISFJ, so that's my experience base when reading this post (I myself am INFJ)\n\nI agree with the other comments that you seem more in line with an ISTJ info processing preferences than ISFJ. I don't have tons of time to go through the whole OP, but this part really stood out for me in this regard:\n\n>Professional life\n\n>At work I go by the book most of the time, I'm strict and orderly and often described as the tough teacher, I prefer to go by the rules and regulations, unless they make no sense to me, then I will bend them, that's when something seems to be out of order. I put a lot of effort into work and make sure it's done right, then do some more. If I'm not convinced by a task or if it's contradicts with a value of mine, I won't do it, I would go as far as quitting a job if I feel it doesn't satisfy my goals or that I'm not going forward or being held down by management, despite following rules and regulations I'd rebel if I feel that I'm being treated unfairly and would walk away if my rightful demands aren't met (I am usually reasonable and realistic in my demands and I don't go overboard with them). \n\nNot only does this seem very Te-Fi to me in its basic description, but it also meshes closely with some information and stories I've gotten from my ISTJ SO about her approach to work life.
4	You sound almost exactly like me. So, maybe that helps a bit. 
3	You sound like an ISTJ. I'm married to one. He has anxiety issues as well and is generally pessimistic. Not that that means anything to you though. :P But anyways, your attitude at work is very Si-Te, which I noticed other people said as well so I won't copy the text in. The problem here is that all Si doms tend to dislike conflict, be passive aggressive and cautious because of how memories and past experiences affect them. So, an ISTJ and easily look like an ISFJ. An ISTJ however will strongly value efficiency. So they'll change up how they do things if they learn a better or faster way to do it. An ISFJ won't necessarily care and will just keep doing it the way they've always done it as long as it works. The struggle to deal with emotions also sounds Te/Fi.  The harsh, inconsiderate "say what's on your mind" approach is also Te. \n\nAlso, an aux Te will care about solving interpersonal relationships when it comes to those close to them. That's Fi. If it's a personal connection, an ISTJ can care very deeply. They just won't necessarily care about the..less..intimate(?)  relationships. 
2	ISTJ. \n\nThe tests are imperfect.
2	ISTJ. It was kinda obvious that you are a thinking type... ;) thanks for sharing a good amount of details tho.

1	Sure as fuck not an isfj, unless of course your self description is garbage. Describe your thought process more. What information do you work with? What do you find funny? Shit that doesn’t just say who you are or what you do. Types are descriptions of thought processes.
1	Perfect description of ISFJ \n\nAux extroverted thinking doesn't give a damn about solving interpersonal relationship type problems, and yet clearly from your self description that seems to be the dominant way you interact with external reality (Fe as opposed to Te which is not interested in interpersonal relationships at all)\nThe rest of it I concur you are a dominant introverted sensor Si \n\nFyi how you approach learning by doing is not Te it's Si so you got that part right. \n\nMost of your description is Si the organising functions and all that, then when I read how you relate to the world, all I see is you care about your relationships and that's hard out Fe 
0	ISFP(M) dating ISTJ(F) AMA	I'm an ISFP guy who's been with an ISTJ girl for about 1 1/2 years. If you want to know what it's like to be in a relationship with one of you guys, now is your chance 😁
2	What’s the biggest struggle?\nWhat’s the best thing about ISTJ for you?\n
1	What attracted you to her?
24	What are your thoughts on marriage?	I take marriage very seriously. To me it's a solemn vow of my complete commitment to my partner. I know that *I* will be completely loyal and put everything I can into keeping the relationship fulfilling, but at the same time, it fills me with anxiety as I can never know how my partner may be. And for that reason alone, I find myself very hesitant to enter into marriage at all. I know that's a pretty jaded way of thinking, but I can't be certain that other person will take it as seriously as I will. 
12	I'm very much into commitment and being loyal, so much so that it's a fault. I was with someone who was very emotionally abusive for 15 years. I kept telling myself that relationships are work, that it's not easy all the time, that I shouldn't break my vows because I entered into them willingly and needed to do better, be better to live up to my commitment. Finally, I think some sort of survival instinct kicked in and I basically pushed them away to the point that *they left me*. Sat me down on the front porch and told me they were no longer in love with me. Moved out the next day...I was so, so relieved.\n     \nSeveral years later and after a long time as a couple before making it official, I'm remarried. This time with someone who is a lot more like me, actually an ESTJ. All about rules and planning and commitment, loyalty. Willing to accommodate my personal rules and lack of flexibility at times. Just a bit more ready to take action (and bring me along) instead of rethinking to the point of inaction. I've never been happier or healthier. They're a bit more nurturing than me and better at openly communicating. Taught me to speak up when I'm upset or something isn't right, and we work it out 50/50. \n\nMy 2 cents when comparing both....\n\nSO1 was my opposite, very spontaneous and outgoing. There was never a plan, only here and now. And if I didn't go along with it, I was a Debbie Downer. It was exciting for a while to step out of my comfort zone and get crazy. But there was no security, no long-term consideration of consequences or outcomes. We were constantly broke, like putting ikea furniture in the fireplace to keep warm because the electricity got turned off broke. They took out credit cards, racked them up and didn't pay. Took jobs and quit them because their boss wasn't nice or wanted them to come in after being out sick with a cold for 3 straight days. They went to college, never finished. Went to beauty school but quit because their hands hurt. \n\nSO2 was a wild child way back in the day but knew when it was time to grow up. Despite not going to college, they worked steadily and ambitiously and now has a great leadership position and team to manage. We plan our weekends during the week, put together lists, make sure we have time for fun and time to clean house, grocery shop. We have a plan A-C for activities. We have a plan for the future and diligently set aside $ for fun stuff, like buying a spa for the house, and $ for retirement. They research everything as well which is amazing. We are looking at buying a second car, they now know everything about that car, the trim levels, packages, etc. And of course, it's a practical vehicle, within our budget, and on several lists for excellent resale value. \n\nFor me, it's been night and day...it just took me a long, long time to figure out that opposites attract but longevity requires someone a lot more like yourself. 
14	Not just marriage, but moving in with someone to me is when life starts. Just coming home to someone and having that security and love sounds so good. As a 24yo guy i just really look forward to that and overcoming all the uncertainty of dating.\n\nI thought i found the one and was heartbroken when i recently got blindsided by the break up, i hope it doesnt change the way i see marriage in the future.
6	It's a serious commitment and not one to be entered into for trivial reasons (which I think most people do, unfortunately).  Too many people have the wrong priorities when they consider marriage and relationships in general.  Its primary function is to help ensure kids are raised in the best possible environment so I don't see much point in getting married if a couple isn't going to have kids.\n\nI also think religious matrimony >>> secular "marriage" which is essentially just an official change in title for your relationship. \n\nPersonally, I look forward to getting married, provided I find a suitable partner.  Unfortunately, that is easier said than done in today's culture.
9	An excuse for someone to take half my stuff after they cheat on me. No thanks. 
6	Personally I don't believe in marriage. \n\nThe need of a piece of paper to show your commitment to each other and feel more secure about the relationship makes no sense at all to me and just hints at trust issues.\n\nPlus it's crazy expensive. Not only to have a wedding but also if you do end up getting a divorce which, lets be honest here, is becoming more and more common in this day and age.
6	I’m married to an ISTJ (I’m an ENFP.) I believe in marriage, and in commitment, loyalty, honesty.
3	At this point, I'm beginning to think the Ferengi Lease model is looking better than hunting for someone who would take marriage seriously. I'd have to be sure whomever I marry understands the commitment and the general population doesn't give me very promising data. Worst case is I'll stay single and let this instant gratification culture burn itself out.
2	ISTJ M, I like the idea of marriage but dont see myself going through with it. I think it just makes things more complicated and in the end if one is unhappy they can easily leave. But on the flipside if a couple is  happy together then they can do the same things a married couple would do. 
3	I'm recently divorced (18 yr marriage with ENFJ). So take this for what it's worth.\n\nAlthough the relationship began to feel empty a few years before the end, I took my commitment very seriously, and fought to save my marriage at the end. My ex left.\n\nThere's no guarantee the person you marry will remain the same person throughout your relationship. Someone who's 100% all-in at the beginning can change over time, regardless of personality type. \n\nPay VERY CLOSE attention to any red flags you see in the relationship. If the thought of marrying this person makes you think, "Yeah, I think I can do this", DO NOT MARRY THAT PERSON! \n\nEventually in any marriage, one person leaves the other, either through death or divorce. People don't like to think about that.\n\nGet a pre-nup. If they balk at the suggestion, they're not ready for marriage and aren't in it for the right reasons. 
1	It's good and all, just not for me.
1	IMHO marriage is a legal contract with health care benefits and tax breaks, and pretty much is used in religious/traditional/patriarchal systems to attempt to ensure whose kids are whose.  (INTJ)
35	Tell me about it	
17	5.3% of logisticians like to be approached while shopping? pretty sure it's actually 0%. \n\nif i want/need assistance, i'll ask for it.
7	Gahhh this is so true. Sometimes I won't even go into a store even if I really want to because I know the workers will bombard me. 
1	I don’t like it either, and I’m an ENFP.
1	Hmm.  Maybe it's the *browsing* bit, which I hate doing in general, but I usually want to have assistance.  Usually, I know what I want, and hate searching for it, so I welcome the assistance of someone who should know the inventory.  If the employee is competent, it speeds the process of shopping.  If I am actually just browsing, then I have no issue letting the employee know.
1	Do not assist me until I ask for your assistance.  (intj)
1	Professional Logistician and INTJ here with borderline ISTJ tendencies, according to many MBTI tests, but I must say that I HATE being approached by workers in a store.  I spent enough time in retail to know that most people there don't really care about or know what they are talking about.  They simply are making sure they don't get in trouble with the boss for ignoring you.  There's not much more frustrating when shopping, and you've done three times more research than the person selling the item.  Just leave me alone, and I'll let you know if I'm going to steal something first.  Then again, I suppose most logisticians are not going to be INTJ or ISTJ.  I'm in the industry by chance.  It's just where life has taken me.
2	Am i an istj?	i get tested as istp but i am very suspicious i might be another type and am trying to find out what.\n\n-i don't like fixing things with my hands like the typical istp\n\n-i like problem solving and analyzing but in other ways than with your hands(ex: figuring out stocks)\n\n-i am usually reserved but around people i know/just get a long with i can be outgoing\n\n-my fashion sense is kinda plain but with just enough style imo, not crap\n\n-i work in spurts of energy and usually procrastinate(motivates me)\n\n-i don't really know what i want to do career wise and i wish i could kind of just do my own thing but that has to work out perfect imo.\n\n-i like investments and want to look further into how to make good ones but feel i need to learn with time although im doing pretty good imo\n\n-i do care about people but i don't think im the most caring either\n\n-usually easy going but if you rub me the wrong way i can be cold although if you are someone i know i will give you the benefit of the doubt\n\n-hobbies include sports, fishing, gaming, listening to music, buying stuff(maybe clothes), stocks and investments but i need to get more money haha\n\n-in a way i kind of care what people think but then i dont at the same time. i want to be happy and not have to follow the social "norms" all the time to be accepted while making it harder on myself to basically please others.\n\n-don't like doing things that dont make sense\n\n-when plans are made i prefer for them to follow through but understand they can change.\n\n-don't mind working in teams especially if i get a long with or can work with the group members but i can also work alone.\n\nso what do you guys think? \n\n\noh i also saw some thing of an istp type of convo i guess and i was like damn that's fucked up... i def care more about not being offensive with what i say and usually only say something kind of offensive when i am joking around(but i say it in a joking way and im sure it is obvious). i usually only "trade blows" when someone is being unreasonable and i feel like i usually never start it, especially with really rude comments(apparently istps don't care, and i do)
3	Well...to answer your title, you definitely aren't ISTJ. \n\nI agree, I think you're either ISTP or ISFP. Just keep in mind that "ISTPs need to fix things and are all mechanics" is a stereotype, and you shouldn't type yourself based on stereotypes. 
3	[deleted]
1	dont have to be any particular type of personality to be an asshole, just sayin'.
1	What you say/do/think/feel doesnt determine your type, but *why* you say/do/think/feel they things you do. \n\nFor example, saying i have a clean yet quirky dress style thats all my own doesnt make me an ISTJ... but explaining my motivation would give greater insight: even if i might have a lot in my closet, i have some reliable staples that i really like and always wear beacuse i know i look good and feel good in them, so i rarely bother to change it up until i need to buy new clothes.\n\nSo it would help if you explain the deeper motivations behind what you've listed.
0	Not sure why you're getting the vitriol... I usually test ISTP but am most definitely not one. I too like to invest, like to have nice clothes and things when I can get them, have a healthy level of care about what others think of me, and prefer to be cordial with people. It even sounds like I have more inclination than you towards working with my hands, but unlike an ISTP it isn't a natural inclination for tools/mechanics but rather a response to the cost of those things versus learning to do them yourself.\n\nAnswer in terms of function:\n\nDo you prefer small groups of close friends (I), or large groups of aquaintances (E)?\n\nDo you prefer realistic and practical representations of life (S), or do you prefer to see life as the embodiment of interconnected forces within the universe (N)?\n\nDo you prefer to make decisions informed by past experience and/or research (T), or are you happy to make decisions based on relationships and associations (F)?\n\nDo you PREFER to have plans before action and designated places for your things (J), or do you PREFER to be free to respond in the moment (P)?\n\nThat last one sounds like you are getting hung up because you understand that plans usually require in the moment changes. If you prefer to have the plan at all then you are more J than P. Being easy-going, laid back, go with the flow, and procrastinating doesn't automatically mean you're a P, it simply means you don't have a dog in the fight or you've learned it is easier to live in a fluid/responsive way than a rigid one (maybe you were raised by a P type, or maybe you have experience general instability in your early life). Procrastination in particular is usually a symptom of advanced capability (you can adequately complete the task under pressure at the last minute and don't require the additional time) and some level of indifference towards the task. Again this doesn't indicate anything about your personality, at least in MBTI terms. 
7	How badly did I screw this up?	I spent about a year getting close to a male (24) ISTJ, and have only recently fully gained his trust.  We had planned to hangout a few nights ago, but as that time came around one of my friends came into town and we decided to go out.   I didn't know how he'd take it if I told him I wasn't gonna hangout with him because I was going out with him, so I texted him and told him that I was feeling tired and we'd hangout later.  \n\nOf course he found out, and he gave me the cold shoulder for a good week before he finally brought it up.   He told me that it stung a bit that he got moved to the back burner, but what he couldn't forget is that I wasn't completely honest with him.  He said that lying, regardless of the size of the lie, was the fastest way to completely burn our friendship.\n\nI'm not sure why I created a reddit just to ask this question, or what I'm even looking for... I just care about him a lot, and he's been such a big part of my life this past year.   I know I screwed up and should have just been honest, but there's gotta be something I can do to make it up?   I understand that ISTJ's are very direct, honest, stubborn, and don't give away their loyal friendships quickly.   Because of this, I'm concerned that I turned something so small into an irreparable mistake...\n\nIs this a common way for you guys to act when someone lies to you?
23	[deleted]
16	>I didn't know how he'd take it if I told him I wasn't gonna hangout with him because I was going out with him \n\nI'm not sure I understand this statement.  Are you saying "Hey, since we're dating and I see him all the time, I can back burner him, but I'm afraid he'll get butthurt if I tell him that"?\n\n>so I texted him and told him that I was feeling tired and we'd hangout later\n\nTranslation: So I lied to him.\n\n>He told me that it stung a bit that he got moved to the back burner, but what he couldn't forget is that I wasn't completely honest with him.   He said that lying, regardless of the size of the lie, was the fastest way to completely burn our friendship. \n\nThat sounds about right.\n\nSo, if I understand the situation correctly, here's what you should have done (assuming it is true):\n\nContact your ISTJ and say "Hey, I know we were planning on hanging out, but I just found out an old friend is coming into town. I don't get ot see them that often, and I don't know when I'll get to see them again, so I need to cancel our plans."\n\n>but there's gotta be something I can do to make it up? \n\nMaybe. \n\nStep 1) Say to your ISTJ: "I know I screwed up by lying to you.  I should have told you the truth.  I will never do it again."\n\nStep 2) This is important: NEVER DO IT AGAIN.\n\nStep 3) Profit.
15	ISTJs place so much value in honesty, loyalty and reliability... Not only did you show your friend that you lack those qualities, but it was a personal betrayal against him. Actions will always speak louder than words to an ISTJ. \n\nThe only way to reconcile that i see is if you are truly upset with what you did, then explain that to your friend, tell them why you did it, why you were wrong, why its a flaw, and how youre working to change. If you can turn this into a learning moment, a chance for personal development, theres a chance your ISTJ friend could respect that enough to give you a second chance.
7	I'm unclear about your desired relationship with him.  \n\nRomantic feelings or just friends?\n\nA "little white lie" isn't usually a deal breaker for my ISTJ feelings.  I wouldn't be happy about it, but I would understand the reason behind the lie.\n\nI don't think anyone on the Myers-Briggs scale would appreciate being lied to.\n\nIs it possible he told friends your "I'm tired" excuse, they saw you out with the other dude, and teased him because of it?\n\nIf he was humiliated by other people that might explain his anger.\n\nMy recommendation:  Explain that you lied to not hurt his feelings, and suggest something fun for the two of you to do to make it up to him.
5	My last relationship started out with a couple situations like this. She never did fully get my trust back and it was eventually our downfall. Even though I knew she wasnt the type of person to cheat. It was that it felt like she thought so little of me; like I was too dumb to be able to understand her wanting to hang out with a friend. Even though I always encouraged her to do whatever she wanted. But then again, in my case it happened twice. 
3	yeahhh... never lie to an istj lol. i have an istj friend as well and trust means a lot to him. i would take the advice to apologize to him and see what he says. 
4	It'll take a while to earn back his trust. Just be patient.\n\nAnd yes, I can identify with his feelings. Although I'm not sure about the "regardless of the size of the lie" statement; at least for me. \n\nI'd be a little hurt if you had told me that a friend had come into town and you needed to cancel. But I'd get over that faster than being lied to. 
4	I don't need to reiterate the obvious about what a terrible light you placed yourself in by being cowardly and a liar, so I'll move right to the fix. Tell him you are sorry. Tell him what you did was wrong. Explain your reasoning for why you did it, but then add that now you've had time to reflect, you have realized the error of your ways and you understand the gravity of it and what it must mean to him. Tell him you will never do it again and earnestly ask him to please allow you to earn his trust back. \n\nThen you make good on your promise and never lie to him again. You also strive to earn his trust back and keep your impatience in check if you decide he's moving too slowly in trusting you again.\n\nSide note, you found it necessary to mention his gender by saying he was a male ISTJ but then failed to mention the gender of the friend visiting. This immediately made me not only think that the friend was another male, but that your penchant for being less than forthcoming runs deeper than you let on. Of course, I could be wrong and it was a female, but the lack of reciprocity in your descriptive ness stood out to me.
3	Honesty is a big thing for me. I'm always honest, and I expect the people close to me to be honest aswell. I think it would be good to just apologize, and say you've learned that he prefers the truth over a white lie.\n\nAlthough honesty is important for me, it takes a lot for me to dislike the people that are close to me. It takes some repitition before I decide that I don't like a person. Hope it works out!
2	> He said that lying, regardless of the size of the lie, was the fastest way to completely burn our friendship. \n\nEh, 'regardless of the lie' is a bit on the extreme side, even for an ISTJ. I think I'd be hurt. I think I'd be annoyed, but I don't think this would burn our friendship. Not the first time at least. The second time you did it, we probably wouldn't talk for a while; much, MUCH longer than a week.
2	To my knowledge, it's never happened, but if someone lied to me like that, they'd be unlikely to ever get really close to me again. I might still hang out with them, but I'd always remember the LIE.  I agree with the general consensus that your best bet is some serious groveling.
1	Not necessarily impossible to come back from, but it won't be easy.  We might not be happy about a hard truth, but a lie is infinitely worse.  I'd say the fact that he's talking to you again means you have a chance at least.
1	Some personality types may do well with white lies, but probably not most. ... Keep in mind that if you lied to this guy that his anger/disapproval can be to protect his agreeable/insecure desire to be a core part of your life. Can you do something (without making any unnecessary purchase) to let him know that he means a lot to you?
-2	Don't let one small mistake turn your mind upside down. People make mistakes and im sure he knows that. Just give him a sincere apology and learn. If he would hold a grudge for one petty incident then thats on him. 
5	ISTJ and all I crave is new experiences	Anyone going through same thing? Is that my inferior function kicking in or what\n\nAs a kid I could definitely see ISTJ qualities, but right now in my mid 20s all I want is to explore new places, cities, countries. I want to meet new people and push for new experiences and be somewhat careless!\n\nI am bored with doing same things on daily basis and started traveling whenever I can to the point my extroverted friends are surprised.\n\nEdit: don’t get me wrong I still get anxious about future, and while a bit careless I still have strong morals, loyalty, and the sense of practical matters.
5	Maybe you're not an ISTJ ? 
1	I’m around the same age and I feel exactly the same way\n\nI’ve already started out new activities and experiences, planning trips abroad and all. All the while still maintaining the stability I have at home and work.\n\nIt’ll be tough to work out at first, and you’ll feel all over the place, but it’ll work itself out eventually. 
1	Sounds a lot like Se to me
5	What is the major difference between an ISTJ and an ESTJ?	I recently took the MBTI and it stated that I was an ISTJ, after reviewing the information pertaining to ISTJ's I realized that alot of it was pretty spot on.\n\nHowever, about two or three years ago I took the 16 personalities test and it stated that I was in fact an ESTJ. Most of the things related to an ESTJ I feel as though were pretty spot on as well.\n\nAfter taking the MBTI my friend who actually told me about the personality tests thinks strongly that I'm an ESTJ. I personally think I'm somewhere in between because I am somewhat extraverted but I can be and use to be super introverted. \n\nAny thoughts on this?
7	In general, an ISTJ wants stability first, and an ESTJ wants productivity first. An ESTJ will also be more likely to sacrifice relationships and values for productivity where an ISTJ would be more loyal to their close relationships and values. But if you don't have ISTJs and ESTJs in your life to observse, it might be hard to gauge the difference in yourself.\n\nOverall, if you're not sure if you're an E or an I, I ask people this: how long can you go without human interaction before you really start to *need* it? Two days... or two weeks?
7	I'm an ISTJ and my wife is an ESTJ, and everything being said here is very spot on. 
5	Best way to tell them apart:\n\nESTJ values money, power, status and contextual/subjective judgement \n\nISTJ values problem-solving, possibilities, honor and consistent/objective judgment. 
6	ESTJs lead with Te, which makes them a leader first, while ISTJ leads with Si, which makes them an observer first. ESTJs prefer to deal with large groups of people, or organizations. ISTJs prefer to deal with smaller groups, or individuals. ISTJ have better Si, which does translate to good memories, liking routine, and a sense of familiarity of place. ESTJs tend to switch between Si and Ne a lot, and have a creative streak, can be good writers/artists. I sometimes mistake them for intuitives :P
2	I suggest you learn the [functions](https://www.careerplanner.com/8CognitiveFunctions/Cognitive-Functions-Simply-Explained.cfm). ESTJ have primary Te, meaning they're more likely to organize/critique the people  around them,,, unsolicited.   \n\n\nOf course they're also extroverts so they're more likely to seek the spotlight and be visible leaders in their field or communities.
6	Quickly judged by ISTJ online	Hi guys! I m a ESTP (F) scandinavian , in good shape,stable job and with close friends and sporty hobbies. So I matched with a guy and we followed eachothers Instagram. I try to strike up conversation. But he eventually responds with; I dont think we will be a good match, sorry.. of course in a more polite manner;) . I dont have any risky pictures of myself, only being active in sports, kayak, or normal pictures with friends. So my question is; do you quickly judge people, and how? I know I can judge quite quickly because of percieving clues about a person. How do you judge people and why?( did not get the chance to tell about my own personality type, so maybe he thought I want a really outdoorsy fella, when all I want is someone to complement me) - Sorry for the long post! 
10	People fit patterns and it's like watching a rerun. You associate with the experience you had before and make a judgement. I quickly judge foods just on how they look, don't need to smell or taste it. If it looks like it's pumped full of liquid egg (ranch, Mayo, etc)  I'm not interested.  \n\n\nLikewise with people... I have a new (ENTP) coworker that has emotional outbursts/a temper and likes to catcall women.  \n\n\nJust from a couple of days I could tell I wanted nothing to do with him. Of course I find out he has a beautiful girlfriend that he talks badly about and I felt pretty justified in judging him a dumb-ass early on.
3	When I was younger I didn't really know what I wanted in a partner so I was willing to give anyone a chance if they were interested.\n\nYears later, I still don't really know what I want, but I have a much better sense of what "clicks" for me.  If we're going off MBTI functions, us ISTJs have dominant Si which is really great at recognizing patterns and details and sorting them based on prior experience.  For example, when it comes to online dating, I know I don't mix with strong extraverts.  If I saw your profile and there were mostly pictures of you with large groups of friends, I'd assume you put more value on social experiences than I like and rather than talk to you and see if we click anyway (probably the healthier option) I'd opt to spend that time looking for a better likely match instead.
3	He could just not be into sports if that's the only quality that he had to judge you by.\n\nI do feel that I can sometimes be too swift to lump people into categories.
2	I think whether people mean to or not, they have this image of what they are and/or are not looking for in a potential date when giving online dating a try. I don't think that has much to do with personality types though.\n\nAs for me personally, when I'm not feeling a click during a chat, I prefer to just call it a day sooner rather than later instead of wasting my time and their time any longer.
4	Asking ISTJs, from an INTJ, what do you as an ISTJ, feel is the difference between us in terms of social/career/romantic skills?	Obviously the two are certainly similar, and yes you can just see which traits are different. But I just mean in your personal opinion, in your own words, what do you believe are the major differences, what things are each other better/worse at ? Just in your opinion nothing here is going to be set in stone of course. I just want to see some perspective. 
10	My SO is an INTJ. Not sure if this is related to the S versus N difference, but he is more “big picture” and I’m more “small detail”. He likes to think of me as grounding him to reality, but sometimes it causes us to butt heads.\n\nI’ll often poke holes in his ideas, which (rightfully so) annoys him. He will say “hey, wouldn’t this be a cool business idea?!” and I will have a response like “well, you’d need to consider x, y, z... also a, b, c doesn’t quite make sense...” and nit-pick all of the details until he’s just regrets bringing it up in the first place.\n\nHe will think towards the future and try to make big plans, whereas that can stress me out sometimes, thinking about all of the little details that need to go into it. For example, he wants to move apartments to a bigger and more expensive place which we will probably only stay at for 1 year before moving states. To me, this is completely illogical, we will have to pay new pet deposits, move all of our furniture, etc. just to do it all again in a year. Didn’t seem to bother him at all, but it’s stressing me out.\n\nIn terms of work, he wants to rise that ladder. He jokes about being a CEO someday. He is introverted yes, but sees himself as a manager one day (we are early in our careers). I for one never want to manage people. I’m honestly content just being a worker bee and getting shit done. I’m not unmotivated, and we both care about our success. But I don’t care about rising the ranks, whereas he does.\n\nTL;DR: My INTJ SO is a dreamer and big picture guy, I (ISTJ) nit-pick small details 
5	I'm not super familiar with INTJs but from what I gather INTJs are more creative. When tasked with something, an INTJ may think of different ways they can complete the task. An ISTJ may think how many ways the task has been completed already, and choose the most effecient one.
3	If youre questioning your type, just say it
1	Since I’m not really familiar with INSJ, why don’t you provide a situation, and what your thoughts are, and how you would respond?\n\nI could then tell you where I agree or differ. \n\nYou could do a simple interaction like at work or something more personal with your family or close friends, but keep in mind the dynamics of families can skew perspectives. 
1	As an ISTJ dating an N-type, I have noticed several differences already. I tend to be the more dogmatic and conventional one. We're better at going off of previous experience and tend to crumble in new or unfamiliar situations. That kind of spans the gap.
1	I guess the most obvious one that pops up for me is the way we treat rules. I'm very happy to follow rules, guidelines and authority (not blindly of course, but generally I like to follow even the small pointless ones). I like structure and order to my life, not in a 'neat-freak' way, but in a 'I need to know what comes next' way. For example, I stress about being on time way more than my INTJ friend. I guess in my experience, in everyday life we're just a little less chill and you guys are a little more daring. \n\nOP, I suggest you look up 'functions' though. They're confusing, but it's just something you said about being "60% intuitive" that irked me. You can't be borderline IS/NTJ, MBTI doesn't work like that, and these two types are actually significantly different. 16personalities is a good starting point, but that's really all it is. 
1	I knew one. She was too logical and inside the box. Friggen annoying. It's a love/hate thing. We would never get along, but we do, cuz we can fight so easily, and still not completely hate each other.\n\nShe needs to be more open minded, and not judge the things I think, but if she's not doing that, she isn't being herself. Quite the lose/lose. \n\nSo yeah, too critical. 
4	Career change advice	Anyone here with a career in IT because I need some advice on where exactly to start in that particular field. I’m currently working in retail management and it’s tiresome and draining. The work itself doesn’t fulfill me at all and the constant rush of customers is hell. I’ve never really been a tech savvy person but dealing with less people face to face 40 hours a week would be a nice change. 
3	(in the UK at least) working on a Service Desk is the best place to start, you don't need massive IT knowledge as you will learn and pick things up as you go. After a year or 2 you can work your way up through other teams, 2nd line or applications support etc with the experience learnt. As someone who has been in IT now for almost 8 years (started as an Apprentice) I'm actually looking for a career change. It's more the Users stupidity which I can't take much more and looking for a career that has less user interaction. Though, I feel due to being ISTJ I've always been one of the top techs within my departments, just being efficient at work and providing good customer service (email/over the phone/face to face) and can easily work your way through a company. Good luck! 
1	ISTJ in IT here.  I'll echo the commonality of starting a call center type position as an entry, especially for those without any (IT) hardware background or MS certification (possibly previously referred to as "product packages").  In my own case, I had both a hardware background and a MS Certification (in a worthless OS, but HR departments don't pay attention to the version of your cert, just to the fact that your resume contains the right acronym).  I started hardware work almost four decades ago by constructing (from a kit) an H-89 personal computer which, along with my 24-pin dot matrix printer, got me through college.  \n\nBy happenstance, I later enrolled for the MS MCSE+I certification through a world-wide, well-known company and got at least enough exams passed for the MCSE part...in Windows NT (that puts a time line on things).  The ensuing class-action lawsuit regarding failure to follow all of California's educational statutes resulted in a full cash refund of my "training package", so even though the MCSE version I have is worthless, at least it was free.  This enabled me to enter the hardware support work force of IT departments without having to serve a single day at a call center.  \n\nJust another data point.

8	How utilitarian is an ISTJ?	I was wondering if ISTJ have similar results in this utilitarianism test. \n\n[http://www.jimaceverett.com/test/oxford-utilitarianism-scale/](http://www.jimaceverett.com/test/oxford-utilitarianism-scale/)\n\nI'm an ISTJ and scored 26 out of 63 in Overall Utilitarianism, 17 out of 35 in Impartial Beneficence and 9 out 28 in Instrumental Harm. My friends (one ISTP, the others I don't know) are shocked by how low my results are.

1	I took the test twice as a sort of experiment to myself, and here's what I came up with:\n\n1st Time - 21/10/11 - This time I picked answers that I feel are more in line with the way I was taught as opposed to how I really feel...more of a Nurture over Nature approach I guess.\n\n2nd Time - 43/15/28 - This time I did the opposite and picked answers that I really felt were correct as opposed to what I've been taught...more of a Nature over Nurture approach.\n\nIf I was forced to make a decision like this out in the "real world" I would probably choose more like the first time, but if I could make the decision anonymously I would probably choose more like the 2nd time.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

5	Childhood neglect is a serious issue that many people don’t talk about. It’s like how the article describes that it’s an invisible issue because there’s an absence of care. \n\nI definitely grew up in an emotionally unresponsive environment, especially in my later childhood and on. I’m trying to work on expressing my emotions and be more reflective of how I feel. It’s tough because I wasn’t raised to do those things and often felt ashamed of feeling. \n\nI think a large part of growing into adulthood is realizing the unhealthy tendencies that we internalized from our family and how to overcome them. So that we don’t repeat the same things for our children. 
2	Part of me totally resonates with this article, and another part of me really feels like this is another extrovert/feeling person assuming that my introvert/thinking personality makes me flawed somehow. My mom is also an ISTJ and my dad is an ENFJ; I definitely don't remember there being a ton of "touchy-feely" moments growing up, but I also don't really fee deprived of anything, I truly believe that my parents did their best raising me. I scored 16 1/2 on the questionnaire (I really feel like one of the questions had both a yes and no answer), but I really think that most of those just kinda go along with being an ISTJ. 
11	Advice for dealing with an emotion-based world.	I have always had trouble operating in the very emotional/feelings based modern world. As someone who has always been very harshly realistic in my approach to life (due to my personality and personal experiences), I have felt alienated in most of my young life. I have a graduate job interview coming up next week with a prestigious organisation that is very... ideologically based (politically and culturally) and while it is my ideal job as it is based on my studies the culture honestly scares the crap out of me.\n\nI don't agree with the ideology at all and frankly, I believe that even if I try to act and gain rapport, my natural lack of agreeableness (1% when I tested it) will protrude during my show. Logically I don't really care about that sort of stuff, I just want to work and be productive in a field that I am skilled in, but I worry that they are too ideological and will try to maintain a monopoly in their work culture. \n\nThat's the crux of my issue. Based on my observations there is simply no place for someone like me in the modern world, I am way too realistic. I don't really have hobbies, sure there are things I do to waste time, but that's why I do them and I am not passionate about anything other than progressing in my career/life due to missing out on so much time and ruining parts of my youth due to unforeseen sickness. I've been told by mentors to wait till I approach my 30s to get serious in terms of a career, that sounds like a massive amount of time wasted in my 20s.\n\nThe worst thing is that this disconnect with modern people is ruining my ability to function because I feel frustrated that I just don't understand why things are so emotional? Frankly, every day goes by and I become more frustrated and more misanthropic.  \n\nSo how do I "deal" with it? Do I just adopt a fake persona and lay low in order to try to survive in that environment? Honestly, I am quite lost, which really really scares me. 
5	Perhaps it is just a matter of changing your professional industry. “The best careers for thinkers include those that require analytical thought, such as science, engineering and legal professions.”  \n\nhttp://www.schoolsgalore.com/career-education/thinkers-and-feelers-can-get-along-at-work.html\n\nTry to find more “thinker personalities” in your personal life. (Perhaps peers from the above professions.)
4	The thing about having different opinions as other people is that usually when one points out that theirs is different there is also an insinuation that the differing opinion is wrong. And that’s what pushes people away. You’re allowed to have your opinion and others are allowed theirs and in order to successfully co-exist in a working environment, you just have to make clear that you respect the other person’s opinion even if you don’t necessarily agree with it and to ask for that same respect back. It just makes work a lot easier when there’s less tension. Less tension = more productivity. Think of it like that. 
4	U seem closed minded
2	Seems to me you already answered your own question. Blending into your enviornment to survive is as good advice as any in this situation. Either that or consider a career change that might better suit your personality so it wont be necessary.

1	> Based on my observations there is simply no place for someone like me in the modern world, I am way too realistic.\n\nAs long as you have that mindset, you're going to have a hard time. People are different, have different strengths, and we need that to be able to function as a society. You do your thing, and other people can do their thing. \n\nSure, there are going to be some people who don't want to let you do your thing, and you'll find them at work. They're easy to identify, and if you put up barriers from the onset, usually they catch on and leave you alone.\n\nLooking at the subs you're most active in, you seem to be dabbling in ideologies that disempower men. They want you to have no hope, they don't want you to be happy, they don't want you to improve your social skills to function in the world. Recognize your self worth and leave that behind you.
13	Music and personality data gathering (5 minute survey)	Hello all, if you are interested, I created a survey regarding Mbti type and music preferences. It's just for fun, but I am curious to see the results. I personally don't expect to see a huge difference between types, but who knows! It'll only take a few minutes, so please check it out.\n\nI will be posting results after all the data has been compiled.\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/wgMY0z9LvWmN0NY23\n\n***Edit: I will be closing the test to do data stuff at 2pm CT on Sunday, August 5. Sorry if you didn't get it a chance to take the test. Look for the results post in a day or two.***
7	Are you going to post the results to this sub or will this be another survey we never hear about again after filling out?
1	Can't wait to see the results. I wonder if there's a chance the raw data can be manipulated and viewed in more ways by others - would be super cool.
3	Power, or Relationships?	Which, ISTJ brethren and sistren, do you view as more important (and why)?
7	Relationships, but probably only because I dont believe it's possible for me to attain the kind of power I would need to radically alter how the world works. We only get one life. I cant make enough of an impact to really change the world for the better for everyone, so I'd rather focus on doing well enough to have the things I need in life then put all the rest of my effort into my personal relationships or just enjoying myself.
4	come for the philosophy, stay for the russian military band performing lady gaga's bad romance https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtjRTjWDT7k
2	The two usually go hand-in-hand, y'know...
1	I have no interest in power, but I do want to be taken seriously and have my opinions respected if I am talking about something I am knowledgeable about. I suppose that would mean stronger relationships and building that trust. 
1	need help typing...?	im looking for some good tips typing people.im not talking about people present,theres a lot of people in history that i really want to figure there mbti types,whats a good way typing people in history just by looking at biographies ect?
2	I think the **best** way would be to read something that person wrote. Many famous historical figures have letters that are available to read online or elsewhere. Diaries would be the best of the best. Everything else is fairly sketchy IMO, as different people interpret people's actions differently.
1	(Cross-post) Temperament and Humor (All over 14 Welcome)	 Hello! I recently posted a survey you might find interesting.

4	How do ISTJs deal with the mistakes of themselves and others?	I have an ISTJ colleague and we recently started conflicting a lot (I'm most likely ENTP myself). I want to understand if his behavior is related to the ISTJ mindset, or if he is just a backstabbing a\*\*hole. There are four situations described below, but I would like to know more about a typical behaviour of an ISTJ when mistakes are concerned.\n\nThis probably is going to sound very negatively charged - we actually used to get along very well for a long time, but at some point he became very irritating by doing all the actions below. I've tried speaking with him about this, but it was as if he didn't heard anything I said. I don't trust him anymore now and suspect hidden motives in his behaviour.\n\n1. there are a lot of standard operating procedures (SOPs) involved in our work, and sometimes I get too focused on the end result that I forget to perform certain steps, which would provide some tangential information or prevent a catastrophic failure in some extremely unlikely situations; when he notices that I did something like that, although nothing can be changed anymore, he comes to me all emotional and expresses a reaction as if I did the biggest mistake ever;\n2. if he disagrees with the way I do things, he doesn't come to discuss with me but goes around and slanders to other people;\n3. the people he did not (does not) like in his life were (are) doing EVERYTHING wrong; I don't know if I ever heard a positive comment about someone he holds a grudge on;\n4. if he breaks something, and someone sees it, it is ALWAYS the thing which was faulty; I never heard him blaming himself. If no one is around, I believe he just doesn't tell anyone; if I break something, his reaction is as in 1); on the contrary, for me the information is very valuable for the future predictions; so if I apply too much force along certain angle and some glassware will break, I will tell that information to everybody; however, when the equipment doesn't work I no longer know if it was something I did, or if he already messed it up before (and getting that information is even more complicated now, as I've stopped speaking with him);\n\nThanks!
10	I can relate with him on 1, 2, and 3.\n\n1. Rules are rules, and need to be followed. I would probably say the same as him, but  I would try to be more friendly about it.\n\n2. ISTJs often stay away from conflicts, as do I. I only talk about such things with people I really trust though, just to vent. If he just says things to people here and there, he's just a douche.\n\n3. I rarely dislike people, but when I do, I often dislike multiple thing about them. So it's more likely that I dislike multiple things about one person, than disliking one thing. It's hard to explain.\n\n4. I'm brutally honest. So if I break something I never lie about it. If someone else breaks anything, I mostly sympathise with them. I just don't say anything, or ask what happened, and say it can happen to the best of us or something similar. If it happens again, I give my advice on how to stop it from happening.\n\nSeems a little douchy here and there. Maybe he's going through something?\n
6	He sounds just like my daughter, who is not ISTJ, but is on the autism spectrum. Some people are just assholes, no matter the type. 
2	1. I work in a field that uses SOPs, too.  In my case, they're not a nuisance that largely lack a point - they serve the purpose of showing regulatory agencies (EPA in my case) that we're conducting our work in such a way that aligns with good practices.  SOPs are basically, "Hey EPA, this is how we'll do things, alright?  Give us approval so we know we're in compliance with what you want and we'll make sure to do exactly what we say right here".  Deviating from SOPs defeats the purpose of having SOPs and undermines trust in your business practices (at least in my case).  Even if a deviation is minor, you should still make sure you follow SOPs to the letter because not doing so shows that you're careless in your work and that's at best a bad look, professionally speaking.  Sorry for the rant, ISTJs are known for being sticklers for procedure and doing things the "right" way.  Your coworker might be an ass about it but he's not wrong (especially if deviating from SOP leads to unnecessary mistakes like you say in part 4).\n2. Yeah that's bad behavior.  I'm guessing that he dislikes confrontation but still feels a need to vent about things that annoy him.  I've had disagreements about how coworkers do things and I have to remind myself not to take it personally.\n3. Also bad behavior.  Could be ISTJ specific if Te is in the driver's seat but that's not relevant.  He needs to be a better person here.\n4. If I break glassware (sounds somewhat like we're both in chemistry, actually) my reaction is to swear at the glassware because all the time I spend telling people how they can be more efficient/effective/etc. in their work creates some real nice blowback that I don't want to deal with.  Internally, I know damn well it was my fault and I'll work to be better, but externally, I just want to save face.  If someone else breaks glassware, I know better than to get in their face about it, because it's just glassware.  They're embarrassed enough as it is already, no need to be a dick about it.  I assume everyone can learn from their mistakes just like I can.\n\nSorry for the wall of text.  It sounds like your coworker's behavior is what happens to me when I can't properly engage my Te - I get very irate and every little inconvenience ceases to be an isolated incident and instead becomes another rock in a landslide whose sole purpose is just to ruin my day and get in my way.  That may be an ISTJ thing.  Regardless, he needs to work on the same thing I'm working on, which is learning to be OK with people who don't put the same level of intensity into every detail of everything as we do.  I hope this helps!
1	ISTJ's? Mistakes? Why, how dare you even use the two words in the same sentence! Preposterous.
1	If this were about an ISTJ, I'd say they were a poorly developed one.\n\n1. If you keep making mistakes, I'd rather do it myself because I know to how to do it correctly/perfectly. I would probably get you removed if the potential negatives were that great.\n\n2. Its makes more sense to confront you directly about your mistakes and how to fix them. Thinking ahead, slandering you to others could very likely blow up in his face. It's unprofessional and I could never trust someone like that.\n\n3. Sounds like he must be right in everything. I guess that's ISTJ like.......\n\n4. I've seen enough. Sounds like a superiority complex.
1	Maybe they're under a lot of stress.
2	Sister spent night w/ her bf in our very conservative ISTJ grandma's bed while she was on vacation. Grandma feels very disrespected. They had permission to spend the night but knew they were supposed to be in separate beds. Plus, there are 3 guest rooms they could've used (they're just not as nice)	Sister is dumb. Any tips on how to approach the apology?
13	Not your circus, not your monkeys. You don't want to be associated with this noise. 
13	I'm with Grandma, that's disgusting. 
7	Did they get 'fluids' on the bed? if so they need to wash that shit and make it up with a gift.
12	shouldve switched title with content.\n\n20 lashes for the pair of them
2	Apologize. Be sincere. Don't do it again. 
1	OOH, yes, as suggested, a gift, but also, do like all the housework ever for her.
8	How to be less critical of other people?	I would like to be less critical of other people. 
4	We need more information here.. \n\nIn what scenarios do you find yourself being critical of others? Are you critical to them or do you keep your thoughts to yourself? Are you critical of things you have done, better, than others? \n\n\nFor general advice, I find myself being judgmental of others who are taking on a task or assignment differently than I would because I feel that I am a very efficient (while also detail oriented) person. Instead of being negative and trashing that person to myself or others, I will try to ask if I can assist or offer advice. This generally changes my attitude. 
3	Simple, you mind your own business. \n\nIt’s not your fault that they’re ignorant in some cases, and it’s not your responsibility to educate everyone. 
2	be less critical of other people. boom.
2	I hope you find your answer.. but I don't see a problem with being critical.  I think it's a great trait to have.  
1	Here's what's worked for me:\n\nFirst step: Don't hold them to the same standard to which you hold yourself.\n\nSecond step: Consider whether there is a valid reason for them to not meet whatever standard to which you are holding them.\n\nThird step: Consider whether their failure to meet the standard to which you are holding them is correctible.\n\nFourth step: If it's correctible, are they willing to take correction. If so, apply the correction or suggest the correction politely.\n\nIf they are able but unwilling to take the correction, be critical anyway.
0	any..?	do you guys know of any serial killers that were/are entj,or murderers?...besides ted bundy...lol.
8	10/10 title, written like a true serial killer
4	Why are you asking ISTJ's about ENTJ's?
3	I don't know many SJ serial killers. Especially ISTJs, as they're the most friendly out of all the guardians
2	Most serial killers are ST types. There was an article floating somewhere that the majority were STPs followed by STJs, so an ENTJ serial killer would be hard to find. They are more likely to be involved in corporate and financial fraud a la a corrupt CEO type.
8	What are ISTJs like when they are pissed?	Just wondering.
35	I'd give that person the cold (arctic cold) shoulder.
26	I go quiet. 
13	Can I unleash hell?\n\nI'll unleash hell?\n\nNo?\n\nEvil stare that will make any man fucking uncomfortable.
12	all these comments are accurate af.\n\nCold shoulder, Ignore, evil stare, homicidal thoughts
10	I go quiet. Almost deathly quiet. Like before a big storm and my husband knows to stay away. I usually have to work through everything in my head - turn it around, twist it, see it from different angles and perspectives. If I can talk myself down from the mad I usually do, but other times it hits a critical mass and then I start talking. 
10	Bossy, very bossy. \n\nTe may take over our Si and we’ll start barking out orders. I often give angry advice haha.\n\nIf you offended our morals, expect some angry Fi in there too. 
4	Shut it down until i regain control. Attempts to talk to me while in lockdown mode will be met with the avoidance of eye contact or if instant on not getting the hint... a stare of a thousand daggers.
2	I take a big breath and collect myself. Usually just leave and let it blow.
2	I get super super pissed off, like about to hit a wall pissed off. In that, I go super quiet, get super snappy, and if someone is pissing me off, they'll find out soon enough
2	Think about how pissed I am but keep it inside until I boil over and it kills me. Meanwhile I just appear cold on the outside
2	Quiet and kind of passive aggressive
1	what am i like? i take a deep breath :-]
1	I get quiet at first, but if I get more upset, I may raise my voice for a few seconds. Then I just leave the person to cool off. After a few minutes I may be ready to talk again.
1	It depends on what kind of pissed and with whom - if I'm frustrated with a partner/someone I care about, I'll let them know that I'm frustrated and we'll talk about what I'm frustrated about, with a member of the general public, I'll usually just exit stage left.\n\nThe really fun thing, and I see it echoed in a lot of the responses is that if a situation is escalating and it's looking like violence is coming, things get really quiet and calm, I don't want to fight angry and I have defused entire situations by looking at someone and quietly asking if they would like to repeat what they just said where yelling would just have escalated further/faster.

5	Si means we recall memories via our senses (visuals, feelings, etc) but that doesn't mean we're not susceptible to faulty memory if that's what you're asking
7	ISTJ or INTP? Please correct me	I thought I was an ISTJ and still kind of do, but some things don’t apply to me. Quite a few things from INTP do apply to me. Tell me if I’m ISTJ or not.\n\nSome key examples:\n1. Getting things done on time - I procrastinate a lot. Tend to do things in the last moment, unless I’m really interested in what I’m doing. Used to think I’m always on time and get things done in efficient way until I moved in with INTJ and ESTJ.\n2. Cleanliness- I love cleanliness but I hate actual cleaning. Therefore I don’t until the point I just have to.\n3. Boring - I’m not boring. I am an introvert, but I love exploring new things and places, and going out with extroverts. I do have the tendency to be the “dad” of the group though. And do like to plan things out, but also have tendency to “wing it” when people around me get too granular. \n4. Rules - rules should be followed unless they don’t make sense to me. Some are broken for fun, but nothing too serious. I’m more about morals, right and wrong.\n5. I focus on practical things, while having a ton of unpractical ideas and thoughts in my head. Do like to just think about stuff and how something would turn out.\n6. Thinking/logic: yes. Love figuring things out - but only on subjects interesting to me. Same with learning - I can’t sit down a learn something because I have to. I need to be intrigued by it to study it. But when I am interested in something I can get obsessive in it.\n7. No nonsense type of person. Straight forward and honest. \n8. Emotions: Feel them strongly - hard time explaining or knowing how to deal with them. \n9. Quote traditional - except things that don’t make sense to me. “Just do it” or “because it has to be that way” don’t fly with me. I need reason.\n10. Open to new ideas, and suggestions, and slightly going out of comfort zone. Especially if I see something that can be improved or be very fun.\n\n\nIn the mbti tests I tend to get one of the following: INTJ, ISTJ, INTP\n\nBasically IxTx for sure, and then N/S and J/P are 50/50
6	I'm most of these things you described too and I still firmly consider myself ISTJ. I especially really feel you on the "how to do stuff efficiently when you constantly procrastinate" and "how to deal with the need for cleanliness when you don't like cleaning" aspects. \n\nI feel like the main problem with MBTI is that people have a certain image of what each type "should" be, when in reality there's actually a lot of room for variation within types. \n\nIf you're having trouble with typing by letters, maybe have a little look at typing by functions? For example, are you past, present, or future focused?\n\nAlso, you've told us a lot of reasons why you think you might not be ISTJ, so maybe switch it around and tell us why you think you might *be* ISTJ?
2	Well I agreed with all of those except the last one and I'm an istj. The last one is difficult because I'm not a huge fan of being pushed out of my comfort zone, but will do it if I absolutely must. 
1	You sound a lot like an INTP
1	All very relatable, I'm ISTJ according to my Socionics type (LSI) which I found out through two tests and confirmation of typing through a close friend who knows an insane amount about socionics and typing in general. 
1	I’m more about morals, right and wrong. This sounds Fi.
4	Why are there more INTJs than ISTJs on reddit?	Just curious why the INTJ board is 8x bigger than the ISTJ one. I would understand if extrovert forums are smaller because they're all outside (lol) but don't get how the discrepancy is so big between introvert types. 
13	I find it funny that you're asking this exact question. My best (one of them atleast) friend is an INTJ and he advised to go on here. I am not much for reddit other than for this purpose.\n\nINTJs needs theory and to discuss their thoughts. ISTJs are more static (prefer one answer instead of 3 possibilities).\n\nMy INTJ friend likes to talk more and bounce ideas off of me even when the area of his theory/suggestion is not the sightliest interesting to me. I do not need those things, I simply apply logic from assumption and experience to give myself an answer. That might be why.

2	I'm only on reddit an average of 3 hours a week. I almost never look at the comments unless the post content implies there'll be interesting content in the comments as well.\n\nJust rather be doing than reading about doing.
4	Because S is more likely to be outside as well, not just E.
1	INTJs have a lot to say. I'm an INTP, which means that I am much less decisive than INTJs are I never feel that my views are polished enough to be shared, and therefore I probably share less than most INTJs. Yet all of us with the INTx trait think a lot, perhaps think the most of all MBTI.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, ISTJ (which is my "better half" or my awesome complimentary personality-type) is more to do with listening and defending,a little less to do with creating and speaking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust like you can find celebrities and performers from all MBTI personalities, though, it is true that anyone can expand their skills so as to become great whatever they choose. So ISTJs can surely be writers and creators of content if they choose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this helps! :) -INTP
1	There's no such thing as an extrovert forum. We're all on the internet because we're introverts. \n\nINTJs are too logical for real life and regular human interaction so they're all on Reddit instead.\n\nAs an ISTJ I had to get used to this internet stuff but I like it now.\n\nPlus INTJs are robots, so they like to be around their own kind. 
9	What are your methods of clearing a cluttered mind?	I have an incredibly hard time shutting my mind down, especially when I'm stressed or overanalyzing. I would love to be able to clear my head and refocus to handle the situation at hand, but I find that I make things worse by "spinning my wheels" and overthinking. \n\nWhat are your go-to methods of clearing your head?
8	Yes. \n\nI tried the Headspace app and found some of their guided meditations helpful. \n\nI write out lists of things I need to accomplish on my hand so I hopefully stop obsessing about it during stressful/busy workdays. \n\nI process a lot of it through dreams. I might live out a whole situation I’m dreading in a dream the night before. It’s also how I process the emotions that come after traumatic experiences. \n\nI listen to podcasts. It’s hard to think while also listening to someone talk. It’s really hard for me to fall asleep without them. \n\nFind something physical to do as a hobby. I love weightlifting and snowboarding, they both require 100% of your attention. \n\nTry to just embrace having an overactive mind, it sucks at times but you can really use it to your advantage. 
8	I found that the best way to deal with a cluttered mind is by writing everything out. I have a journal that acts as a means of reflecting on anything that's happening, and I write it in often, whether it's at work, at home, before bed, when I wake up, etc. Having this "brain dump" once a week has really helped clean up my mental room and allow me to deal with the stuff that's cluttering up my mind.\n\nSo if you're stressed out, write out a) what's stressing you out, b) why you think it's stressing you out, c) how you're feeling, in excruciating detail, and d) every possible solution you can think of, regardless of how outlandish it seems. \n\nThings like that, and meditation help as well, but I find that I just get distracted during meditation.
3	The ones that serve me the best, in no particular order:  \n\n\n\- Go for a long bike ride or run.  This is mostly when I need to sort through complicated thoughts that I'd otherwise go crazy trying to analyze.  It gives me enough space from distractions to think, but engages my mind just enough that I can dim the noise\n\n\- Write music.  This is mostly when I'm feeling strong emotions that I need to get out.  Music has always been a great emotional outlet, and writing lyrics in particular helps me organize my thoughts and get them out of my head.  I'm a lot better at conveying my emotions outwards through music than anything else\n\n\- Clean my apartment.  This is mostly when I'm nervous as organizing & optimizing are natural outlets for stress for me
1	The only thing that will make my mind feel shut down is music that is faster and louder than my thoughts. This can get exhausting but I really do love listening to Hardstyle (150bpm Electric Dance Music). It kind of gets you going if you are doing something physical like running, but it can also make my head relax(stop thinking) if it is loud enough. Here is an example: [https://youtu.be/mw9WcQo6aIY?t=1062](https://youtu.be/mw9WcQo6aIY?t=1062)\n\nEdit: I just remembered that there is some way of triggering your primal mode (cave men/stone age), by certain breathing methods and cooling down your body physically. That should clear any humans' mind, you can get some insight into this in JRE#712 & #865 here: [https://www.youtube.com/user/PowerfulJRE/search?query=wim+hof](https://www.youtube.com/user/PowerfulJRE/search?query=wim+hof)
1	For minor mental over-throttling:  Beer.\n\nFor moderate mental over-speed:  Beer, then bedtime.\n\nFor major mental cyclone:  Beer, put on some ambient music (e.g. "Liquid Mind"), then bedtime.
6	ISTJ- Emotional Support?	I'm wondering if anyone has insight as to how they balance having the traits that are predominantly ISTJ with needing to be the primary emotional support for those closest to you? \n\nToo often in life, I've found myself being the steadying influence mentally and emotionally for family & friends. I always want to help because these are those I've allowed in my inner circle but often feel overwhelmed and then frustrated by having to do it in the first place. This in turn makes me, temporarily at least, want to enter isolation and "selfishly" leave others to figure their problems out on their own.\n\nAny new guidance or wisdom at this point would be welcome...
8	Learning to let go of being a fixer has helped. My knee-jerk reaction is to analyze, assess, come up with possible scenarios, and make a plan. It’s 1) exhausting and 2) actually not the most helpful. \n\nIn my experience, people seem to be looking mostly for support, not solutions. Which is actually great for us, because it means being there for them in the here and now and less about making a job out of it. Being level-headed and rational means people will likely continue to come to you for support, but optimizing the approach can make it less taxing on you.\n\nSo just validate (“I can see how that would be frustrating”), empathize (“I would feel the same way”), and ask open-ended reflective questions that show you’re interested and care (“How do you feel about that?”), but actually have them come up with their own solutions (“What are you thinking of doing now?”). Unless they directly ask me what I think or what they should do, I offer no solutions. I’ve started paying attention more to these sorts of phrases, and have found that my friends actually rarely say these things. Again, support, not solutions.\n\nThat stuff doesn’t come naturally to me at all, but I’m getting better. And it takes up way less time than fixing, but seems to be appreciated just as much, if not more.
1	Maybe this experience I had can help you: \n\nI have a friend who has some mental issues:, OCD, schizophrenia and anxiety disorder. At first I felt really sorry for him and wanted to help him by making his life easier and trying to work out something that could help him "get better". I got him to take meds and visit a doctor. I used to walk him home from uni because I was afraid he would would "have an episode". Keep in mind this, took about two hours off my days, time in which I should be studying but I felt I sort of "had to". I thought it was what a good friend was supposed to do. Well, I also thought things were going pretty ok.  Then out of nowhere, he has one of those episodes and must be hospitalized for half a year! I was really sorry but also pretty angry. I had spent so much of my time on him and he just threw it away! (I know this isn't about me, it's about him, but in that moment I was pretty childish and upset.) Well, he got better eventually. But I stopped following him home from uni. It evidently didn't stop him from getting those episodes. We still see each other now and then but my way of "helping" him consists mostly of me picking up the phone when he needs someone to talk to. He says he is extremely grateful for that and I guess I don't really have a reason to doubt him.\n\nPoint is, you don't have to "solve" people's problems. You're not being paid to be their psychiatrist. Just be that guy or girl they call when they need someone.\n\nSorry about the long story. I hope it helps, buddy. 
0	Typos in Dating Profile	Circumstances in which an ISTJ would repeatedly post dating profiles which include typos even when friends point it out.\n\nAlso arguments for why such a person must be an ISTP rather than an ISTJ.\n\nReady, set, and go!
3	I don't get it, are we supposed to come up with such circumstances?  \n\n\nISTPs operate very differently than ISTJs so that's probably easy to figure out if you know the type functions.
2	Maybe the typos are a test to weed out the weak. 
1	How do LGBT ISTJs differ from LGBT people who are not ISTJ?	I previously asked if there were any LGBT ISTJs on this subreddit and got a surprising amount of yes answers.\n\nAre we more prone to:\n\n\-stay in the closet longer?\n\n\-be self hating due to valuing tradition?\n\n\-be less inclined to get into gay culture?\n\n\-care more about masculinity (or femininity for women?)\n\n\-anything else?
12	[deleted]
5	I don't understand why OP's post got downvoted. Are there some in-the-closet queer-haters around here?\n\nAnyways my responses to your questions:\n\n-stay in the closet longer?: I came out at 18 to my HS and college friends. I came out to MYSELF at age 15-ish when I finally accepted myself. I still haven't come out to my parents, but at this point I don't find the need to.\n\n-be self hating due to valuing tradition?: Absolutely. I hated myself so much from 7th to 9th grade and tried to plot ways to make myself straight. Obviously that didn't work, and I slowly accepted myself for who I was. And you know what? Fuck tradition if it's based on heterosexuality and doesn't include others. I can still fulfill ideas of tradition, like getting a surrogate if I really want children of "my blood".\n\n-be less inclined to get into gay culture?: I hate gay culture. The hookup scene is toxic and tons of my gay "friends" are always in some drama. Get me away as far and as soon as possible.\n\n-care more about masculinity (or femininity for women?): I've had friends tell me they couldn't even tell I was gay at first. So maybe?
3	For me: I came out as early as 15 (to get it over with mainly) (Te?)\n\nI had a self hating period before I came out for a little while, but if was gladly short. Letting go of religious beliefs helped (though that wasn’t my reason for letting go of them.)\n\nI don’t really care for gay culture and often get mistaken for straight and can’t help, but value it in other gay men when looking for guys in into. 
2	>-care more about masculinity (or femininity for women?)\n\nFWIW or not, my ISTJ SO is a lesbian and she's quite butch in her physical presentation. She isn't into traditional gender roles as a style of interaction, though, so she doesn't make butch into a dominant-culture-masculine role she inhabits in a relationship (in other words, she doesn't act in relationship in ways that are traditionally seen as masculine, doesn't require a butch-femme dynamic between us, stuff like that)
2	Not sure, but here's my 2 cents.\n\nAre we more prone to:\n\n-Stay in the closet longer?: Came out at 20/21\n\n-Be self hating due to valuing tradition?: Tradition isn't important to me\n\n-Be less inclined to get into gay culture?: Not really into gay culture. \n\n-Care more about masculinity (or femininity for women?): Definitely more on the masculine side of things, but I don't care; If I like it, I'll do it.\n
2	Being the rational and practical person I am, I decided to get it over asap and came out at 13. Since then I've been proud of who I am, because the fact is it doesn't matter if I'm queer or heteronormative / cis. I'm too rational to care about what others think.

4	ISTJ Cognitive Orientation Guidebook	
6	ISTJs who are only children: what's your experience?	
5	Honestly I both love and hate being an only child. I didn't have annoying older/younger siblings to deal with, and my parents were lenient on me because they already knew I got my shit done and did well at school. Although I would say that some things that I find difficult now, I attribute to being an only child - being incredibly unhappy with not getting what I want (in more ways than one), not being good at dealing with interpersonal conflict, and sharing (both my belongings and emotions).\n\nSometime I do wish I had an older sibling - I think I would've gained a lot from an older sibling in terms of life experience (such a practical thing to say, I know). That said, being an only child means I'm the only one in the family with the responsibility to make my parents happy. I'm Asian as well, so there's the ideas of my success = my parents' success, taking care of my parents when they're older, etc. I think that added onto the need to be a responsible, successful person. Failure ain't an option, buddy.
2	About what?
20	Doing a study on sexuality comparisons among MB types. The survey's on sex, so it ranges from your views on sex to your preferences/kinks. Totally anonymous, all questions are optional. No essays. Only takes about 15 mins. I'll share the results :)	
5	Done, curious to see if there are any correlations between types and their typical ideologies regarding general life decisions.
3	Good survey. \n\nHope I didn’t throw off results as a gay ISTJ haha. 
2	Question about hair color preference is phrased as check all that apply but you can only pick one option on the form

2	So Ive come to the conclusion that I'm a pervert. Yay me......LMAO
2	Done! I appreciate the inclusion of “interested” in this—some things are interesting to me, sure, but I don’t know if I’d actually participate in them, ha-ha. So it was nice to have that as an option!
1	Click the post title to go to the survey :)
1	There's one mistake. In the question about choking, you didn't allow for the "no" answer. The closest you did is "I'm not sure."
1	Done! Looking forward to seeing the results 
6	An interesting fear.	Lately been feeling like I've no one to turn to, which isn't unique I believe. (I have just a handful, but I'd never turn to on my own accord..) I've never been one to dive into something on my own accord. Usually in a group, if there's someone first to be cast, it'll be me (for an analogy, somewhat like Colorless Tsukuru - a Murakami novel).\n\nThe strange thing is I often find myself frozen, dreading on the inside upon meeting someone I haven't in a long time, from a different stage of my life. This has been going on probably since forever, but lately this strange fear has been eating away at me. \n\nI dunno.\n\nJeez, soo confused.
4	I can relate -- the mix between wanting connection with people and yet feeling anxious and tense about and around them.\n\nIt is like I enjoy the idea of an overarching relationship, an alliance where both benefit from mutual affection, support, and so on. Relationships of any and all sorts -- platonic, romantic, sexual. But every smaller-scale movement towards people brings enough anxiety with it that it becomes a barrier to having any kind of relationship. Not an insurmountable barrier, but definitely a barrier.\n\nJust the other day, I was reflecting on the low-key state of anxiety I was experiencing, the kind that nags at you when you have forgotten something very important. The kind that tells you "when you remember what you've forgotten, it will be a situation you need to immediately jump to fix"... I was experiencing that after casually chatting with a coworker I've known for a few months online -- one of the first times we chatted outside work. Just that had me feeling keyed up, and I'm 31, so I at least feel old to be feeling so anxious about the basic process of friendship-building. \n\nMost of the time, I don't make myself emotionally vulnerable when I am around other people, I just try to get along enough not to have a terrible time, then get back home where I can relax.\n\nI am only now beginning to really contend with the fact that if I do not change those habits, despite discomfort, I will find myself coming back home, alone, where I can relax well into my middle and late age. It's not an emergency or anything, but some needs are going unmet that I might have in smaller amounts than others, but I do still need some kind of in-person companionship and interaction. ...And I am getting sick enough of it that I am more willing to consider taking on the anxieties of approaching other people and being vulnerable around them.
3	I feel the same way. 
3	How do you guys feel about being 1 on 1 with aquaintances/not super close friends? I feel like my discomfort in that greatly affects my ability to make and keep friends. \n\nI often find myself attract we didn't to groups of friends, but as I struggle to get close with most of the people anyway and am still kind of looked at differently.\n\nEdit - Relevancy
2	A while back I thought I had some type of mental disorder because I was feeling anxious and not very compatible with other people. Each one of us needs to figure out how to deal with our own minds right. I get the impression that like myself, you are aware that in this is the case; so you can do something about it.\n\nNow that we have this established, we can start to think differently. The best thing about this is that we can, given enough time, very versatilely adapt.\n\nI like to break down why my train of though that is most commonly a standard template in situations like the one you describe, and tinker with the variables in this equation. This is takes a lot of mental energy and you will feel like a genius when you figure out a new way to think, just like a math problem.\n\nLets pretend your mind is a computer. You are the software engineer that will create programs to run in different situations to deal with every day life. Without this knowledge I definitely understand if you feel frozen. I recommend that you intentionally put yourself in these uncomfortable situations on a regular basis to work on yourself and this will go away.\n\n\--\n\nI want to take the time to share a personal experience with you because I feel where you are coming from.\n\nThe absolute best thing that happened to me is that my company invited me do a course in leadership. I had to stand in front of and talk to team managers and the CEO about an experience from my life, which is EXTREMELY outside of my comfort-zone and I couldn't even make conversation with half of them. I did this on multiple occasions over the course of a few months. I had no experience of this what so ever and my stomach was turning intensely.\n\nWhat I learned is being calm, collected, and comfortable in uncomfortable situations. Run different programs and use your five senses and learn to interact with new people as much as you can handle. Post-traumatically you will come back to your house and overthink what went wrong and what was bad/awkward/unbearable, and then you need to trick yourself into going outside again and repeat (This is also the key to not getting too anxious because you stay occupied where you get more experience to draw conclusions from). Courtesy-phrases is a great foundation to start with when formatting an approach to people. I hope this was helpful. Now you should have an extended introverted toolkit to be more extrovert. Figuring out the rest is part of building your character :)

10	Open ended stuff, like Cities: Skylines.
3	Games where I need to optimize “things”. Like city skylines or eve online. The amount of time that I’ve spent on those two games embarrasses me. 
3	Depends on my mood, but my chill out favorites are anything from the Katamari (rolling a ball to pick things up? Yes, please!)\n\nLately, I enjoy rogue like games (Rogue Legacy, esp) and incremental games. 
2	Pretty much everything. Western, eastern, RPG, strategy, puzzle, action, walking sim, adventure, rhythm/music games, 2D, 3D, you name it.
2	Racing Games and Sandbox Games with a heavy driving aspect.\n\nCurrently, my go to in each category is Trackmania Turbo and Watch Dogs 2.
2	I mostly do J/RPGs and action games. Minecraft I like, too.
2	I've been playing Star Trek Online quite a bit lately.  Thinking about it, though, I'm not sure I can actually say I "enjoy" it.  I like flying around in a space ship and blowing stuff up.  I kind of enjoy the DOFF and Admiralty systems.  I abhor the ground combat, and I frequently minimize the chat window if I make the mistake of paying attention to it, although I make the occasional smart ass comment, which often goes unappreciated.\n\nI have been enjoying playing Far Cry 5, and I enjoyed Far Cry 3 and 4 as well.  I couldn't get into Far Cry 2, and I haven't tried Far Cry 1.\n\nI enjoy Saints Row 3 and 4, but I haven't tried Saints Row 1, and I didn't enjoy Saints Row 2 (story was fine, but the mechanic that forces you to do side missions to go through the story was annoying and poorly implemented).\n\nI've enjoyed most of the Assassin's Creed games that I've played.  AC1 had a similar mechanic to Saints Row 2 where you had to do some of the side missions to go through the story, but it was implemented better, so it didn't feel like it got in the way.  Unity was a dumpster fire.  To date, my favorite AC game to play was Black Flag, because pirate, although I preferred the combat in AC3 (because Connor's use of that tomahawk was amazing).  The best story, hands down, was the Ezio trilogy.\n\nI've also been playing Mobilityware's Solitare and Freecell games on my cell phone.  The daily challenges are quite entertaining.

18	Can we get a "ISTJ user and care manual" like the ones some of the other mbti subs have?	Besides the concept itself being cool and a fast introduction to the type, it would be a good way to quickly give information to people seeking it preventing yet another "how do I deal with my ISTJ?" or "does my ISTJ likes me?" thread.

3	What are some ISTJ characteristics I can use for my interview?	Hello everyone, Im a Comm major trying to get out of retail and recently got a job interview. What are some good ways to convey they way we are able to analyze and deal with situations? I tried on my previous interview but i ended up saying things like "Im very methodical and analytical" but i couldn't come up with concrete characteristics. Can anyone help?
2	"I am analytical, and can handle any situation." thennn if you can either make up examples or recall actual ones that you've had to reflect those traits you'll be good hopefully! also i mean characteristics are just abstract unless you can come up with examples p sure
2	Organized\n\nDependable/Reliable \n\nMethodical\n\nAnalytical \n\nImpartial 
2	Demonstrating a trait is better than stating a trait.  Anyone can regurgitate a list of desirable traits off a job-hunting advice column but less people can adequately convey ownership of those traits during an interview.  What's really worked for me is spending enough time developing myself to know exactly what my strengths and weaknesses are, then spending enough time to learn how to manage those strengths and weaknesses for maximum effect.  Those inevitably come up in interviews and show an ability to objectively evaluate even the most personal of topics (ie, myself) as well as the ability/tendency to maximize efficiency in my workplace responsibilities.  It also shows my strong work ethic since you have to take your work life seriously in order to have such an understanding of yourself.
2	Charecter change	Till date , I was classified as an INTJ. I had taken the MBTI test 2 years back. Today , I retake the test , and I am now ISTJ.  This was kinda surprising. Does our character change with time  ? Or is it possible that I have both of these characteristics ( my weak trait Ni is approx  50% , along with Si)?
2	ISTJs commonly mistype as INTJs because there's a lot of overlap between the two (Te secondary, Fi tertiary or whatever the term is).
2	Same thing happened to me. I was surprised I was an ISTJ this year after getting INTJ results all the time back then. I read ISTJ's profile and it was truly such an accurate description of myself, that i wondered how was i so sure back then of being an INTJ.
2	Are any of you guys sensitive?	I had a friend who I am very confident is an ISTJ. After 2 years of being really close friends with him, I realised that he is a pretty sensitive guy. I am as well, possibly more so than him, but when I am hurt by something I rarely ever show it, (because I realise I shouldn't be) and when I do, I try to explain it in an up front way. He, however will always show it, but does not say it straight up and will not explain why.\n\nHe is 17, so he is not near the most mature an ISTJ can be, but is this something any of you relate to? I am asking because I don't see this as a stereotypical ISTJ trait, but I also can't imagine him being any other type.
7	I was much more sensitive when I was younger. Now I'm not sensitive at all. I think it was when I finished school and started to work I lost my sensitivity.
6	I'm definitely sensitive (stronger Fi) but the only people who ever notice are women I date long term.  I just don't like displaying my emotions; I'd rather get right to solving whatever problem is bothering me.
5	The goal of typology is to explain development not to describe behavior. That's why it is taught in developmental theories and similar courses and things like Big 5 are used more for personality.\n\nMBTI Types are just horoscope styled explanations, which generalize a series of positive qualities and a few negative qualities.
2	When I was younger but now I am not as emotionally invested as I use to be about things 
2	No.... If anything I am very apathetic to most humans. Love dogs though. 
11	Are there any other gay ISTJs here?	I’m just curious since our type isn’t typically know for being LGBT, but here I am.

2	Awesome. I might make a thread asking about LGBT ISTJ similarities. 
2	Me ;-)

2	Yep! 
1	Do we dirty bisexuals counts?
6	I want to confirm my type	Hello, ISTJ's.\n\nSince I took the test, I got kinda obsessed with MBTI, I've been reading a lot about different personalities, seeing how each would apply to me, and comparing them to my INTJ results. \n\nI have taken multiple tests from different sites, because I've read that some sites are very inaccurate. I would always get INTJ, once it suggested INFJ (but I'm 100% sure that I'm not INFJ), and one test concluded I'm an ISTJ. I'm not sure if it's accurate at all and it's been bugging me since. The test wasn't asking any questions, rather it was letting me pick words that describe my personality.\n\nSo, I've read about ISTJ's and, I relate more to being intuitive rather than sensory. My memory is shit, I forget details easily if something doesn't interest me, history doesn't interest me, I think about the future, I live inside my head, etc.\n\nSo, I came to the conclusion that I'm not ISTJ, I've read that lots of ISTJ's mistype as being INTJ, so I just want to be 100% sure before I move on comparing to another personality type.\n\nMaybe you want to ask me some questions or just have something to say that will help me?\n\nThank you for reading.
4	Have you taken any tests focusing on cognitive functions? I find those to be more accurate. Once I was sure of my functions, I was more confident in my type. 
3	I’m an ISTJ but I dated an INTJ for a long time. I’d say the biggest difference between us was he was so future minded and I was the nostalgic one. He was very in his head where as I liked to talk things out. \n\nSo, just based on the short amount of info you provided, I’d say you sound like a pretty typical INTJ to me. 
3	Do you find cleaning and organizing the entire house relaxing? Haha
1	It's better to read about specific types to see if you match. Like Si, Ne, Ni, etc.
12	There is one thing that I just can't stop being perturbed by at the office and I'm wondering if it has to do with personality, particularly ISTJ?	Thanks for contributing! I'm interested in hearing what you think.\n\nMy office has a culture of showing up late and leaving early. We're paid hourly, and in my mind I'm going to put in my eight hours each day. So this is exactly what bothers me, arriving early and leaving late, and I'm wondering if it has to do with personality? I simply can't "let it go".\n\nHere's the thing: my manager and supervisor are both okay with us sometimes coming in late or leaving early. What's nice about this is having a flexible schedule and we get treated like adults. No one really cares as long as we get our work done.\n\nI can let go of a lot of things that go on at the office, but I see showing up late and leaving early almost like being lazy. It really bothers me, and on top of that I sometimes feel resentment because I'm there almost all day and some folks show up for as little as 3-4 hours at times. I feel like that's almost abusing the privilege, and I simply cannot wrap my head around the fact that some people feel like it's okay to put down eight hours when they've only shown up for part of that.\n\nI've been working there for years, and you think I would have assimilated by now. I simply cannot help feeling guilty if I show up late or leave early like the others. On top of that, sometimes I feel angry and resentful at others because they waltz in hours late and leave early, and no one with management cares. I tell myself I need to let it go, and also start doing what the others are doing, but I simply cannot.\n\nI wonder if a lot of this has to do with ISTJ personalities being "duty fulfillers"?\n\nEDIT: There's nothing I can do about others of course, but I'm wondering if you have any tips for letting this go? I've tried but I simply haven't been able to, and maybe I'm going about it wrong.
14	Hi, pretty strong ISTJ here. A lot of the time I had the same sort of problem, I like getting things done by the book and have that same sense of duty-fulfilling type of honesty as you do.\n\nThat being said, it's good to keep being yourself and do the full schedule whether you get your work done or not, because that helps you. From most ISTJ's I've known, it's a universal thing and for me personally it helps keep me sane.\n\nSo about others... I try to logic myself out of this situation a lot. This situation is sorta similar to a situation I've had with my old swim group. During the 15 minute running session that I had before swimming, a few people just walked around the entire building, maybe getting around it once or twice before I and a couple others actually finished the full three laps around the building, actually running. By the end, Coach would have us all go inside and get ready to swim.\n\nSo the people who walked around the building got to the same result as the people who ran around it. They didn't fulfill the 3-lap requirement, and I got plenty irritated at that. I talked to Coach about it and he basically stated that the way the lazy people were doing this, it didn't affect me. It just affected them - and negatively, at that.\n\nWe all ended up at the same place, getting ready to swim. But the difference is, one's cutting down his discipline while the other is building it. It's not the destination that matters; it's how you do your journey. The people at your work who are using those rules lazily are cutting down their discipline. You are building it. Keep that in mind.\n\nAt times I still do feel the same way you do about less honor-bound people, and that's something I haven't learned to completely ignore (and maybe never will), but "logic-ing myself out of it" certainly has helped.\n\nHope this helps.
8	That would totally annoy me. Mostly the deception of lying about the hours they have worked. It wouldn’t be as bad if they were working less and being paid less but the lying is not really cool. \n\nOn the flip side, don’t think you’re the only one who notices. What goes around comes around so just keep doing you and the rest will work itself out. 
3	This doesn't always work for me, but I try to remind myself that I must not be busy enough if I'm hung up on others' flaws. The smaller the infraction, the more effective that seems to be.
3	I’m an ENFP, and I’m married to an ISTJ, so I thought I’d offer some insight. \n\nMy hubby encounters the same issue at his work, saying that people are lazy. I think the same in that people just want to put in as little effort as possible. Wether that be in work, relationships, career, school, etc.\n\nRemember that those who leave early and show up late are showing bad character qualities/marketable skills. This has no bearing on how you’re perceived. I understand your frustration, but try to keep in mind that their performance has nothing to do with you. Focus on the things you can control, like how well you perform at work, rather than what others are not doing. 
2	I personally see your irritation and totally agree. I would be able to let it slide if you all were being paid salary.  If you were salary it's much easier to look the other way if these people are in fact getting their work done in that small amount of time. Now, you stated they are being paid hourly.  I too would be ok with this as long as they are getting paid ONLY for the time they were there, but you stated they are writing down 8 hours when they were only there for 3-5 hours.  That in my opinion is stealing and I'm not ok with that.  Being paid hourly and lying about how many hours you worked is not ok.  Depending on how much you like these people and or the company you work for, you may consider talking with your boss.
2	As far as letting it go, I would recommend focusing on the things that make you feel like you have a peace of mind. 
2	Not sure if it applies to your company but my workplace has a similar culture. However, we are able to work outside the office due to having company-issued phones and laptops. A lot of the time, I'm one of the people showing up late or leaving early, but I usually do the rest of my work from home or wherever I am. In reality, I'm frequently doing overtime... We're on a salary so it's a bit different but I'm just trying to say that sometimes people who can look lazy on the outside do a lot of work when nobody's looking.
2	I used to work for a company with a similar policy on flexible hours and for the most part, I feel most people were respectful with putting in their 40 hours. I instead focused on holding myself to my standards, and not other people to my standards. \n\nUnless what they do directly affects me, it's really none of my business as long as they're getting their work done. I've known other people who were overly focused on the number of hours put in or how "hard" they worked, but not the quality or quantity of results produced. If someone is getting the same amount of work done in 4 hours that takes you to do in 8, there is some self-reflection on your part that needs to be done as well.\n\nThere were a few bad eggs that always, every day pushed the boundaries and would come in later, and later, and leave earlier and earlier. I noticed it bothered me more often when I had a lull in my workload and would notice these things more.\n\nHow to let it go?\n\n  \n1) Realize that it's not within your scope of responsibilities to monitor and manage hours worked to correspond with pay. If this is something you want to do, work towards a management position.\n\n2) Keep yourself busy, ask for more work if you find you have time to let your mind wander. I mean in theory you could keep a log of when the worst offenders get in and when they leave, but it's a double edge sword if you go to management. They may ask what are you doing with your time if you're spending so much time watching other people?\n\n3) Realize that even if they're not getting in trouble now, it's still likely management is aware of it, especially if they're slipping in their productivity or if people are unable to find them during business hours. If the work is coming in, they company may not care now, but if work ever slows down and they need to lay people off, those slackers are usually the first ones to be shown the door. \n\n4) Another thing to consider is that if you truly cannot let it go, then maybe this corporate culture isn't a good fit for you. A company that rewards or encourages employees to be inefficient and stealing company time is probably not the most efficient either and until it hits their bottom line, they may not do anything about it. You might be happier at another company that values employees like you more. 
2	Look into enneagram, you might have one of the "superego" types such as 1 or 6. The one person I know who is often upset at seeing such behavior is an ESFJ. It might have some relation to weak intuitive functions.
30	Happily married to an ISTJ! :)	Wanted to just share my story on the ENFP-ISTJ relationship/marriage!\n\nWe met online, on a forum, and he messaged me asking how I was feeling and if I was doing better. (I made a thread about my crappy day.) I appreciated his concern and care for my feelings and we really hit it off. We were long distance for two years before he moved to be with me and we got married shortly after. He’s the kindest, most caring man I’ve ever met. He attempts to understands my feelings, validates my ideas and thoughts, and appreciates who I am. He’s not the most visibly affectionate unless I nudge him and/or initiate, but overall, it’s a very stable, calm, fun relationship.\n\nISTJs, when you become developed and receptive and open to differences and to Ne/Fi, you are the best of the best! Thank you for keeping us grounded and loved. <3 No one expresses commitment and loyalty like an ISTJ! <3 
9	ISTJ here; marrying my ENFP in 12 days!
7	ENFP (M) married to an ISTJ (F) and we're about to hit 10 years in a few months.\n\nLearning that what I saw as a lack of demonstrative love doesn't mean she doesn't love me is perhaps the biggest lesson I've learned in the past 2 years. 
7	I'm an ENFP married to an ISTJ! We're getting ready to celebrate our 15 year wedding anniversary soon! It's not been easy, and we had a rough go for several years. But we've reached a really good place. We both highly value each other's strengths and perspectives (for the most part 😉). Although we did just get in a bit of an argument about a light fixture I decided to remove without first discussing it or "doing it the right way". So, not all perfect. 😆 But, he's the best. Ever. 
3	Ooh duals. Cool. I need an ENFP of my own...
3	Wow, never saw so many other examples! I’m an ENFP married to an ISTJ. I happen to be a male in a male-female marriage, any others like me here?
3	Yes! I am an IxFP and I will have been married to my ISTJ for 4 years as of this Thursday (together for 8)! I always comment on how grounding and loving my ISTJ is!
2	Wow. These are exactly the things my wife says about me. We're Enfp/istj too. Glad to hear both of you are happy together.

1	Boyfriend broke up with me because we have different interests, but the same values	Can anyone shed any light on this? My boyfriend basically told me that with his ex wife there were a lot of little issues over things and he said he thinks some of our issues are the same. For example, I don't like fish. He does. He said he wants to be with someone who likes fish. He runs 5ks, I have asthma. I have been TRYING to get to a place where I can run a 5k, but he said that he wants to be with someone that would already be doing that. Meanwhile, I think the issues he had with his ex wife are because they were vastly different people and didn't share the same values, and I pointed out all the values that we do share, but he basically told me that he wanted an exact replica of himself. That I'm not good enough. I told him I felt like he was being really judgmental and he just got upset with me about it and said I was insulting him and calling him a know it all. I am at a loss. Anyone??
7	I'm going to go against the (current) grain and sympathize with your boyfriend to some extent.  Personally, I would really like to share one or two of my hobbies with a partner.  Coincidentally, one of those is athletics, and it's hard for either party to have fun if there's a drastic difference in ability.  The food thing makes less sense because it seems so minor, but I do a lot of barbequing so it'd be weird for me to date a vegan, for instance.  Maybe he's just trying to avoid saying his feelings have fizzled out and wants to point to an excuse so he doesn't have to explain himself.  Have you been dating for \~6 months?  That's usually when infatuation wears off and deeper connections have to take over.  If he's not feeling a deeper connection at that point, it means you two weren't built to last, unfortunately.\n\nI don't know, saying he's just a narcissist who wants a replica of himself sounds too much like you'd rather paint him as an asshole than understand his motives.  I've had similar experiences where it's hard to find fun things to do with my partner because we don't have any major interests in common despite strong shared values.\n\nIt's not a matter of you being "good enough", it's a matter of you both having what each other wants in a partner.  Having wants doesn't make him a jerk.
5	It kind of sounds like his heart wasn't really in it to begin with. \n\nIf people are thinking in problems instead of solutions things aren't really meant to be. That's been my experience anyway.
3	He is straight up telling you that he does not want to be in a relationship with you. It does not matter if the reason seems small, or weird, or misplaced or that you do not understand his reasoning. Once I am done with something, I am done and there is no going back.\n\nI would be really annoyed and borderline angry if I tried to break off a relationship as gingerly as I could only to have the other person keep rebutting me. At that point, you are forcing my hand to either be brutally honest and hit you over the head with everything or angrily tell you some ridiculous shit to get you to go away.  \n\nThere is no easy way to break up with someone as it is and you have not made it any easier it seems.\n\n
6	He sounds like a jerk and you're better off without him. Wanting to date someone exactly like yourself with all the same hobbies and interests is boring and pretty narcissistic, in my opinion. Nothing to do with MBTI/ISTJ...
2	Values are important, but for some people, shared activities are also important.   That's valid. For my ISTJ gf, shared activities are a form of connection and intimacy. She doesn't require that we do everything together, but being out in the world doing things together is a form of intimacy for her that she would not want to do without in a relationship. \n\nThat said, if someone decides you're incompatible, that's their decision to make. Arguing with someone on that decision isn't a wise use of time/energy in my view. \n\nI suggest you'd be far better off with someone who fully desires a relationship with you, just as you are. 
1	wow you got every right to be upset. "i want to be with someone who likes fish" just wtf. i cant see food being an actual reason someone doesnt want to be with someone else, so unless he's using that as an excuse for something else... hope you'll be all right whatever you do
5	Help an infj(27f) with communication	Hi again. I was here a few weeks ago asking about my istj (32) husband, and I'm back needing more help. \n\nHe broke it to me shortly after I posted here (like days) that he wants to leave me. It's been a huge struggle to get anything in order because I'm an emotional processor and he is a logical one. I'm trying to find a place and move on and he can't even give me a simple answer for anything; he just tries to make himself seem like a hero and I'm so unappreciative and uses this condescending tone. \n\nI know my thought process is emotional, and I try really, really hard to just communicate, but he says things in a way that feels like he's trying to hurt me more, and make me feel bad for being emotional. I'm heartbroken and lost; I can't help it. He's avoiding me every chance he gets. \n\nI know not all istjs act like this, but I also know you are known for processing things logically. I really need help in how to navigate this. We both don't want lawyers involved for monetary reasons. I'm suffering sever depression and really can't handle this stress involved with that anyway. 
4	I'm sorry you're going through this. It must be so stressful.\n\nI don't have any advice to give, but perhaps some insight.\n\nWhen I'm 'done' with something, I'm really done. There's no going back and I just want to move on from it asap. \nFrom your story, that's what I'm reading from your ex here. Having said that, he is being a dick about it :/\n\nI know this sounds cliche, but this too shall pass. Good luck with everything!
5	INFJ in a relationship with an ISTJ here.\n\n>We both don't want lawyers involved for monetary reasons\n\nI really feel like given your descriptions, it's making your stress worse trying to figure this out with him as the only other person involved in the communication/negotiation process. I wish there was some way you could find some outside assistance (if not traditional lawyers, at least a mediation process) so you don't have to do the communication just the two of you. It really just doesn't seem to be working. But I also understand sometimes resources just aren't there for what's needed.\n\nSo - onward...\n\n---------------\n\n>I know not all istjs act like this, but I also know you are known for processing things logically. I really need help in how to navigate this. \n\nIf he is correclty typed as ISTJ, then I suggest you focus only on what he is saying in a logistical way and don't read into anything at the emotional level.\n\nIn your communication with him, focus only and specifically on getting the tasks and logistics taken care of. Start here:\n\n>He's avoiding me every chance he gets. \n\nWell, he needs to engage enough to do what needs doing to handle his responsibilities at the logistical level related to ending a legal contract. Communicate that to him clearly, assertively and without emotion. \n\nYou should probably keep for yourself a running list of tasks and logistics that need attending to and keep track of which one require communication with him and what kinds. This is exhausting for an INFJ, I know. Pace yourself. Identify, seek and use any other support resources apart from him that you have available (like your friends/family).\n\nOnly interact with him as is absolutely necessary to get things done that you need done. Put up your boundaries and keep them up when you're interacting with him. He's not a a friendly entity in your life, he's someone who can do you harm right now. Take that seriously and navigate carefully.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nAs for insights  into ISTJs: Keep clear in your communication with him that you aren't looking for any emotional processing with him, but that you do need him to step up and take responsibility for the tasks associated with ending the legal contract that is marriage. Insist that he be present and fair for this part of the process. He made promises entering into this legal contract and he needs to honor whatever logistical responsibilities come with breaking those promises. Be firm, assertive, and keep emotion out of it.\n\nShift your emotional processes away from interactions with him into other areas of your life. Shift your internal understanding of his role in your life. He is not part of your emotional support system now. He's someone you have to deal with as part of the unpleasant process of getting stressful logistical tasks dealt with.\n\nI hope that is of some assistance somehow.\n\n\n\n\n\n
2	I think I probably posted on your previous thread as I’m an INFP with an ISTJ partner. They can be tremendously stubborn, so he is probably digging his heels in and waiting to do things his way (the only RIGHT way in his mind). My partner and I have huge issues with communication, so I’m the last one to give advice there. I wish you luck, though, and hope everything works out in the best way possible for everyone. 
1	Man, I'm in the opposite position. My INFJ (32 M) husband is trying to leave me ISTJ (32 F). He probably will leave me, but has agreed to counseling because he "owes me." I don't want to talk about it. I'm still in the stage of watching my heart being picked apart and am just looking for hope.\n\nI wish I had advice for you. All I can say is what my counselor keeps telling me. He's not going to give you much credit because he probably doesn't want to bring up reasons to believe there's hope in you or this relationship--it's harder to leave someone you admire than it is to leave someone you resent.\n\nI don't know your financial situation, but I think it would be a good investment to hire a lawyer if you two can't come to an agreement as to how to divide up your assets. It should help you distant your emotions from him (assuming that's what you want) and help resolve things quicker.\n\nNormally, I would recommend trying to shake off his responses as nothing more than logical and not personal, but this whole thing is personal and he probably doesn't know how to balance his words. He may just not want to be sensitive to your needs either. It's selfish and not right, but if he doesn't feel loyalty to you then he probably doesn't care.\n\nI apologize if my words were harsh. I really am hurting for you. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.
9	Help me (INTP) make my ISTJ's life easier	Okay, so someone at work asked me my MBTI yesterday and this was something I had never really considered before but it totally explains some issues my boyfriend and I have. I am basically "too much" for him sometimes and he just totally withdrawls from me and I drive him nuts with my thinking and overthinking and long messages and explanations. I have started to try meditating and taking a page out of his book and just totally loading myself up with things to do, or just being really mindful about how he feels about what I'm about to do before I dump all of my thoughts onto him. I am an INTP and I would ordinarily say that I am 100&#37; INTP, but dating a guy with kids has pushed me a tad closer into INFP territory, I think. I feel like the overall experience with his kids has changed me somehow, but it's not over the top, it's just slightly noticeable. Anyway, I really can't get over how much this explains, because I plan fun trips for us with all kinds of stuff he's never done before and he enjoys himself but it's never quite the reaction I am looking for, or I get him little things and he's just annoyed by it, but he gets me pocket knives because I run alone at night, a toilet light because I pee in the dark at night, and a screwdriver set with smaller screw bit things because mine is bigger... that was the most interesting Christmas I've ever had.\n\nSo, about him, he is 39, been divorced twice, last was 2 years ago. He has 3 kids and has been going through a custody battle since his divorce which just finished 2 months ago. He had primary custody at first but now it is 50/50. He is a physician and in the army. He just told me this week that he is not happy. I think he feels like a failure. He is going to have to give his ex child support which is being worked out, he has to choose between being in the army or completely missing out on a lot of time with his kids which was vastly different when he was with his ex, he is in a lot of debt from the lawyers from all of this being dragged out, he had a lot of plans for the future that got messed up when she left him. Oh, and she cheated on him, refused to accompany him and the kids on a deployment and quite literally stole the kids and kept him away from them for over a month.\n\nAnyway, he has a lot of issues in his life and I put myself into fixer mode for some of it and I think it started to drive him nuts. I have stopped giving him so much advice because I think he is so overwhelmed and mostly just wants to vent to me. I really, really heard him when he said he wasn't happy and I want to do everything in my power to do that for him. And I think I finally get that, for him, that is just somehow making his life easier. His life is very complicated. I used to help him clean, cook, and do things around the house even though we don't live together. I know he appreciated it because it drives him nuts when things are messy, but I also think it annoyed him because it was like his thing and he wasn't doing a good job or something. But, his ex was a stay at home mom and now he has a huge house and 3 kids and lots of shit to do alone!\n\nSo, today I put what I learned into practice. I was going to give him a fun father's day present, but yesterday he was bitching to me about the disorder of his pots and pans in the pantry and that it was somewhat distressing to him. I got him a whole bunch of wire rack organizers, with pictures I printed out of how people organized their cabinets with them. I dropped off his gift with a little note basically saying that I have had an epiphany and a very small summary of my understanding of the situation and I hope that he enjoys this gift for once. As I gave it to him, he was like, "you're not supposed to give me crap anymore..." but I think he was pleasantly surprised. At least I think. Anyway, I left very quickly because this was a somewhat surprise visit and he sometimes doesn't like those.\n\nANYWAY, what little things can I do to make his life easier? Does anyone have any tips? I am totally willing to do any and everything you guys suggest and my man deserves the world. For example, he loads himself up on chores when the kids are with their mom. Sometimes I think he totally forgets about me. And lately I have offered just basically a booty call and he will squeeze me in for that but it gets to the point where he can't even relax and sit next to me because he has to go do something. The other day I went over to his house under the ruse of baking something and I left an ingredient at his place. I ended up baking for like 2 hours, and he finished his stuff from work, did a little bit of chores, and he had a dresser he had to put together for his daughter so I ended up helping him with that and then we just went to bed. I think that was a really good night, but if I had asked him to come over he would have said he was busy, but I kind of snuck myself in there. Another thing is that he doesn't want to spend money right now but he feels bad when I buy everything, but like, sometimes I want to do SOMETHING that costs money and I'm the one offering because I want to do it WITH HIM. Is there some way that I should be saying this better or suggesting things? Oh, I also called to ask him for advice earlier. And I have not been feeling well so I asked him to check on me. I figured those were things he would like to do.\n\nAlso, while I have your attention, can I ask if it is typical that he routinely gets jealous/upset/defensive with me talking (literally just talking)to other guys (I am quite a bit younger than him and certainly not ugly) but he and I both work in the same place with people he's slept with and I have to see his ex wife pretty regularly?
1	> I plan fun trips for us with all kinds of stuff he's never done before and he enjoys himself but it's never quite the reaction I am looking for, or I get him little things and he's just annoyed by it.\n\nI wouldn’t say this has to do with your respective MBTIs necessarily. I’m an INTP (male) married to an ISTJ, and she also plans trips and stuff and is unhappy with me not being enthusiastic enough. Might be more of a gender difference. 
1	How can I develop my inferior Si?	
7	I think this is like asking ENFPs how to develop Ne. Shouldn’t you ask more balanced ENFPs or other types that have inferior Si how they managed to develop theirs? To ISTJs this is their natural strong suit.
4	Learn from your past.
2	You mean NE, don't you?
2	Hey, an INTP here. Had a similar issue and I started doing yoga + meditation, and that helped a lot. Certainly stopped me from dying of inferior Fe tantrums.\n\nhttps://personalityjunkie.com/09/introverted-sensing-sensation-si/
1	I guess you could try making notes of challenges you faced throughout your day-to-day life, how they made you feel, how you resolved them. The objective of this is to help you recall past experiences.\n\nWhat I understand is that Si is about remembering and cataloging past experiences and recalling them in future when we need them.\n\nMaybe another way would be to use superior Ne to help you remember/recall things (by connecting the dots?), but that's my inferior so I can't advise on that.
5	Hello ISTJs! I’m wondering what “type” or even what qualities you look for in a SO - more specifically what type of person you would want to settle down with	
26	Alright time to get personal so be nice. ;)\n\nI’ve been married twice. My first wife was my first girlfriend. We were married 5 years and everything was good except she didn’t complete what she said she would. She got 99% done with a college degree and then dropped out. She quit a few jobs without giving me a heads up. I loved her to death but I had to protect myself and my family. So I had to get a divorce. It was the hardest choice I ever made. I made the suggestion of therapy in the past. But she didn’t take it until it was too late. \n\nAnother story is that years ago when we were poor we moved to a new town to get a better job. My budget said it would be okay if she got a job. She didn’t get a job. I started missing credit card payments and my credit score dropped to 430. \n\nLesson there is I find resilience and a sense of duty very desirable. I also find being able to do what you say very desirable. I plan everything based on the info I have. The other thing is being able to better yourself even if it’s uncomfortable. \n\nOn to my second wife. \n\nShe’s a foreigner from China. English is her second language. When we started living together I would work from home some days and I noticed something. She started reading a book and then writing down new English words on flash cards and studying. Not because I asked her to but because she wanted to better herself. I took a mental note and moved on. This continued every day and then she asked how she could get a job to help our family. \n\nThere’s a big difference between the two of them. \n\nBut main highlights:\n\nShe bettered herself without prompting. \nShe actively worked on getting a job instead of watching tv. \nAnd she pushes me to grow every day. Because we actively communicate about things in the open. \n\nEven though my first marriage was “easier” in the sense that I didn’t deal with immigration bs I’m much happier in my second marriage. \n\nHope that helps. 
13	Theoretically I would prefer someone who is also an introvert, but I think it would be foolish to get tunnelvision and only look for specific qualities in a potential partner.\nYou could miss out on a great match you wouldn't have expected ahead of time.
8	One thing I was specifically looking for, was someone who could complement me not be identical. As an introvert and a very pragmatic one at that, I wanted someone who is more extroverted and more emotional who could help me to get out of my shell, a little bit. Someone who is very strongly on the extroverted, emotional side, would’ve been difficult. However I was able to find someone who is more in the middle of the spectrum, which I think provides a good balance
4	1. Intelligence.\n2. Cool headedness. \n3. Depth.\n4. No drama!\n5. A hint of romance and passion is always welcomed. \n
3	Must haves include religious, attractive, and smart. \n\nWants include pro-life, introvert, athletic, and not super sensitive.\n\nDealbreakers are drugs, kids, and divorce.\n\nAnything beyond that is fine by me unless it makes for a bad pairing.
3	I've been married just over a year.\n\nI would say I looked for a man who was stable (emotionally, economically, etc.) and independent (can function like an adult without me). Other attractive qualities to me include funny, smart, and affectionate.\n\nIt should be common sense to say, don't long term date someone if you already know you don't want the same things in life. Talk about it. I wanted to get married and have 2 or 3 kids. I wouldn't waste my time dating a man who didn't want that.\n\nI would probably not stay with someone who made me feel exhausted. I'd be exhausted with a complete party animal, someone who wanted to travel all the time, or even someone who talked almost constantly and expected me to listen. It's a totally different lifestyle than I prefer.\n\nIt's going to vary for each person. Many differences can be overcome with excellent communication and knowing your love language.
3	Well I’m gay, so my SO would need to be a man.\n\nShort term; I’d want someone who can appreciate my cooking, is generally kind, and someone who is okay with setting  many rules schedules, and standards. Someone who doesn’t expect me to be the most socially outgoing, but also someone who can drag me out of the house when need be. Maybe someone who could (without being annoying) persuade me to try new things -in small doses. Someone who understands my need for personal space. Although I do also like affection. \n\n\nFor long term: Someone  with a good job, someone who wants to raise children, someone who doesn’t need a house, but instead wants a city apartment. 
2	I have have a laundry list of qualities but really everything is a trade off. What I would like above all else is a Robin to my Batman where we can operate in sync with little to no discussion or just exchanging a look.\n\nLaundry List\n\nSmart\n\nConfident\n\nOrganized\n\nStraightforward\n\nPersuasive\n\nFunny\n\nIntroverted\n\nDecisive\n\nBad-ass\n\nPrepared\n\nEccentric\n\nFoul Mouthed\n\nGeek (but not a weeb)\n

8	What is the best way to deal with an angry ISTJ?	My bf is an ISTJ and I’m an INFP. As you can imagine, our relationship is pretty interesting. Our communication styles clash completely. When he is upset, I tend to stay away from him and withdraw. This only makes things worse, but I can’t ignore the issues and pretend everything is okay because then nothing gets resolved. If I sit down to have a conversation with him about it, I can’t speak my mind. All I get to do is listen to him talk until I agree with him. If I disagree with him (even if it is about something black and white and he’s wrong), he will just keep talking and explaining until I agree with him. I don’t know how to have an open conversation where we both are able to voice our issues and have them both be heard. But really I just need to know...ISTJ’s, when you are angry, what is the best route your SO can take with you? Also, I know everyone is different, but is it an ISTJ trait to drag things out? In previous relationships with other personality types, any tiffs we had were water under the bridge the next day. My bf seems to hold onto things a lot longer. A “spat” can affect us for a week sometimes. 
30	Personally, when I'm angry, I just want some alone space to blow off steam until I'm not in rage mode so I can come back more level-headed and figure out how to get through the issue.  I need to get my feelings out so I can return to rational, problem solving mode.\n\nI don't like to drag things out, especially conflict.  I just want to "solve the problem", get to a resolution, and move on.  Your BF's behavior isn't an ISTJ thing, it's more just an immaturity thing.  He'll fix it if he gets it in his mind that it's a project that's worth tackling over time.  He'll bunker down and entrench himself if he feels like he's being made to change against his will.  I'm not really sure how to help you get him to the former state of mind, maybe someone else has good advice for that.\n
8	Uh I usually withdraw to avoid saying something I can't take back while angry and then talk about it later. As for drawing things out I someone can't prove me wrong with facts or logic then i'm going to dig in like it's 1916.\n\nBecause when i'm petulant i'm not going to just give in to make up, I will do the opposite/nothing of what someone demands of me out of spite.\n\nAs far as suggestions, I'd say listen to their talking points and calmly dismantle them with your own rebuttals.
9	With me, it's just best to leave me alone for some time afterwards most of the time. Sure, I may angrily talk about it for some period of time even after that, but at least I won't be tempted to just angrily tell you to piss off.
5	I (INFJ) don't experience my ISTJ SO like this at all. She's really great at communication. She doesn't have anger issues like your bf. I question whether MBTI type is the most useful lens through which to understand this dynamic/situation. \n\nAs I write the above, I'm thinking about my last relationship with an INFP. She had major anger issues. And both she and my current SO are enneagram 9s, so it's not simply enneagram type, but my SO is a far healthier 9 than my ex.\n\nAs I write all of this, I begin to wonder not only about your respective enneagram types and levels of health, but also wonder if MBTI has any relevance ... perhaps you being Fi-dom in the mix may be playing in. \n\n> I don’t know how to have an open conversation where we both are able to voice our issues and have them both be heard.\n\nFi is really tricky when it comes to what this requires, in my non-Fi experience. Basically, my experience with Fi is that all it wants is to be agreed with and validated. \n\nYou can't question or discuss or even sometimes ask for clarification on Fi judgement when it is in force. Especially when it is intertwined with any amount of frustration or irritation or anger. This was my experience with my INFP ex and it is my experience when Fi-tert comes up in my SO. Just say affirming and supporting things, that's what Fi seems to want. Which is fine when there is extremely strong values convergence and Fi is not a really strong preference (as is the case with my current SO) But for me was a huge problem with my INFP ex. Sometimes it was not okay for me to just sit there and take in her angry rants and be all affirming.\n\nBut my ISTJ SO is one of the gentlest people I know, and she is beyond excellent at listening carefully and well, and taking in information in a non-angry/non-defensive way that can then be used in our cooperative mutual communication and decision-making/problem-solving process together.\n\nSo I don't know what all of this means, but will post it as information  into the mix of your "figuring this out" process. Hopefully it will have some use for you.\n\n
3	Anger is the result of frustration, a loss of control over something.  You might consider recent situations, and see if there was some sort of control game going on.  It can be subtle.\n\nAlso, someone breaking the rules willfully and knowingly, or simply irrational feelz\-based behaviors, can create frustration.  Illogical positions can be frustrating to one who views the world rationally.\n\nTry this one sometime you feel a conflict developing: "How interesting.  You see that completely differently than I do!  Help me understand.".  And then actually listen.  You already know ISTJs love to explain things.  You obviously don't have to agree, but do be prepared to respond rationally somehow.  An ISTJ won't change, won't agree, just because you "feel" differently.  For example, your ISTJ may think, "I don't care if you "feel" the sky is green.  It isn't.  It's blue.  Quit arguing about it!"; the world is rather like that for ISTJs, if I may speak generally.\n\nI will argue hammer\-and\-tongs for my position, until you show me facts that point out I'm in error.  I'll agree if you can show me what I'm missing, where I'm wrong.  That's ok!  As long as we're talking about some issue, some facts, something objective, we're good.  When it goes personal, or simply irrational, is when it goes sideways.

4	Guy sounds immature more than anything. It is a bit offensive that you assume it’s just part of his personality archetype, but if that’s the lens through which you view the world, I get it.\n\nFirst of all, anger on a regular basis is just unhealthy. What in his life is causing him this stress, and how much of it is of his own making? The fact is that you should not need to adapt and learn how to deal with people who are consistently angry, that’s a fucked up situation.\n\nThe choice to hold grudges is also pretty juvenile. It means that he is not able to work through his social issues to an adequate degree to move past them.\n\nYou’re definitely going to need to talk to him about his fundamental communication style and how it isn’t working for your mutual satisfaction. You also should encourage him to solve some of the root causes of his stress.\n\nGood luck.
1	I agree with what /u/lustigjh said, further more, I think it’s best to approach this the same way your approach a computer or a 3 year old baby. \n\nTeach him more about MBTI and how to start to understand how you view and percieve things. Taking a second to see the world from others people’s perspective has really helped me with communicating and expressing myself. \n\nIf he refuses to take the time to see how you view things perciece the world around you, i think it’s best to end things between the two of you. The last thing you need in this world is an immature ISTJ. Trust me, I’ve been there. \n\nBest of luck

3	ISTJ burdened to sensing?	Do any other ISTJs feel burdened to sensing?\n\nIt seems I often find myself drifting into sensing in some way. I drink several sodas daily, listen to hundreds of hours of internet radio monthly, and watch at porn and anime when I have the chance. It’s like I continually have to engage that Si to function. It’s so seemless it’s like breathing. It can be mildly time wasting but not harmful.\n\nHow are you other ISTJs?
3	I don't feel burdened to Si at all - in fact, it's one of my greatest strengths.  I'm not sure what you're describing is Si (our form of sensing), anyway, as much as general addiction to addicting things.  (Si is more about sensory recall than sensory indulgence from what I understand.)\n\nI used to drink several cans of pop a day and still struggle to limit the amount of sugar I eat.  It's possible to break these habits if you commit to it long enough for your body and mind to adjust to a new lifestyle.
3	I do the same, though in the last years I swapped soda with coffee and water. I don't feel like it's a burden though. I also consume a lot of internet radio, anime, games and so on. But it's things I like so I don't really have a problem with it. I feel like consuming art and content you like is important to life.
2	if you wanna kick sodas i hear it's easier to do by gradually decreasing. anyway nah i never have these problems lol
1	This type of behaviour, for me, is triggered when I am bored out of my mind. If you stay occupied (the absolute best thing is being productive), you won't have time nor think about doing these things.\n\nI read that ISTJs might obsessively consume (over-do) one type of drink or edible. So make that water.\n\nNow speaking more direct towards the apparent addict in you, decrease the amount of everything over time. There is no such thing as quitting a bad habit, only replacing with another one or a good one.
8	Does this ISTJ(m) like me more than friends?	I'm an INTJ female and have been talking to this male ISTJ I met for a few months.\n\nWe initially began talking because we were partners in class and I started to become aware that he would not leave the classroom until I left and then would be right behind me not saying anything at all. Then, one day we were talking about something as class ended and he ended up walking me to my car and it became an unspoken routine for the entire semester even if we were not talking about anything. In fact, the two times I broke the routine, he gave me this look and I decided that he did not like that and I never did it again.\n\nI wanted to get to know him better and I figured like we were not going to get anywhere if I didn't initiate things with him. So eventually, I asked him to go to the school diner with me (just as friends) and this became part of my unspoken routine with him where we would go out at least once a week. \n\nOne day he asked me what I thought about him (like first impressions) and I told him a variety of things and included how I thought he was a sweet guy.\n\nI came to that last conclusion because it felt like he was always courting me or at least trying to. So the next time I saw him in person he was acting different and I figured that he did not want to be the "sweet guy".\n\nEventually, he reverted back to normal, but in our later interactions, he randomly began to talk about how he really liked tall women (I am not tall) and even started pointing out random girls when we would be out just because they are tall. One time there was a girl walking with heels on and he just like stood still and checked her out. In fact, like he went into detail about his ideal woman and like I just don't fit anywhere in his list especially personality wise (submissive). \n\nI figured maybe he was trying to send a message to me due to the randomness of it and I left it that. For whatever reason, he stopped doing this. If I tell him I don't like something, he responds with very few words, however, his behavior changes and he kind of acts like nothing ever happened.\n\nNow when we go out, he tries to make up reasons why he should cover everything and will insist unless I roll my eyes, sometimes it almost seems as if he is mimicking my behavior, and he is always staring to the point where I start to feel a little nervous so I try not to notice and I end up laughing.\n\nI would like to hear from him more often, but he's a really busy guy and takes forever to respond to texts (I've recently learned that it's probably partly because his phone is in airplane mode).\n\nDespite being very different people, I just feel close to him, like sometimes we just "get" each other. Is he just being friendly?\n
16	ISTJ's from my experience are really bad at emotions unless they've developed that part of themselves. \n\nThey are practical people who like routine, especially ones that have worked out well in the past. That doesn't necessarily translate into interest in someone though. They may just feel comfortable around you. (That was the case with my ISTJ friend). \n\nAnd also don't overthink ISTJ's. They aren't really that symbolic and will just tell you straight up what they think (oftentimes blunt and insensitive but no harm intended). \n\nI've noticed that if ISTJ's are interested in a person, they are pretty obvious about it (flirting, describing the person, contacting them, initiating conversations, 'liking' their statuses on fb a lot, etc.) These are patterns I've gathered from my friend. I've known him for almost 10 years lol. 
9	Tldr, Just ask him directly. 
6	Honestly, sounds like he is interested, but he seems pretty socially inept and possibly shy. I speak from experience. I personally act in this sort of manner with girls I am interested in. I will be as formal as possible so as to not cross any boundaries that I don't quite know.\n\nI feign my personal "type" so as to avoid suspicion of liking the girl in question. This is perhaps what he is doing.\n\nI probably would want to be called sweet either. Many girls will say that if they want to "remain friends". It's a bad sign if one is pursuing a relationship. It may also be that he wants to be taken seriously. I personally tend to react negatively if a girl calls my actions "cute" or "sweet" because it seems insincere (even when it's not).\n\nAll in all, I'm very inexperienced when it comes to romantic relationships. To me, it sounds like he is inexperienced as well. \n\nIf you like him, then you have to "give him clearance" so to speak. Make sure you are being obvious in your interest in him. \n\nIf you don't like him, you also have to be obvious and let him know that you aren't attracted to him. Don't lead him on. He will likely accept this quietly and remain friends.\n\nOf course, could be 100% wrong. All people are different and often act in erratic and illogical ways.\n\nGood luck with whatever you decide
5	I would straight up tell him. Secure him as a boyfriend before he accepts you two as just good friends and moves on. 
2	This sounds exactly like something I'd do if I liked someone. There's only one way for you to find out though.
1	Do you think he would treat you differently if you two were a couple? By different, I mean more accessible. If not, how would you feel? I think that would give you the answers to see if you want to ask him if he's interested romantically.

6	Any advice on dealing with an ISTJ boss?	Original thread on /r/mbti:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/8nmu6k/what_type_is_my_boss/
6	It's not coginitive styles we deal with so much - it's their personalities (which speak to their underlying fears and motivations). The ISTJ cognitive style comes in many flavors. If he's an Enneagram Type 3 Personality, he's going to be about image and order. You need to make him look good. If he's a Type 5, he'll want order and his expectations met with as little communication from him as possible. Types 6 and 8 will be variations of the 3 and 5 respectively. 
1	Just make sure you stay within the regs and everything looks neat and tidy as possible. That alone makes ISTJs like myself pleased.
9	Advice for ISTJ and ENFP?	I'm an ENFP female dating an ISTJ male and was wondering if any of you have general advice for me. We love each other very much, and he's very emotional/affectionate despite the normal cold stereotype of his type. However, we do argue a bit too frequently for either of our liking and we're trying to understand each other better and learn what the other person needs.\n\nI'm very emotional and overly sensitive, and he loses patience with me sometimes.\n\nAny advice much appreciated 
10	I am an ISTJ, and my ENFP and I have been together for almost 20 years. The rare times we argue, I have to watch how I'm arguing because 'cold' and 'sarcastic' could be my middle names. She has learned that it's easier to convince me of something with facts.\n\nA lot of our arguments have been in relation to social time. I desperately need my alone time, and she equally desperately needs time with other people. We've learned to give each other that. I know that she's going to go out and have a few drinks after work. I know that if I want to join her, I'm invited, no questions asked. If I don't want to join her, she knows where to find me (at home binge watching netflix). We sometimes have to do what the other one wants, but she doesn't freak out if I wander off alone.
6	I’m an INFP and have been dating an ISTJ for 2.5 years. Like yours, my ISTJ can be warm and affectionate at times. However, our biggest problem is how we deal with communication and conflict. He has the need to be right, and I have the need to feel peace. These often conflict. He doesn’t understand my emotions and can sometimes be extra cold and sarcastic to me if we are in a conflict. It’s almost as if neither of us knows how to deal with the other person, so we both just go our separate ways, and that makes things worse. There are often misunderstandings about what the other is thinking or feeling, I think because I am very self-aware and he is not. I know this sounds like doom and gloom, but we do love each other and ultimately want to work on our relationship to make it better. In a lot of ways, we balance each other well. This is just my experience with an ISTJ as an INFP and may not be your experience. 
5	My husband and I are the exact opposite as you. He's ENFP and I'm ISTJ. It can definitely be tough but it's also a great balance if you learn to appreciate each other for your differences. \n\nI write a blog post about our opposing personalities.\n\nhttp://hotandsourblog.com/2018/03/06/opposites-attract/
3	Give him rules. Do whatever you need to do to figure out *what* you need from him and lay it out as rules for behavior. He will work well with that, I would guess. It arms him with everything he needs to meet your needs.\n\nWhat’s required of you is to be perfectly honest with yourself so that you can be honest with him, and to be forgiving while he makes the adjustments that he needs to make to calibrate to your needs.\n\nWe learn rules. We love rules. But we need to know them to make sure we color inside the lines.
3	You have seen the warning signs. They alarmed you enough to make you reach out to strangers on the internet. 
3	I honestly think ENFP and ISTJ are very difficult to be together. According to socionics, these two are in conflicting relationship. It is the worst compatibility between partners among all other types. I have met a lot of my conflicting types. Usually we start with good impressions, rather attractive, mostly. and then we start to develop misunderstandings and notice something is always going wrong. Those errors in the flow of coexisting can sum up to really painful problems afterwards. In my opinion, just end it as soon as possible and don’t overthink it too much. It’s not your fault that you fall in love with your conflicting type. It’s normal to be attracted to each other in the beginning and also normal to gradually causing minor conflicts to each other later. It’s a trap within the dialog of socializing. 
4	Well, the depressing advice I have is that opposites often attract because your differences are novel and exciting but those kinds of relationships tend to fall apart after about 6 months when the novelty wears off and there's not enough commonality to justify a real relationship. \n\nMy encouraging advice is that you've recognized the problem (sensitivity and coldness do not mix well) so you can address it and maybe find a happy medium for both of you. I'd bet that you're arguing because you're both frustrated with your differences and if that's the case, it'll get better as you both learn to respect each other's nature. \n\nFor your boyfriend, I suggest that he really try to explore his emotions and affection and see if opening himself up to being more emotional helps. I'm a similar emotion-prone ISTJ male and my current "embrace feeling and emotions" self-improvement project has helped me connect with "feelers" a lot better.\n\nI'm not sure what to suggest you do to meet him halfway, except to lead by example and let him follow you to a happy medium rather than making it sound like you expect him to change at your behest. Maybe you should pay attention to times where conflicts have resolved and remember that conflicts don't have to be anything more than temporary phases that you fix. 
2	This should help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqlxAF1fpbA\n\nPractice noticing function behavior and the reason for a function behavior. Understand function interactions when it comes to socializing. Notice the energy they have and the energy they create. Take an ISJs Si "push" against an INP. Their Si pushes against the INP's Ne, but this makes the INP's Ne want to push back. Ne doesn't want to conform to Si. This creates conflict. The ISJ is trying to appeal to the INP's Si, but that's their third function. They need to practice and get in the habit of appealing to the INP's second and first functions. It can be difficult, strenuous, and energy-consuming at first, but once you get used to it and more comfortable with it due to the positive outcome, it becomes much easier.\n\nIt's all about tuning into the right frequency.

8	Thinking but not saying?	Hey guys, I was hoping you could enlighten me, a 27f infj, as to whether or not I'm on to something. \n\nMy husband has this really terrible habit telling me he said something he never said. I'm always trying to give people the benefit of the doubt, so I finally (after being together for 7 years) thought, "maybe he was thinking that but never actually said it?" It get to be pretty infuriating sometimes, because it always gives him a leg up in an argument. I tend to withdrawal myself when he does this because it feels like a lie! \n\nSo, is this something related to personality, or just him needing to be right? Or is that something istjs are known for? I love this man immensely, and really just want to understand what's going on in that complex head of his! 
6	How are you sure he hasnt said something he _says_ he said? If you are sure then surely you can just retell how whatever conversation he's refering to actualy went? \n\nIdk what this could have to do with mbti types.. but if we are to talk types his Si should be good at recollocting what he said in detail, and doesnt leave much room for recalling something with no ground in physical reality (i.e. probably didnt just _think_ he said somethimg)\n\nI for one will never recall something I or anyone else hasn't actually said. If anything, I pride myself in my ability ro recall things in detail. And will be quiet (read: very) annoyed if someone tries to tell me I remember wrong. \n\nAnyway, I would find it more likely that a Si dom would lie about 'remembering'  having said something rather then actually misremembering often.\n\nOr maybe you interpreted it differently? That would explain how he might have said X, which you remember meaning Y, And so he would recall 'saying' X? \n\nAlternatively; are you sure he's an ISTJ?\n\nOn a side note prehaps you could try asking for details around what he claims to have said, if its true he should be able to recall them! \nDont let something like that go often, you view them as lies (since you dont believe them to be true); and that'll fester and lead to no good.

5	Gaslighting?
2	>telling me he said something he never said.\n\nI'm INFJ in a relationship with an ISTJ (2.5 years) and she's never done this. \n\nThat said, my SO has told me that she knows that she can and has done something like what /u/MadRoxana  describes here:\n\n> I sometimes wrongly assume that, even if succint, it should be as clear for the person I'm talking to as it is for me. So I tend not to give details about the subject, which means that the other person doesn't always fully understand what I mean/want/etc.\n\nWhich hasn't been an issue for us, since I know to ask for clarification if anything she says isn't clear to me. I really haven't had the experience of her saying she said something she didn't, in any case.\n\n>It get to be pretty infuriating sometimes, because it always gives him a leg up in an argument. \n\nThis is a relationship problem regardless of type - that either of you would have a concern about wht gets a "leg up" in an argument. Healthy relationship is a partnership in which the couple faces issues and problems together as a team. I say this from experience, me and my SO have this team approach and it is wonderful and effective in together navigating difficult stuff, whatever it may be.\n\nHaving a focus on who wins an argument is a problem in itself. 
1	Maybe he did say it, but he worded it differently the first time and just assumed you understood it? Could be just a case of miscommunication. \n\nOr maybe he's just bullshitting you to get you to agree with him. Honestly, one of my personal pet peeves is when people state that they said shit that I clearly don't remember them saying (my mom does this frequently and it really irks me). \n\nI personally would never do this, because then I would be lying, and if I'm lying, then I would lose any reason that I may have had to begin with. If I have to lie to get a point across, chances are I'm not right at all. Can't really speak for everyone else, maybe it's not really related to type, but I thought we ISTJs were fond of truth, honesty and integrity and all that good jazz? Again, it could be just a miscommunication.
1	I typically know what I have said or at least the gist of it and what other people have said fairly accurately. Where I flub up is if I’m experiencing a lot of stress or trying to multitask and I’m not really focused so it ends up being a lapse in my memory. \n\nI am more of a “thinking to talk” type of person and so I hate being put on the spot, I need a few hours/days to mull things over and I prefer written communication to get my points across. 
1	ISTJ here.\n\nI usually tend to say things in a succint way and on a very normal/neutral tone. Even something that it's important to me. \n\nThe information is very clear to me so I sometimes wrongly assume that, even if succint, it should be as clear for the person I'm talking to as it is for me. So I tend not to give details about the subject, which means that the other person doesn't always fully understand what I mean/want/etc.\n\nSince I don't give details on the subject, and adding the neutral tone, even if she/he usually understands 100%, the importance that the subject carries for me might not be that clear. If it's something unimportant to them, and I don't state that it's something important for me, then it's normal it will remain unimportant to them.\n\nSo I suggest that you explain to your ISTJ that you have different ways to process info and that you need him to give you more details and specify when something is important to him. And that he shouldn't expect that everything he says will be treated as very important info. Nobody does that. Not even ISTJs.\n\nAlso, this doesn't mean he's not trying to manipulate you of some sorts. Is he's good or bad intended it's up to you to decide, we don't know him.\n\nBest of luck
1	It might just be a guy thing haha. My Dad does this sort of thing all the time.
1	My ISTJ bf does this to me all the time when I know for a fact that he didn’t tell me something. He will tell me a story about someone I’ve never heard of and then act like I’m the one with the problem because he has told me about that person before. I have a memory like a steel trap, and his is (by his own admission) terrible, so I swear I’m right most of the time. In fact, right now we aren’t on speaking terms because I came home with Greek food and he swears he told me he will never eat Greek food again after the last time it upset his stomach. Lol 
2	ISTJ Communications Majors?	Any ISTJs out there who are or have majored in Communications? What jobs have you gone into? ISTJ Organizational Communications major here. 
2	I graduated several years ago with a bachelor's degree in Mass Communications. \n\nMy husband and I started our own design company six years ago. He is an ENTP, so clearly he is the 'mouth' (his term, not mine) of the company. It works out beautifully. \n\nThis is my dream job. A degree in communications doesn't force you to constantly be surrounded by others, or even 'on' all the time. I believe it is a broad enough field that you have options. Decide your level of comfort, and shoot for your goals!\n\nHope that helps. 
2	Have an advertising degree...I'm a copywriter now. Been in agencies, internet startups, the corporate world and now work from home which is fabulous. In all my office jobs, being a little weird and quirky is normal for a creative. And once people got to know me, they realized how bad it was to poke the bear when I was concentrating or on a deadline or not feeling like joining in on singing Happy Bday to Susan in customer service. On a good day, someone would bring me donuts, give me clear instructions (a proper creative brief) and leave me the hell alone. 
29	Any other ISTJs ok with being single and don't see why everyone is in a rush to be in a relationship/get married?	So many people around me are getting married. All the people I think of being 19 or 20. And I have a friend is is depressed from getting dumped and going on with this rebound chick who I don't think he actually cares for much. Anyone not get this? I have shit I want to improve on myself and I have no desire to try to get a GF right now at this point in my life (19 years old). And I love the fact that I'm okay with it
11	I'm ok with being single to the extent that I don't feel like I'm lacking something for not being in a relationship.  However, I want to start a family at some point and I do enjoy relationships so I'm definitely looking.\n\n19 or 20 is young for marriage in my opinion, though.  People change a lot in their early 20s, especially if they graduate college.
7	INFP male 22 here, I don't see any point to dating. I don't want to be chained to anyone right now. Maybe it's part of being of a late bloomer, but I just want to flirt. I don't want to shut down the party as soon as it starts. Nor do I want to sleep around. I just want things to be casual.\n\nIf I were you I wouldn't feel guilty. Too much pressure is put on young people's sexuality these days.
5	I'm 28 and not in a hurry what so ever, good luck OP.
5	I feel like I'm in the minority here, but ever since graduating from college I've been super gung-ho about getting into a relationship. I felt similarly in college, but I was too busy focusing on getting good grades to give a rat's ass about relationships (though I did have a couple of flings). I think part of the issue is that I've never been in a relationship, and I feel like I'm behind the curve for my age now that I'm nearing 24 (I know, ancient right?) and in my head, I have this life plan of getting married by 28 or 30 and having kids before 32-ish. In addition, many of my friends around me are getting into / are already in relationships, further compounding on that feeling. I think another part of the issue is that I'm doing decently well for myself (graduated from a good college, making more than enough money, and have great friends to boot), but the one thing that's escaped me for years is a partner in crime.
3	Yep. 34 and enjoying single life. I’ve had a few long term relationships, but I’m happier single. If the right person comes along, maybe I’ll tie the knot one day, but I’m in no rush. Never having wanted to have kids definitely helps. 
2	I’m a fairly young ISTJ as well. Don’t see the rush in getting married when there are other priorities in life that i need to handle. It’s a matter of seeing priorities i guess. There’s surely no reason to be marrying and settling down when you have barely anything on your plate, let alone enough to support a family...
2	24 yo male, also don't want to get married asap. I'm mostly taking an economic view of dating, so it's logical to put that off for a while. Even dating requires a time/money/energy investment that I can't swing for an extended period. Never-mind the financial tax of a wedding and getting my own place in the modern economy.\n\nIdeally, I'll start dating in fewer than 5 years. By then I should have my degree, a car, and a house of my own. Keep in mind these are merely my requirements and you should go for it when you feel ready.
1	Literally me. 
1	I was okay with being single all throughout my High School career and a little while after I graduated. I didn't have my first girlfriend until was 22 actually.
1	Gay male ISTJ here and: \n\nNo, I want a damn boyfriend already. I feel like I'm missing out of life not having one.\n\nOur society is so anti-relationships and marriage today, especially the LGBT community, and here I'm like: "but relationships sound wonderful. I'm good at committing and don't need a billion sex partners. One is fine."
12	ISTJ and Mental Illness	 I identify strongly with ISTJ and I test that way \- LSI on Socionics as well. I also have severe social anxiety and PTSD. Some of the characteristic ISTJ traits, like observational awareness, are lacking; at least when I'm in public. I stay pretty deep in my own head, usually thinking paranoid thoughts, when other people are present. It's hard to notice details in fight or flight mode.  So I'm left with this moderately dysfunctional ISTJ personality. I force myself to perform and hide all of this at work. I've managed to work my way into a school administrator position. I'm always ironed, tie clip and all. This is hell though. I'm interested to know how other ISTJ's with mental health issues like depression are managing in life. Anyone else having a difficult ISTJ experience \(or know an ISTJ that is\)? How does it impact your ability to be organized, observant, and "on" and how do you work around it? 
5	I’ve struggled with severe mental illness which included two 4+ month long hospital stays and nearly 5 years of weekly outpatient therapy. I held it together and was kind of able to function for a while but eventually ignoring my mental health long enough led to disastrous consequences. The only way I was able to have a healthy and normal life was to get professional help for my mental illness.
3	I went through a bout of depression and social anxiety after a cancer scare. It made me feel totally out of control, like cancer could be in my body and I could have no idea. It terrified me and kind of ruined my optimism for a while. \n\nI tried various things, from counseling to anxiety medication. I hated the idea of being dependent on medication so I really tried to cope on my own. \n\nI started running almost every day to kind of get out of my head and get some endorphins going. For some reason when I would get social anxiety, I would get really thirsty before I would start to panic. To cope I started carrying a bottle of water with me and that little comfort seemed to really make a difference. I did get on a low dose of Vyvanse and it basically eliminated the rest of my anxiety and helped me getting things accomplished and start to feel like myself again. The Vyvanse seems to not alter my personality at all, which was important to me. \n\nTruthfully, it just took time. I needed to work through my irrational thoughts. There was no over night fix for me. I do think life comes in seasons and it gave me hope on the bad days that I wouldn’t always feel sad or anxious. \n\nOn the flip side, I have friends that actually had a chemical imbalance and the only thing that helped were antidepressants. I personally didn’t want to go that route, but I’ve seen it work for others. You may just have to figure out what works for you and that may not have anything to do with being an ISTJ. 
2	Have had mental health issues for years, partly due to me not being where I want to be in my profession and lack of income, despite the amount of hard work I put in, Though things are slowly getting better. Have been prescribed Sertraline for Anxiety/depression/ptsd though yet to take it, Am worried it might make me 'emotionless'. 'coming out' with my mental health to my family and doctor made life a bit easier. :)\n
2	I struggled with depression a few months back. It took a turn to the worse after my best friend bailed on me when I turned to him for help and support. \n\nDay by day, I started to find what’s missing from my life, and that was challenges and control. \nI started to regain control over myself and emotional states, then sought out challenges to keep me focused and composed. There’s always that special feeling of confidence after conquering a challenge, which is how eventually I got through it. \n\nGet a challenge, get in control of the situation, and the anxiety will fade away as you feel more and more confident of your control. \n\nNever underestimate an ISTJ who’s familiar of their surroundings and in control of them. 
1	Anyone else here a high functioning sociopath? 
1	I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression in my early 20s and have managed it well since then.  First, make an appointment with a psychiatrist (not a GP or psychologist) and get a proper diagnosis.  Meds, at least initially, will help but it may take some time to find the right medicine - be patient.  As far as non-pharma treatments, take 2,000mg Omega-3 daily, get plenty of sleep, try to stick to a routine and exercise exercise exercise - even if it’s just walking daily walking. Also, if you live in the north, make sure to take Vitamin D and use a sun lamp in the winter - light therapy is super helpful.  And last, but most important, don’t isolate yourself. Our introversion tendency makes this particularly hard. So make sure to engage in an activity you like that does not feel scary or threatening socially.  I found volunteer work to be really helpful.  It gets me out of my head; in fact some of the work I do is helping other folks who suffer from mental illness.  I also find talking openly about my mood disorder not only helps alleviate the stigma associated with mental illness, but it helps folks understand my behavior better when I’m “off”.  Hope this helps. 
4	How do I get back to productive routine?	Say you went out and had fun until 4:00 AM.\n\nYou slept until 2:00 PM next day.\n\nAt night, you cannot sleep because you slept during the day.\n\nYou need sleep to be productive next day.\n\nWhat is the best way to get out of this situation and regain productivity?\n\nI know it is best to not get in this situation in the first place but you know sometimes it happens.
4	To do lists help me even with a messed up sleep cycle like yours. 
4	I get up at my usual time (or maybe 1-2 hours later) regardless of how late I went to bed the night before, specifically so that I'll sleep some multiple of 2 hours since sleep cycles apparently occur in 2 hour intervals.  I'll be tired the next day but a 15-minute nap after lunch is enough to take the edge off the fatigue as long as I'm active and not sitting around. Then I'll make sure to get to bed on time or early for the next day.\n\nUsing drugs (legal or otherwise) as a crutch to make up for lack of sleep when you don't need it is an awful idea.\n\nBut yeah, it's easier to get to bed before 4. Shit happens though
2	Change to a swing or grave shift worker.  LOL   Loved swing shift.  Work 3-11, be up until 4 or 5 am, sleep until noon, have 2 hours to get ready, and an hour drive to work.  I am a night owl and have been for 55 years.
2	Sleeping medication. I’m not joking, when my sleep schedule gets messed up and I cannot get back on track because I’m not tired at my usual bedtime, I induce sleep. Just one night of normalized sleep gets me back on track usually. Alternately you could keep going to bed at a later time and just force yourself to wake up at your normal early time despite the reduced hours of rest. Eventually you’ll lose enough sleep to be able to fall asleep at your normal time again due to exhaustion. Lack of sleep really screws me up so I settle for a more immediate solution of using medication to get back on track. I just take Benadryl and it knocks me right out and gets my body back into the right rhythm.
4	300mcg melatonin and a unisom works for me. Don't get the mg doses of melatonin or you'll be a zombie the next day. 
-1	> Roll a lil something, smoke a lil something, kick back and then floss.
8	ISTJ's, how do you guys experience emotions/feelings	I'm pretty sure I'm an ENFP or anyway a Feeler/Intuitive, but today I tested as an ISTJ-A - and not in the middle but like everything in the 70-80% range. There could be multiple reasons for this, but I have to confess I think I'm depressed. Normally I will feel this passion literally where my heart is that drives me, but I've been in a lot of stress lately and a lot of heartache, which manifests as a literal stabbing pain where my heart is,  and yesterday I suddenly seemed to snap and turn into this ISTJ version of myself. \nI've felt like this before in my life for long spans of time, so I'm actually at loss who I am right now: an ISTJ who pretended to be an ENFP or an ENFP with a depression. \n\nTherefore I'm wondering if you could tell me how a typical ISTJ's emotional life is manifesting. Do you feel passion or strong love, literally at the place of your heart to the ones close to you or the matters that are important to you? Is your head often full with stuff you want to do? Do you get an emotional reaction when you finish a task, or is it more in your head? hope you can help!\n
27	I do everything I can to not experience them lol.  Even when I'm just happy, unless it's with my husband, it's usually very internal.  Birthdays and Christmas are hard because it seems i'm ungrateful of gifts since I open everything with a blank look on my face, but I do say thank you.  If I'm upset or stressed I usually shut down and avoid everything.  My husband and most family know when they see this to leave me alone until I work it out resurface into the world.  Some people don't take the hint and keep pushing and pushing until I blow up, and that's not pretty.  Then I end up looking like the asshole.
17	I have feelings? 
8	The easiest way to tell between ISTJ and ENFP is by cognitive functions. The two types are literally opposites - ISTJs rely primarily on introverted sensing whereas that's the last function for ENFPs.  Similarly, ENFPs rely primarily on extraverted intuition while that's ISTJs' last function. \n\nIntroverted sensing manifests heavily as "reliance on what works".  Ie, we're creatures of habit and prefer to rely on past results rather than new ideas when it comes to making decisions. Does that describe you at all?\n\nKeep in mind that MBTI types don't exist as boxes, but spectra.  I'm easily an ISTJ but I'm also very expressive and vivacious at times. I've been told I have a strong zest for life and am driven by my passions. Hope this helps!
5	I'm much like u/mallutts when receiving gifts and the blow-up when pushed is similar as well.\n\nI don't tend to show much emotion and kinda have an RBF. Emotions aren't something I'm good at expressing on a regular basis. If you met me, you'd probably think I'm a really cold person. However, I actually do experience emotions (sometimes very strongly), despite keeping them to myself.\n\nExplicitly answering your question, I do feel passion and/or strong love and I do have a list of things I want to do. If I finish a large task like a large paper for school, I'll sigh in relief, but that's about it and it's mostly in my head.
3	The ISTJ and the ENFP are shadows of one another. They are all the same functions, expressed in reverse. It makes sense that under stress you may seem to “manifest” the other personality.\n\nMy best friend is an ENFP and we both draw the suppressed qualities out of the other. You have all of these things as part of your personality. The way they will be expressed can shift based on the situation.
4	One of my biggest problems especially in relationships is that I never show emotions. I’m always “blank” you could say. This means that people are always asking me “what’s wrong?” and “Aren’t you happy?”. It can be pretty frustrating but it’s something I never really notice until someone points it out to me. 
3	I do feel passion and strong love. My head is full of all sorts of stuff I want to do, in a logical and orderly manner. I celebrate my successes, and I certainly have an emotional response to finishing a task. However, all these responses are MY responses, and I'm not really interested in sharing them with others, most of the time. I don't take compliments well because I don't really want them. I guess the same goes for criticism, but I've learned to turn that into a learning moment. My emotions are just for me, and if you see me being emotional I'd appreciate you do the cool thing and just pretend to answer an incredibly important email or whatever means you're not paying attention to me.
2	I feel emotions, at times intensely, but either don't want to share them or don't know how to express them. 
1	Sorry you feel the way you feel OP, as an ISTJ myself I do have feelings and feel strong love, it's just that I don't like showing them and find it's difficult to express them at times. 
1	Maybe just don't rely on 16personalities to type yourself. I tested as INTP-T even when I was already aware of being an ENTP (and I usually have this irresistible tendency to manipulate test results to what I think the outcome should be because I see right through the questions).   \nThe way you describe your normal personality sounds much more like an ENFP than an ISTJ. Keep in mind that stress can do all sorts of shit to one's thought patterns and behaviours. I've never been an overly emotional person but recently I've been under a lot of stress and I often found myself snapping at people unexpectedly and crying at the slightest hints of criticism. I'd say you're an ENFP who just happens to be under a lot of stress and consequently turned into the opposite of themselves.
1	My emotional response is the same as most of the comment replies. When I do show emotions it has some variety to it depending on person. On a regular basis I’ll become mildly enthusiastic. When its a heart to heart or heavy topic wise, for instance, I can break down too easily. \n\nI like to experience emotions, but as a ISTJ by instinct I will not let myself be emotionally vulnerable or suceptible to it. 
2	ISTJ Authors	Does anyone know of any ISTJ authors? I can only really find Heidigger \(from IDRlabs\).
7	Are you a "complainer"?	Recently I was called out for using Snapchat too much to complain about work in general, and more recently, about a disgusting co-worker that sits right across from me and regularly burps and farts openly. I use it at most once a day to send these Snaps, but to me it doesn't seem like I complain THAT much about this coworker. If anything I find these Snaps to be humorous because it falls in line with, what my friends consider, my sassy personality.\n\nThis might just be a ranting post, but I'm also curious if any of you have been called out for complaining too much when you didn't even think you were complaining too much in the first place. Is this just some flaw that ISTJs share and we should be more aware of to tone down and not annoy others?
10	I'm a complainer because I'm not afraid to call out people/situations.    \nI'm negative and a Debbie Downer because I'm realistic.    \n     \nThis is why my ex is my ex. She said I was dragging her down. One of her complaints was that I refused to go on road trips which she loved. I explained that because she refused to work, and I couldn't afford car insurance, that our car was only to be used for me to get to and from work in order to minimize risks. But, I was the asshole. :/
11	I don't remember being called out on it but I definitely complain a lot.  ISTJs are optimizers and not fans of dressing up what we say so telling people how they can be better comes naturally to us. 
5	Yes. 100% problem identifier. 
4	Yes I can’t stand people 
3	I recently broke up with my ISTJ of 4 years.  One of the things I loved about him was how we would complain and make fun of everything.  Then we would one-up each others insults until it got almost evil.  It was nice that we could vent about our day at work for hours.  I felt like we were Edna and Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons when they dated.  \n\nSigh...dating now is so difficult because I feel like I come across as a total asshole lol.  Most people DON’T like to complain all the time, because it comes off as negative.  \n\n(ENTP here).  ENTP and ISTJs can be evil and twisted BFFs.  
3	It’s in our nature to point it out when something’s isn’t working efficiently or following procedures. Luckily for me, there are procedures to follow when making “complaints”.
3	It depends on what people perceive as "complaining".\n\nI have a habit of telling it like it is which can be confronting to others\n(I'm not the most tactful person when it comes to this).\n\nSome might see this as complaining I guess.
4	Yes. Yes, I am.
3	No I don't think so
2	Absolutely. 
2	Yeah definitely. I complain, and i'm quite picky about most things. 
1	No, not really, but some people might consider me "too negative" because I have this tendency of pointing out problems that should be obvious but for some reason tend to go on ignored.
1	Yup.
1	People have called me sassy (never a complainer though), but I keep a lot of my complaints to myself. 
19	You guys watch 13 reasons why?	I’m watching the second season and it’s all lost on me... everyone is so emotional and dramatic due to their “problems” but I can’t relate at all. Most of the characters have dilemmas in their life, but they’re caused by their own doing. Lies, emotions, insecurities.  It’s just weird that I watch it and think “this is fucking stupid.” \n\nI love not being a dramatic person. 
10	I haven’t watched this show because of how badly mental health and suicide were portrayed. Mental health professionals have decried this show as unhealthy and dangerous and as a result I’ve kept far away. 
4	I can't imagine watching that show at all.
3	Haven't seen it because I assumed it was about like you said - and just a dramatic teenager-y show. Which doesn't appeal to me at all (because I'm not a teen and hate dramatics)
3	Never watched it doesn’t seem entertaining 
3	I watched it because my friends watched it.  Thought it was pretty good!  Second season fixes/addresses a lot of the criticisms from the first season like "glamorizing suicide."\n\nSure, all the characters make stupid emotional decisions, but most people around me do that all the time.  Besides, whenever someone does something insanely stupid, I just rationalize it that it has to be done to move the plot along.
2	I don't because the subject matter doesn't interest me. 
1	I haven't watched it yet.
1	In my opinion this show doesn't glamorize suicide, it explains it. I can, however, understand why it may be misconstrued as such.
1	I'm a sucker for stories like this. The main character Hannah Baker is an ISTJ. We see high usages of her inferior Fi and Ne though, which you would expect from a character on the verge of suicide.
1	Isn’t that show like a glamorization of suicide? Gross.
3	Career	This seems like a question for SJs. Do any of you happen to know a non-tedious way to search for jobs that tells you outlook, demand, desired education, education requirements, or income?\n\nI don't know what I want to do career-wise.\n\nI know I want a job that emphasizes abstract thought and creativity (analysis, pattern recognition, and problem-solving would be very enjoyable too) rather than something concrete like zoology or with as heavy emphasis on logic like computer programming that I have a realistic chance of getting, that pays at least decently, that provides at least decent treatment, and that I can have a positive impact on humanity in.\n\nInterest doesn't matter to me. As long as it's scientific, not too concrete, and doesn't have too much emphasis on logic. I dislike dealing with "pure logic" like this: https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F_kvCBJtcRxls%2FTUhw8CiDSBI%2FAAAAAAAAAdk%2FqigoqIG2NQ0%2Fs1600%2FCollege%2BMath%2BProbs.jpg&f=1 I hate using Te. I like using Ti. I hate only using Ti or using Ti but not Ne. I'm an INTP (MBTI) IAS (Holland code).
2	I have no idea how to help. I spent 5+ years in complete existential crisis over not being able to figure out what I wanted to do for a career. I finally figured it out but it came after tons of individual therapy and the resulting personal insight. It was challenging for me to figure out how to take my talents and turn them into a viable way to make money while still adhering to my personal values. I think this is a struggle for a lot of people.
1	Try going on O*NET (google for website) it's essentially a free vocational interest test that has results which point to specific careers, outlook and a 3rage pay. 
1	Manufacturing Engineering ticks a lot of those boxes. Companies are always looking to improve processes or improve quality. With summer around the corner, it might be worth looking to the manufacturing industry for internships.
1	Try the website sokanu. There is a free test that covers much of what you are considering and then lays out careers in a clear way so you can compare easily. Good luck! 
1	My province has [occupational profiles](https://alis.alberta.ca/occinfo/occupations-in-alberta/) that list the type of information you’re looking for but it’s very specific to my region. Perhaps your state or country has something similar?
8	What do you guys feel are your strengths and weaknesses as a person in any aspect?	Myself: I suck at social things, driving, etc. But I am awesome at staying committed to things I need to do. Things that are healthy and everyone should do, but most people don't. I also would like to think that I'm good at being objective and trying to leave out opinions. Im good at not being dramatic or superficial.
12	Biggest weakness is my lack of empathy.  \nI recognize the things I should give a crap about, but have a difficult time caring about them.  \n\nStrengths would be avoiding drama, and blending into whatever crowd of people I'm around at the time, like a personality chameleon.
9	Biggest strength: Being an independent thinker. I was the kid nobody bothered peer pressuring because if I didn’t want to do it, it wasn’t going to happen. As an adult, it has been beneficial in breaking away from the “sheep” mentality, which has helped further my career against my peers. \n\nBiggest weakness: My ability to connect with anyone. I have a hard time even with my own family. I tend to “figure someone out” quickly and then have no interest in furthering the friendship or relationship. 
2	Good points: honest, resilient, humble, honorable, independent.\n\nBad points: lazy, indecisive, distrustful, socially inexperienced, isolationist nature.
1	For me, my greatest strengths are; tenacity, strategic hard working, planning, pragmatism and compartmentalizing. \nMy weaknesses are: being emotionally vulnerable, selflessness, having a very small social battery, and being blunt to the point of unkindness sometimes. 
4	At the risk of ending up on r/iamverysmart, I need to ask this question to see if anyone relates	disclaimer: i have no way of asking this question without coming off as a huge douche bag. I'm not trying to be. This is mostly a rant, but I do genuinely want to know if other people relate to this. tl;dr at the bottom\n\nI'm a very logical person. I like facts and I like knowing all the facts. in the recent past I've been really working on owning up to when I'm wrong (factually) and knowing when the argument at hand is about opinions and while I'm not wrong, it's okay to try to understand the other persons perspective. It's a nice thing to work on and I enjoy it.\n\nBut not everyone does this. I deal with my family members whose arguments about anything (from net neutrality to what types of cars to drive) stems in large part from their political opinions and bias, and I deal with them being unable to be honest about things (such as diet, health, exercise) and I'm sitting there thinking "Theres no way I'm right this often. There's no way my family and friends are wrong so often." I just see people around me do such stupid and hypocritical things and it's hard to be 100% objective and logic based, but i really try my hardest. And I think I do really well. Is it possible that I'm right as often as I think I am? I try to take into account the facts that I know, the experiences I have had, the experiences I have heard from others, and try to leave opinions, temptations, and emotions out of it. And I'm right a lot. Not all the time, but a lot. And things like hubris (something that I like to think I don't have. I dont have the invincibility mentality, I never think "eh, that won't happen to me."), and people being over confident. I just want to make sure I'm right, instead of thinking I'm right because of my own bias.\n\nDoes anyone relate to this?\n\nExamples since this question is probably pretty stupid and random:\n\n-Texting and driving is bad, even if you're not explicitly texting (checking the time, changing songs)\n\n-Eating healthy. I am very health oriented, I have gotten my bloodwork done many times, I have altered my diet accordingly. I try to eat healthy diet in terms of micros and macros. My brother does not. He hasnt gotten his bloodwork done, he eats unhealthy. Some days he says "Oh i dont eat like this all the time/Its just a treat/Everything in moderations." and other days he says "Whats the point of living if youre not going to enjoy it?/You only live once. I'm gonna eat what I want." (translation: example 1 is "i dont eat unhealthy all the time. Example 2: "I eat unhealthy all the time but thats because i enjoy it and yolo")\n\n-Calories and weight. I have 0 issue not eating. I was skinny all my life, but in the past few years have been bulking to build muscle. So I can't relate to the temptation of food like a lot of people these days suffer from. If I don't remind myself to eat, I'll eat maybe 1000calories max. But being conscious I eat 4000 a day. I do it as healthily as possible, and it works. I weigh myself every day. I track my calories, each gram of food. It works. I have undeniably proven to myself that counting calories works. My dad has been trying to lose weight since I started gaining weight. He hasnt been successful. He refuses to weigh himself consistently "in case its gone up, then I get discouraged." He's tracked a calories a few time and it worked, he says, but he stopped because its too much work. He swears carbs are evil despite this. However, only when convenient. If he orders no fries and they give him fries, he'll eat them. Just today he got KFC for lunch, ordered the grilled chicken, got fried instead. He ate it no problem, and had a klondike bar for dessert. "Carbs are evil" he says, but eats cake, cookies, ice cream, chocolate, on the regular. \n\n-Playing online games with friends. One friend always pushes the idea to try hard and actually win and get better. Then when I want to take the time to go into a custom game and work on our callouts, coordination, and grenades, he says "nah". Hypocritical.\n\nIn these situations, I feel I am on the side of logic and facts. It feels like my friends and family are on the side of bias and crazy opinions. Am I wrong here? \n\n-Brother is major conservative, agrees with everything trump says and does, disagrees with anything a "libtard" says. Because liberals were trying to keep net neutrality (NN), he was entirely on the side of Ajit Pai and the FCC. We spent hours a day arguing about it. Me with facts, him with some facts and mostly logical fallacies fueled by political bias. I tried to understand his perspective, why he thought getting rid of NN was a good idea. But his arguments were full of holes. At one point he made this argument, and I quote (from a text he sent me) "But if you look at how [the internet] grew from the 90s to 2015. Verses now. It's a big difference. Ignore the length of time. But the changes. There isn't really a whole lot since 2015." He actually tried to argue that NN was bad because the internet grew much more since it's birth to 25 years after its birth, compared to in the last 3 years. And used the phrase, "Ignore the time." \n\n\ntl;dr\nIdk I guess I'm looking for validation but past that, does anyone else ever have the thought of "How am I right this often? Surely I'm missing something. Surely they're correct and I'm just not seeing it. There's no way I'm right."\n\n
4	Everyone encounters irrational people who are difficult to interact with. But if everyone you meet seems so absurdly irrational, perhaps something else is going on. \n\nWith regard to dealing with irrationality, I'll leave you with this quote.\n\n> “Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness – all of them due to the offenders’ ignorance of what is good or evil. But for my part I have long perceived the nature of good and its nobility, the nature of evil and its meanness, and also the nature of the culprit himself, who is my brother (not in the physical sense, but as a fellow creature similarly endowed with reason and a share of the divine); therefore none of those things can injure me, for nobody can implicate me in what is degrading. Neither can I be angry with my brother or fall foul of him; for he and I were born to work together, like a man’s two hands, feet or eyelids, or the upper and lower rows of his teeth. To obstruct each other is against Nature’s law – and what is irritation or aversion but a form of obstruction.”\n\n― Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
2	One thing to note is that people have different experiences, persepectives and levels of self-discipline.\n\nYour examples aren't exactly controversial, and I'm sure that most of us here will agree with your positions. Nonetheless, I believe that "right" and "wrong" are subjective and entirely dependent on a person's individual motivations.\n\nTake this test and you might find that you have some inconsistencies in some of your positions.\nhttp://www.philosophyexperiments.com/health/Default.aspx
7	How do I deal with an angry ISTJ?	I'm an INTP and I find it difficult to handle an angry ISTJ and his frustrated outbursts. \nI'd like to know what's the right way to deal with him and the wrong way to deal with him, whilst he's angry or stressed?
8	Why is he angry? This definitely depends on context. If he has uncontrollable outbursts of frustration without good cause maybe you should just avoid him.
4	What is his specific relationship to/with you?\n\n(I don't think this is necessarily related to MBTI type, but jumping in on a more general relationship level)
5	Ah, so the festering I have been accused of is an ISTJ thing?
1	ISTJs are usually angry due to triggered tertiarty Fi or a lack of a appeal to their auxiliary Te.\n\nIf it's his Fi, tell him you respect his right to his own values.\n\nIf it's his Te, you're probably wrong for disagreeing with him. ;)
26	Does anyone else get worn down constantly trying to figure themselves out?	It’s been a tough day.  I even cried! 
11	Dang yeah I’ve been in figuring out self mode for the past couple of months now. It can be a tough situation. Take care! 
5	You mean figuring it out isn't just life? It IS just me (us?) And here I thought I was just ahead of the curve
5	Yeah ever since graduation. Completely changed how I view everything. Trying to be more objective, fact based, I've been thinking about what I want, what makes me happy, every day. Been enforcing good habits now so I'll have them built when I'm older. It's exciting, but then I have to think about things like getting a job (which I'm more excited for than before after thinking about switching majors) and it scares me a bit. I have everything planned out except for a job. Kinda
21	Do you find you think too much?	The most enjoyable part of my day is when I’m so enveloped in something that I can’t think about anything else. \n\nBut otherwise I’m bored. If I’m not sucked into a project then my mind wanders and thinks about anything and everything. \n\nThere’s almost always something else I’d rather be doing, or something I know I should be doing. 
3	I've been meaning to get into meditation to try and slow down my stream of consciousness and embody boredom, in a way. I think it would be quite beneficial for me to eventually let go of what I "should do" in order to focus on what is in front of me at the moment.
3	Oh, man, yes!  And it is always negative voices.
3	It's great to know there are others like this.  I keep thinking there's something wrong with me \(that's probably still true\).  I say I don't idle well.\n\nI can get so engrossed in something at work that the whole day flashes by.  And then other times, every minute feels like a day.  Lists help me focus on the next thing; even if it's not interesting, it is on the list.  Thus completing the list is its own, what, meta\-goal?
2	Yes. I am constantly ruminating over something, no matter how meaningless or stupid it might be, from mundane shit like getting chores done to what will human civilization look like a thousand years from now. I also tend to escape to imaginary worlds and stories often.\n\nAnalysis paralysis also definitely applies to me too. It can take me really long to get off my butt and act on something because it takes me so long to decide on a course of action and to work up the courage to get out of my comfort zone.
1	You heard 311's song "Too Much to Think"?
1	Thinking of a response..........
1	Have you ever read about Cziksentmihalyi's psychological research into flow and autotelia?\n\nIt sounds to me that you should actively seek to change those bored moments into moments that are more challenging and growth-oriented. I bet you'll be happier.
1	Definitely. I overthink things like crazy.
8	Who is your least favorite personality pair?	Who is your least favorite personality pair?
9	I can’t stand ENFPs. Especially girl ENFPs. And INFPs but only when they cry or mad for “no reason”, and they don’t tell me what’s wrong. 
3	I'm not sure if this is my LEAST favorite personality type per se... but ENTJs drive me nuts sometimes. I've been on dates with some ENTJs and they just go on and on and on and... I feel like there's no time to breathe when I'm with them. I have an ENTJ friend (who I love dearly) but sometimes she goes from one topic to the next without any (from what I can tell) real connection between them. It's hard to keep up with her train of thought, and it's exhausting to hang out with her sometimes.
2	I would say ENFP can be hit or miss with ISTJs. I’m ironically married to a male ENFP, but I also know a middle aged women ENFP and she might be the only person on the planet that I can’t stand. \n\nThe ones I’ve been around are either awesome to be around or the most annoying person ever, but maybe every personality type can be that way? Maybe it’s a maturity thing? \n\nRegardless, the middle aged woman is an attention seeker and drama creator and I avoid her like the plague. My husband does like to be the life of the party but does so in a fun lighthearted way. He’s an excellent host. So, I think it’s interesting to see the same personality type be so different. 
1	Basically any XXFP drives me nuts. 
4	Who is your favorite personality pair	If you had to pair with a single personality, which one would it be?
15	couldn't make this one thread huh
8	Lifestyle analysis for MBTI survey - 3 minutes to fill, will post results in a week. Participate too!!	
3	Looking forward to the results ! Best of luck
12	Sorry for being so annoying	ENFP here to over apologize again. Anyway, can’t stress how much respect I have for you guys out there. I’m sorry it took so long for me to understand you.
10	Oftentimes, I'm very amused by ENFP's and your type's quirks. Used to mess with a friend of mine who was ENFP. She always thought I was serious because of my type, so my dry sarcasm went over her head. Had some fun with saying totally outlandish things and watching her be totally shocked.
12	Everything's going to be okay, Dark_Nuts.
18	Connecting with people?	(my first post here) I feel like I really don't understand how to be social. Whenever I talk to someone I just get bored after a few minutes even when I really want to talk to them, sometimes I feel like people are judging me when I speak, so it makes me really nervous. Is it normal for an istj?\nIt would be helpful if I can get some tips on how to connect with people easily. 
11	From my experience, ISTJ's seem to not like small talk and superficial conversations. And since that's how a lot of conversations first start, it can be a turn-off immediately. \n\nI don't like small talk either but found it to be helpful as a starting point for conversations. I try to think of events everyone can relate to and if the interaction is consistent (like at work), I try to remember things about everyone and start from there. People really do like talking about themselves. So direct and specific questions about individuals are good ways to build conversation. 
11	Normal for me, people generally having nothing interesting to say or I can’t add to the conversation but I slowly learned to pick up on things to casually lead the conversation 
4	I am sure most people are aware of Dale Carnegie, but it's still worth mentioned that in order to connect with people you need show interest in them. Ask them a question, and focus on a part of their response that vaguely intrigues you. Respond with great enthusiasm—even if it's feigned—as to make that person feel like they are incredibly special. And don't forget to ask for their name. You need to evoke an emotional response, and people will be attracted to you. \n\nPeople aren't creatures of logic, they are creatures of emotion...
6	My Fiancée gets annoyed at me a lot because whenever we are out at social events with her family or friends. She says I tune out and that I am almost always looking up at the ceiling instead of engaging with people around us.\n\n\nAdmittedly, I am socially awkward and share similar feelings you have during social encounters. I do better if someone asks me questions rather than me struggling to come up with some dumb small talk just for the sake of talking.
2	I know exactly what you are referring too. Maybe it is an ISTJ thing? Although, I’ve learned ways to enhance these situations. \n\nI agree that small talk is extremely boring but I can fake it in situations where it is necessary like at work for example. I’ll second what someone already said about remembering little tidbits about people to help direct the conversation. \n\nI suppose it’s most difficult for me around my in-laws. They bore me to tears with unending small talk and I’m forced to sit in these situations for hours sometimes. It’s my own personal version of hell. I finally told my husband an (ENFP) and now we have a code word when I get to my breaking point. So I can say the word and we get to leave, which thrills me!
2	It isn’t easy. I thoroughly hate superficial conversations and thrive when I’m chatting about the newest article I’ve read or a personally passionate topic. Unfortunately, this is not all people. But i have learned to adapt. Mostly, I fake it. As horrid as that is, I feign interest and hope the conversation evolves. Though, I only fake it if I have to otherwise I don’t bother. So work events, conversations with people at work, social events where I am required to socialize and what not. If I a can not connect with a potential friend, I don’t put much effort into it. I believe it’s there or it’s not there. Some people really mesh and jive well, others do not. I refuse to force relationships and make sure EVERYONE likes me, fuck that. Your life has so much more meaning than being a social butterfly. \nI’ve also learned to love myself, and my alone time. I’ve found activities that are of interest and keep me learning. \nI have tons to say about this if you have other questions or want some more specific advice. 
2	I can't do small talk either. It sounds like you have social anxiety. 
2	One time I was alone with a friend who I'd only known for a month or so and had never spent much time with 1 on 1. We both sat silently for a little, then he looked up and asked "What's your biggest fear?" It was awesome; he didn't try to make small talk, but rather delved in to an interesting, insightful conversation.\n\nIf it's a person you actually want to get to know, I recommend something like that. Just cut the bullshit.
1	Are you talking about things that you want to talk about? How to conversations go when you talk about things you love?
1	Professionally?  Get to know them how they are at work, and only pass "judgment" as they perform their duties assigned to them.  (helps to have security cameras monitoring everything except for the john).\n\nIt won't take you long until you realize that "this guy always does the right thing", so you stop watching the new hiree's every step, and treat him just like everybody else, (don't kipe shit, and we're cool).  It takes a very very honest person to take a $0.01 coin to the L/P office, and I just told him to keep it, he found it out in the carpark).  Then they're mind boggled that I knew that, and I can only respond, "Let's just say I have eyes everywhere", and point up.  (I really can access any camera any time I want, or watch 16 at a time if I so feel like it on a 96" screen.)  I can lock doors, unlock them, authorize certain persons, slam doors in their faces, deny entry outright, etc. \n\nBig Brother is watching, and sometimes it's the bored looking cashier that ID's you just because he thinks it might cheer up your day even though I can tell you're "really old", and checking your ID makes your "sourpuss" turn into an almost laugh, because "you'de be surprised at teens these days..." and make up a bullshit story about 17-year-old kids dying their hair gray because they want to buy fucking beer).\n\nThat always makes their day.  :)  Yes, I can see you coming, and I see you're pissed off, so I'll take over the empty till "just by walking by", and ID you, just to make your day go a little better. :D  Ever ID'ed somebody and quizzed them about birth date and license information, just to make a dude feel better?  I did it today.  :)  I made her day. :)
1	I usually bring up music, TV, cooking, or a fun fact, or maybe my work from classes, but yeah it can be hard if they want to talk about emotions lol.
1	I'm in school so if I'm going to talk to strangers my go-to is to ask what their major is. I'm mostly interested in academics so it's something I know I will be able to talk about for at least a little while. This has a hidden advantage which is that you'll hit it off with other people who also like talking about that stuff, which means instant acquaintances with shared interests. \n\nThat should work for anything in theory, so you might try coming up with topics that hold your interest like work or school.
1	Get to know the person. The mindset is to relax and have fun, it's for you to figure out how to achieve this. Ask questions to get to know them, comment on what they answer, tell them about yourself too. Don't make it an interview, see how they engage. After some initial small talk, try to shape the conversation towards something interesting, see what common ground is in there, maybe tell them something related. You surely have things to talk about; if not, maybe you are afraid to open up or your life is boring. Good news are, you can fix both.\n\n\nYou're ISTJ: practice makes perfect. Put the tips we've given you into practice. Go to social events. Either join them or propose others to come with you. Talk to as many people as possible. Soon you'll get the hang of it. In the process you'll meet all kinds of people, some of them will become friends and acquaintances, maybe valuable contacts or even a partner. Best of luck :P
10	istj and intp, can these two type have a good relationship??	idk guys tell me your opinionsi feel like my istj need to organise things ecc kinda helps his intp need to just be totally random , these sort of thing do make a good combo imo
8	I (ISTJ) dated an INTP for 5+ years, lived together for 4 years, now broken up. It was an okay relationship. I did 100% of the household chores and organization, which was pretty exhausting. However, he and I had a lot of hobbies in common and had super amazing intellectual conversations. Ultimately the relationship fell apart as a result of untreated mental illness on his part and general immaturity from both of us. I think this pair can work, but make sure you have SOLID communication. Communication issues were a major problem for us and led to a lot of resentment. We were together for a long time, so it’s not like this pair WON’T work, but it’s definitely going to take work and good interpersonal skills. 
6	Can and probably will.\n\nI am an INTP-A (f) and he is an ISTJ-A, and we've been together for.. some months, I suppose?\n\nPROS:\n\n- Everything is communicated directly and bluntly, and this manner of speech is preferred by both - and, the greatest thing, neither one of us ever gets even slightly miffed about it.\n\n- He is very tidy, trustworthy and his words are as good as gold. Everything is done in an efficient and simplistic manner, of which the first ond I am personally not very good at to be honest and thus can appreciate it.\n\n- His Si compliments my horribly chaotic Ne. I can come up with a dozen different ways of doing things, approaching university coursework tasks, doing one's job, and he immediately picks up on them and filters the actually doable ones that are practical. He also reminds me to do normal life things, such as eating food or taking my keys with me when I go.\n\n- He loves when I go on about theories and new scientific finds and new ideas. He says it's nice to listen to colourful speech when his own head is so empty and mainly filled with everyday stuff like "go to the store and buy bread".\n\n- Both like staying in and keeping to themselves. The silence is not awkward.\n\nCONS:\n\n- It gets a little boring for the INTP. ISTJs are not imaginative, bubbly nor spontaneous, and they might for example need a little forewarning and time to plan and schedule their lives before you do something together or go somewhere.\n\n- ..and vice versa, the excessively chaotic and liberal nature at the heart of INTP's personality might get on the nerves of the ISTJ. Not so much in our relationship, as I intentionally tone myself down every now and then. If the INTP remembers to clean up after themselves, though, all should be fine.
4	I'm ISTJ (f) and my INTP (m) and I have been happily married for 8 years this month after getting married when we were 19 and 20. Anything in particular you want to know about the dynamic? 
5	I’m more of an ISFJ, but my bf is intp. We’ve only been together about half a year so far though.\n\nI notice a lot of differences between us and the way we think. When he says something to me, he can still change his mind or he’s trying to use me to bounce off ideas/discuss. But ill take it too literal and be like “you said this one time so this must be your opinion forever”. I feel like he doesn’t always know exactly what’s going on in his mind or has trouble forming opinions quickly. Which is fine, just different to me!\n\nI think he is quite forgetful. I‘m the one who is like “do you have everything you need for today” kinda thing and always the one to ask what the plan is “whats for dinner/when are we leaving to get to ____” etc.\n\nI do worry sometimes that our personalities are too different but we’ve gotten through everything so far. Communicating and being open is definitely really important. Make sure you know how each other feels :)
3	I think ISTJ and INTP would be a good match. My boyfriend is ISTJ and I am INFP. Our relationship is mostly great. The only thing that every really clashes is his T and my F. I’m too emotional for him at times, and he doesn’t understand it. He wishes I could be more logical and I wish he had more empathy.  We have no problems with the J-P discrepancy. He does most of the organizing and doesn’t berate me for leaving piles of papers around the house. He helps a lot with the cleaning, but I also like to have a clean house, so it’s a team effort there. 
3	I've been married to my ISTJ for ten incredibly happy years. \n\nWe are different, but we appreciate our differences. He is thankful that I've brought him new experiences and ideas that he wouldn't have considered without me. I am thankful for the rock I can always rely on, his patience and loyalty. And that someone else wants to assemble furniture, because I don't want any part of that mess! :-)
3	Yes. A lot of my friends are INTP. 
3	I think it can! There are a lot of differences and you both can overthink and make assumptions but communication goes a long way.\n\nI dated my ISTJ ex for 18 months (ENTP) and she brought a lot of stability structure into my life and I in turn organized some adventures/trips she wouldn't have normally gone on.\n\nMine fell apart like littlesoubrette because of immaturity issues and lack of communication.\n\nINTP's and ENTP's like playing devils advocate and exploring ideas so that can be tiring to ISTJs. It may seem like we are annoying and combative but that is just sorta how we sort out our ideas by thinking aloud.
1	I divorced my INTP
2	How to Explain Personality/Thinking Differences to an ISTJ	Hi all..I'm an INFP sadly about to break up with my ISTJ boyfriend (with great regret but a fair amount of certainty), but my main concern is that I can't figure out how to explain my reasons in a way he'll understand. This doesn't seem to be the case for all (or even most?) ISTJ's, but he is very non-intellectual and generally speaking, not very curious about anything beyond his set of interests, and I am highly intellectual (plus we have completely separate hobbies/interests). After some months of really trying, I just feel that we can't connect with each other. \n\nHowever, I've raised the issue of us not having conversations and of me being very intellectual and him being very practical before, and he didn't seem to understand what I meant at all, and became a little frustrated. I'd like him to leave this relationship having *some* clarity at least of why it ended, because it's much worse when you don't understand. In our last conversation about our relationship, I said that he's very grounded in practical things - i.e. mostly likes to work around the house and work on the house - and I'm very grounded in theoretical/intellectual things like talking about politics and books and ideas - and so we're just on different ends of a spectrum of people. But he didn't seem to understand at all. \n\nIs there any better way I can explain it, that he might be able to process better? :( 
17	/r/iamverysmart\n\njust tell him it isnt working for you because you want something else, don't need to overthink this ya smarty pants you.
6	Maybe you can explain it by telling him he doesn't stimulate you intellectually
3	Agreed, I’d be direct. Don’t over explain unless he asks for a more in-depth reason. Then, like already mentioned, just explain that he didn’t stimulate you intellectually and maybe give one concrete example. \n\nIt sounds like you guys have at least discussed things not working out so it won’t be a total surprise. \n\nAlso. I just wanted to add I think it’s really kind and respectful that you want to leave him with closure that he can understand. 
2	1. What everyone else has said\n\n2. About this\n\n>I'd like him to leave this relationship having some clarity at least of why it ended, because it's much worse when you don't understand.\n\nI recommend keeping in mind that what you'd like is not necessarily relevant to what would be good for him from his actual needs and perspective. If you're really concerned about him in this, focus on what he actually needs, not what *you* would need if you were in his place. You're different people.
1	I think he gets your point of view, but isn’t interested by it. Just be straight and direct when you end it
1	My recommendation is to speak to him in practical terms: \n\nFocus on **what he needs to do** and **why he needs to do it**. Get him to **acknowledge** why you are feeling the way you are, but **don't** try to force him to **understand**.\n\n>e.g. You need to spend more time with me on X. This is because I highly value X, and it makes me sad that you do not share the same passion for X. It is important for me and our relationship that my need for X is being met. I know that you might not be that interested in X, but are you willing to compromise for the sake of our relationship?
13	Do you ISTJ guys like the girl to make the first move?	Hi, guys! ENFJ girl here. \n\nI am sure that my ISTJ guy friend like-likes me. But he has not said anything and we just keep going forward as we are, really close friends, with some flirting, but he hasn’t made the first move yet. Does he want to be girlfriend and boyfriend? Does he really like-like me? I don't freaking know. \n\nShould I tell him my feelings first? I know most guys like to make the first move but I am wondering if ISTJ guys prefer the opposite— which is fine, and there is nothing wrong with that, but a girl needs to know this so she knows what to do. \n
25	As far as I'm concerned, my dominance/submission in relationships depend on the girl's preference. She wants a dominant guy who leads the way? Fine, I'll be that guy. She wants to call the shots? Fine, I'll ride shotgun and she can take the wheel.
19	I think most people appreciate not having to make the first move in a relationship if they do like someone
8	ISTJ types generally like to stay within the lines they recognize. So perhaps the question is; what lines does your friend recognize? His social norms and expectations are your key to solving this riddle. Once you think about what he values, it may not even be a question of who moves first.\n\nFor example, I'd like to make the first move as is traditional for a male. However, I have a self-imposed set of requirements, primarily fiscal, which I must fulfill before I'd consider dating. As such, I'm unlikely to make a move without meeting the criteria I recognize. If she makes a move and my standards aren't fulfilled, I'll probably turn her down on the grounds that I've not prepared enough for a relationship yet.\n\nIf your friend has particular rules of engagement in his mind, best to figure it out. Maybe he'll be open to you asking directly, maybe not. That all depends on his own meta-rules.
8	Idk if this is helpful, but I am an ISTJ lady. Though I like the guy to make the first move but I have ZERO problem making the first move. I’ve done it in most scenarios. 
5	I see in the other comments that you've already made the move.  Good for you.\n\nI'm going to add this as an ISTJ guy:\n\nI'd be fine with the girl making the first move.  It would be a nice change of pace and eliminate the "Aw, that's sweet, but I have a boyfriend" rejection that I, personally, have become too accustomed to hearing.\n\nAlso, there's a better than even chance that she knows I like her long before I know she likes me.\n\nThe general advice around here is "If you like an ISTJ, tell them plainly and directly, and then let them know that you're in no rush for an answer and that you encourage them to think about it and get back to you."  The gender of the ISTJ in question doesn't seem to matter in that scenario.\n\nThere does seem to be a stigma against women making the first move, which is BS.  If you're ready to make the first move and you're reasonably certain that it will be well received \(and can live with the consequences if it isn't\), make it, regardless of gender.
4	Hi! ISTJ girl with ENFP boyfriend here, so we're almost your opposite! Now, please bear in mind that everyone is different, absolutely. In our case, I am so glad that he didn't make the first move- he was ready literal years before I was. If he'd asked me out when he first wanted to, I would have turned him down as gently as I could and then put some distance between us. Luckily, he read me well enough to not do that, and after years as pressure-free best friends I finally realised that he was my definition of the perfect man, and so I sent him the world's most awkward Facebook message. Approx 18 months later and I've not even considered changing my mind. Part of me sort of wishes it had all happened sooner, but I know that I wasn't ready for a relationship before then.\n\nTl;dr: ISTJ+ENFP, we had very very different time frames, but got there eventually, ISTJ was much slower at being ready and got to choose the time frame and do the asking.\n\nSorry if that was tangential!

3	Before I make a move, I much prefer that the girl makes it clear that she would be accepting of such a move. I hate making people feel uncomfortable, so the best thing is if I am fairly certain that she would like that sort of thing. This requires either telling me upfront or dropping hints like mad.
3	I'd say make your intentions as clear as possible so there are no mixed signals but follow your own style to do so, just the way that feels right.
3	Oh my goodness this is perfect, my husband is ISTJ and I am ENFJ!! We’re currently on a long car ride reading about our personalities and we were cracking up reading this because this is exactly how our relationship began. We were friends first and flirted around for YEARS before he finally “officially” asked me out.  \n\nGive him a clear indication that you are interested in him. If you are interested in pursuing a relationship, you need to make him feel confident that you will say yes before he asks you. Allow him to be the one to make it official, but make sure he knows for sure that you are interested.  In my husband’s words, “I wanted to know for sure that you liked me before I asked you out.” It wasn’t until one of my friends told him I liked him that he mustered the courage to make it official.\n\nHope that helps!! Feel free to ask any more questions if you have them for us! We’ve been together for almost 6 years and married for 2.
2	ISTJ male here and can confirm that and also confirm what Cersox wrote.
2	My istj male partner (I am an infj) doesn’t believe that a man should always take the lead. He is shy, and he responds well to me initiating. I initiate in a way that’s more suggestive, if that makes sense. He was the initial pursuer when we first met. Over time, I started making the moves. \n\nHe’s mellow and believes in mutual communication. 
2	An ENFJ and ISTJ couple? Oh no, conflict types. (If you follow socionics.)\n\nBut I’m an ISTJ and it really doesn’t matter as long as I like the guy I’m flirting with. \n\nThen again, there is no “girl” in that situation.

3	Interested in your thoughts and perspectives if you have the time/energy/inclination to share them - ISTJ-INFJ interaction.	Hi all,\n\nI'd love to get your perspectives on a post I just made in r/mbti. Wasn't sure if I should post here or there or both. \n\nFor now, I'm posting a brief note here asking for your thoughts if you are interested in sharing them, and this link to the post itself:\n\n[Curious about whether and how MBTI info processing preferences may have played into this INFJ-ISTJ interaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/8hyz7n/curious_about_whether_and_how_mbti_info/)\n\nI'd be delighted to have any of you join any discussion over there, or discuss it here at r/istj if you have time/energy/inclination to do so. \n\nAnd if it would be easier for me to cut and paste the whole thing here at r/istj as well, I'm happy to edit this post to add it. It's just quite a wall of text (be warned)
3	I'm not an ISTJ but this is very interesting to me because I have a friend who is an ISTJ. \n\nOverall, I think the frustration captures our dominant function conflicts, as people have already commented on the original thread, Si and Ni. \n\nIt's very easy for Si users to miss the forest for the trees, so to speak. While us INFJ's are big-picture people who value the overall context and intricate connections more than the details. When you were like: "consider the whys of the research..." I was like nodding and like: "exactly". Haha totally something I would've said. \n\nI remember helping my ISTJ friend with his homework. He's very neat and generally the details are superb. But he's not necessarily great at systemic-thinking, so he gets stuck. (So to give some context, we were in a computer architecture class where we had to program hardware components if anyone's familiar with that). \n\nOur projects required a great deal of systemic-thinking and problem-solving. I often tried to explain the greater conceptual ideas of what we were doing, but he keeps bringing back the details. I remember this being frustrating because I was not trying to nitpick the details of his code but rather whether he understood the greater conceptual system. \n\nNow that you've given me this example, I feel like I understand his thinking a little better and why we weren't getting through to each other. 
3	Conflicted about confessing feelings to an ISTJ	UPDATE: \n\nSo I met up with him today and asked him out. He rejected me but I feel much better now that I know how he feels. I can finally move on from guessing in this relationship and like you fellow ISTJ's said, he's OK with staying friends. I was relieved about that. I'm glad he gave me very direct responses. That's what I would prefer. \n\nThank you all for supporting me! It definitely helped in terms of mentally preparing me. I think otherwise I would have taken it badly. \n\n_______________________________\n\nSo I've been friends with an ISTJ for a long time. We never really hung out a lot, but we talk a good amount throughout the years. The past 2 years I was in a bad place and did not contact him. He was also working out of the area. \n\nBut recently he came back and I met up with him. I've had feelings for him since I was in college (we went to the same high school and college btw). But was always conflicted about telling him because 1. I'm not good at expressing my feelings. 2. I don't want to lose him as a friend. Friendships are very important to me. \n\nI just want to know if he feels similar. He has asked me a few times if I was in a relationship and seemed curious about it. I didn't think much of it at the time but could be a signal? I'm honestly very bad at catching signs. \n\nWhat should I do? Do you all ISTJs have advice?
18	I’m a female ISTJ and I always really appreciate directness. Maybe you could just say, “Hey, is there any potential between us?” \n\nEven if there isn’t interest on his end, I don’t think you’d lose a friendship over it. \n\nAlso, fun fact: I straight up turned down my now husband more than once. I just wasn’t really looking for a relationship when he initially started pursuing me. He eventually won me over though by just being an awesome person. So, sometimes a “no” doesn’t mean never. 
10	As a wife of an ISTJ, I would say, be direct, but also don't put him on the spot by demanding an instant response. "Think it over and get back to me" is the thing he likes to hear best. And he always DOES get back to me, usually with a nice, long, detailed reply. 
5	What type are you, first of all?
4	[deleted]
3	I flat out turned down a date with my now SO (together for 3 years currently). ENFP friend demanded I go meet this guy. Told her basically I didn't care how cute he was I'm not looking right now. In true ENFP form, she basically kidnapped me. Long story short, meeting him won me over. He's INFP. As mentioned before in this post, ISTJs like to say no sometimes. That being said if it's a mistake to say no, we come around. 
2	as an istj, i hate when people play mind games, bothers me a lot, or when they clearly like me but just kinda 'fly around' me without doing anything,  so now idk if this is for all ISTJs but be direct , and mostly logical ahahi know that most people view us as unemotional, but we aren't, i am sure that if he likes you back he will be very happy that you are asking him, if he doesn't \(at least that's what i do\) he will be honest and direct about it without trying to hurt you, so i don't even think you will lose him good luck!!
2	well if he's asked you he's interested so there's that. i don't think an istj will judge you for the lack of being able to express your feelings well, also it wouldn't cause a loss of friendship imo...
1	Also, just ask him out, the worst he could say is "no."
1	Academic Survey on Personality	Hello I am a student at University and I am collecting data on Big-5, type indicator, and cluster B personality characteristics. The IRB and the Human consent pages are in included in the link. At the end of data collection I will be giving away amazon gift cards. The information is on the last page. I appreciate anyone willing to take the time. The average response time is around 15 minutes. Thank you again.\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/T2DWFXG
10	Revising the Belief That I'm Right / You're Wrong	One of the sources of conflicts I've had in my marriage and in some friendships is that I tend to assume by default that other people are wrong and I'm always right. Many times, I just misinterpreted what the other person meant; they weren't wrong. This happens mostly with people I generally view as smart and capable and I'm very comfortable around, like my husband. I rarely have this problem in a more formal setting like work or in situations in which I'm much less experienced than others.\n\nI don't want to come across as rude, and I think I'm otherwise an agreeable and nice person. Can anyone relate to this problem? Does anyone have advice for how to change my default mindset? How to practice giving others the benefit of the doubt rather than assuming they are wrong? Any phrases or tactics that have worked for you?\n\n[Photo for attention](http://www.dumpaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/funny-pictures-dumpaday-3.jpg)
5	Sounds like me. It helps to approach disagreements with the initial assumption of "maybe I'm missing a piece of information or understanding that makes their argument true" and ask questions from that perspective first before deciding the other person is the one missing info/ understanding
5	100% me
6	From interacting with my ISTJ friend, I noticed that he thinks he’s right and is stubborn about it. He’s grown quite a bit though and is more receptive of other perspectives. \n\nI think what helps is before you make your swift judgment about something, try to ask the other person questions first. Try to understand before you judge.  The other person will appreciate this too. \n\nToo often xSTJs can burn bridges with people or miscommunicate by their stubborn convictions. Know that people aren’t rational and objective like you are. They won’t see your point unless you also try to understand theirs. 
3	> I tend to assume by default that other people are wrong and I'm always right. Many times, I just misinterpreted what the other person meant; they weren't wrong.\n\nCould you:\n\n1. Stop the interaction at least briefly whenever you see yourself assuming that the other person is wrong\n\n2. Shift your conscious attention from who is right or wrong to whether you understand what the other person is saying.\n\n3. Internally formulate some questions for the other person around the theme "I think I hear you saying X - is that accurate? How and how not?" (edited on re-read to add my initially implicit: "...and then ask them those questions" in case it's not clear)\n\n4. Take in the  information they are sharing, ask more questions if needed, and when you get definitive feedback that they feel you understand them, pause for a moment (or more) to re-assess the situation\n\n5. Ask yourself if there is any way in which they are right even if it's not how you would think of it.\n\n6. Resume the conversation from that space.\n\nNote: this is just off the top of my head. I'm not ISTJ, I read/comment here because my SO is. And I really have not seen her doing what you describe in the OP with me or anyone, so the above is not based on my experiences with her, just on me wondering if a set of specific actions you could follow might be useful. I do know ISTJs are great at getting pretty much anything done if you commit to doing it and find some concrete steps/ways to get it done.\n\n\n
10	Mistyped INTJ	I spent like 2 years thinking that I was an INTJ, because a lot of the "socially and romantically inept" and "misunderstood child" stuff applied to me.  I'm wondering if this is a common thing for ISTJs.  If you're an ISTJ, have you experienced this mistype?  And do you think ISTJs share those same weaknesses / misunderstandings?
10	INTJ's and ISTJ's both appear the same externally. The real difference between the two (which I am stealing from someone more intelligent who stole it from elsewhere) is that the INTJ will always do something from scrath mentally and use previous information as a guide while an ISTJ does something right then forever repeats the pattern until given an effective logical reason to change that pattern.\n\nHonestly both of you are incredible to date, I am an ENTP. You are both very stoic and concerned more with your partner than yourself. My only advise for you is to let whoever your SO and close friends are know how you're feeling. 
2	I'm the same way! The two types share their second and third functions which gives us a lot of crossover personality traits. 
1	The only difference measured between INTJ and ISTJ, by definition, is the intuition–sensing spectrum. Of course, everyone uses both intuition and their senses all the time, but different people tend towards one or the other in different situations.
1	MBTI has a huge intuitive bias that makes many sensors mistype as intuitives and go on believing it for years. I used to regularly read INFJ groups on facebook and noticed that like half the people posting there aren't INFJs. Some sounded like ISFJs, ESFJs, ENFPs, ISFP, and even ESFPs and ISTJs. Whenever someone tells you they are MBTI N-type chances are at least 30% that they aren't an intuitive but a mistyped sensing type.   \nThis is also why some prefer to study socionics to MBTI. It doesn't discriminate against sensing types to such a degree and their profiles are more accurate and detailed, allowing people to find their actual type quicker and easier. MBTI is just a huge mess in this respect.
1	Probably. Socially we're not the best. Fe\-PoLR if you follow socionics.
1	Yup

1	Social Anxiety	
15	Friendship is hard	I, an ISTJ, have struggled a lot with friendship for a very consistent reason throughout my 20's. I seem to attract damsels in distress, of both genders, and when I see that their issues are finally calming down I assume that I will then be able to approach some of my personal issues I want feedback on and that reciprocation will then ensue. Except, the reciprocation never happens. \n\nI don't know that this is necessarily an ISTJ issue, but I assume that my personality trait of seeing things in a very black and white sort of way \(a trait I'm actually working to not be so extreme with\) attracts people who are perpetually stuck in the gray. I just don't understand how I can buck this trend. It makes me feel really lonely at times, and it's already difficult to open up without the fear of a friend not reciprocating a listening ear and words of encouragement. \n\nAnyone else deal with this?
7	I'm an INFJ in a relationship with an ISTJ, and commenting because one of the things I saw early on in my gf's world was a tendency for some of the people in her life to treat her like "the rock" to lean on, and in the process not be thoughtful that she is a person who needs care and support also.\n\nIn our relationship (which, granted, is romantic and not just friendship), it's always been reciprocal, from the start.  I can say that I deeply value her for who she is as a person and not just what she does "for" me. \n\nI can say that we both tend to be other-focused as much as, or more than, self-focused. We both get pleasure from the happiness and well-being of whoever we're in connection with. We each came into the relationship with this orientation. \n\n>but I assume that my personality trait of seeing things in a very black and white sort of way (a trait I'm actually working to not be so extreme with) attracts people who are perpetually stuck in the gray. \n\nIn our case, the fundamental reciprocity is not sourced in to how we process information - meaning, it's not about black and white versus grey, it's about another layer of human connection. \n\nOne thought I have as I write the above is: I'd suggest that you look for and internally require reciprocity from the start of any connection, instead of allowing imbalance at ths start in hope that it will change. Assess each connection and person's approach in real time from the start, instead of assuming something will happen in the future that is different from what you experience at the start, as you have been:\n\n>when I see that their issues are finally calming down I assume that I will then be able to approach some of my personal issues I want feedback on and that reciprocation will then ensue. Except, the reciprocation never happens. \n\nIMO, action speaks in connections, and it's utterly okay (I would even say it's baseline healthy for connections) to assess the dynamics based on the actual experience from the start, instead of some hope for things to be different from that in the future.\n\nHopefully that makes some sense and is of some use to you. 
4	Gosh, this is my life 100%
5	Yeah have an ISTJ friend who frustrates me with his kindness sometimes. I often feel bad because I dump things on him all the time and he tries to be there for me. I'm glad that I eventually realized that I was taking a lot from him but not giving in return. So I was resolved to help him as much as I can. He was very gracious about it. I think that's why we are still friends despite not spending a lot of time together. \n\nI think many people don't appreciate ISTJ's because they are the type of people who show care through quiet action. 
3	As an ENTP with an ISTJ ex I agree completely. I realize I'm still hurting 2.5 mo later because I relied on her a lot for support. She was always there to listen and give advice. Looking back I realize I assumed she always had it together because she rarely reached out when she needed it. The few times she did I didn't really support in a mature positive way :/\n\n\nI think if you reach out and initiate conversation you might be surprised who will listen and help. I know it might be hard to put your issues first sometimes but people really do appreciate ISTJ's for being there for them.
3	I love to help others out, though I have encountered problems while doing so. The worst is when friends take advantage of my trustworthiness to pull mean jokes on me. I'm always going to be open with people because if I don't allow others to initiate conversation with me, I'll become socially isolated. The problem is that when people I trust repeatedly deceive me when I try to be kind, then proceed to mock me afterward, I have a hard time trusting anyone. With some people, it has become a sort of a game to see how many times I'll fall for the same realistic lies. I have to calculate the chance that I'm being lied to whenever I interact with certain people, and I think it has given me a degree of social anxiety over time. Has anyone else dealt with this/know how to turn these kinds of situations around?
2	There's the Golden Rule, "treat others as you would want to be treated" and there's the Platinum Rule (a term typically used in the business industry), "treat others as THEY would want to be treated". I have two close friends, one is an ENFJ and one is an INFJ. I try to think of how I can respond to them or give them advice in their style of communication so they can hear me, not my way.
5	How would you describe Si as a function?	INTP here. I feel as if I've gotten a lot of mileage out of learning about Ne and working on it, so I'm wondering if I could do the same with Si. \n\nWhat I'm wondering is for those of you who have Si as their primary function (That's you guys, ISTJs), what are some common tropes or idiosyncracies you recognize that are synonymous with Si-dominance? How would you describe using Si?
11	Si hinges on sensory memory from what I understand.  Here's a few aspects to that that explain a lot about how I operate as Si dominant:\n\n1.  I store information based on the sensory input used to learn it.  For example, I can remember names of countries by thinking of a picture of a map of their continent because the names are stored along with the general shapes of their borders (sight).  I learn physical skills rapidly once I get it "right" because muscle memory is associated with touch.\n\n2. When deciding on paths of action, I rely on what I know to work (based on firsthand experience) rather than what "should" work in theory.  This is apparently a manifestation of Si-dom.  "Nothing is guaranteed to work unless I've already seen it work myself" could be an Si axiom.\n\n3. I'm a huge creature of habit.  As in, I've been eating the same breakfast cereal for two decades straight, my weekly schedule is always the same, I tend to buy clothes in the same style as what I already own, etc.  That comes with the whole "go with what works" mindset.\n\nHope that helps!\n
10	Do you have strong opinions?	I find that for most things I don't really have strong opinions or thoughts. Recently my roommate (ESTJ) and I watched a debate video re: Polygamy vs Monogamy. Personally I could never be in a polygamous relationship for various reasons, but I saw valid points from both sides of the aisle and couldn't decide if one was "more right" than the other.\n\nSimilarly, when people ask me what I think about a movie or a book, I usually just think "it was good" or "it was entertaining" and have not much more to say.\n\nThe only time that I feel strongly / have deeper thoughts about something... is when I feel very invested in the topic, whether that be LGBT issues (which are very personal to me) or certain types of music. It's almost like I don't care enough about other things to put in the effort to form a more opinionated thought. A lot of times I find that when some of my friends are having heated discussions about a topic, I tend to zone out and not pay attention because I'm too bored to even care what's going on.\n\nDoes anyone else feel a similar way?
19	I definitely have strong opinions about anything I've researched well enough to know both sides.  Even if I understand the other side's point of view, it's very likely that I'll think they're simply wrong or misguided.\n\nIt's probably partly because I really enjoy the battleground of ideas, particularly when something that matters is at stake. Abstract, pointless topics don't often interest me unless there's an interesting philosophical puzzle to solve.
5	I have strong opinions about literally everything.
5	Have I researched it? Then no, I don't have a strong opinion as more research is needed. But if it's somethiing I know about, Then yes, because I'll have had enough info to see which side I land on and why. 
7	I do for some things, like how I feel about bodily autonomy for fully competent adults. \n\nFor things that don’t personally affect me and are legal, I’m usually indifferent. 
3	I feel exactly the same as you. I feel I see both sides of the argument too well to come down hard on one side. 
2	Not particularly, if I do its about things i now very well. So politics, guns and history.
4	**"Strong opinions, loosely held"** was a phrase that resonated from the first time I heard it. Very, very few things are absolutes for me (one "absolute" example is abusing children—*it's never, ever ok.*)\n\nIf I know a little about something, I generally have a strong opinion about it. That said, I almost always welcome other viewpoints and discussion with people who disagree—because it means I can learn MORE and be more confident that my opinion is correct because it is more informed.\n\nIf someone who disagrees with me can present a valid argument or elicit my empathy, I can be swayed.\n\nIt all depends how much respect the counter-arguer can earn in the process of discussion. I don't engage about politics any more with my "fake news!" conspiracy-theory-believing family members because they've lost my respect in that regard.
1	In regards to the polygamy vs monogamy, I guess polyamory would be similar to former. Like the OP it's not something I would practice myself but I have friends that do and have even approached me to be part of their relationship. \n\nIn a relationship I feel like each partner brings something to the table that compliments the other. Ideally, they possess qualities that make them a much happier and better person. But everyone also has their limitations and things that they can never be. Like an introvert being the life of the party or just plain outgoing. To me the poly is like a way of getting around these limitations while at the same time accepting them. Don't know if I worded that funny but you get what I mean. As a partner that would make me feel inadequate, and feel as if I'm not doing my job well enough. I'm not there to be the tag team champion. I'm there to be THE champion.\n\nP.S. First time poster here and I'm glad I found this sub Reddit. Greetings to you all.
1	Im literally the exact same 
1	I have strong opinions on everything, but when it comes to things like movies I don’t really care. 
1	I'm the exact same way especially with two good friends I have that love to talk about stuff and have deep conversations and I'm the one who is zoned out most of the time and really don't have an opinion on what they say and if I do its seems like its a basic response that doesn't generate a good response or spark up new topics for the convo.\n
1	I have no strong opinions either, there are pros and cons to everything. No one is really right, no one is really wrong. Its just different.
6	The IPIP-NEO Short Form	
8	I need advice, not sure how to give enough space to this ISTJ and still look interested	First time in another mbti sub, coming from /r/INTJ, because I think some online advice will be better than nothing. Even though I feel like I should figure this out myself, being an INTJ, I've become too social to answer it. Also I'm just assuming this person is an ISTJ, but I still wanna see what you all have to say.\n\nThe background is we're in the same college classes, and I know as of Friday that she hasn't made friends since we started 2 months ago. She's mostly silent when we're hanging out in groups and rarely talks 1 on 1 with anyone, really. \n\nSo last week we spent a few hours together and she really seemed a little bit more comfortable to tell more "personal" (not personal at all for more extroverted people) things, so now I'm feeling more confident to try and get closer.\n\nProblem is: How much time alone do I give her? Do I even message her on social media if we're in the same place for hours? Should I go study with her if I said I go to the other library or does it sound too pushy?\n\nI honestly never thought I'd have problems with other introverts, but here I am...
4	She's a girl not an alien, I think you're overthinking it a bit! Don't be pushy or hound her, just make it clear you want to hang out with her and let her accept or decline. You may have the best luck having a plan. In other words ask if she wants to meet at the library at a specific time to study, or meet elsewhere at a specific time to take a break from studying. It's more comfortable for us to accept or decline a specific invitation rather than a vague, "do you want to study sometime?"
3	I agree with what the others have said and I'll add a thing or two. It's not that you necessarily need to give her space it's just that we like our quite time. If you go to the library with her to study then you are getting to hang out with her and maybe talk some without exhausting her by too much social interaction
2	As with all successful relationships, communication is key. Ask her these questions in intervals, not all at once. When it comes to decisions, tell her your preference and then give options. Lead and show the ways, but let her choose. She has the right to accept or refuse, so no need to tell her that. Just make sure you don't appear bossy, alright?\n\nBest of luck, bro! :)
1	I fell for an ISTJ and stayed up her ass damn near 24/7 but it turned out her primary love language is quality time. So maybe my natural obsessive behavior was to my advantage.\n\n-ENTP
1	I’m an ISTJ that dated an INTJ for a long time. Quality time is my top love language so I always enjoyed knowing he was interested enough to spend time with me. I’m picky about who I give my time, so if she is that way and likes you back, you’ll be able to tell by her responses. \n\nI’m sure I’m not alone when I say we like clever conversations and intrigue. You want her to like you for you so tell her something interesting that you know a lot about. Don’t be afraid to just be yourself. She will either go for it or she won’t. 
14	Adventurous istjs	So I've become good friends with an istj (or someone who I believe to be an istj) and I've been blown away by how adventurous she is. She's willing to try anything, which is so fun for me because I feel like I have to hold back a lot of ideas around most people. \n\nOn one hand she's your stereotypical istj, responsible, studious, stoic, structured, serious etc. And on the other hand she's a completely energetic, playful, eccentric weirdo. I feel like this the dichotomy that exists in istjs that people don't really discuss. But it's one of the things that I like best about istjs. \n\nI do believe that istjs are risk-averse, but they're not closed off to novelty. Anyways, do you guys relate to that? How open are you to trying new or weird things? \n\n
12	Istj here. I am very open to trying new things and going new places, etc. I've traveled a lot and done a bunch of things I never would have planned on doing, most of which turned out well. I think risk taking for me can be summed up in one sentence: I am only afraid of new things/risk taking when there is a reason to fear failure at that thing. If I go somewhere new or eat a new food or play a new game with friends and it doesn't work out or I'm bad at it, who cares? However, if there's an actual negative consequence for me failing at a new thing, then I am anxious to try it. ESPECIALLY if that failure impacts other people. \n\nTo give a reddit-worthy example, back in my MMO days raiding gave me bad anxiety and I'm not even an anxious person. But going in knowing that if I screwed up a mechanic I could wipe the raid or if I was bad that night and everyone could see I was the worst healer, well, I would sit there tense and sweaty worrying about it until it was over. But after learning and experiencing the mechanics (not just reading about them) and doing the raid multiple times, the anxiety would totally go away and I wouldn't worry about it anymore and actually have fun. 
6	I asked my (very accurately typed and confirmed) ISTJ gf why she loves traveling so much - she's really into seeking out new experiences that way and seems to need it to be balanced and feel good inside. \n\nShe said that she notices a lot of fine grained details in the physical world and she has kind of maxed out on most what there is to notice in her everyday world after living in the same city for close to 30 years and the same house/neighborhood for 15+ years.\n\nI wonder if that's a version of the dichotomy you're seeing. I do feel like you are onto something. Maybe it's good/mature use of Ne-inf to serve the needs of Si-dom?\n\nThere is also an adorably Ne-like playful/silly side to her that only becomes visible under certain circumstances, like when she's relaxed, and it has come out more and more as she's experienced my responses to it - I do think it's enjoyable when she starts riffing and getting all cute and bouncy from that space, moreso because her default presentation in the world is so calm and solid and serious seeming - and also as we've gotten closer. It really is adorable.
4	My favourite ever trip was an interrail trip where we just vaguely laid out a plan ahead (down this side of Europe, up this side, one stop in about the middle we wanted to make), then took it from there. Usually hadn't decided where we were going more than at the earliest a day ahead and it lead to some minor snafus and us going places we'd never consider if we planned it out meticulously ahead of time. Slept for a few hours in a train station one night because we fucked up a connection and there were no more trains before early in the morning, stayed the night in a town in Normandie with all our things left in Paris due to not checking when trains back to Paris actually went and so on. It was great.
3	I love planning to be spontaneous. Adventures are the best!
2	As long as the adventure is safe and follows the rules I'm all for it!  Haha.  
1	The ISTJ I have my heart set on is this to a T. Though I think she is only adventurous because she picked up that I have a real need for it.
1	This is quite accurate. I have not read into my type a whole, although my friend with 3+ years of theoretical and practical experience of MBTI says I am definately ISTJ, I find this to describe myself indeed. This friend is an INTJ. He was always telling me I am so boring as I always order the same pizza for example. I started trying new things and since then my pacing of "exploration" has increased constantly.\n\nI went out of my comfort-zone and traveled across the world where my brother was studying. I did this because I told him "if you go to Mexico I will come visit", which sounds dull but I like to keep my word. This is how I broke the barrier of "risk-averse" which made my stomach question my decision until we got to the Hostel. At this point, my mind is significantly crippled to the point of thinking about basic needs pretty much, and here is why:\n\n1. My brother is the one in charge, he made the plans.\n2. I have not studied the map & I don't know where I am going to staying.\n3. I do not speak their language, and they dont speak English.\n4. I am in a foreign country that is allegedly corrupt (This I learned from experience a week later).\n5. My comfort-zone is on the other size of the planet where all of my tools and gadgets are organized.\n\nThis was probably the most spontanious adventure I have ever done and that reminds me I need to say thank you to my younger brother, Daniel. I really liked it and I promissed myself to travel one more new place (like trying out new pizzas) for ever year that goes by. That year was last year (Greece, England, Mexico). So far this year I have gone to Leeds(UK), Madrid, and Malaga. I already booked Milano (Italy) because my brother is moving there next in a few weeks, also going to Spain later this year and most liekly Leeds to visit a friend again.\n\n@Gusto\_game & Any other ISTJ; Saying yes to something no matter how far fetched and ridiculous it is a good test for an ISTJ, because we want to be held responsible. Ask us to do one of two things, followed by an "OK, LETS DO IT!"; and that is how you will trigger "The Adventurer". (Then later you can watch us systematically pack our bags and slice the pizza at the air port into 6 equally sized slices).
3	Shutting off Fi - good idea?	Most of my inconveniences are caused by my unreasonable overly sensitive Fi turning against me. I could keep it in check with my Te, but would it be a good idea to completely shut off my Fi? It would take me a long time, but I could pull it off with time and practice.\n\nThoughts on this? 
2	no not good 
2	No. Never shut down your functions. If you shut down your Fi, you will lose connection with your feelings, and you won't know how to handle and let others express their feelings. You'll be crossing their emotional boundaries guaranteed. You can only be as deeply in touch with other people's feelings as you are to your own.
1	Istjs already have bad empathy and experience problems in relationships due to their inferior Fi\n\nIf you shut off your emotions even more you'll just be even more of a robot. \n\nI suggest learning how to voice out your feelings and opinions in a professional and open-minded manner
1	Eh, ive read that as an jntrovert you are more likely to fall into the trap of ignoring your first extravertd function( aka te) because you prefer to stay in the "introverted energy". Also, basically, because its your 3rd function you probabally arent as proficient at it as you think. So, yeah its a bad idea to know about functions and ignore it.
7	How did you know yourself? I have no idea what I'm doing.	
3	 >What kind of friend should I be? Which type of person am I?\n\nI spent years trying to figure out what kind of person I "should" be and was rarely happy.  The constant policing of my natural inclinations was a perpetual drain on my energy and self esteem.  It was only in my early 20's when I stopped caring about what other people thought of me that I figured out that the only way I "should" act is what's natural to me, given that I maintain enough decency to keep my relationships intact and show others respect.\n\nSo to answer your question, act the way that feels natural to you, even if it's cold and unfeeling compared to your friends.  You can't change the way you think, just act with decency and respect.  I don't keep friends that are fragile and soft because I don't want to have to constantly deal with other peoples' feelings in order to have a relationship.  Sure, I treat "feelers" with respect and decency, but a deeper friendship isn't going to happen unless they can manage their emotions independently.\n\n> I'm 19 years old and haven't discovered my passion.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't give much advice here because my main passion found me at a young age.  However, I can suggest simply trying things until something sticks.  I've discovered new passions in life simply on the basis of "this seems interesting, screw it, let's see if it's any fun".
-3	I stopped reading after you compared yourself to your friends. Be you not your friends good luck
4	Advice for an ENFP who wants to learn efficient organization?	Let me just scare you real quick: https://i.imgur.com/TY7EZrz.png\n\n-\n\nMy real problem comes with being reliable with my side-friends and keeping my clothes off the ground, remembering to shower, keeping my papers organized and meeting educational deadlines. I just turned eighteen if you have any adulting advise. I'm new at being a functional responsibiliter so thanks for any intro tips you guys!\n\n-\n\n(I have an unending amount of almost-due assignments for highschool and am going into college soon(on campus))\n\n-\n\n(feel free to ask for peopling or intuition advise~ )\n\nUPDATE: https://imgur.com/YjuaS1C\n\nThanks for all the useful tips guys!
9	Todo lists are pretty cool
9	Te: Extraverted Thinking\n\nPractice list-making and planning
5	I have to do lists for just about everything, keeps everything in order, as long as I remember to look at them often enough. \n\nKeeping my room tidy is something I suck at though. I allways leave trinkets and books everywhere :/
5	Do you have a smartphone? I am attached to mine because it is my greatest tool for keeping organized. You can make it remember stuff and remind you so that you do not have to remember it yourself. \n\nI use this app called ToDoIst to keep track of all my todolists. It is worth every dollar of the annual premium subscription I pay for it. You should investigate it, try it for free and learn how to use it (small learning curve since it does a lot), and try it! They have a great developer team who can help you.\nYou can do things like create projects for things like "school," "errands," "medical," "work," "bills," etc. and put tasks.\nFind a To Do List app that works for you, and make sure it has the ability to send you reminders. I like ToDoIst for its customizability and multiple application platforms.\n\nFor homework though, I use a homework app called MyHomework. There are other homework apps, but you can also do this in a todolist app if you want (I prefer to keep it separate though). Has a web app and a mobile app.\n\nAnd for prioritizing what to do and when, try looking up the time management quadrants where you decide what is urgent vs not urgent and important vs not important. Helps a lot to get the important and urgent stuff done now. Giving yourself a soft or hard deadline to do things is key to getting things done at all.\n\nLastly, I like to put organization into two different categories - personal and universal. Personal organization would be your desk - Where do you put things that works best for you personally? It only matters that it makes sense to you and your organizational needs. Like, if you have dresser drawers, where you put your things only has to make sense to you. You could organize it by color, type of clothing (I sort my college dresser by undergarments like underwear and socks, shirts, pants, etc.), or what you most frequently wear being wear you want and stuff you wear less frequently being elsewhere. Universal organization is organization that anyone can use. Libraries have a universal organization system - anyone can find anything alphabetically, by genre, by subject, etc. That, and there's usually an online database to search. You ask yourself "If an emergency happened and a stranger needed to find something, would they be able to do so?" I organize my files like this - properly categorized and labeled.\n\nThe more effort you put into organizing stuff upfront, the easier time you will have when you need to find something later. This does however require discipline to stay on top of doing it for it to properly work. 
4	Date any IXXJ personality.\n\nLife hacks by an ENTP
3	Also, your open tabs scare me. Please acquire a chrome extension called "too many tabs" and save your RAM usage.
2	Yes, please list make and plan. I recommend learning more about yourself. This video and playlist of vids may help you:\n\nStarter Types: https://youtu.be/G5i1KxOVXQM\nENFPs: https://youtu.be/eBE2-Nu7yys\nSelf-Actualization: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7_i40Y6N8E&list=PLCPzIFw2QJDfGBUyAaIwBD4rvxlwtJRMv
2	Haha I love your screenshot. My bf is INTP and his browser looks the same... makes me want to cry every time I see it. and on his phone's browser, there are so many tabs it doesnt have a number for them anymore.\n\nI'm not a *great* planner or anything, and a pretty bad procrastinator. But I think you should look into bullet journalling. Personally I haven't been able to commit to it and I prefer keeping things on my phone rather than on paper.\n\nIf you're more like me, I use workflowy (a list app, although I hear dynalist is better) and my calendar. I do like todoist but I dont actually have that much to do in my life haha. I think a calendar (physical or on your phone) with the due dates of assignments will really help.\n\n[Here's](https://imgur.com/a/TmehkK2) some pics of last month's calendar and an old workflowy list for when I was moving house. I put bills and appointments and other things I need to remember on my calendar.\n\nI hope that helps! :)\n\n
1	To do lists. Check them and update them everyday. Stick to them and organize your entire day to a list. It will help you not to forget things and also make your day more manageable because everything is already laid out for you. I recommend Google Keep because I can sync it with all my devices and also share lists with people (I share a grocery list with my SO). Following this has allowed me to worry less about forgetting to do something or even just what to do first. 
1	Hey I usually have that many tabs open. My desktops cause people stress too.\n\nI agree with the others lists can help and writing it down organizes your thoughts. You can also use sticky notes or your hand if you are on the run.
1	Considering the answers, you've come to the right place to ask 😂\nIf you need that many tabs at least put them in separate windows to group them by different concerns, then use a keyboard/mouse pad shortcut to switch between them.
0	When your both getting off drugs and your hypersensitive and your partners indifferent.	One persons lacks feelings and is optimistic, bounces back every time like a king and DX as a ASPD. One persons is slightly BPD, hypersensitive DX as manic depressive. The whole worlds ending, cant see a future and overthinking how ugly of things you both did and resentful for its being so easy for the other person. Im told it’s going to be ok and things will go back to normal but the pattern of inconsistently makes me question everything and , I don’t feel comforted mentally or psychically, we want to be together but live opposite life’s in the same room. Get upset when I leave the room but can’t touch me. I’ve seen a hero and a monster. The only person we shared every ghost to but I regret knowing his devious tendencies. Says he scams the world but wouldn’t me. He cries seeing me go through this but can’t comfort me. Im in a love hate position while drained of all dopamine and overthinking everything. I feel like I’m going insane. Where do you go from here, once you go to the dark side is there ever coming back? Is it the boot camp of addiction the only you thing keeping us together? Is it the drugs that make you evil or did it just make the evil you had already come out? 
2	OP doesn't strike me as an ISTJ. 
7	Do you all have problems understanding others needs for esthetics?	My bf doesn’t get why I don’t like his house. It’s extremely clean and organized but very unappealing visually. I get depressed if I am there too long. He gets offended when I mention maybe changing something and really doesn’t understand why I wouldn’t want huge Marshall stacks in the living and dining room. \n\nIs this an ISTJ thing? Or just a “been a bachelor too long” thing?
7	To me, visual “clutter” and vibrancy are offensive aesthetics in common areas of the home.\nMuted, clean, simple, those are comfortable things.\n\nIt’s not to say that color and flair don’t have their place, but they might be best appreciated when contained, like within a picture frame that is neatly placed.
6	>Is this an ISTJ thing? \n\nI myself don't think it's an ISTJ thing.\n\nMy gf is ISTJ and her house is really nice visually. She has a subtle sense of color and texture and placement that's really visually great. I'm INFJ myself and I'm the one who tends toward very bare stark monotone type space - in my case because my Se-inf can get overwhelmed by too much sensory chaos. She manages to create and use a sort of subtle interesting-ness and flow in color and objects without it being chaotic or overwhelming. It's quite a talent. It got really apparent to me when we were together figuring out how to finish one of the bathrooms. Where my choices tended toward the boring, she would always be looking for those little subtle aspects that would add some visual oomph/beauty to the room.\n\nedit: I think /u/emedrick describes her aesthetic well in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/8b8myl/do_you_all_have_problems_understanding_others/dx4w5ui/) with this phrase:\n\n>a beautiful cozy space\n\n(though unlike that comment, my gf is very open to including me ... we live together now and she wants me to feel at home. It's me who has a limited amount of energy for attending to the details of how to decorate space)\n\n\n
4	Is your bf the ISTJ in this situation?
2	 Can he be my bf instead? Marshall stacks around the house sounds pretty cool to me.\n\nAnyways, I can see why this may upset you, but I can also understand how he has no problem with it.  I'm all about utility, so if having my amps in the dining room is what works for me, then that's what I'll do.  
2	>and really doesn’t understand why I wouldn’t want huge Marshall stacks in the living and dining room.\n\nI mean, I prefer Fender amps, but I wouldn't complain if my SO had Marshall stacks instead...
2	I've been told my place is comfortable, but to me it seems kind of cluttered.  I've got bookcases filled with books and knick knacks, pictures on the wall, etc.  So I wouldn't see it as an ISTJ thing.  As someone said, not wanting to change is more of an ISTJ thing though.
2	ISTJ here, and I may be a little older, but I've learned the value of balance. My GF is an INFP, and loves decking our house out  in decoration that I could care less about; but deep down I know it looks better  that a sparse utilitarian space. Perhaps you need to speak with your BF about balance, yin and yang, things like that. After years of living with mine I am actually more content, my house looks "lived in"  instead of like I just moved in.
1	Wait. Who doesn’t want a Marshall stack in the dining room?
1	I sometimes have trouble understanding them, but as a guy it's best to delegate decor to my lady/someone else who understands the whole "feels like home" concept better than myself.\n\nThe only thing I insist on having final say on is technology, technology deployment, and anything that might affect those 2 things. The rest I delegate.\n\nYour bf needs to realize that partners are there to fill in his blind spots, and that's what you're there for. \n\nThat said, be careful to be respectful and not TOO critical of someone else's living space. As long as the bills are paid and it's sanitary, it's fundamentally fine and you're expressing a personal, subjective preference. 
4	I have a huge crush on an INFP (f)... how do I deal with it?	Hey guys... I have an absolutely huge crush on an INFP gal and it’s absolutely driving me nuts. When I have a crush it becomes a huge focus in my life and I tend to over fantasize about who the girl is and I never have the balls to talk to her. Well I finally texted this girl, but it’s been super hard, I can’t read her and she is not engaging in conversation at all. I ask all the questions. Overall we get along pretty well and she’s opened up to me before. What do I do? I have a good feeling that she likes me but how do I know if shes talking to me just to be nice? 
6	>What do I do? I have a good feeling that she likes me but how do I know if shes talking to me just to be nice?\n\nDo not text her for 3 days. If she texts you first after that, she's interested in you.
6	INFPs are hard to get to know. If you are a newer acquaintance you are going to feel like she is always closed off to you. And this will be news to her, because we think we are being open because we are communicating.  It takes a long time to get through each of our layers.  We don’t do a whole lot of initiating, so be patient. 
3	I’m an INFP, and my my bf is ISTJ. At the beginning, I was sure he wasn’t really that into me because he only texted me every few days. It didn’t increase my attraction to him. If anything, it made me write it off as just another failed attempt at finding a good guy and I kept looking and going out with other guys. I obviously can’t answer for other INFP women, but I at least require some attention to hold my interest. 
8	How many dates does it take for you to feel "something" for your date?	I've been seeing this one guy for two dates now, and he seems like a sweet guy. Good-looking, proper, well-dressed, kind, and a twinge of snarkiness that I appreciate. But I find that talking with him at the beginning of our dates is a little awkward, maybe even forced, but by the end of the date it feels more natural and enjoyable. \n\nAs the years have passed, I've found it increasingly difficult for me to determine whether I like someone. If I like someone from the first date (sparks flying, etc.) it goes sour within a month. With this person, I'm not sure if I even like him, but potentially worth it to keep seeing.\n\nMy ESTJ roommate had the same issue before she met her current BF and couldn't tell if she liked anyone. Do any of you all face similar problems? 
8	Ah can't help you out here - I fell for my partners on first sight. 
7	I don’t have a lot of dating experience, mainly because every date I’ve been on feels forced... almost like a job interview.\n\nPretty much decided that intimacy was stupid, I’ll just be a dog lady, yada yada. Then I ate my words 4 years ago when I met my boyfriend at work. We are both ISTJs for reference, but he is more outgoing than I am. We were both attracted to each other in the beginning, but I’d say it took about 1-2 months of almost daily interaction to feel really emotionally connected to the point where we would pursue it.
7	I think I can usually tell right away whether or not there's potential, then by the end of the first date whether or not there's something there.\n\nI also think I'm wrong about my feelings 90% of the time and am too quick to dismiss potential partners because I'm a perfectionist by nature and don't want to spend more time socializing than I have to.  It's a work in progress
3	[ESFJ] Fiancé and I met July 2015. He fell in love fast and hard and even said "I love you" like...two months in.\n\nI said "I love you" back half-heartedly at 2 a.m. because I just wanted some sleep and the Skype call had been going on for ages. Probably didn't feel it until December 2015, so several months compared to him. Still thought of him as a close friend in August when he already considered us "dating".\n
4	INFJ dude here. Not sure if my opinion matters here, buuuuutt- My wife is ISTJ and I knew she fell pretty hard after a few months. Don't settle for less if your feelings aren't there. Love someone to love someone, not because you think/feel you have to. In the long run you'll enjoy your life and intimacy with your partner. If you ask yourself if you love someone and have to stop and think about it, you probably don't love them as much as you might think. 
3	I knew after first meeting my husband that he was the type of guy I wanted to marry.  Went on one date and now we've been married 10 years. Dated for about 2 years.  Edit to say he's an ISFP.
1	I didn't feel much for maybe around 1.5 months that we talked online and then another 3-4 months that we dated. He turned out to be a great conversationalist and we had many interests in common. It somehow turned into a 5 year relationship. I think interesting conversations and a good friendship is a good basis to have a relationships and that you don't really need intense feelings on first date - they tend to burn out fast anyways.
3	How to be a friend to an INFP	Exactly as the title says. What's your experience with INFPs? How do I become a great friend to them? Dos and don'ts? What should I expect? Any warnings? I need everything you know!\n\nThank you!
5	I am not an infp, but an infj. \n\nI can speak from experience with infps. They like validation and being listened too (as do infjs). You don’t have to agree with what they say, but hear where they’re coming from. Being  quick to say something dismissive or insensitive can be a turn-off. An example would be an infp feeling sad over being dumped. A poor response from an XSTJ is “You shouldn’t have done xyz, or you wouldn’t have been dumped.”  An Infx could lose respect for you and not see you as a good friend to confide in, if you respond in a way that’s not supportive. \n\nAccept their right to their individuality. Controlling them or pushing your values on them won’t work. They may be nice to your face when you offer your advice, but they may eventually may get annoyed if they feel like you’re imposing on them. Staying true to their values and their autonomy is important to them.

3	I don't understand. Depressed only while at home, but perfectly fine outside it - duality?	I'm typing this while I'm at a hospital (accompanying mom for her checkup), where I am surrounded by thousands of strangers, and I am wearing particular set of clothes that **purposefully** fit the occasion and place as opposed to wearing clothes at home for the sole purpose of covering my body.  \n\nAnd, I don't feel depressed, sad, lonely, and weak - *at all*. I feel great, well functioning, and healthy; I feel like myself. I feel motivated and productive!\n\nHowever, when I'm home, I feel depressed, sad, lonely, and weak - **not** myself. I get suicidal thoughts. If I stay in my home for too long this "depression" takes over me. \n\nThe "depression" is mainly caused by the recent end of a friendship with someone I had been very emotionally invested on. I long for her, I grieve, and I sometimes cry. I feel emotionally traumatized, afraid to make friends, afraid of loss. Yet I crave social interaction (but only online, because too long IRL socialization would exhaust me). Nothing makes me happy, but chatting with people online.\n\nHowever, right now while I'm here at the hospital, or just anywhere outside of my house, I don't feel any pain. I don't think I need a therapist. Sure, I still fucking miss her, but I'm more emotionally intelligent and tough that I don't even feel the pain. I'm a sheer fucking healthy human being, I am.\n\nIt's like the moment I step foot outside my house, I magically transform into the real me. I return home and poof, I'm the sad, weak, and dependent suicidal me. It's as if my front door is a fucking portal, where the fake me switches places and summons the real me to this world when I go out.\n\nCan anybody please explain what in the fuck is going on here? Why am I like this? Am I truly depressed? How do I bring "my real self" with me inside my house? How do I fuse this seemingly duality in my identity? Help me understand.
12	You lack purpose when at home. You need a hobby you can practice at home that will give you that purpose.\n\nLook for something that will require you to learn a new  skill or set of skills.\n\nOr get a dog.
4	You sound pretty dependent. When you come to rest, you feel empty because you don’t have much sense of self without drawing it from your environment.\n\nSo whatever you end up doing, that might be somewhere to start. Develop your selfhood. Your ambitions, your preferences, your interests. It requires acknowledging yourself as someone who should be nurtured and putting in the time to allow that person to come out. Don’t be a victim, be a hero.
3	How much light comes through the windows of your home? Building codes used to require that at least 10% of the area of each habitable room's floor square footage to be provided in window glass to bring in natural light. This was to prevent slum lords from causing problems with overcrowded dark unhealthy depressing spaces. ISTJ architect.
3	I've always put on a brave face in public.  Hiding the true nature and depression.
0	You shouldn't take advice using an outdated methdology (MBTI) from complete strangers who think to be experts since they read one or two books on the subject....
17	Ever feel like there's a "void" in you that's waiting to be filled?	And you don't know what you should put there? You'd think maybe a person, someone special, could fill that void. But, then that'd be looking at that person not as a human being/individual, but rather what they can do for you. In other words, you'd treat that person as an object.\n\nAnd no matter what hobby or task you do, you can't find that one thing that fits that void. It remains empty and begs to be filled, but you don't know what to do about it.\n\nI don't even know if this is the right sub for it, so I guess I'm really just here to ask help to brainstorm what the hell this is about. What I can do about it?\n
6	I feel this way a lot.  My 'void' is more of a yearning to find what I'm good at.  Everything I've tried just never seems to work out.  Starting to think I'm just one of those worker bees that just serve a purpose to be a worker bee guess not everyone can be the queen. Oh well.
3	Yes, I think this is a pretty common thing to feel. \n\nAs for what you can do about it, the branches of religion, philosophy, and psychology try to provide solutions to this. \n\n\n[This webpage](http://www.critical-theory.com/meaninglessness-purposelessness-anxiety-the-existential-vacuum-2/) elaborates on potential causes of that "void" feeling, and says that to combat feelings of meaninglessness, one should:\n\n* Create or do something tangible\n\n* Cultivate relationships\n\n* Remember that suffering (or dissatisfaction) is inevitable, but you can change your *mindset* towards it
2	Yes definitely. After graduating uni and getting an entry level job I got really depressed and have felt this huge void in my life. It's made me want to go back to school tbh which I never thought I'd say 
1	Good luck, bro, but I can't help you.  My access to that void was cauterized at a young age.  Sadly, the longing never actually stops...
1	I'm so busy, I can't imagine what this would feel like. I don't remember the last time I had nothing to do or was even significantly bored.\n\n> You'd think maybe a person, someone special, could fill that void. But, then that'd be looking at that person not as a human being/individual, but rather what they can do for you. \n\nIn my experience, the solution here is to focus at least as much on the happiness of the other person as I do on my own.
1	I called it my quarter life crisis after checking off everything on my list that I thought I needed to accomplish.\n\nSome people choose to fill that void with children so that they're so busy that they don't really notice it until the kids leave the nest.\n\nI choose volunteering and pets. 
1	I think this is the same/related to the feeling I'll randomly get a couple of times a year. It feels like a calling/aching that I should be doing something important. Idk what it is or what triggers it.\n\nI've tried analyzing it and when it pops up but it's extremely inconsistent. I've been happy with life and very busy, unhappy and bored, dealing with heavy stuff and being absolutely care free. It's popped up in all of those situations.\n\nI've been happy with my career and the job I have and I feel like I'm where I "belong" but it's still popped up. I've known some others that aren't ISTJ that have had this feeling as well, so I think it might be more of a human thing vs type thing. It typically lasts a week at most for me now, I've been able to suppress it a bit by reminding myself of what I've accomplished and what I'm happy about in life.
1	The ISTJ (female) that I fell for fills that "void" with religion. I think it's just community that she needs, though she can be very clingy so maybe it's that damn Fi.
0	Cannabis to suppress it 
8	What are your proven methods to make yourself happy? Mantras? Mindset? Anything!	I'm developing this rather unhealthy tendency to rely my happiness on other people. I'd appreciate if I could be my own source of happiness. It's not as simple as just finding a new hobby or something like that.
6	This probably isn't the sort of response you're looking for or expecting, but I'm what's known as an "ABDL". Basically what that means is I wear diapers for enjoyment purposes. While it is more fun (for me) to do WITH a willing partner, it can nevertheless be enjoyed as a solo activity (and for me, most of the time it is). \n\nI find the activity to be comforting, relaxing, liberating, and life-affirming. Yeah I know it's a little weird and I'd never deny that but it has never failed to make me happy when I was sad, anxious, stressed out or otherwise feeling unhappy. \n\nIt is important to find an activity that you can enjoy that doesn't rely on someone else. Even video games are getting to be more and more "interactive" and so many games have online play built in to them that they're getting more difficult to enjoy alone, and I think that sucks. I've tried art, music, hiking, and travel but while I do enjoy doing those things they still don't provide for me the same enjoyment that diapers do for me. \n\nI guess I should be happy that I found something simple, cheap, and safe to enjoy. I'm used to the negative stigma about it by now but I don't let it bother me like it used to. I still believe that we are all entitled to happiness however we may find it and in whatever form in which it finds us, so I just go with it.\n\nGood luck in finding your source of solo enjoyment, OP, I know how important it is and how difficult it may be to find. But rest assured it's out there somewhere, and who knows, it may lie in an unexpected place. 
5	Listening to my favorite music and podcasts allways gets me in a good mood. And I find peace in my nihilistic view of the universe. Nothing matters, so there's nothing to worry about :)
4	Well if you're looking for something more complex than finding new hobbies, I can't really help you.  I mostly solved my happiness issues through a combination of finding a few rewarding hobbies and an enjoyable job. ISTJs tend to gain their sense of fulfillment through completing meaningful work so martial arts, regular workouts, and succeeding at work do it for me. I always have something on my plate to work on.
2	I hear ya!  I picked up a book called "Hardwiring Happiness".  While I'm naturally skeptical of, well, everything, it does present some points that make sense.  If my brain got me into this mess, it can get me out!  So it might be worth a read.\n\nI've also started yoga.  I'm not even a huge fan of yoga and it doesn't necessarily make me happy... But it does give me something to look forward to and something to do, which is close enough.  I like that it gets me out and around people, without forcing me to interact. \n\nYou could look into some sort of class, or some way to spend your time without it feeling like a waste.  Volunteering has always appealed to me personally - quick interactions and a job to do.  I went to a pet rescue orientation last night and they have a bunch of computer and at home things you can do, so there might be opportunities around for you to make a difference, have a goal (so to speak), without having to get out and about if you'd rather stay home.

20	Unable to multitask?	Do you find it hard to do many things at once?\n\nAlso do you completely tune out of what people say to you when you are focusing on a task, even when it's watching television?
8	Absolutely. I think multitasking is glorified a bit because it is helpful in a lot of service-oriented professions, like front desk reception. But, I read [an article](https://www.agileconnection.com/article/multitasking-evil) a few years ago (not sure if this is the same one exactly, but same point) that talks about switching costs and how multitasking is actually an inefficient way to complete tasks. The letter/number exercise was really interesting to me.\n\nNow I try to avoid multitasking at all costs. I hate getting thrown out of “the groove”.
5	As an ISTJ, I think multitasking is for the self-deluded.\n\nI don't do the "tuning out" thing, but my father, an ESTJ, always did this. The rest of the world could have ceased to exist, and he'd go on focusing on his task (yes, even television). I, however, prefer (need?) to minimize distractions to stay on task.
3	YES, and I work in an environment (been there for years, hey it's a job)  where I absoltuely have no choice but to multitask.  I swear it's screwing with my head and making me more ineffective at everything.  Living with ENFP mom doesn't help because I can NEVER focus on ANYTHING because she capitalizes my attention unless she's ina  different zip code.\n\nMakes me feel like my life is a waste of perpetual distraction and drama.
2	Yes.  Yes.\n\nI absolutely *loathe* interruptions to my workflow.  It introduces errors and makes me lose my place and it's so much garbage.  I can sorta mimic multitasking if I create a mental roadmap/routine of when to pause on one thing and take up another then jump back to the first task, but "true multitasking" is really hard.  
2	>Do you find it hard to do many things at once?\n\nYes.  Conversely, I am *very* good at focusing on a task until it is completed.\n\n>Also do you completely tune out of what people say to you when you are focusing on a task, even when it's watching television?\n\nYes, and this has irritated the piss out of my mother for my whole life.  What's worse is that I've developed the ability to parrot back responses that make it seem like I'm paying attention and engaged in the conversation without having any conscious idea of what happened.  If I am not actively listening, I'm not listening at all.
1	I ALWAYS have at least 2 things going at a time.  \n\nRight now, I have a video playing on the left side of my screen, a mturk query and data entry screen running on the right, reddit window for in between data entry hits, and a grocery order in the background.  I can't just sit and watch a movie.  Got to be doing something else.
1	I cannot multitask well at all. I don't even work particularly well with music playing unless it has no lyrics or I completely ignore the music to focus on the task.  It also really bothers me when people push the stereotype that women are supposedly great at multitasking compared to men.\n\nEdit to add: I try to do work on my laptop on the couch sometimes if my husband is watching a TV show that I'm not interested in, but I guess I'm not committed enough to my work to tune it out. I always end up watching the TV and not doing the work.
1	I can't multitask *efficiently*, but I can multitask. There's a difference.\n\nYes, I tune out. If I'm focused at something I'd like total silence.
10	As an INFP in a long distance relationship with a ISTJ, just realized this series of texts perfectly exemplifies both our types...	
22	[deleted]
8	I'm an istj. Is this giving people detailed instructions, whether they need them or not, something we all do? 
4	This is so true! Except for the very abbreviated messages, this felt like a conversation I'd have.
4	Honestly don't think I've ever seen anyone whose first language is English type in such a strange way
3	I’m in a long distance relationship with an istj! And this sounds exactly like him! Lol
1	INFJ here. These detailed instructions would drive me nuts XD
8	I always thought I was an ISTJ, but...	For the longest time, I’ve seen myself as an ISTJ. However, some comments from friends lately have made me reconsider. As an ISTJ, the T seems to fit me. I tend to make logical decisions before involving the feelings of myself or others; however, I do definitely consider them. I will confront someone to solve a problem but overall I dislike discord (but doesn’t everyone?). The cognitive stack makes sense as well. I can totally see the Te - when I’m put in a leadership position, I can easily organize everyone to develop a good and efficient outcome. Sometimes, I tend to get a bit carried away trying to organize everything and make it perfect that I will forego others’ feelings without realizing it - however, when I do realize it, I always feel awful about it. I also tend to be very Type A. I can also see the Fi - I tend to keep my feelings inside to most people, although to my closest friends I will let my true emotions show more. Based on all of this, an ISTJ makes the most sense. However, I seem to possess some qualities of an ISFJ as well (or maybe I’m mistyping myself). I’m known as the “mom” friend because I’m always making sure that my friends have eaten, gotten enough sleep, etc; when they haven’t, I’ll give them some food or offer my car and a blanket for a nap during lunch (I’m in high school). My friend said the other day that whenever she mentions my name to anyone, their first reaction is always “Oh, she’s so nice!” I can maybe see parts of the cognitive stack in me, but they’re inconsistent and I think that I relate to the ISTJ stack more. All things considered, I know that I’m young and probably don’t know myself or haven’t become my true self yet; however, I’d really be interested in learning what type others think I am. Thank you in advance for the help!
7	I'd say you're still probably ISTJ. You're at a point in life where you will probably start changing though. 16-25 is when a lot of shit happens and changes and molds you into who you really are.\n\nIt's great that you have a grasp of who you are right now, that puts you several steps ahead of most high schoolers who have no idea who they are. Don't be afraid of the non-ISTJ qualities about yourself. There's a strong possibility that embracing your weaker traits now will allow you to be an extremely healthy ISTJ (or other typing) by the time you're 25. And don't stop loving people, there's not enough of that in the world. 
4	I have gotten similar responses from people familiar with MBTI.  I've come to chalk it up to ISTJ just being a very misunderstood type.  From when I've had close interactions with other ISTJs in a nonprofessional/nonformal situation, I definitely see levels of warmth and caring that you don't really think of in the "stereotypical ISTJ."  Posts that I've made in this sub about emotional struggles or things I feel have historically been well received with a very emphatic "me too!"  Based off that, I'm inclined to think ISTJ descriptions are just kind of lacking and we're not given enough credit for being really caring people. :)  From what you've written here, you sound ISTJ to me.
2	I'm also an ISTJ with what seems to be a well developed Fe function.  I enjoy hosting my friends and barbecuing for them and feel like the dad of the group sometimes. We must both be pretty well rounded
1	I know the feel of being confused on whether you're an ISTJ vs ISFJ. I've taken the 16 personalities test three times and always get ISFJ, but in every other test I've gotten ISTJ. I think at the end of the day I'm more ISTJ but given certain circumstances I can probably be either. Last time I took 16 personalities I was 51% ISFJ, and on another test I took I was 55% ISTJ, so I'm really at the middle.
6	Big 5 Correlations (x-post from r/INFJ)	Edit*\n\n##[Results Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/89k2lv/big_5_correlations_results/)\n\n-------\n\nHey there, ISTJs! I'm a mod over on r/INFJ and we've been doing this experiment to see if we can confirm any Big 5 correlations between MBTI types. So far I've got input from INFJs, INTJs, INTPs, and ENTPs, mostly. I've asked a few other types as well and now I'm coming to you :) I promise to come back with results if I get enough people to participate. Just state your type (it's ok if you're not an ISTJ) and your % scores for each Big 5 category, and feel free to add anything else from your results if you want to share. Thanks in advance!\n\n-------\n\nThere is a lot of talk regarding MBTI vs [the Big 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) - [is MBTI as valid](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/08/02/what-is-the-current-thinking-about-myers-briggs), do they correlate ([1](https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/13460/what-correlation-research-has-been-done-on-mbti-vs-big5), [2](https://personalityjunkie.com/09/openness-myers-briggs-mbti-intuition-big-five-iq-correlations/)), etc. I thought a community post would be a good way to see what kind of distribution we have when we compile results. With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)\n\n##[You can take the Big 5 test here](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test)\n\n(it's free, the $29 "cost" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click "no thanks")\n\n**Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.**\n\nBelow is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.\n\n-----\n\n[*From wikipedia:*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)\n\n> * **Openness** to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  \nAppreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven—sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.\n\n>* **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)  \nA tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.\n\n>* **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  \nEnergy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.\n\n>* **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)  \nA tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.\n\n>* **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)  \nNeuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, "emotional stability". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.\n\n[*From a peer-reviewed paper:*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000335):\n\n>The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive.

12	Anyone else impenetrable in work/school matters?	For example: if my boss scolded at me in front of coworkers and fired me on the spot, I'd be anxious and uncomfortable, but I doubt anyone would notice. \n\nI'd probably just stand there to analyze everything being said, then pack my stuff and leave with a straight face. Like, people screaming at me make me feel uncomfortable but other than I give zero shits about what's said about me because I'm too busy internally debating if the complaint was justified and if the boss has been a decent person the entire time or something like that.\n\nAnyone else?
15	Agreed. I won’t respond quickly or emotionally. Then an hour later I will have the perfect response figured out but the moment has passed. Also if I’m deep into reading something and someone tries to talk to me I try to ignore them and focus on what I’m reading.
8	I get annoyed with people who are unjustifiably emotional. My last ex hated that because she had a bad habit of trying to provoke me whenever I did something she didn't like but it never went anywhere.  Getting emotional is pointless. \n\nI think I'm introspective enough to know when I've screwed up and my boss is very reasonable so the one or two times I've been reamed at work I didn't hide my disappointment in myself. I'll show that I care when I need to. 
8	It's a "no" for me. I'm somewhat sensitive to direct criticism, as I have perfectionist tendencies and hate to disappoint others. I'm not usually super emotional, but I can cry easily when under stress. I try to avoid crying around others in professional settings, though.
1	I've had many difficult work-related conversations before, and I've taken it with a poker face every single time. \n\nAs an ISTJ I'm too busy analysing the situation and formulating responses/courses of action to actually pay attention to my own emotions -- which is actually a good thing because you want to maintain a clear head especially in difficult situations. \n\nIt's usually an hour later that anxiety/panic/depression hits me.\n\nPS. One time when my team was being trained in a mock angry customer confrontation, my colleagues all said I was 'unshakeable' (even though the instructor who was acting as the angry customer was doing a damn good job of getting my blood boiling inside).
13	Here’s What Kind Of Boyfriend You Are Based On Your Myers-Briggs Personality Type	
3	I'm an ISTJ who is not in a relationship but that description fits me pretty well. 
2	~~You are the serious-relationship boyfriend. In a world full of dudes who won’t commit, you are the coveted anti-fuckboy. You invest yourself fully in relationships and don’t shy away from putting serious work into keeping things running smoothly. You throw your absolute all into meeting your partner’s needs, whether it’s a week-old relationship or a fifty-year marriage. You date to find a life partner, not to kill time, and it’s incredibly refreshing for everyone.~~\n\n~~Yeah, that's pretty much true for me.  I never saw the appeal in sleeping around.~~\n\nI am not a clever man
1	My boyfriend is ISTJ and this is him TO A TEE.\n\nI'm INFJ and their description fits me too, which should explain why I'm subscribed to this sub :) 
1	Not sure how this content adds to what's already out there in the world in terms of ISTJ descriptions. (Mentioned bc OP seems to be spamming various subs with multiple links to material on that site).
9	Stay Single Until You Meet Someone Like This, Based On Your Myers-Briggs Personality Type	
14	ISTJ\n\nStay single until you meet someone who takes the relationship as seriously as you do.\n\nSomeone who sees the sweetness in your consistency and traditions- what looks like repetitive tasks to one will look like thoughtful stability to the right person. Wait until you meet someone who takes notice of how dependable you are, and doesn’t take it for granted. Don’t shy away from the ones who have scattered and animated personalities, because they will appreciate having you as an anchor in their lives when they tend to want to fly all over the place- and they just may break you out of your shell a little in the process.
5	I'm in a relationship with an ENFP and we laughed when we looked at this article because it describes us pretty accurately. She's loyal, sweet, and she gets me go out, and I'm her anchor to reality whos always dependable and practical.
8	How do you handle very painful memories?	I'm an idiot. I sometimes dig them up out of impulse and I start feeling the pain all over again. And once I'm emotionally and psychologically hurt, my capability to think is severely impaired.\n\nI get suicidal thoughts, which I 100% know I won't ever actually do due to lack of convenient suicide method. Okay, maybe an 8 out of 10 probability I might just jump to death in the future. Whatever.\n\nThe pain doesn't come only when I dig those memories. I'm terrified of the possibility of experiencing that pain again, that I have become more paranoid and extremely untrustworthy of everyone. I see potential friendships, and the fear of "not this shit again" and impending pain and frustration overshadows the potential happiness and positivity in ways I can't even explain.\n\nHow would you handle something like this?
7	Honestly I know we often feel the best course is to logic our way through things but you're expressing some things that are beyond logic. A professional's help could do you a lot of good
5	Good on you for reaching out. It sounds like you're really struggling, and asking for help can be very uncomfortable. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would consider making an appointment with a professional. Counselling can feel strange, but it really helped me when I was going through shit. I ruminate on stuff too and it's just not something I can always deal with on my own, and my friends are great but were not equipped to help me in the way I needed.\n\nIf the suicidal thoughts start to solidify into a plan, it is my sincere hope that you reach out to a hotline in your area, or to someone that you trust.\n\nHang in there. 
3	how's abouts some therapy?
2	Therapy is great. If you are worried about the cost find a therapist that is covered by your insurance.
2	I do a really weird thing. \n\nAs soon as a painful memory surfaces, my inner monologue immediately blurts out "persons name was a c***", even though they weren't. They were a person I very much loved, but instead of having to feel that loss, I kind of just go "WTF?" at my strange thought, and it forces me to stop thinking about the subject.\n\nI am aware that this is really, really strange. 
2	Do you have access to a therapist? If you are a student, many campuses have free mental health services. Also, check in with your workplace's insurance, they may make the use of certain mental health offices free or discounted. Sorry you are dealing with all of this.
1	For me it's about discovering reasons and finding acceptance. \n\nIf I have a situation that comes back to haunt me, I have gotten into the rhythm of finding a why. What did I learn from it? What can I learn from it? In what way has this situation impacted me now that I am thankful for? This has made a huge difference, and I have actually gotten to the point where painful memories are just a quick neutral thought now because of this. 
2	ISTJ/ENFP too much hard work?!!	Hi all, so glad to come across this community! Would like some advice... Recently found out I’m ENFP, (Gemini female)  I am back in a relationship with an ISTJ (Virgo male) we were a couple 10 years ago and have got back together in our 30s as we have always remained close, despite living in different countries for 5 years, and share a great friendship and respect for each other. (the most important things long term?) We have been there for each other through a lot. We had a brilliant relationship back then but i fear now what was ying and yang is butting heads 😣 we have a very different outlook and little things become big things that go in circles. His lack of apparent enthusiasm for things Im passionate about can seem dismissive and hurtful to me.I feel he views me as kind of childish, due to my lighter approach to life and liberal nature. On the other hand I find sometimes his single minded obsessions and attention to detail over insignificant crap a little boring! Then there’s the differences in how we express ourselves... I’m aware we are polar opposite personality types - which is a relief to know as I can understand his anal perfectionism and him my flouncy fickleness. we work so well together when it comes to advice and support, we share a similar humour and offer stability to the other in lots of ways. He feels safe to me, and I relieve the intensity of life for him. I love and care about him a lot. I don’t think I’d ever find someone who could love me more or want to care for me as much....thing is, chemistry is a little off. Or a lot off. There is basically f all. We are both attractive people, i appreciate that. I just don’t feel that spark. We have both made HuGE sacrifices to give this a go ( moved country and given up a very good career) so this is a massive disappointment to us both. Has anyone else found this? Is it something that can be worked on, and how?? or are we just TOO poles apart and understanding one another if too much hard work :( I want honest opinions, although there is a lot at stake I also don’t wanna waste time flogging a dead horse and hurting us both in the process.Or having this constant battle over silly stuff. Is it doomed to always lack that extra oomph and I should pack it in as mates? is it the ENFP in me striving for too much? or will my natural penchant for passion destroy the relationship in the long run. Very confused here and in need of advice!! sorry for the rant and all the qs-thanks guys :) We are 6 months on by the way...
9	The personality types only mean so much. ENFP male here happily married to ISTJ female. We like that we make it work where it doesn’t on paper.
7	I find it notable and amusing that both the OP and the author of [this response](https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/84ay7d/istjenfp_too_much_hard_work/dvpe7ry/) suggesting that it is actually relevant to ask broad compatibility questions using MBTI type reference not only MBTI type but also astrological sign.
5	My husband is ENFP and I'm ISTJ. We're so different in so many ways. It has definitely been challenging a lot of the time but we've learned so much from each other and we are both constantly evolving as well. I actually wrote a [blog post](http://hotandsourblog.com/2018/03/06/opposites-attract/) about this very thing recently.

2	Yeah yeah, personality type only means so much, but ISTJ-ENFP? Good f*cking luck. These types are only meant to interact on an extremely superficial level. EVERY interaction between these types turns into a misunerstanding, misinterpretation, or a fight. The ability for them to see eye to eye is painstakingly fleeting. Stop wasting your life with someone who will never understand you and who you’ll always have to be pushing against. \nI’m an ENFP (Gemini) as well. I grew up with an ISTJ father (whom I love and I respect more than anyone). \nMy take. You can choose to make relationships easy or hard on yourself. Why put yourself and him through the pain?
1	Thanks step_right_up, Idefinitely agree there. It would be foolish to base it all on personality type, as we are all unique :) and we do complement each other so well in ways. I suppose I was just flabbergasted to learn how opposite we are on paper, and it explained a lot about our differences. Made it easier to comprehend actually, but no more tolerable I’m afraid in this case.
1	Yes.  
1	thanks music2myear and bangbuddyxoxo. it’s good to hear you and your wife have a good, solid relationship.I suppose what i was wondering was whether our intimacy issues, the lack of chemistry i mentioned, was something others found in polar opposite personality types; or if it was just us! Am seeing things clearer now, maybe being friends was better for us than lovers. I’m passionate and yearn for someone to share that with. I reckon it’s each persons own responsibility to ensure their needs are being met or we are just lying to ourselves and will remain unhappy. I reckon it is just ‘me and him’ but the MBTI she’s light on our differences. thanks again :) 
1	You know, I’m not here for an off topic argument or to satisfy anyone else’s need for one, nit picking at my style of communication. My post was not about that, nor was it mentioned in your original ‘constructive’ response. You’re after a back and forth, I’m not. Unless it is relevant to my original query, and gracious.\nMaybe it did ‘i don’t know’ (passive aggression much?!) seem passive aggressive. I could have been a lot more direct, but that’s just rude and this is public.\nI meant I have no time for meanys trolling about searching for ways to be pretentious, irrelevant and condescending. 
1	Hmmm some fair points there actually....I took a few days and suppose I did get defensive and a bit dramatic, having looked back on it.  \n\nMy reason for returning to this relationship was because, aside from the friendship and respect, he is and was a steady dependable bloke who still knows how to have a laugh. He feels like part of me...we just miss the oomph :/ \n\nMy relationships since then have been rocky and emotional to say the least, and I felt I’d lost myself in that madness.  My upbringing was fraught with conflict and drama, maybe that’s what I was drawn to in those guys. And confused it as the missing spark with us... Jeez, what a revelation lol. \n\nOk, so TK444.... what is a girl to do?!! I don’t want to be addicted to drama for my kicks, as mentioned I have a young daughter (whom he loves dearly). She deserves better than that. I’d hate to think of my life without him as I do love and care for him dearly. But how do I cultivate some kind of spark, if it’s not via the messed up way I know it? I feel kind of flat lined as it is...\n\nBeing totally open here, thank God for anonymity right haha. thanks! 
1	I’d just like to add that I am passionate in every area of my life, not just in emotional exchanges. Your reply has helped me see that’s an element of my life I could obviously work on though... 
1	Thanks for the comments....Yeah I’m an advocate of therapy, has helped me a lot with mentioned upbringing. Never touched on the need for drama in relationships though it would definitely make sense...we search for the familiar, no matter how f*d up, unfortunately :/\n\nHaha the problem, however, is the Mr. ISTJ/INTJ in his draconian view of relationships and traditions is completely against the idea. Point blank refuses to entertain it could help with communicating or seeing the others way of being. Or with his own messed up childhood...\n\nThe ENFP in me is taking all responsibility here, reading into every avenue...going on Reddit for advice lol. Maybe we just simply aren’t romantically compatible anymore. It’s a bummer...but what it’s lacking is very important to me... back to the drawing board so. \n\nthanks everyone for the honesty and opinions!

0	INTJ Female Having Problems with an ISTJ Male	I'm an INTJ female who's been having a friendly relationship with an ISTJ male. The other night he was at my house, and he asked me for a favor. I, jokingly although I do have a dry sense of humor, said, "No, I'm too tired." He got irritable, and said, "I've done a pretty big favor for you." I told him I was just kidding, and he said, "I don't joke like that. I feel like leaving." At that point, I was embarrassed and defensive, and I told him to go. As soon as the words were out of my mouth, I regretted it. It's worth noting that he's a religious figure and shouldn't even be at my house alone. I know he stresses about that a lot, so I don't know if he was just super stressed or what, but he started yelling at me that he was done, and it took guts for him to come to my house. (He has been to my house three times. This was not the first time.) He stormed out and hasn't spoken to me since. \n\nI've messaged him and explained my point of view, apologized, and offered to make it right. He read the message, but didn't reply. He does still have me on his social media. Have I completely ruined everything, or does he just need time to cool off? 
3	If he's like me, give him time and space and he'll come around, probably.  Especially if he's actually devout and prays about his behavior.\n\nThat said, though, I wouldn't have gotten your joke, either, and may have gotten irritated myself, but as soon as you pointed out the sarcasm he should have laughed it off.  Something's bothering him.  I'm wondering why he went over to your house in the first place but I don't know him so I can't try to guess what he's thinking.
1	So you were able to make a joke that can go either way, and he got defensive. And as the person that inadvertently offended someone, you got defensive in return? Doesn't sound like a good recipe. Usually when there's a dispute, at a minimum one person needs to have a cool head (to calm the situation down).
-1	damn what you even like about him
4	Music taste.	I am wondering if music taste is related to your personality type. That is why i am asking what music you like.
6	Indie and alternative
4	Mostly house growing up. Now a little EDM and quite a bit of pop.
3	My favorite genres are Metal (80s Thrash, Death) and Classical (Beethoven, Mozart, and the bunch).
2	Classic/hard rock and metal, for me.
2	I mostly listen to metal (Death subgenres mostly) but I am really musically open-minded, I can listen to anything from classic rock, punk to rap or EDM really.
2	Mostly classical and instrumental lately, but I also like alt rock and pop punk (MCR, Three Days Grace, Fall Out Boy, etc)
2	Chillwave/(light) EDM/instrumental/ambient: Active Child, Blazo, OOoOO, Richard A Ingram, Toro y Moi, Washed Out\n\nFolk/singer-songwriter: The Civil Wars, Ed Sheeran (mostly older stuff), Imaginary Future, Iron and Wine, Joshua Hyslop, Joshua Radin, Kina Grannis, The Oh Hellos, The Paper Kites, Peter Katz, Wake Owl, William Fitzsimmons, Wise Children, Zee Avi\n\nAlternative/pop-punk/emo/rock: All Time Low, Bastille, The Birthday Massacre, Evanescence, Fall Out Boy, The Killers, Linkin Park, My Chemical Romance, Panic! at the Disco, Paramore, A Silent Film, This Providence, Two Door Cinema Club\n\nClassic rock/folk: The Beatles, Billy Joel, Fleetwood Mac, George Harrison, Simon & Garfunkel, The Who\n\nClassical solo works (usually baroque, rarely modern): Evgeny Kissin, Gil Shaham, Glenn Gould, Hilary Hahn, Jan Lisiecki, Mstislav Rostropovich\n\nThose five are probably the core music genres I stick with, but I've also got a soft spot for modern pop. Some of my favorites are Adele, Marina and the Diamonds, Mika, Pentatonix, Sam Smith, Sara Bareilles, Taylor Swift, and Tove Lo.
1	I listen to almost all genres of music except country. Some artists I enjoy are\n\n- fun. (Anything nate ruess really)\n- MIKA (the boy who knew too much)\n- Nicki Minaj\n- Green Day\n- Scott Joplin\n- Queen\n\nThere are a lot more where that came from but those are just what come to mind at the moment. Hope I helped!\n
1	I pretty much listen to any type of rock or metal. I also enjoy classical. I listen to some old country as well (like Johnny Cash, Marty Robbins, etc.)
1	Classic, instrumental chill, future bass, bit of drum and bass. Getting into deep house atm!

9	How to Tell an ISTJ You Love Them	Heeeeey, you ISTJs! INFP lurker here and like very other type I come for advice from you lovely folk. I was about to just make a novel about my adorable robot and I, but then I realized I just wanted your unbiased thoughts when it comes to this sort of thing.\n\nIf it is of any consolation, I am an female INFP (31), and he is a male ISTJ (31).\n\nWe've also hit the 2-month mark, and after much thought and deliberation, I really love the person that he is, even with his quirks, habits, and the (few) things we don't have in common.\n\nI am open to any and all opinions and would love to know what or how you guys and gals react or8 expect out of this type of situation?\n\nEdit: Thank you guys in advanced also, for giving me your thoughts!
27	First of all, thank you for the Reader's Digest version of your question.\n\nThe usual advice here is to "be direct."  That might actually be bad advice in this case.\n\n2 months isn't a very long time.  Dropping the L-bomb at this point *might* be too early.\n\nThere is a factor that we random Internet strangers can't gauge:\n\nDoes he love you back?\n\nIf he doesn't, you will probably run him off.\n\nIf he *does*, then you have a possible avenue.\n\n*If* you decide to tell him how you feel, you want to say something like this:\n\n"I want to tell you something that is very good, but it's also important, so please hear me out and let me finish before you respond.  I love you (or I'm in love with you, or however you want to phrase that part).  I know that's a big thing to say this early, and I don't expect you to say it back right now, but I wanted you to know how I feel."\n\nAnd then don't be surprised if he gives you an "OK," or something equally non-committal right then.\n\nWe are often slow to process things like that, not because of how you feel, but because we're slow to process how *we* feel.  And we **do** feel, but as I said, we don't process it quickly, and we don't externalize it easily.\n\nIf/when he says it back, listen closely.  You'll be able to hear the capital "L" when he does.
1	Have him take the 5 love languages test so you know the ways he likes being shown love. This is great to know in any relationship.
13	ISTJs and boring stereotype	[ESFJ, F,23] I think you guys aren’t boring at all!\nBut I get the feeling that I am the one boring y’all?\n\nAnd that feeling is eating at my self esteem especially when I’m a generally interesting person who can hold a pretty decent conversation. But when it comes to conversing with ISTJs, I feel like the conversation is sometimes dull, and would wonder if I’m not interesting enough to evoke your attention!\n\nTLDR: What do you guys think? Do y’all project that other people are boring when it might be you guys feel that you’re boring? \nSO finds the repetitive conversations we have boring, and says we have very different interests and on different wavelengths\n\nFor the record I don’t find y’all boring, youguys are interesting in your own way.
30	One aspect for me personally is that I just don't really like talking to people unless their is a need for it. I'm sure I come across as rude sometimes, but really I'm just comfortable with sitting with someone in silence, unless there is a reason for us to communicate. If you are just talking to talk, I usually will find it somewhat annoying after a bit, but I'm working on my social skills. 
9	>But I get the feeling that I am the one boring y’all?\n\n>I’m a generally interesting person who can hold a pretty decent conversation. But when it comes to conversing with ISTJs, I feel like the conversation is sometimes dull, and would wonder if I’m not interesting enough to evoke your attention!\n\nYou're speaking pretty broadly here, so I will answer you broadly.\n\nISTJs hate small talk.  Small talk is what people do when they don't have anything interesting or important to say, but they can't just sit there in silence.  ISTJs are perfectly happy to sit there in silence if there's nothing interesting or important to talk about.\n\nIf you want to keep from boring an ISTJ while actually having a conversation, find out what the ISTJ is interested in, and more specifically, what they are passionate about.  If you are familiar, and especially well educated, on that topic, engage in a back and forth conversation.  If you are not familiar with or well educated on that topic, learn enough to ask a few intelligent questions.  Ask an intelligent question on the topic and be prepared for a torrent.
6	I dated an ESFJ once, and I found everything she said to be irrelevant. She expressed feelings by talking, and I expressed them through actions. Didn't last long. 
5	I tend to not be able to keep a conversation going if I don't really care about what is being talked about. I would assume that your topics of conversation have plenty of interest, just probably not to everybody. It would help if we knew what you liked talking about. However, ISTJs (in my experience) tend to make their disinterest more clear than many other types. \n\nTo me, I'm quite indifferent to many things. One time my friend asked me if I like snow (I live in Montana, so was asking me about the climate and such). I responded with the fact that I don't really care about it enough to like or dislike it. She (an ESFJ I believe) was incredibly frustrated with that answer. \n\nI've since teased her and been have been saying I'm indifferent to a lot more things than I really am, but it is hilarious to watch her little world crumble for a brief moment because she thinks that everyone should have strong feelings about everything.
3	It's hard to say anything when we don't know anything about you and have never conversed at all.
3	This is what I tell people who say "I just feel like they aren't interested!" about the ISTJs around them. Most likely, even if we don't like the topic/person, we ARE listening! ISTJs may not always seem captivated, but we show our love differently than other types. For example, while some other types may show love with extravagant gifts/gestures or acting over the top with words, an ISTJ may give you coconut hand lotion because they remembered you telling them how dry their hands get at work and how coconut is their favorite scent because it reminds them of their significant other.

1	Is this about all ISTJs or the one in particular in your life you've posted about before?\n\nedit: looking over the comments. Oh, it's about issues in your relationship again. \n\nedit 2: I do wonder if or when you're going to be willing to take in that your problems in this relationship are very likely [not related to his MBTI type](https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/7y67hj/istj_and_receiving_help/duf1qa8/?context=3).  
1	Istjs are the most boring types along with isfj . They just take in information in large quantities and spit them out. Absolutely boring types.  
1	29/F ISTJ. I have been told by a few guys that I'm boring, but they meant it in a poking fun way, but being me, I did not take those jokes kindly. I'm very factual and concrete, so I'm just not interested in "wild" "off-the-wall" "hypothetical" stories or opinions. I don't find those boring, but they turn me off and I don't enjoy thinking about those topics because they seem to lack supporting information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think we're very basic and simple and that comes off as being boring to many people. We think a lot and want to make sure we have thought things out before things fly out of our mouths like fools. I agree with some other comments about finding something that the ISTJ is interested in and asking about that specifically. I enjoy teaching others about things I like and am passionate about and I find delight in sharing facts and bits of trivia.
12	This is why u should hire more introverts, we’d never go on national TV and blabber.	
9	actually we'd still probably "blabber" if something went against our morals
10	How do dating and relationships work for an ISTJ?	Fellow ISTJ here, I need some help with the idea of relationships and to put it simply: I just don't know how they work. I feel like for the average person this question is a no-brainer but I was never taught how I am supposed to feel when to take things from dating to a relationship.\n\nMy question is basically how do you know when to make someone your boyfriend or girlfriend. Is it simply based on mutual interests and liking spending time with one another and that's it? Am I supposed to have the "butterfly" feeling in my stomach every time I see them? How am I supposed to feel? It makes me really anxious not knowing this and that anxiety has contributed to me ruining a lot of potential relationships.\n\nAs a side note, I am diagnosed with OCD, so this may be contributed to that, maybe I am just over-thinking?\n\nI am considering speaking to a professional about this because this has been going on for years and I need help.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your answers. They have given me a lot of the clarity I have needed.
32	I am not ISTJ but I (ENFP) have dated one for many, many years and I studied the Myers-Briggs types extensively. This is my understanding of ISTJ's view of relationships in general:\n\n1.) They are looking for long-term partners. They are primarily interested in long-term, sustainable relationships. Ideally one that ends in marriage.\n\n2.) ISTJ do not prefer to keep a wide circle of acquaintances. They want a small group of intimate friends. But beyond that, they prefer to have a stable partner to confide with, cuddle with, and share household tasks. It is supremely practical/efficient to have a partner because a partner can help fulfill a lot of basic human needs.\n\n3.) ISTJ usually likes to start off with friends and when the other person fulfills the "quality check", then he/she is willing to take the relationship to the next level. This usually means sexual intercourse and/or escalating to boyfriend/girlfriend status depending on what the ISTJ is looking for at the moment. \n\n4.) ISTJ sees the relationship as a team. Each member brings something to the table and together create something of value. \n\n5.) I think the positive emotions an ISTJ feels towards a partner is primarily happiness, comfort, and security. The other person has to make him or her happy, feel at ease, and secure. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nISTJs feel free to correct me or add further comments. Also, I welcome all personal messages as well. Have a nice day.\n\n
3	It's possible that it is caused by your OCD, but I have experienced similar confusion due to my lack of knowledge. Usually, that comes from a lack of experience, but my personality keeps me from getting close to only a few people, so I don't really have a way to remedy that inexperience. I've been told I should join a club/class with a higher population of girls (I'm an engineering major), but I don't have the time for that type of thing.\n\nAnyway, the most comprehensive answer is probably along the lines of some sort of combination between your OCD and your personality. \n\nThese are more along the lines of what I expect (as an ISTJ) in a partner. I desire compatibility, intelligence, and uniqueness in a partner. I do need to be sexually attracted to them, but sometimes that develops after I get to know them better. You definitely need to be physically attracted to the person at some level. This is the person you could be having intercourse at some point, and it wouldn't do you good to be uncomfortable with her.\n\nFrom what I hear, the first few weeks/months, that butterfly thing may happen. This is usually the most superficial part of the relationship since each partner is on their best behavior. After they get used to it, they start to show their real self. This is when the relationship can really deepen and become more real.\n\nSpending time is important, but don't become attached at the hip. You need to remain yourself.\n\nI don't know what parts of this may be helpful, so I smattered a variety of ideas to go off of. Ask me to clarify if you need me to.

2	So like, you’ve never experienced a crush or attraction to someone? Are all people just sort of the same to you or do you not feel romantically or sexually attracted to anyone? For me I started getting crushes on boys when I was a small child and could easily distinguish from a young age a friend from someone I was attracted to. Is there no distinction for you?
2	For me, it’s not really a butterfly feeling because most things give me anxiety. If you have OCD this might also be the case for you. I think the best way to put it is, when I have a “crush” or whatever on someone, I enjoy being with than more than I enjoy not being with them. Hanging out is never an inconvenience, even when I’m tired or sick, etc. 
2	I am not a ISTJ but would definintely hope you get the answers you(I also) need!
2	ISTJ-A / ISTJ-T	What the A and T stands for and what is the difference ?\nI can't find the answer anywhere...
6	Assertive and Turbulent\nhttps://www.16personalities.com/articles/identity-assertive-vs-turbulent
3	16 personalities is a crapshoot. Don't worry about the A and the T. Study cognitive functions. 
12	I don't understand why I want a girlfriend.	It's not about the sex or physical contact. It could be LDR and I'd be fine with it. I don't want a bro, I want a girlfriend. I don't know why.\n\nYou could be the best bro in the whole universe and it wouldn't be enough. You'd have to be the opposite gender. And also take a liking to me, in much the same way I'd like you.\n\nI don't get it at all. Help me out here, brainiacs.
21	Direct partnership by choice is fundamentally validating for your worth as a person. It is a confirmation that we have “won”, that our efforts and our virtues so far and going into the future all matter.\n\nThis win condition exists for everyone who does put in the effort and keeps the faith. Instead of focusing on the lack in a negative aspect, think about things you can do today to be more like your ideal - the person who would be chosen as a partner.\n\nPractice better habits. Build skills, build relationships with your communities, build your finances.\n\nIt’s not a matter of “just being confident”. We know that’s bullshit. You need value. And when you have it, you will be chosen, and you will be validated.\n\nSo quit whining and go accrue value.
7	Weren't you just in here whining about how you were pathetically stalking a girl you were friends with and she kicked you to the curb because you got too serious?\n\nPretty sure you also complained about how you were a pathetic piece of shit who had nothing to offer the world and threatened to kill yourself, and then shat all over the advice people tried to give you.\n\nSo, here's the answer to the question you're asking:\n\nYou're an attention whore.  Go away.
5	Ahh so I'm not the only one that doesn't just want sex and physical contact

4	Importance of Tradition	I always hear about the importance of tradition, but I never actually here the reason behind it. It's like every movie I've seen says "Tradition is important. We're not going to explain why." or "So people remember our ancestor's stories."...That's a LOT of people to remember...I'm not sure I can remember 100,000,000+ stories...nor have the time to tell them...
7	Like securitysix said, It depends on the reasoning behind it. A lot of traditions are called outdated, and rightly so, because the context in which those traditions were developed were different than today. However, it does take careful thought and consideration of each tradition. We don't want to change something that should remain. \n\nWhen I talk about this, I usually think of a metaphor my father taught me. Old traditions are like fences in the middle of a vast field. When you come across it, it may seem pointless. It may be pointless. However, before you tear down the fence, check to see if it is keeping the cows in.\n\nYeah, there are old traditions that seem stupid. In today's context, we may not need them, but I would be careful about casting away any tradition simply because it is old, because it may be incredibly important.\n\nTraditions are like games we play. They are often universal among the group we belong to (family, community, etc.). They work well because we all know the rules to "play" by. They provide structure and order to our homes, communities, and nations. However, like many things, they can be perverted to serve some darker purpose.\n\nI think we can all (as ISTJ's) can agree that pure chaos is dangerous. Traditions (like rules) serve to bring order out of that chaos. They are (depending on the tradition) incredibly important constructs.
6	Depends on the tradition and the reason for it.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my family had a pretty solid Christmas tradition.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, we would open our presents, then we would go to my paternal grandmother's house, have a Christmas dinner, open presents there, and then go home.  Much excitement was had about the coming of Santa Claus, and eventually we would go to bed.\n\nOn Christmas morning, we would get up, discover what Santa brought us, play with it a little bit, but never enough, and then go to my maternal grandmother's house for another Christmas dinner and more presents.  This was a much bigger gathering, because in addition to my parents, my sisters, and my grandmother, there was also my aunt and uncle (mom's sister and brother-in-law) and their 3 kids.  I would help pass out presents and annoy my Grandmama by guessing what every present was with a ridiculously high accuracy rate.  Eventually I was forbidden from passing out presents, then forbidden from even touching them, and eventually forbidden to be in the room with the Christmas tree until time to open presents.  I don't know why, but I found this wildly entertaining.\n\nAnyway, I have very fond memories of that tradition, but it ended abruptly when Grandmama died of pancreatic cancer.  Since then, we haven't developed a new Christmas tradition, and I'm OK with that.
2	Yeah, the tradition thing has been kind of thrown around. I am ESTJ by the way still xstj. I am suppose to be keeper of it. So, what does it mean anyway? I’ve kind of come to terms with it. Before it was like, what traditions. I don’t keep them blatantly, don’t have too much, ETC...\n\nSo, I think all it means is a good healthy respect for the past. I think as xsxj we respect history, our elders, people who have come before. We respect more, I think respect is a big thing for Xsxjs but we also respect the known knowledge of what has come before us right? So, it’s not upholder of just family tradition, or a tradition we physically do, like hold a party every august 4, why, because it’s a tradition. No, not exactly that, but just respecting older ways, keeping. Being that. stable in one’s ways. ETC... For example I think older society is better than today’s society and morals. I take the time to study history and look through it. This why is sjs love history. Not really like just because, oh, why? Because it’s history!!!! No! We like it because we can learn from it,, have learnt from it, respect it, ETC... You get the idea..
2	When people hear ISTJs are traditional, they assume we hold "traditional" (religious or conservative) values. However, the tradition can be anything. We make our own.
6	ENTP going to be working with an ISTJ boss. Tips?	Hi there, ISTJs!\n\nI posted a version of this on the ENTP sub. \n\nI'm going to be starting a job with a new team in my department soon, and based on our last MBTI testing at work, I believe she's an ISTJ. \n\nI don't know her super well, but I like her and she seems really competent. She's the one who approached me about joining her team, so that bodes well. My only worry is that, as an ENTP, a lot of our working styles and personal quirks may be very, very different - and not very complimentary. I like to brainstorm and go on tangents. I'm a big picture thinker. That doesn't mean I can't also execute on details, but it's not natural to me. ST types have a tendency to find ENTPs impractical, since we're usually more interested in possibilities than the here and now. I'm also quite gregarious and open, and she's definitely a lot more reserved. I can be argumentative and a bit nonconformist, which may be different for an SJ, but I don't know! I'm basing some of this on my ESTJ husband. \n\nSo, I guess my question is: if you're in a leadership position, what behaviors do you love to see from your subordinates, and what do you hate? Or, if you're not in a leadership position, what behaviors annoy you from your colleagues? What would be a big no-no for you? My current boss is an ENFP so he gives me pretty free reign to take on zany ideas, push back and disagree during meetings, etc. How open to new ideas are you, ISTJs, or how best can someone present a new idea or critiques to you without rubbing you the wrong way? \n\n
21	Do your job, on time, listen to instructions. Avoid excuses.  Be efficient. Ask if you do not know but have bothered to figure it out before asking. 
5	You've already been given some good advice, but I'm going to address a couple of things in your post and also a couple of things I haven't seen specifically mentioned.\n\n> I like to brainstorm\n\nThat's good.  When you're trying to come up with solutions to problems, your creativity in brainstorming will be helpful.\n\n>and go on tangents.\n\nThat's less good.  Try to resist the urge to do that.\n\n>if you're in a leadership position, what behaviors do you love to see from your subordinates, and what do you hate? \n\nIf I teach you how to do something, I expect you to do it that way.  You may think you know a better way.  Your way might even be better, but it is not the way I taught you.  Prove to me that you can do the job well the way I taught you to do it.  Then, if you want to show me your better way, ask if you can show me your better way.  If your way is objectively better, we'll implement it.  If it's subjectively better (you think it's better, I think it's the same as my way) but definitely not worse, I will probably let you do it your way.\n\nAlso, don't make me ride your ass.  You should know what your job is.  If in doubt, ask.  If I have to ask why you're sitting there doing nothing, you should be able to prove to me that you have completed all of your assigned duties.  Ideally, if you've finished your assigned duties, you should find something productive to do.  If you can't find something to do, ask.  If I can't find something productive for you to do, I'll give you permission to sit there and do nothing.\n\nIf I have showed you how to do something correctly multiple times and you keep making mistakes because you're not doing it correctly, I will ask you why you're not doing it correctly.  "Oh, I forgot" is **NOT** an acceptable answer to this, especially if we talked about this exact thing in the last 5 minutes.  And yes, this has actually happened to me.  The reason I haven't fired this person:  He's the boss's son, and I'm literally not allowed to fire him.\n\n>Or, if you're not in a leadership position, what behaviors annoy you from your colleagues? What would be a big no-no for you? \n\nI'll tackle both of these at once.\n\n1) Don't make extra work for me because you're incompetent or lazy.  I'll tolerate ignorance, because ignorance can be fixed with education.  \n\n2) If something is a regular part of your job duties, don't make me show you how to do it more than twice.  Three times, tops.\n\n3) If my ability to do my job is dependent on something that you have been assigned, do your job quickly and correctly so I can do my job.  If I have to choose between quickly and correctly, do it correctly so I don't have to go back and fix your mistakes before I can get started on my job.\n\n4) This could go up in the managerial section, but I've encountered this at non-managerial levels: If I catch a mistake that you have made and point it out to you, I am not attacking you personally.  I'm letting you know so that you can A) fix it and 2) avoid making that mistake again.  Do *not* get butthurt and go pout in the bathroom for 15 minutes just because I asked you to fix a typo or correct a date.  Own your mistake, fix it, and try to avoid making that mistake again.\n\n>How open to new ideas are you, ISTJs, or how best can someone present a new idea or critiques to you without rubbing you the wrong way? \n\nThis is getting long, so I'm going to try to wrap this up.  I think I covered the "how best" part above.\n\nAs far as "how open," the answer for me is "If it's objectively a good idea, I'll give it a chance."
3	To add to anbeav, or maybe summarize, "be competently independent" is a short way to put things. I'm likely to give someone a goal, or list of goals, along with relevant information and advice on how to start then leave them to it. I'm happy to provide help when needed as long as you've taken a good stab at it yourself - one long, productive interruption is preferable to several short interruptions. 
2	All you have to do is get you work done and on time. Well and whatever it is it needs to be correct. One of my co workers takes forever to do her work and it drives me nuts.
2	Just one word of warning on working for an ISTJ (I'm a weird ISTx),  ISTJ's don't always make clear their appreciation for you doing your job.  It's your responsibility, you do it, and you move on to the next thing.  Don't take that as a lack of respect or lack of appreciation, because it's neither.  If we aren't talking to you about your job performance it's because you're performing well or even great. And if we are talking to you about your job performance, it's probably not personal.  We just want the job to be done well.
1	Be on time, get your work done, do it right the first time. Competence is everything. If you have questions, be direct. If you want to put forth a new idea, be prepared with a list of reasons the idea will work or be beneficial. ISTJs can initially say no to things out of habit, but we listen to evidence.
1	Hey I remember you! As an entp who worked with an istj, I should add: be very precise and detailed when you talk. Always make the context very clear.
26	People who ramble annoy me badly	I am overall a nice, pleasant person. However, there are certain people that no matter how nice they are, they manage to push my buttons. Sometimes it's a co-worker, sometimes it's an acquaintance. For instance, there is a guy at work who is very nice, but he always talks about mundane kind of stuff - talking about his allergies, his home repairs, etc. It's nothing offensive, but it's so irritating - the small talk.\n\nThere's something about people ramble on about things that drive me up a wall. My problem is that I'm very open with my emotions, and it's always super obvious what I'm feeling. I know that that's not the appropriate response in most cases - e.g., you can't be rude to a co-worker just because you find them annoying.\n\nHow do you deal people who annoy you but you can't just jet and leave? How do you not show them that you're annoyed and appear to be 'normal'?
11	I don’t enjoy small talk like this.. or people who just like to talk to hear themselves talk. It might be a rude tactic, but I just nod my head and pretend I’m listening. Eventually they will burn out. 
6	Lol, ugh, one of my co-workers can't tell me anything without waterboarding me with some long ass wandering lead-in that tells me nothing. The guy is awesome but holy crap just get to the point, lol.
4	There is someone in my family who I talk to a lot, and I swear all she ever talks about is herself, no matter what the subject is. I prefer to talk facts, and to get deep into the subject, so that both parties get something from the conversation. But when I talk about the subject, she is waiting for me to finish, and then talks about something she did once, that barely fits the subject. I recently talked about some politics with her, and said that "something" is a big problem today, and why that is. She agreed, and began talking about something that happened to her in 1980.\n\nI'm in my early 20's, and she is almost 70, so I guess she thinks I value her experience. I do respect experience, but talking about past experiences that barely relates, is not much to respect.\n\nI recently read "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carneige, where he said that someone who talkes about themself alot will never be a good conversationalist, and that really rings true in my case.
2	Don’t fake anything. There is a reason for you to exit the conversation, so express yourself exactly as such.\n\n“Hey man, I’m (general positive or commiserating emotion) about that. I just don’t want to (or use “I don’t have the time”) talk more about it now. Good luck with it!”\n\nEdit: However, if you do have the time and this person has value in your life, consider that it may be your approach that is flawed, not theirs. That small talk serves an important purpose for forming social connections, for seeking guidance, and just for decompressing it. Make a deliberate value judgment about whether your choice to not be neighborly is truly warranted. Be kind, don’t be cruel.
1	Wear earphones. You don't even have to play music. That usually discourages people to talk.
13	Which subtype of ISTJ are you? Sensory or Logical?	ISTJ subtypes:\n\n**ISTJ-Te** - The logical subtype is impatient and active, loves frequent changes and new impressions. Industrious, hardworking, and very caring. His behavior is unpredictable and characterized by unexpected transitions from aloof contemplation to expedient activity. Keeps certain reserve and distance from other people, and at times can be overly direct, harsh, and inconsiderate in conversation. Very independent and proud, does as he wishes. - [**Full description**](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/4964-ISTp-SLI-Subtypes)\n\n**ISTJ-Si** - The sensory subtype is composed and cordial, not demonstrative, obstinate and uncompromising in defending his views and interests. Supports his positions rationally by logic and facts, and not by thought-up or assumed accounts. Diligent, laborious, patient, persistent in his work and studies. If some project captures his interest, he will tirelessly try to improve his results, both intellectual and material. At times he needs a change of occupation, but will attempt to bring previous work to completion. - [**Full description**](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/4964-ISTp-SLI-Subtypes)
8	Sensory for sure - just the other day a friend asked me "Why do you always have to rely on facts and can't make things up once in a while?" (Just talking about a movie that ended on a cliffhanger and I was shooting down all of their proposed theories.)\n\nAnd taken from an ex, after telling her I'm not a very opinionated person. "You are a VERY opinionated person. If your stance is to not pick a side until you're ready to choose, then you don't budge. Your decision to hold back is an opinion in itself." Honestly, that changed the way I thought about myself for the better and gave me confidence in my personality.
5	I'm more ISTJ-Si.
4	ISTJ-Si for sure
5	ISTJ-Si
3	ISTJ-Si sounds like me
3	ISTJ-Si sounds like me
3	ISTJ-Si sounds like me
3	Not ISTJ, but my SO would be ISTJ-Si, just like everyone who has posted here so far. \n\nBut mainly I'm posting because it seems to me that an "ISTJ-Te" would probably actually just be an "ESTJ." 
3	my sister is definitely ISTJ-Si
3	Not everything fits, but I'm probably ISTJ-Te.
2	Si
2	I can relate to both descriptions, but I admit Te seems more like my subtype.
2	ISTJ-Te for me. I am curious to know everyones ages who responded to this. It seems that stronger Fi could play a factor in the ISTJ-Te result. \n\nI am 29 and my Fi is clearly developed. 
1	Si for me too, but damn I thought at least one person would be Te lol 
1	Definitely more ISTJ-Si
1	The test I took said I was logical.  Even the above description (which is mostly negative) kind of fits.
1	I have literally spent about an hour reading both of them back and forth and while neither description is perfect, I felt myself saying "it knows me" more often during the ISTJ-Te, so I suppose that is my subtype.
1	The link does say ISTJ-Te is not very common. It almost sounds like me on a good day, but I'd say I'm ISTJ-Si.
1	Si. I rely on reproducible evidence, and lend no credence to any claim which does not have evidence. 
27	Hating to give good news about yourself?	Wondering if this is an ISTJ thing or just a me thing.\n\nI hate giving good news about myself, especially if I expect the person to have an overwhelmingly positive or emotional reaction.\n\nIt's like I feel under pressure to live up to the expectations others will have of how happy I should be. \n\nAnyone else like this? 
10	Yep. Everyone's always much more excited for me than I am. I just want to move along and get on with my day, but everyone else (it feels like) has to make a big deal of it.
9	Hate is a bit strong, but, yes, I definitely understand the pressure.
6	I blush whenever I’m the center of attention, good news, bad news, or otherwise. Don’t look at me!
5	Yep. I think it’s because we’re logical thinkers and don’t use emotion much so struggle to appropriately replicate others emotions. \nI hate getting gifts because I hate people watching me react. 
3	I usually share major highlights with my close family because I feel like I'm supposed to (and I enjoy praise).  I definitely don't share "work in progress" news, though.  The good thing has to be completely finished so I don't wind up accidentally broadcasting a failure in the future.
3	Yet another post about your romantic intentions	ISFJ here who thinks she's dating an ISTJ (even though he types as ISTP). He wanted to be exclusive/boyfriend after 3 dates. (Naturally) I ran away but a day later accepted his fwb proposition. Now I'm seeing him weekly and evaluating him as boyfriend material without telling him as much. \n\n\nQuestions for ISTJ males:\n\nDid I already lose him by saying no to the boyfriend proposition?\n\nShould I tell him exactly where I am in terms of feelings or is it better to let him assume I'm just not that into him even if my feelings are warmer than that?\n\nHow do I get you to be more adventurous sexually?\n\nAnd anything else you care to add ☺.
9	1. No, but he probably questions your intentions for the "relationship", so it's not exactly good either.  If a girl opted for FWB over a relationship I'd assume she wasn't planning on sticking around very long and approach the "relationship" accordingly.  I guess it depends on how you said "no" to exclusivity.  I've had someone say "not yet, let's give it a few more dates" because she felt she didn't know me quite well enough yet which didn't bother me.  If you "ran away" and dropped contact that'd send a whole different message.\n\n2. If he's like me, you should find a tactful way to make your intentions clear.  See point #1 about the optics of choosing FWB over a relationship.\n\n3. It sounds like he settled for a sexual relationship since he couldn't get what he wanted (a real relationship) and wasn't willing to go it alone and wait for someone else.  Complete guess here, he's probably not super adventurous right now because he's not exactly happy with your situation (especially since it was born out of rejection) and it's affecting his self-esteem which hinders him from really opening up.\n\n4. Since you're asking for "anything else I care to add", the "sex first, exclusivity later" mindset of dating is incredibly unhealthy IMO and makes a lot of people unhappy on the inside.  I wish people would at least wait a month or two before sleeping with a new partner.  Perhaps that's just the "tradition" mindset ISTJs are prone to have.  \n\nI'm also not sure what's so awful about going exclusive after three dates.  If you don't like him enough to go exclusive after 3-4 dates then you're probably not a good match.  It's not like you're engaged or anything.
9	I feel like I’m the only ‘social’ ISTJ in this subreddit.	Hey y’all I’m an ISTJ female and I’ve been on this subreddit for a while and realized that while I definitely relate to many of the internal factors of what makes an ISTJ person, I find myself in many social situations and I’m pretty much surrounded by friends in places like school and during the weekend. I’d have to admit that I still feel really nervous when making plans, (like everything has to be perfect) and relieved when people cancel plans, but I can’t seem to figure out why I’m able to make friends. I feel really self centered saying that but I don’t know how else to put it. When I talk to strangers I kind of have an instructions book in my head, and if I have the time, I plan what I should say in a certain situation without thinking. But even then, I still feel like I bore people talking to them since I completely blank trying to come up with ways to keep the conversation alive. Am I just lucky? Does anyone have an explanation? 
7	For me, it's a learned behavior. I tend to surround myself with more outgoing people - my wife is an ESTJ. I find them stimulating and like someone else mentioned, I enjoy their company without needing to actively participate. However, by having more extroverts in my life, I've actually learned to be more social, even enjoy it, as long as I can balance it with downtime.\n\nWe actually have a friend who always invites my wife and I to her parties. Since we recently moved to the area, we're new to the group. So, it was super stressful at first, but I've actually started making friends and every get together is more and more fun. It's "Hi!!" and hugs and all that. Convos have gotten easier and my wife is very good at taking over if I start to flail. :)\n\nI definitely consider myself lucky, but I've also put in a lot of work to learn, to push myself and to adapt. It's also been immensely helpful in my career.\n\n
4	Don't have an explanation for you, per say, but I do relate to your point that I also kind of have a set of instructions in my head when talking to other people... Or at least a set of question to ask them so I don't have to talk about myself as much - because Lord knows I hate doing that.\n\nWith regard to finding myself in social situations, I feel the exact same way. I like spending time with people I'm "close" with (quotes because I'm living in a new place right now, and the people I'm close with aren't necessarily that close to me, but close enough), but it has to be in smaller groups - it's kind of a must, otherwise I'll tire or get bored really easily. Even in smaller groups I find myself drifting off, needing some "alone time" even though I'm clearly around other people. I also find that when I'm with other people, I don't tend to say much. I enjoy their company more than I need to be actively participating in conversation the whole time.
3	Are you certain of your IS placements? \n\nI don't know the intricacies of how more subtle traits come out, I only ask because your statements make me wonder if you are extroverted or intuitive, at least more than I am. Or maybe you have those friendships because your friends have a need for someone as completely logical as an istj.\n\nPersonally, I have difficulty socially for two reasons. One, I'm painfully socially anxious. I can fake it for an evening at an employee dinner or in the lobby at church but then I need to be done. Facebook is a lifesaver for me because in can interact socially with the time to think through my response and communicate what i mean. \n\nThe other difficulty is, outside of analyzing a situation (like this one) - a problem to be solved - so Manny conversations seem... boring? Unimportant? Unnecessary? I dunno. So i find myself sitting it of social situations that don't seem relevant. \n\nI dunno, ymmv. 
6	Societal pressure?\n\nWomen are expected to be more sociable than men, so they are often pushed to be so.  As such, they are more likely to practice and develop social skills.\n\n>When I talk to strangers I kind of have an instructions book in my head, and if I have the time, I plan what I should say in a certain situation without thinking. \n\nVery structured.  Indicates that your social interactions are skill based rather than coming naturally the way they would with a social extrovert.  \n\nFWIW, I feel the same way with regards to the instruction book, albeit there are some chapters in mine that were poorly written or weren't included to begin with.
2	Maybe you're ISFJ. I was convinced for a while that I was ISTJ. Then realized I was actually ISFJ.\n
1	What's in your instructions book?
1	What's the gender ratio of your group of friends?
3	How much do you think?	I have a number of ISTJ and ISFJ friends, and we all seem to agree that we all kind don't think about anything when we're not actively doing something. For example, if we're just laying in bed, our minds are kind of... blank?\n\nThis is different from, say, my INTJ or ENFP friends who have said that when they're not actively doing anything their minds just go off. Even my ESTJ roommate says that she tends to overthink about the littlest things and seems to be in her head quite often.\n\nWould you agree with the sentiment that you're not always actively thinking about something/in your head?
16	That's odd. I'm constantly running through a steam-of-consciousness style train of thoughts at all times, particularly when I'm not active. I have to listen to music or Bob Ross to quiet things down. It's actually really irritating sometimes. 
7	Absolutely. My SO asks me “What are you thinking about?” And I say “....nothing.” And she says “oh ok. I see.” No seriously. I’m really not. 
5	My mind never stops and slows down. I actively have to practice yoga and meditation in order to get any peace from the incessant stream of thoughts. I WISH I was able to just hang out with a blank mind... sounds peaceful! 
3	I can never stop my brain from thinking. The only times I can "slow down" is when I go from thinking about everything to thinking about 10 things. I am so jealous of my SO who can just completely blank their mind. I have never had that ability. 
3	When I get into 'the zone', I only think about one thing, but other than that, my mind is everywhere.\n\nForcing myself to focus is the hard part though.
2	My brain never shuts down. I'm constantly thinking at any given moment.
2	This is me. When I'm not doing something or scheming my head is empty.
1	INTP. I'm always thinking. You can tell when I run away with my thoughts because I'll stare off in the distance, even in the middle of a conversation. \n\nI daydream a lot.
1	Uh, no. My mind hardly ever shuts off.
1	The way i see it i have my external voice that might not always have much to say.\nThen i have my internal voice that is pretty much constantly going, but i kind of like it. Currently it allows me to process and work on myself so i can slowly work towards my goals for this year and longer term.
1	[deleted]
1	the thoughts are too thinky
1	Constantly thinking. I can tell when I’m getting in a bad place mentally so I play music that kind of “lifts my spirit”. Sometimes it’s the only thing that helps me sigh  in relief.
3	How many novels did you read in 2017?	
3	Not a single novel, actually. I read Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins and David Brooks, though. Fascinating stuff, I got way into it. \n\nI tried reading the Outlander series but it couldn’t hold my attention. 
5	31.\n\n[Feel free to follow my reading journey](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41285490-catherine)\n\nLet's be reading buddies since I don't have many buddies in the first place haha.
4	0 I don't really read. More of a gamer
3	Does it count if I started but didn't finish?
1	2
1	19 full novels and a couple Chronicles of Narnia
1	I usually read 12-15 books a year. I try to do as many educational books as I can, but I mix in a lot of guilty pleasure novels in there too :) Probably 5-10 novels a year.
1	I read 64 books total. I think excluding poetry, short stories, and non-fiction etc it would have come to about 55 novels.
1	12, my goal this year is 20 which shouldn't be too hard considering that I changed my major to English. 
14	How do you handle loneliness?	I long for a companion. Someone willing to talk about how our days went. Someone who will reciprocate my friendship, openness, and interest justly. \n\nI'm sad and lonely. I feel like Barry Allen in that Justice League scene where he tells Bruce Wayne, "Stop right there! I'm in. I need... friends."
17	Well, for one I'd suggest getting out of the house/apartment/van down by the river.  It doesn't even matter if you do anything, just turn off all your electronics and go wander around somewhere outside.  It's too easy to get sucked into a virtual world on the internet where you can hide from your problems.  Start breaking the cycle of go home/turn on PC/dawdle around on the internet/eat/more internet/sleep.\n\nOnce you've done that a few times, start doing a few more simple things you can be proud of. Go to the gym and start working out, and stick with it.  I used to get so annoyed that that bit of advice was basically rote copypasta on advice threads but it's so stupidly effective that it bears repeating.  There's millions of workout routines and advice threads online so you don't even need a friend to get started.  It'll give you something to be proud of, a reason to leave home, something to work on, and an excuse to be around people.  Isolation and sedentary lifestyles are incredibly unhealthy, even for heavy introverts like us.\n\nYou may notice that I haven't even addressed finding a friend/partner/whatever yet.  That's because I think you should avoid looking at friends as a way to pull yourself out of depression/sadness/etc.  You should start by building your own way out of that hole, whether or not anyone will meet you halfway.  People are more likely to start new friendships with others who appear happy, anyway.\n\nFinally, once you have a few things to be proud of, pursue some hobbies that give you an excuse to interact with people.  Build a circle of acquaintances (as pointless as that sounds) and you'll start finding people you actually want to be friends with.\n\nThere's a professor named Jordan Peterson who has a lot of insightful videos on YouTube that have helped countless people find ways out of their own individual holes.  (Just ignore any of his politically-charged videos, they're not relevant to his advice.)\n\nIf you don't want to do any of that, or don't even feel like starting, you might want to see someone about depression.
8	The weekends are the hardest for me. It’s easy enough to take care of business for myself, but then I finish and start asking “what now?”\n\nBeing actively engaged in the lives of others and being needed shuts off that what now before it even starts. It always feels like there is a natural next step.\n\nNo advice, just empathy. Having a terribly lonely weekend. And going to the gym and taking care of business isn’t making it better. I wish I was at work, there I matter.
2	I live alone right now and don't really get lonely. I guess I get enough from talking to co-workers and random meet ups with my handful of friends during the week. \n\nI'll be your friend! If you just want someone to talk to.
1	badly
5	ISTJ and receiving help	ISTJs, how do you feel receiving help when it’s...\n\n1. Unsolicited but out of goodwill from someone who cares about you?\n2. A task you specifically asked for help with?\n\nDo y’all appreciate it more when it’s 2 compared to 1? If so, why?\n\nFor me (non-ISTJ), I appreciate it more when it’s 1 compared to when I have to ask for it. But I appreciate the help nonetheless. So when I offered help but it isn’t appreciated, I feel hurt, (maybe it’s a Fe thing). \n\nIt’s kinda out of my character to not offer to help/do something to help someone I care about if I can but somehow, the other party (ISTJ) doesn’t seem to appreciate it if it’s not solicited. \n\nTLDR: is not appreciating unsolicited help generally a ISTJ thing?
10	I don’t appreciate unsolicited comments or help. I rarely ask for help but if I do it’s because I want help so I’m receptive.
5	I'm highly independent and self sufficient to the point that I'd rather get something wrong a few times than have someone do it for me correctly from the start. I place a lot of value on learning, collecting skills, and improving myself so being denied the opportunity to learn from my mistakes deprives me of all three. \n\nI also take a lot of pride in not needing help. I feel like a burden if someone has to help me.\n\nI understand that it's in your nature to help, but sometimes the best way to help us is to give us the opportunity to learn how to help ourselves. We'll ask if we really need assistance.
4	1. Appreciate it, but 99% of the time their help solves nothing.\n2. If you're actually able to HELP, I'd shower you with gratitude. Otherwise, if you're helping but I can do a better job, then fuck off you're dead weight.\n\nAsking help is a very gray area for me. 99% of the time leaves me disappointed and frustrated, so I ought to just solve my shit myself.
2	We tend to be more self-critical than anything else. We are very aware of our limits and abilities. I do not need help cooking because I know how to cook. If I am having trouble cooking something or don’t know what to do, I will look up a recipe.\nI don’t know how to install a sliding glass door and don’t pretend to have the knowledge or physical ability to do so. I would call a reliable professional to do the job.

1	Oh gosh. I hate getting unsolicited help, or any type of help in general. Even on things where I have minimal to no knowledge (which are a lot of things), I spend a whole lot of time trying to figure it out on my own before I go to someone else. Even when I know people with a whole lot more experience at something than me, a part of me feels embarrassed in asking them for help, thinking that the answer is so obviously simple that they'll think I'm stupid for wanting help, while a part of me is untrusting of that person, because, though I may know that they'll be able to help me, they'll lie about it or try to sabotage everything I've been working on.
13	How do ISTJs experience love?	It would be really nice if the ISTJs here could share their experiences here with love and relationships.\n\n\nThings I'm curious about:\n\n1. Is it more common to start out as friends and have that develop into romance over time or do you date with romantic intentions from the get-go?\n\n2. How do you decide whether to pursue a relationship with someone? Is it based off things like 'sparks' and 'chemistry' or more objective factors?\n\n3. How long does it take you to fall in love in a relationship?\n\n\n\nResponses to any or all of the above questions would be much appreciated. Thank you :))\n\n\n
12	Someone wrote a really accurate and funny article on ISTJ love about a month ago: [6 Things That Happen When an ISTJ Falls for You](https://introvertdear.com/news/istj-falls-for-you/)\n\n1. Usually friends first; I like to know what I'm getting involved with ahead of time. I also feel that it builds a strong foundation for something greater. I've made some exceptions but they didn't last.\n\n2. I think there has to be a noticeable spark in order to get me to seriously consider someone, otherwise I just accept them as they are and assume they aren't interested. This can apply either to a new person I recently met, or a friend when I notice that *something's different now*...\n\n3. I basically have to endure the initial crush, overwhelming thoughts and emotions, and oxytocin rush to feel that it's true. The strength of these things usually fades somewhat. If I was already friends with the person I might be inclined to believe it to be love faster. With someone new in my life I'd be more suspicious that it might just be a phase that I'm going through.
8	Friends first, with very little exception. The reason is that there needs to be a lot of information gathered. The prospect must be judged and rejudged, evaluated through time and through crisis. Every potential romantic partner is evaluated as if they are going to be my wife and the mother of my children, period. I do not want to bother otherwise.\n\nCharacter is by far the most important element for attractiveness. Does this person enrich my life and complement it in a way that makes me better than I am alone? Does this person have values and circumstances that are compatible with my long term goals of starting a good family? Recently I fell hard for an ENFP (didn’t work out, alas!) because of the way she would coax me into novel situations that I otherwise would not have approached alone, and our opposing perspectives made a sort of “chemistry”.\n\nOnce romance clicks for me, it’s 0 to 100. If I make up my mind that you’re wife material, I’m gonna go hard until I strike out. Otherwise, I pretty much am aromantic and asexual. I generally am not “looking”, but will encounter people who pass the vetting process organically every so often, at which point I feel romantically activated.\n\nIt’s a great feeling when I’m in it. I feel complete like nothing else. I have faith that it’s gonna be amazing when it clicks on both sides, because there is a _lot_ of intensity on offer when one of us chooses you.
4	I, an ISTJ, married my wife who is also an ISTJ.  To answer your questions:\n1.  We started out as "friends" (she was the Ops manager at the Circuit City we both worked for) as her team needed extra help with some projects and I could use the extra hours being in school at the time.  We never really said 10 words to each other before that point.  A lot of the work that needed done was done from where she worked in the store so many casual conversations were had, but nothing outside of normal work talk.  I thought she was pretty but didn't think I stood a chance.  More I talked to her the more I realized she was super smart and very driven (2 of the big/main things I looked for in a partner).\n\n2.  We had each others cell numbers so she could let me know ahead of time if I was needed for the extra work that day and eventually I just said screw it and took it beyond that and started texting her outside of work.  I thought we had some chemistry so I dug a little deeper and eventually got her to meet a friend and I out at a bar one night so I could see how she was outside of the work or texting environment.\n\n3.  I think after the first time we went out, it was probably a month or two until we were "Official."  She was a manager at our store and I wasn't, so relationships were a big No, No, and she's a rule follower so it was tough to convince her and we had to keep it on the low once I did.  We took things pretty slow, dated for 5-6 years before getting married (I waited a good 5 years before popping the question and that's with zero pressure from her to get married).  As far as falling in love goes, I'd say in my experiences it takes me a good 6+ months to really know if I'm in love.  Things and people change pretty easily/quickly though in your 18-25 years of age so it can be very different for everyone.\n\nHope that helps, I'm happy to answer and more questions if you think of any. 
5	I'm married so I'll tell you what happened at the beginning of our relationship.\n\nWe started out as friends; not even close friends to be completely honest. Slowly, we began to talk and hang out outside of school more. I ended up taking one of his roommates home and his roomie invited me to come up and hang out with them. \n\nFast forward like a month later and we were sitting on my couch playing Mario kart. By the end of the night, we started dating and it was all over from there. \n\nMy love for my husband was one where it happened so fast that I didn't even know it happened. But it's something I do not regret for even one millisecond of my life.
2	1. It depends. I usually date with the intention of romance right off that bat, but my ex and I worked together first and I could not stand him. That slowly developed into a relationship that lasted far too long (obviously). That's really the only time I have not just gone for romance straight away. \n\n2. I can decide whether or not I will pursue something fairly quickly (the above situation aside, . I either feel comfortable with you or I don't. If you make me feel weird and vulnerable right away then chances are I will never give you another chance for my affection. If I feel a connection with you, it is usually extreme and I know right away that I am more than interested in you.\n\n3. If I get past the point above ^ then I am usually set for intentions. With my current partner, I started off pretty infatuated with him and almost 2 years later I'm still extremely infatuated with him. (Probably also helps that he is a great person)\n\nTL;DR If your mind aligns with my mind we will hit it off immediately and I will give you my enduring love and affection for the rest of time or until you do something really stupid. 
1	>Is it more common to start out as friends and have that develop into romance over time or do you date with romantic intentions from the get-go?\n\nI've done mostly online dating recently so that's romantic from the get-go.  IRL, I need to get to know someone before I decide whether I want to date them.  (I'm a guy so I'm not going to bother risking rejection with just anyone.)  So IRL things are more likely to start with friendship.\n\n>How do you decide whether to pursue a relationship with someone? Is it based off things like 'sparks' and 'chemistry' or more objective factors?\n\nIt's 90% objective factors and 10% attraction.  Attractive women are incredibly common compared to women who have the long-term compatibility I need.  Attraction has to be there but ultimately the decision comes down whether I think there's long-term compatibility.\n\n>How long does it take you to fall in love in a relationship?\n\nAbout 6 months, or basically once the initial spark wears off and I know plainly whether things will last or not.\n\nJust in general, I approach relationships with a strict cost/benefit mindset.  In other words, pursuing someone is a very rational, deliberate decision for me.
1	My problem with classifying as an istj is that I have a wild side I embrace at times, and I'm very good at being social in groups and great at talking to And attracting women.\n\nBut these were not natural traits, these are abilities I learned and they  aren't me, and in a sense I attract free-spirited people who realize I'm too rigid and distant once we are more than just "a friend".  My nature allows me to give off a stoic secure vibe very well, and because I learned to not rely on facts by simply accepting any outcome prior to a decision...I can portray confidence and edge... Accompanied with a taste for abusive substances. I attract the most poisonous free spirited women around. I only seem to attract women with some type of history for abuse or lack of father, or women who think their dad is god.\n\n.I handle rejection very very poorly, I take pride in myself, so when a woman leaves me I feel like I'm not good enough. \nAt the same time my introverted side causes me to get sick of companionship quickly, more stable women relationships tend to bore me and frustrate me so I end up leaving.\n\nMy best relationships have been the most twisted ones. It scares me.\n\nI eventually realized I need a relationship that keeps me on my toes otherwise it won't work out.
1	To all the other ISTJ commenters, I know you guys don’t really express your feelings well... but how do I know if the lack of expression is indeed due to this.. or because , like one of the commenters said, he’s just aromantic and asexual as he’s not 100 into me?
1	Dating advice [INTJ Male ISTJ Female]	I'm INTJ and I've been seeing an ISTJ for a little close to two months. We've been on a few dates and we're hitting it off really well. I'm a really direct person so I asked her after our most recent date if we have a future together to which she said yes. I didn't ask to make it official but she said that she also needs time to get over her ex who she recently ended things with (about 4 months ago). I have a habit of overthinking things and overanalyzing but it sounds like her old relationship was a shipwreck. I'm not going to push her to say yes to a relationship but I'm confused; does she want to be with me or is she stringing me along? Any advice you guys can give me on how to best approach this situation? Thank you in advance.
9	She's probably interested and not stringing you along. ISTJs are also usually straightforward, even in romantic relationships. She just wants a little more time to process her emotions before entering a serious relationship. Keep showing her you are interested, be friendly and ask her to go on dates. Don't force a serious relationship, but rather let it evolve with time.
6	My take as an INFJ in a relationship with an ISTJ:\n\nIf she's correctly typed, she would be unlikely to say anything other than what she actually and literally means - no subtext to worry about. ISTJs are awesome at literal and direct communication. Say what they mean and mean what they say.\n\nIf you need further clarification on how she sees "needing time to get over her ex" impacting her connection with you, just ask her that directly. A correctly typed ISTJ wouldn't have a problem with a direct request for more information, as long as it is honest and clear. 
5	How to become better/closer friends with an ISTJ?	I have a friend an online friend who is an ISTJ. We talked a lot the first time I met him online but later on he would never really initiate conversations which had me feeling confused and not important until I researched on his personality. Usually I would always talk first. I know the personality type won’t really initiate conversations a lot but i tend to overthink situations like these. I don’t really think small talk is his thing either but I want to become closer friends with him. I’m also afraid if I’m talking too much because I’m mostly the one initiating conversation. Any tips/advice? Oh also I don’t know if this is relevant or not but I’m INFJ. 
15	I hate to start conversations, but I love to talk to people, especially about interesting topics. If I wanted someone to talk to me, I would wish they told me about their interest and give me an opportunity to tell them mine. Then we all know what could be interesting topics. And no, I don't like small talk :)
3	>I don’t really think small talk is his thing either\n\nYou are correct.  ISTJs hate small talk.\n\nFind a topic he is interested in and discuss it.  If you are knowledgeable about that topic, have an interesting conversation.  If not, listen and learn. 
3	Best strategy:\n(1) Quality of attention > Quantity of attention, never make us a burden or a distant memory. \n(2) Don't talk to me if it's social, talk to me about deeper things or even don't talk at all -- I'm used to awkwardness and take it as a sign of respect for my sanity! - just no small talk please. \n(3) Keep in mind we're one of the few temperaments for which the leading cause of separation is a Buridan's Donkey-like paralysis over how to keep a relationship going when we haven't seen them in forever. Believe me, it is devastating to an ISTJ to have to exist in this limbo if a friend leaves. I for one like clear and formal borders to things... if you want to engage with the ISTJ person, never leave them, if you are flighty and or bored with the ISTJ... just say it and we think nothing much of it really--we just move on. 
1	I'm an INFJ and wife and coworkers are ISTJ, so here is what I've noticed.  If any ISTJs experiences have been different, please help me. \n\nIf time is not crucial and there is not a lot of pressure to respond,  the ISTJs in my life seem to enjoy my talking.  Just because they do not respond, does not mean they don't enjoy it.  They are introverted feelers, so all the information you are giving them, they take and make future decisions with on how to act towards you and around you.  \n\nISTJs are introverted feelers, which says a ton about them.  "Small talk" is actually what introverted feelers use to gauge themselves with the world around them.  They will often talk about their opinion on matters, especially on behaviors of people.  Here is what is going on in their mind.\n\nISTJ: (I wonder if this person likes beer or not) So, yesterday my friend got sloshed at this party and threw up all over the floor.\nOTHER: Wow!  I know how that is.  I one time puked after drinking....\nISTJ: (okay so they are down for drinking a lot of alcohol. Few! Me too. How about beer? )  \n\nEtc. introverted feeling will probe with comments about other people's behaviors in order to establish social boundaries with others. \n\nMy experience shows ISTJs really enjoying this kind of small talk.  \n\nTalking about opinions on past experiences and other people's behaviors are huge for ISTJs.
1	I find it very difficult to chat when I don't have anything to say. When someone messages me something generic like "what's up?" it's irksome. I'm all for conversations but prefer people just dive right in. What do you want? What's on your mind? What did you want to tell me? 
22	I feel like I bore people in the long run	I think Im excellent at getting to know people initially, I sort of have an arsenal of jokes an anecdotes and everyone tends to like me a lot. However, it feels like after this initial phase is worn-out they discover Im actually a pretty boring person. Hardly any stuff happening in my life to talk about, so conversations can become really dull if I initiate them. Could it be that Im basing these observations on a small subset of people who I've interacted with?\n\nI wonder if this happens to any of you, and what to do about it.
8	I feel pretty much the same way. Even in long-term friendships, I tend to feel boring after a while. I suppose anyone's going to base their observations on their own personal experiences, but finding out what other similar people have concluded can be helpful.\nAs for what to do about it... I tend to read a lot, so I always have something to talk about with people, but I'm never going to be one of those people who is endlessly entertaining and - well, extroverted.
7	My best advice is to take up a hobby if you haven’t already. I personally garden, play music, read, and keep up with news. Usually I can talk about one of those things with just about anyone. And hobbies will help you develop relationships with people you will genuinely have lots to discuss with.
7	Coming from an ISTJ, a very non-ISTJ approach is instead to ask other people about themselves. Most people don’t care if your life is “boring.”  They care if you’re a caring and trustworthy friend and maybe someone you can joke around with.
4	When I speak to people, I always say I have a boring life. That said, I love my life but I don’t have anything to say about it to anyone so maybe that’s why it seems boring. I always ask other people a ton of questions so I don’t have to talk about myself. People think I’m a great listener :)
3	I definitely think I do this too. I know I'm a dime-a-dozen person with average qualities. I don't really excel at any one thing, but I'm competent about most things. However, people are more interested in things other people excel at. With none of those qualities to speak of, I have to try really hard to keep my friendships from petering (I hope that's how you spell that) out.
2	Friend: "SecuritySix, who was your day/week?"\n\nMe: "Same shit, different day/week."
2	I think it may be true that we can seem boring in the long-run, but in my experience my friends still stick along and hang out with me and we have a great time to boot. So in the end, I don't necessarily think we're as "boring" as we think we are. What's important is the people that matter to you continue to stick around - and more often than not they do :)
2	so what
1	ENFP here - what bores me with ISTJ - too many details, can't talk personal shit even when forced (my mother for example xd), can't theoretize for shit (she NEVER reads any instructions, just jumps into doing things and bruteforces them). So 2 important areas of talking are removed from equation
1	How to tell between an ISTJ and INTJ	Im trying to type my father here and ive narrowed it down to these 2 types, now how can i finally tell between these 2? what are their main differences
6	Make subtle changes to your house. particularly in areas where your dad spends time, and see if he notices.\n\nSensors are very good at noticing when things differ from their norm.  I'm not sure what an analogous test for intuitors would be.
2	Turns out he was an Esfp, wtf! O.o , im starting to lose faith in the MBTI..
3	What're your thoughts on second chances	in friendships, relationships, etc. \n\n**edit for those saying "depends" - you didnt fuck up - the other person (me) did - I apologized - we both take some time apart and you decide to reach out. (giving myself a second chance)
11	For both it depends on why it was messed up in the first place.
9	Depends on the person. Depends on the fuck up. If you burn me or lose my trust, you get no second chances. If you've done something milder and are genuinely repentant, I will cautiously accept you back in my life and keep my distance a little more. \n\nThis might be why I don't make friends easily. 
8	I give second, third, fourth chances but it’s never exactly the same as the first time. 
5	I’m very unforgiving. Burn me once, fuck you. 
3	Is it your fault? We deserve a second chance.\n\nIs it our fault? Give us the teeny, tiniest bit of opportunity, alright?
2	[deleted]
1	It depends on the nature of the fuck up, and if you owned up to it. I can give people second chances but you'd have to work hard to earn my trust back. If you've proven in the past that I can't count on you to do X then I may give you a second chance but absolutely plan for you to fuck up again.
3	ISTJ Dating Advice	Hey guys, ENFP here. I just started talking to this girl who’s an ISTJ, and we just had our first date. It went horrible. She wasn’t really connecting with me, and she seemed way more concerned about the activities we were doing than getting to know me. She got really annoyed and irritated by the smallest things, which people don’t normally get annoyed about, and she was super rigid about doing certain things which in the long run wouldn’t really have mattered. I was stressed out throughout the entire date because I could tell she wasn’t having a good time, and no matter how hard I tried to go along with what she wanted and give her some stability, she just got more and more annoyed with me about little things. I don’t want to give up on this girl because we really do get along well in a less formal setting than a date, and we have more or less the same values and priorities. How do I make sure this doesn’t happen again without having to completely change who I am in order to make her comfortable?
21	It sounds like it wasn’t a match. Not every romantic incompatibility is MBTI based, most probably are not.
12	My guess is she felt way, way out of her comfort zone with whatever the date activity was and therefore was so consumed with anxiety about the activity she couldn’t enjoy herself. My partner did something similar... early in the relationship got us tickets to a MLS game with his friends and family. The huge crowds, loud stadium, crazy people... my anxiety was through the roof. I just couldn’t enjoy myself and felt on edge the whole time. Contrast that with dates where we’ve gone for a walk just the two of us in the woods, or out to a quiet dinner, or even just stay home and watch a movie... I’m calm, relaxed, easy to spend time with. ISTJs struggle in new/uncertain environments and my guess is that was the case with your date. Maybe for a second date ask her what her ideal date would be and accept that to you it might seem boring. I’m a boring person to date- I like routine, I like quiet calm dates, I like just staying home too! And I should say my partner and I do continue to attend MLS games, and since I’ve gone to a ton by now, they no longer make me anxious. If you want to have exciting dates with her in the future, maybe it’s worth repeating them so she can have a chance to get used to the activities and know what to expect. It’s all about knowing what to expect- if she doesn’t know what to expect she’s going to be anxious. Maybe before the next date really describe in full everything that you’ll be doing, where it’ll be, who will be there, what the atmosphere will be like, etc. Give her time to mentally prepare for being outside of her comfort zone instead of making her roll with the punches.
10	Here's my nightmare scenario...I agree to go out to dinner with you. You pick me up and we head to the restaurant, but there's no parking. We circle and circle the block, nada. The anxiety builds. Some guy cuts us off and takes a spot, my blood boils. Finally, we park but it's three blocks away. Fine, FINE. Now, with my little lady legs I have to keep up with a dude's stride all while trying to hold up a convo. A block in, I feel a llittle sweaty and a little out of breath, but I don't want you to know. I'm now a little annoyed at you for having to run even though I know perfectly well that I could tell you to slow down. Finally, we get to the restaurant. Hostess asks, do you have a reservation? You don't and it's a 45 minute wait. So, you invited me to dinner but didn't actually *plan* by making a reservation. Now, I'm angry. You notice and suggest going elsewhere, giving me 2-3 options. But this is not the date I agreed to...this is different than the plan that you didn't actually plan...I don't know what to say and feel awkward. I need to look at these other places on Yelp, I need to figure out which one is close by so that I don't have to jog/walk very far to a different restaurant. All because YOU DIDN'T PLAN.\n\nI could go on, but you get the picture. While another type might find your lack of planning *charming* and a change of plans *spontaneous*, you've pushed me beyond my limits. \n    \nMaybe tell us what happened and we can pinpoint where it went awry.\n
4	My situation has maybe some relevance. I'm an ISTJ and I live with my sister who is an ENFP. I love her to death, but she annoys and exhausts me at the best of times. She's always happy, loud, excited, distracted, and spontaneous. These are all things I cannot be around for more than 30 minutes without having to go home and lock myself in my room overnight to recharge. \n\nI can say without a doubt that I will never date an ENFP for that exact reason. I'm envious of your energy and passion for life, but damn, I feel like I'm on a train ride to hell when I have to be around you guys for a long period of time. 
2	I'd suggest saving both herself and yourself the stress and finding someone to get involved with who you can openly accept for all of how they process information and respond to the world around them. The early dating is only the beginning of the relationship. Real compatibility matters.\n\nIn other words, what /u/anbeav said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/7vo71y/istj_dating_advice/dttralk/).
6	What's your experience with and perspective on travel?	I had an interesting conversation with my ISTJ SO about her experiences of travel. She likes to travel as part of her leisure activities. I asked her to try to help me understand specifically what is so appealing to her about the experience. She said that she notices/perceives a lot of physical detail in the world around her, and that after a while there aren't more details to notice on her usual walks and stuff around home and work (she's lived in the same house for around a decade, worked at the same company for something like 14 years). She said traveling to and physically experiencing new places gives her more details to notice. Going to new places gives her more stimulation at that level, which she likes. Without that, she starts to feel stifled after a while.\n\nThis in some ways goes against some of the stereotypes of the ISTJ. She is correctly typed. Of course there is variation in people within a type.\n\nI'm curious about the experiences and perspectives of other ISTJs here. \n\nIf you're willing to share: Does her desire for and experience with travel resonate with you? How/how not?
5	I've never been a particularly big fan of "traveling" just for the sake of going somewhere else.  Wanderlust and "taking trips" is completely lost on me as a leisure activity.  Securitysix's point about traveling with a purpose reflects my views - if I want to go somewhere specific, like a theme park, I don't hesitate to take a day or two off work to go check it out.  Otherwise, I already have a fulfilling life thanks to an enjoyable job, engaging hobbies, and other practical activities that keep me occupied.  Travelling just takes me away from the things I enjoy and costs me a large chunk of money and vacation time in the process so it's actually the opposite of a leisure experience for me.
4	I do not like to travel. There is nothing appraling about it to me.\n
3	This is pretty much spot on for me. I think it also comes from how I was raised— my parents are fairly worldly people who like to travel and are from different countries. So not only do I like to travel, I have lived in several different cities/countries/continents. I would be happy moving to a completely new place every few years for this reason, despite being an ISTJ who’s supposedly not supposed to like change. I love exploring new neighbourhoods or cities. My favourite way to travel is to stay in a nice area of a city and wander the streets looking at stuff. \n\nOn the other hand I can understand the other commenters because I don’t like to travel or go live just anywhere for the sake of seeing new places, I’m only really interested in certain places like beautiful European cities and countryside, Japan, interesting American cities and national parks, and some places in NZ and Australia (where I live). I’m not the least bit interested in seeing Southeast Asia for example. \n\nTravel can also be exhausting for me, and I am usually glad to come home to my routine. Oh, and on the practical side, I always travel on somewhat of a budget and plan very carefully to get the best value accommodation and transport. I looove the research and planning :)
3	I think I like the idea of travel, but almost every vacation I either get stressed out or have an emotional breakdown. Maybe it's because family vacations are inherently not the greatest thing for me. I have been out of the country twice and both of those were good vacations, but I always have the feeling of being trapped. I know the pictures on Instagram are pretty, but unless I'm going there for an actual "experience", it usually ends badly or "meh". Some of my best trips have literally been going on a bus from D.C. to New York to see a singer-songwriter in a tiny cafe. That being said, I don't mind day trips to D.C. every once in a while. I live so close to the nation's capital and don't visit often enough or explore.
3	I love to travel. Having said that, I need time away to de stress from the stupid I see during travel time.

2	Traveling is always  security issue for me. Do I have enough money? Do I have a place to stay? Do I know who and what to look out for? If I have all that covered then I'd love to travel to cities and forests and mountains for that sensory experience.\n\nBut I am an sp type 6 as well though.
2	I didn't used to enjoy traveling partially because my brain always jumped to "this is too expensive and unattainable." It was just never an option to me.\n\nThe reason I changed my mind about it is because I now work in the travel industry, so I have a sense of "knowing what goes on behind the curtain" about it. I can take advantage of employee travel rates which make going to new places a possibility. I use long drives as an opportunity to binge on podcasts and audio books. Earning travel status is like a game to me. True to my letter I, nearly 100% of all my travel has been solo.\n\nShould I leave the industry, I can foresee myself losing interest in traveling and going back to being the homebody I used to be.
2	I do not like to travel.\n\nI got dragged to Pampa, TX when I was 5 to visit some of my dad's family.\n\nI went to a wedding in Louisiana when I was 26.\n\nI went to Arizona in 2009 to pick up a friend and rescue him from California (he went back anyway and had to rescue himself the second time).\n\nThat's enough travel for me.
1	I understand her and why she feels like that. But as an ISTJ, I'm mostly lost in thought when outside, if I'm in my hometown or in a new place. Of course I take in some new details when in a new place, but that comes second to my thoughts. So the details around me does not matter that much to me.\n\nWhen walking outside, I mostly look up at the sky, at the clouds, stars, or northern lights. And thwy almost never look the same. But I don't think I would get bored if it all looked the same. To much to think about :P
6	Is it possible to help an unhealthy ISTJ with odd self-hate issues?	I know an ISTJ, and I believe he has a good heart. It's unfortunately buried. It's like he has this attitude where he refuses to ever make changes, or improve, and then hates people who are like he is. \n\n\n\n\n1. While capable of hard-work, he barely does any. He preaches a lot about how important work is, often outright shaming people he views as "lazy" but he himself will spend months putting off stuff until the last minute, where he then tries to get it all done at once.\n\n\n\n\n2. He's very quick to assume that he's smarter than others. Often telling people his way of doing things. He hates when other people do this to him. \n\n\n\n\n3. One of his catchphrases pretty much is; "You'll only learn by doing" but what he means is; "You'll only learn by doing it the way I tell you to do it." Which again he despises other people telling him how to do things.\n\n\n\n\n4. He's got an explosive temper. I mean there's been more than one time where he's blown up, over something really, minor. He actually got into a screaming match, with a baby. So, of course, he can't stand "people with attitude". \n\n\n\n\n5. Interacting with him is like he views every interaction like it's some kind of win-lose contest, and he's obessed with winning. He has to get the last word, he has to be right, and when arguing he just continues to get more stubborn, and louder, and louder until it's just him screaming at the other person, just so he can "win".\n\n\n\n\nI know these sound bad, but he does have his good traits. I wouldn't be asking if I could help him if he was just a big, meanie pants, all the time. \n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway is it possible to give an ISTJ like this help? Or is it something he needs to realize, and do himself?
11	>Interacting with him is like he views every interaction like it's some kind of win-lose contest, and he's obessed with winning. He has to get the last word, he has to be right, and when arguing he just continues to get more stubborn, and louder, and louder until it's just him screaming at the other person, just so he can "win".\n\nOK, I thought you were talking about me for a second there...\n\n>While capable of hard-work, he barely does any. He preaches a lot about how important work is, often outright shaming people he views as "lazy" but he himself will spend months putting off stuff until the last minute, where he then tries to get it all done at once.\n\nI'm sure you've heard the saying "Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today."\n\nConversely, there are "Never do today what you can put off until tomorrow," and "Never put off until tomorrow that which you can get out of doing entirely."  Both are pretty solid pieces of the Procrastinator's Oath (which is a thing I just made up, but follow me here).\n\nISTJs will often put off doing things that we consider unimportant or that they don't value in favor of doing things we *do* value and/or consider important.  We often justify this in the name of time management.\n\nWhen the last minute rolls around, we decide whether it's important enough to do at all, and if it is, we get it done, albeit sometimes in a rushed panic.\n\n>He's very quick to assume that he's smarter than others. Often telling people his way of doing things. He hates when other people do this to him. \n\n>One of his catchphrases pretty much is; "You'll only learn by doing" but what he means is; "You'll only learn by doing it the way I tell you to do it." Which again he despises other people telling him how to do things.\n\nI'll address these two together, since they're similar.\n\nISTJs like routine.  Once we've found/developed/been taught a way to do something, we consider this to be the correct/best/only way to do it unless proven otherwise.  We need a good reason (by our opinion, not yours) to change our routine.\n\nThat latter part is the trick, especially if we have been tasked with teaching someone how to do this thing, either by their request or by management.  We are going to teach you to do it *our* way, because it's the *right* way.  While we're teaching you, we really don't give a gerbil's ass if you think you know a better way to do it, because our way is the right way, and we don't need some scrub who just started telling us they think they know better on this thing that we've been doing forever.\n\nOnce you've learned the right way and proven that you understand how to do it, you can probably come to us and say "Hey, I know you showed me to do it this way, but I have an idea that might be better/more efficient.  Do you mind giving it a look and telling me what you think?"  We *like* better/more efficient.  If you show us your way and it is objectively better, we'll adopt it and implement it as the new right way.\n\nNow, whether this applies to your ISTJ, I don't know.  We're all a little different, after all.  He might just need a swift kick in the pants, or he might need a full on [Attitude Adjustment](https://youtu.be/ZFhubbRugak).\n\n>Anyway is it possible to give an ISTJ like this help? Or is it something he needs to realize, and do himself?\n\nThe two are not mutually exclusive.  Like I said, he might need help coming to the realization.\n\nWithout knowing him, I can't tell you how to approach him about it or how well it would work.  He might be the type that you can go up to and say "So, Bill, I've noticed <insert problem here>, and it makes you come across as kind of a jackass.  Could you maybe dial that back a bit?"  He might also be the type that will flip the table and give birth to a barnyard animal on the spot in response to that.\n\nAnd I just noticed this got really long, really fast, so I'm going to stop.
6	This person sounds like they've developed a serious case of cynicism through a history of bad experiences.  I can be very temperamental when things aren't going the way they should in my life (it's very frustrating to have a sub-optimal life and lack the ability to do anything about it).  Arrogance can be its own thing but might also just be a shield against cynicism ("people are awful, but at least I'm competent").\n\nWithout actually knowing this person, it sounds like they have deeper issues they need to address and they'll probably avoid doing so as long as possible.  Pushing them on it is going to entrench them.  If you really want to do something, lay it all out on the table for them to see then don't talk to them until they've had time to think about things and admit they're wrong.  That can take a while and it may never happen.\n\nNow that I think of it, they sound like a much worse version of me at my lowest.  I hold values like hard work and efficiency tight because they're important to me but if I hit a major rut I'll become depressed (losing any motivation to work as my mind becomes preoccupied with the stress), angry (frustrated that I can't optimize my world), and very inconsiderate of others.  It's a lot easier to get out of the rut by solving the underlying problems (which I won't admit to anyone) than any other way.\n\nHope this helped, it's late and I'm tired.
2	I've known toxic ISTJs like this. Nothing helps them, they continue to dig themselves further into a hole by being a jerk to others, which in their mind, validates their paranoid beliefs and superiority complex.  Just stay away from people like that, they are not willing to accept that they have a problem, nor are they willing to change, bc in their mind, everyone else is the problem, not themself.

1	Lol, he's not broken.  He's me.\n\nHe "doesn't need to change" (as much) because he's "perfect."  Not perfect to the point of "I don't need change," but to the point of "everyone else needs to catch up to where I am so we can make progress together."  (Check Enneagram type 1 - Perfectionist)  Procrastination is a common trait for Perfectionists because they're afraid of doing it wrong, so putting it off prevents much of their "wrongness."  (for me, though, I put in as much time as I can on something so the end product is less wrong)\nI don't think he thinks he's smarter, he just has a better way of doing it.  It's more efficient, takes less labor, takes less time, has fewer errors, or some combination that has a higher percentage of perfection.\nLearning by doing is fine, as long as people's mistakes don't get in his way.  If you're going to "try" something, put it in a test environment - don't wreck the production environment.  You want to see what some strange combination of colors looks like in a room?  Put it in YOUR room.  If you're going to do something that affects him, he needs the stability of his way, because it eliminates the flaws that he's worked so hard to do away with by doing it his specific way.  Loading the dishwasher isn't "getting dishes in there," it's "minimize the number of times a specific dish has to go through - hopefully all dishes can get clean after the first time through.  Stop wasting resources by not caring that the bowl covering the other bowl prevents it from being clean - it's just wasteful!"\nAnger is a signature "deadly sin" of Enneagram Type 1 Perfectionists.  It's often buried as resentment because people "just don't care about the right way to do things."  You've told them time and time again that you HAVE to pull on the door handle to make sure the door is shut, and choosing NOT to is a direct attempt to make the world a sloppier and less liveable place.\nInteractions are more about which side has the best evidence.  Although your personal experiences carry TONS of weight to you, you can't say "I've experienced it" and expect that to carry any weight to an ISTJ.  He needs evidence.  I think his anger in statement #5 is that he doesn't feel like his evidence/thoughts are being heard or understood.  He needs someone to fully hear out his side FIRST (especially if they're the ones that asked him first) before they should even attempt to convey their side.  One person, then the other - it's just more "correct" that way.  If he starts the conversation by asking someone else a question/offering a "side," then it's his responsibility to hear out their answer completely before offering his side.\n\nI have no doubt that his anger manifests when he's stressed, and likely in an unhealthy amount, but it's usually due to an underlying problem.  Being ISTJ doesn't help that he probably doesn't want to talk about it.  Starting with phrases like "you're probably MORE angry about something else and just taking it out on me.  I'm gonna try to take what you say at face value rather than an attempt to start a fight.  I know you have a reason for why you think this way, and it's valid.  You just have to respect that I have a reason for the way I think, and I'm also valid."  He might present a lot of stuff as "fact," but if you assume he means "I think/I feel," it might take on a form closer to his true meaning.\n\nI had very similar qualms with my wife and the fact that she did things VERY wrongly (and still does), but I've learned to deal with it by acknowledging within myself that her wrong way, or that "good enough," is RIGHT to her (and others), and that MY responsibility is to do MY right, and to present my right as a strong suggestion (don't be surprised by slight "I told you so's" later on).
7	DAE struggle with recognition?	I think it's an introvert thing. At my job I have been repeatedly invited to a dinner to recognize my "Outstanding Customer Service". However, I have no interest in this and would rather not go. I see it as me simply doing my job. I'm just curious if anyone else is like this?
5	Rather than thinking of the dinner as a celebration for your work performance, think of it as a dinner for you and your colleagues to bond. Chances are work will be left at the door and dinner will be casual conversations.. And we all know that's when the extroverts take over.  If it was made into a large affair then I'd avoid it but if it's small and there's free food, count me in.

2	Yes, I can't even take a compliment, I allways say it's no big deal or turn the conversation around as fast as possible. I don't know how to fix it, it's reflexes at this point.
2	Sort of.  I really like fulfilling my duties and making others happy, but I also dislike heavy spotlights.  Recognition is a great way to know that I'm making people happy/doing my job but the idea of celebrating my accomplishment by making me do something I shy away from (social event) is a bit ironic.\n\nNevertheless, it's nice to let people show gratitude for things they appreciate.  Besides, accepting social recognition is a great way to delegate out the "self advertisement" aspect of career growth that we probably don't like to do anyway.
1	 "I see it as me simply doing my job"\n\nThis.  At my old job I would get random gift cards to a coffee shop and I always felt guilty.  I would tell my supervisor that I was just doing my job, and would do it regardless if I received recognition or not.  Once she asked me how I would like to be rewarded then, and I said if other people could do their jobs so I didn't have to, that would be fantastic... I kept getting gift cards.
0	Persuading ISTJs	How does one persuade ISTJs that what they were indoctrinated, conditioned, etc. to believe is false?\n\nExample: ISTJ teachers in the US education system. Typically, they’re indoctrinated and falsely led to believe a bunch of propoganda and are basically conditioned to become drones, following orders without question, conditioned to believe what they’re told based on title, degrees, certificates, authority, etc.\n\nIn reality, the US education system is a bureaucratic indoctrination, conditioning, and propoganda machine designed to turn people into drones for the corrupt rich.\n\nThose people base the correctness of everything on title biases, authority biases, etc.\n\nThe propoganda they’re led to believe is thus:\n\n*Not informed on neuroplasticity*\n\n*Believes in talents*\n\n*Believes people aren’t credible if they don’t have a degree in the corresponding field*\n\n*Believes degrees make people “more right”*\n\n*Believes degrees and titles actually matter*\n\n*Believes whatever the education system tells them*\n\n*Believes people of authority should never be questioned, except politicians*\n\n*Believes the keys to getting places in life are following orders, following the rules, and working hard rather than smartly*\n\n*Fails to realize sources only matter for black & white facts (e.g. statistics)*\n\n*Believes the education system wants to help people*\n\nI think you get the idea.\n\n1. How does one persuade an ISTJ otherwise?\n2. How does one persuade an ISTJ of something unusual (e.g. chakras being an attempt by ancients to explain how states of mind and the nervous system work)\n\nI’m relatively good at pitching to people if I want to persuade someone bad enough, but my gosh! When it comes to persuading XSXJs on this stuff, it feels like trying to cut a brick with a butterknife!
17	In my case, give me verifiable facts and ideas, tell me how to learn more, then drop the subject until my curiosity eventually convinces me to research the subject on my own. \n\nI've researched BS topics like "the moon landing was fake" and "9/11 was an inside job" because someone presented a good idea or argument that interested me. I've also summarily dropped such BS topics after my own researches confirmed that they were BS and proceeded to outright ridicule after my friend kept pushing the same speculative, unfounded BS when I didn't want to hear it. There's no coming back from that point.
15	I've got to say, many of the ideas in your post make me cringe or roll my eyes. To me, your opinions come across as anti-authoritarian, aggressive, and narrow-minded in a way. Angsty anarchist high schooler stuff.\n\nISTJs like facts. I appreciate ideas or opinions, too, but facts, scientific evidence, or expert testimony that support your side builds credibility in my eyes. I'm pretty quick to judge if I think someone is wrong, and I can be stubborn to change my mind, so you have to present your ideas carefully. Think about how you would write a high-quality essay.\n\nEdit to add: If you were to tell me, "I think chakras were an attempt by the ancients to explain states of the mind." If I'm actually interested, I would say, "Oh, that's interesting. I haven't heard that before. What gives you that idea?" And then you should be as logical and clear as you can be, especially if it's not "verifiable." Still isn't a guarantee I'll be persuaded. If I'm not interested, you're probably not going to persuade me, anyway.
4	I need LOGIC.  You can express your opinions but unless you are very strong in the logic department, we're done on the subject.
3	if you really want to persuade us all, start by going outside sometime
5	Si & Te is based heavily on empirical data. \n\nTrusted Sources (secular, military, civic, religious) are curated early on and remain so until you can prove *within their logic* why it is wrong (using their trusted sources/texts).\n\nPersonal theories are no better than opinions  since you aren't a trusted source.\n\nSo you telling me the earth is flat (because reasons) is just going to raise the draw bridge.\n\nISTJ are concerned with hypotheticals, possibilities & speculation when it concerns Murphy's law (what could go wrong here) because of inferior Ne. Fiddling around with "established facts" or theories or routines is a waste time unless it has proven concrete positive impact.\n\nThis is why I don't buy the newest phone as soon as it comes out or pay attention to dietary fads.\n\nMetaphorically an ISTJ is like a tank in urban combat. It's cautious, nearly impenetrable and only moves forward when told by someone trustworthy that it's ok to proceed a few more feet.
3	I think the problem is your premise. Telling someone of any personality type that they're living in the Matrix isn't going to work.\n\nAs others have said, ISTJs like facts. The ideas you're putting forward are very vague. One point you put out there is a huge red flag for ISTJs. (Fails to realize sources only matter for black & white facts). If you can't provide evidence supporting a claim, then for us it's entirely worthless.\n\nMaybe it'll help if I show how I might argue some of these ideas as an ISTJ?\n\n"So back then, they didn't know a lot about science, technology, and so on, right? So they came up with all these ideas and religions to try and explain the world around them. One of these was chakra, which was an attempt to explain the nervous system. It's a theory, basically."\n\n"Think about this, what's the purpose of colleges? At first you might say they exist to educate people, or help them get jobs. But if that was really their purpose, then wouldn't they be doing a better job? When it comes down to it, schools are businesses whose primary purpose is to make money. If their goal was to provide education, there would be universal access like public K-12 schools, and like they have in Europe."\n\n"There was a study done by X University that found that engineers were equally knowledgeable about X, regardless of educational background."
3	I'm an INFJ and I really love this post.  I also want to become better at communicating with ISTJs.  \n\nMy Ni and Ti are perceiving this happening:\n\n1) Non _S_J types, specifically heavy intuitive Ti users need proof too but we take our big ideas and vocalize it (bang it against a whole bunch of walls).  If it doesn't break down then that is proof that it is sturdy.  We are actually asking others to do the work of proving.  \n\n2) _S_Js however, aren't gonna stand on something unless it has been proven sturdy already.  So if a non Si user comes and tries their box proving session out on an Si type in order to prove his box,  the Si type is not going to help at all.  They completely see past that. (Which is amazing to me actually!)\n\nWhat we non-Si types are actually doing is trying to get others to do the work for us.   Of course we don't expect anyone to jump on board without proof, but we expect proof of why you wont jump on board and when Si does not provide that it feels hurtful because basically what we perceive is happening is, the Si type actually has unshakeable proof that our box is faulty and they are determined to withhold that proof from us and watch us crash on our faulty box.  We feel ill will.\n\nFor the Si type there is no ill will.  They don't believe that withholding knowledge is hateful or hurtful.  Instead, they wonder how you went out and jumped on that box without sufficient knowledge to begin with and the very act of you questioning your box already raises red flags to the Si type that your box is faulty and you have not done the research.  \n\nThe Si type is actually showing you respect by assuming you have done the research necessary to stand on your box.  You confessing your lack of research shows lack of credibility.  The Si type can be left thinking, "wow, I thought this guy knew what he was getting into. After all, I'd never take a step without knowing what I was getting into.  Poor guy." \n\n-------------\nEverything above this line is actually my Ni ramblings and completely unfounded attempt to smash my untested box around in hopes that it stands.  \n\nSorry, ISTJs .   If you feel pity enough to comment.  It is appreciated. 
2	Proving indoctrination or conditioning might not be the best way to approach the issue.  I have found that providing evidence countering beliefs in an approachable way to be successful in getting people to examine why they hold certain beliefs.  Logic and evidence are the most reliable ways of determining the truth.
2	Lol this is why it’s so hard for N’s and S’s to agree on anything. The entire way we perceive the world is different. N’s believe they have a duty to understand the world and fix it for the better. S’s believe the world is the way it is, and it’s easier to adapt to it than try to change it to something better, and they don’t feel they need to care about improving the system if they’re going to die after 80 years anyway. For S’s life is short and unavoidably imperfect, so might as well make the most out of the time you have and avoid putting yourself through unnecessary stress. For N’s, life is this wonderful gift that everyone deserves to experience at its peak and it’s their duty to make life better or rid the world of the shitty parts, their own health/well being aside. So if you’re trying to convince an S that the system is flawed and it needs to be changed, when 80+ years worth of statistics tells them that it for the most part works (people with degrees get jobs, the world still works fine despite using traditional teaching methods to educate the next gen), it’s not worth it at all. 
2	Your problem is in your question.  You don't persuade ISTJ's.  They're sentinels that stand by their convictions.  You either have and present proof, or you take your sales pitch elsewhere.\n\nAs far as teachers, ISTJ teachers have "bought into" the training that teachers are composed of.  It's not that they did their research on all the subjects they have to teach (because there's just not enough time for that), they want the world to continue to go around from what we currently know.  Should you more trust a PhD with medical advice, or someone who insists?  Neither has provided proof of what they're claiming, but one has to have gone through rigorous studies for their title, and therefore in a split second decision has to be accredited with the benefit of the doubt.  If time/research permits, do personal research on specifically whatever is being argued.  What can't be investigated, leave it to defaults.\n\nI'm specifically an ISTJ.  I don't believe everything I'm told from an "accredited source," but I won't tell others they're wrong for believing what I don't believe.  I have to, likewise, be able to disprove what they believe.  If I can't, they have every right to their stance.\n\nSo yeah, you can give up on your attempts at persuading ISTJs.  What works for most won't necessarily work for all.  We don't leave the safety of our walls unless we can reason for ourselves that our walls aren't stable.  Insisting that your wall is better and even providing evidence won't do it.  You have to address OUR wall, not sell yours.
16	How do you show you’re thankful for a gift?	I’ve always struggled with this, especially when opening a gift in front of people. Even when I’m really excited about or thankful for a gift, I feel like any reaction I have seems disingenuous and awkward. 
11	I also struggle with this. If I'm in front of them, I'll just keep it simple, and say thank you, and some (I needed that!) If it's someone really close, I may hug them if I find that fitting. I feel akward as hell though, and often inspect the gift closely so that I have an excuse to not do anything else, but so that it seems that I liked the gift. \n\nI allways experience this at christmas with my relatives. Everybody except me and my grandpa allways jump up and hug each other and say heart warming things to eachother. I think that the best way I can show my gratitude, is by maintaining eye contact and saying thank you. Simple and effective :)
6	I use it.
4	I send a thank you note, on paper, by mail. The notecard is small so you aren't expected to write much.
2	At this point there's nothing more I can do about looking awkward. Regardless I still try to be as appreciative and gratuitous as I can.\n\nBest way I can validate my gratitude is to show the person I'm using the gift.
0	hey fellow ISTJ, here is a Survey to know more about MBTI types. Thank you for your time.	
10	I left when it asked for IQ.
5	Would have submitted if IQ wasn’t required. Never been tested professionally. 
3	How to become friends with an ISTJ	Hi! I really want to become friends with an ISTJ but I just don’t know how to act around him. We’re acquiantances right now and I want to take it to the next level by becoming friends with him. I’m an ENFP and I have a tendency to become too much too soon so here are some things I’m curious about:\n\n1.) How do you feel when a really outgoing extrovert initiates a conversation with you?\n\n2.) Do you get annoyed when someone tells you or shares to you random stories about their day?\n\n3.) If I always ask tips and advices from you about a certain field that you know about, how would you feel about it?\n\n4.) Any other tips you can share to break the cold and icy exterior so I’ll be let in his circle/comfort zone?
14	* 1) If you're extremely outgoing, I might get a little overhelmed but otherwise I really like outgoing persons. It's a nice change from ourselves and introverts like us haha\n* 2) I could be, if I  don't know you well enough. Tone it up slowly at first as you get to know each other maybe...Then it's fine, I'll like it!\n* 3) I would love it!\n* 4) I'm less like this now but I remember when I was younger (teens) we could only be BFF if we had a one on one conversation about something personal hahaha. But it had to happen after enough time being regular friends, cause you know, shy introverts and so on.\nI'm still like this to some extent, It's just less formal. But still, it has to "click", there's no magical solution.\n\nedit: format.
12	1) Depends. If somebody I don't know just asks me hundreds of questions about me or my private life, I feel like running. If you respect my space and privacy and just tell stuff about yourself, then it's ok.\n\n2) Usually not. Maybe a little bit if these stories are too irrelevant (like what you had for lunch).\n\n3) Best thing you could do, honestly. I'd feel useful and like what I say would actually matter and be of interest for you.\n\n4) Just do #3 until you find a topic you both enjoy. Don't ask too many personal questions too early. Don't make feelings a topic unless you know each other very well (we're like "wtf are feelings?"). Don't push. Our ice is usually pretty strong and doesn't melt in a day or two. Becoming friends with one of us takes time.
5	I'll answer this according to how i would react. Of course I can't speak for all ISTJs.\n\n1) I would probably want you to calm down lol. No reason to talk to me 1000 miles per hour. Although this is just an assumption. You could be really calm. It is probably ideal for you to start the conversation because the istj might never will.\n\n2) not necessarily as long as it's not just super useless info. Usually I'm open to stuff like this.\n\n3) I'd probably enjoy that thoroughly. I always find myself wanting to go on and on about things I'm educated in.\n\n4) I think the best way to break the ice with me would be to just find common ground. Otherwise I will have very little interest in what you are saying.
3	Some good insight here already, so a couple tips. First and foremost, if you want to start a conversation, don't interrupt them while they're working/studying or of they appear to be in a hurry going someplace. Headphones on? Come back later. I can't stand it when coworkers roll up to my desk and start chitchatting without taking into consideration my time. Find me in the break or lunch room!\n\nOn your list, # 3 would be a good ice breaker. Ask me for help, and I'd be happy to lend my expertise. Even better, show genuine appreciation for the advice and I will warm up to you. Just don't make every convo an ask me for advice session, it gets boring and I will assume you're just trying to use me for easy answers. Instead, move on to chitchat and more personal topics. Slowly of course. \n\nLastly, be cognizant of introvert signals that they're getting overwhelmed or are done with the conversation. We might stop responding beyond one word answers, get fidgety, stop making eye contact, even look or move towards an exit. And please don't take it personally!!    
3	1) I'll keep some distance at first, try to avoid getting personal quickly and give me some time to warm up to you.\n\n2) That's okay, I don't mind just listening. Try to pause once in a while to allow me to think/speak. Avoid interrupting if I'm in the middle of doing something (text/messaging is ok).\n\n3) I'm cool with that. Preferably it goes both ways so we can learn from each other\n\n4) Being sincere, as well as follow through if you say something. Suggest and schedule an event/activity that we can both enjoy together.
3	>1.) How do you feel when a really outgoing extrovert initiates a conversation with you?\n\nDepends on the person and the conversation.\n\nCompletely random stranger?  "Who TF are you and Why TF are you talking to me?"\n\nAcquaintance that I only kind of know?  Really depends on the conversation and whatever opinion I've formed about you already.  If I actively dislike you, the conversation had better be about work, and it had better be short.  Otherwise, work or a mutual interest is fine, but please minimize the small talk, and please, *please* do not dump verbal your diarrhea on me.\n\nReally, though, just read the social cues (because you're almost definitely better at that than I am) and politely check out of the conversation at the right time.\n\n>2.) Do you get annoyed when someone tells you or shares to you random stories about their day?\n\nYes.\n\nIf you're a friend or a family member I'm still talking to, I'll tolerate this to a degree, and more so if the stories are interesting.  If you're a random stranger or a mild acquaintance, do not do this unless you want me to start actively disliking you.\n\n>3.) If I always ask tips and advices from you about a certain field that you know about, how would you feel about it?\n\nIf you're actually going to listen to the tips and advice and employ them where they're relevant, then ask away.  If you're just doing it to make conversation, please, don't.\n\n>4.) Any other tips you can share to break the cold and icy exterior so I’ll be let in his circle/comfort zone?\n\nPropinquity?\n\nSeriously, though, do the two of you already get along?\n\nIf so, approach him at a time when you're not interrupting and say "Hey, we get along fairly well and I would like to hang out more and see if we could maybe be friends.  If you don't want to, that's fine, too.  Just think about it and let me know, either way."  Then give him your phone number and/or email address so he can contact you.  If you do this, be willing to take "no" for an answer.
2	1.) How do you feel when a really outgoing extrovert initiates a conversation with you?\n\nIt depends on my mood.  If I'm at work, I'm probably trying to get something done so I'll get mildly annoyed at the interruption if I don't realize that the person is just trying to be friends.  If it's out with my friends somewhere, I don't mind at all!  I have a habit of getting lost in my thoughts though so I prefer if someone starts a conversation when I'm already talking to people.\n\n2.) Do you get annoyed when someone tells you or shares to you random stories about their day?\n\nSame as above, it depends on what I'm doing.  If I'm in the middle of something, I'll be a bit annoyed and wonder why they're sharing random stories.  A good way to get around this is keep it short and relevant to my interests (I'll happily get sidetracked talking about things I like).  For example, "Man, I was playing PUBG this weekend and got wrecked by noobs with shotguns".  ("Oh, you play PUBG, too? bla bla bla)\n\n3.) If I always ask tips and advices from you about a certain field that you know about, how would you feel about it?\n\nI'd love it!  I think this is actually something ISTJs are characteristically known for liking to give out advice to people.\n\n4.) Any other tips you can share to break the cold and icy exterior so I’ll be let in his circle/comfort zone?\n\nGive us space and show that you're willing to hang out on our terms.  That gives us time to warm up to a new person.\n
6	Okay. I can't pick myself up.	I can't raise myself from this sadness. I can't power through. Logically, I know what to do: distract myself. But, I'm too emotionally crippled to function. \n\nI have a school report due tomorrow, but I can't even pick the pen up. I just want to vent and waste my time on the internet as I wait for the pain to pass.\n\nI don't think I have the energy to show up for school tomorrow. I'm a top student, so this hurts more, but I just don't have the energy. I don't even have appetite. I want nothing but her.
7	It's ok to pine after people. That's normal.\n\nBut if you want to be the kind of person that she is, you need to take care of your shit.\n\nYou may not be that person right now; I don't know. But whether you are that person now, or you want to be, the path includes taking care of your shit.\n\nYou can write that report in a half hour. Step to it. Close reddit and start right now.\n\nNot in five minutes, no more e-mail, no more social media. Minimize this window, open a new one, nothing but the report work, and get it done. You're making a deposit that tomorrow you will withdraw. Do it for that guy, so that he has a better night that you are.
3	You need hugs and some adventure 
-8	[deleted]
5	How do you handle devastating emotional stress?	Something devastating like a breakup, a death of a loved one, a betrayal, etc.
8	Keep busy. Work. A lot. But if the stress came from work, then take a break (or meditate if that helps).\n
5	Lock myself away into loneliness to process emotions. 
5	I usually need a decent amount of private time to process the emotions and come to terms with the loss/situation. Crying and journaling were important to me after a break up (even though I ended the relationship). It also helps me to read articles or blogs or reddit posts about how other people deal with that specific kind of stress. I've recently gotten into the Dear Sugar podcast; that's a treasure trove of anonymous letters from people dealing with trauma followed by advice and discussion with experts.\n\nEdit to add: I tend to get into a rut of thinking about the stress; might not be able to stop crying. In those situations I need a distraction like a book or TV show.
2	Avoidance and escapism.
1	When my grandma died when I was 14 (21 now) all I wanted to do was go back to bed (it was 1 or 2 in the morning when my mom told me). I woke up a few hours later and acted like nothing had happened. It didn't affect me at all. I had more emotion when my dog died last August (tears in my eyes, but not really much crying), and a hell of a lot more crying when I'm on my period and I'm watching sad dog videos. Stupid hormones and stupid emotions. They're worthless. If there was a way to get rid of them altogether I would. 
7	How perfectionist are you?	Just a stupid question I thought to ask. I know not all of you are perfectionists, but lets say you got a smudge on a final draft of a  school research paper that is unremovable. Is this significantly bothering to you? Tell me things you'd rather have happen to you than this. I've been dating an istj for 8 and a half months and she can barely handle anything out of place if she doesn't block it out.
8	bugs the hell out of me. makes me extremely stressed, and regretful at having made the mistake in the moment, and later when i think about it. "how could I have been so stupid to have made this mistake? why didn't i see this before?" depending on the effort and weight of the assignment, it can stay with me for a week or two or even months before it just sits in my subconscious. perfectionism could be a result of things other than personality, e.g. childhood emotional neglect. \n\ni would rather start an entirely new paper with the same or greater amount of effort to prove a point to myself and whomever sees it that i can do better and can fix/recognize the mistake as opposed to getting a good or decent grade, not having to do extra work, but looking like a complete fool because the mistake just reflects so poorly on me in my mind.\n\nwhat else can u say about your gf?
3	I get significantly irritated at minor imperfections.  In fact, I probably rewrite most comments at least twice in order to get them "right".\n\nRoad rage is the worst because it's nothing but randos being really inefficient in their driving choices and getting in the way of my over-strategic efficient driving plan.
2	Being bothered wouldn't magically remove that smudge. I'd rather think about reprinting the entire thing so I can discard the smudged paper.\n\nWhen commenting/posting/chatting online... I rewrite what I type very often in the name of minimalism.
1	Perfectionist at heart, but there's sometimes where I'll just tell myself 'fuck it' and just try my best to ignore whatever flaw/imperfection something is gonna have. No doubt however, whatever I let go is gonna be on my mind for a long while and I'll mull over what I could have done to do it better. 
4	How do I get organized / be more conscientous	A bit of a foreward; I have spent the majority of my life being lazy. This might be uncommon, but there's a plethora of reasons for it. I didn't have any direction in life, was raised suboptimally and suffered from self imposed social isolation, drug addiction, and depression and anxiety since my early teenage years. Most of which I still struggle with today. Formally, I would test as an INTP/INTJ and was satisfied with that at the time. \n\nMy life has undergone some rapid changes however. I live in a new city and have a new job in a kitchen. I actually like the job because it's very organized and every single thing is done step by step with only the faintest hint of variety (can u make my pasta with this instead of this pls?). My workplace habits is very much of what I identify most with the ISTJ type. \n\nI've struggled greatly with "sorting myself out" in the past. The amount of schedules, lists and journals I have made when feeling "up" only to later discard and never follow is tremendous. I have an inability to follow through. I have no formal education on paper at least, which heavily limits my career choices. That's why I have been considering sticking with this new lotchen job, it allows me to make use of some of my strengths while still being moderately enjoyable.\n\nBut back to my question, is how do I go from zero to hero? I have a huge number of things that need to get done and problems that need solving that I'm completely overwhelmed in starting and planning. It a hard to even phrase this question properly.\n\nI'm looking for resources on how to increase conscientousness mainly. I know to accomplish anything I need a routine but it's just so damn hard to get from where I am in life now / who I Am to where and what I want to be.\n\nI need to lose weight (I'm over 300 pounds)\nI need to quit smoking (both cigarettes and weed are holding me back)\nI need to improve my mental health but have no idea where to start (I hardly left my bedroom for nearly all my teenage years, socializing issues, anxiety issues and a lack of a clear identity or purpose in life or set goals)\nI have a job (they keep telling me I'm an excellent trainee with potential but I feel like I should be doing more and better.... I really have no fucking idea what I would do without this job. It's be back sitting at home doing nothing buttoning and wasting my life away....)\n\nThat's not all either, but it's a good start of what a list could theoretically be. \n\nThe big frightening realization of true isolated adulthood is starting to slap me in the face. I have bills to pay and responsibilities and I can't even take the initiative to solve my own shit. It's a problem for sure.\n\nThat's why I am asking you fellow ISTJs a very complex yet simple question:\n\nHow do I go about structuring and organizing my life to get my life together?\n\nThanks 
2	I can't tell if you've seen any of Jordan Peterson's lectures on YouTube or not because the language you use in this post is very similar to the language he uses. His big spiel is telling people to start building a better life by first cleaning their room. In fact, he specifically talks about helping people who were not raised correctly (ie, no sense of responsibility) and suffer drug abuse and motivational problems.\n\nSo maybe you should look up his lectures on YouTube and/or get his book 12 Rules For Life: An Antidote to Chaos.  Anything I'd suggest would be better covered by Peterson. 
2	Take it one day at a time pick one thing to focus on that day and try to do that one thing for a month, then add another thing, then another thing.  I was in kind of the same boat just lazy, depressed, and making poor choices.  I started with talking to my Dr. about getting on an antidepressant,  I was only on it for 3-5 months but it did help get me out of my funk.  Then I started with the smoking got a vape.  I still use it but I'm on 0 nicotine 'juice'.  Then I focused on diet, I highly recommend the keto diet (/r/keto /r/xxketo are great resources) I started May 2017 and I'm down 47 lbs.  I started taking my dogs for walks twice a week when the weather is nice, it was a good relaxing exercise.  With the weight loss came increased energy so when I come home I don't instantly just plop on the couch or at the computer, I do a quick pick up of the house, fix dinner, and actually clean up after dinner.  Mint /r/mintuit has helped me focus on my finances.  It won't be an instant "all things are going to be great starting today" thing just take it one day at a time it might take a year or two but don't give up and know you are worth it.
2	Seconding the recommendation for a keto diet. So may things about your post resonated with me - in particular I want to point out that on a keto diet I not only lost weight & had more energy, I was able to sleep better, woke up alert and could focus my mental energy in a way I never could just in the weeks and months before I started keto. \n\nSeriously. For me, keto was the beginning of a great time in my life. I felt like once the weight started dropping off I could move on with other things I wanted to accomplish. Anxiety, stress and most of all inability to focus and awful irritability around my husband and kids - vanished. I feel like I'm making this up just reading my own words. \n\nAnyhow. My suggestion is purely anecdotal because it's what worked for me. I love to-do lists and daily task lists and that sort of thing, but they used to overwhelm me so I understand where you're coming from with not knowing where to start. Good luck to you!
8	ISTJs, how do you experience breakups?	How do you experience them, and what do you do to get over them? 
8	Well I broke up with my gf last. So I have sad for a bit then had moments of regret but ultimately it was the right thing and now I'm happier I'd say.
10	It's either a 'Thank goodness that's over' and then it I'll go have a nice dinner and movie alone, and enjoy the solitude, or I'll feel absolutely wracked with pain and I'll really reflect and then take time to myself. My last break-up, I shaved my head, deactivated my social media accounts and then went on a dating/sex fast while I healed emotionally. 
7	The last time I went through a break-up, I took around a month to get over it. I was a little depressed. Mostly stayed at home, spent a lot of time alone. Listened to some music, read some books, played games, etc. Eventually I was just able to clear my head about everything and moved on. 
4	I get very sad like most people and need time to heal.
5	I'm not sure yet. No relationships to be broken.
3	Most of my breakups needed to happen so while I feel sad initially I typically recover quickly by enjoying alone time again while looking forward to improving on what didn't work.
3	Devastating. You might know logically it's for the better, that you'll get over it soon, that breakups are normal, that there are plethora of women out there, and whatever rationalization, but it will not help. It will still hurt. \n\nYour mind knows what to do, but you're too emotionally crippled to do it. As time passes, your logic slowly triumphs over your emotions and you'll eventually be back to your old self.
1	Don't ask. Still struggling.
2	ISTJ, what to you is a good apology.	I owe my ISTJ guy an apology, we both messed up but I am mostly to blame. Things got complicated and miscommunicated and now we are in limbo, and I want to prove to him that I regret it all. I usually am an emotional person (ENFJ here) and I know that route may not work best. \n\nany advice on what are the best apologies you've received or if someone you were dating hit a gray area, how would you like it to be dealt with?
13	Be clear, honest, and sincere. Take accountability for your actions. Make a commitment to change your behavior in the future. Accountability and willingness to make changes are the two things I need out of an apology. 
4	I hate backhanded apologies along the lines of, "I'm sorry you got mad at what I did."  Saying that what they did wasn't the problem, the problem was I got mad at it.  A good apology is stating what they did was wrong and that they hope to not do it again in the future.
4	I broke up with my bf (an ISTJ) once over something ridiculous, and I came to my senses a few days later. He was somewhat reticent to sit down and talk after two days, but he finally agreed to listen. I offered a reason why I did it, I admitted that it was a mistake, and I offered him a solution to the problem (better communication in person and less through text). We both cried a bit, but then I made him laugh by telling him how miserable I was the two days we were apart. The laughter kind of sealed the reparations and I knew we would be okay from that point. Good luck! I think people have given you some good advice! 
3	Make yourself accountable and promise to avoid the same mistake in the future. Do it in person, too.
1	Same situation now:( hugs need help too. 
13	Why is this sub not very active?	
61	Because we're all introverts and we don't do small talk?
34	Because none of us have anything to say. Once you understand it there's only so much to discuss about MBTI. These days the sub is mostly questions and answers about alternate perspectives, which is good, I think.
17	We are ISTJs so any post is with the purpose of information exchange
14	Because we are introverts lol. 
12	 Too many of our type-mates still think they're INTJs?
7	Ya'll too busy actually accomplishing things in life or something like that.
3	Our type is more likely to rebuff the validity of MBTI\n\nPlus we're not very talkative types.
2	The nature of this subreddit doesnt encourage a high amount of \n posts because theres no new things related to it, the topic has already been exlored plenty. If you have a question or something to discuss, its probably been posted before. The second reason would be the low amount of subcribers due to the type.
1	Here's a topic for discussion (which has probably already been beaten to death but here goes): what are some major differences between INTJs and ISTJs? I've tested as both and want to figure it out. 
1	because you don't get as hung up on your types as an IxFP or other types would? \nMy husband only knows he is an ISTJ because his aunt had us all take the Myers-Briggs last time we visited. I've joined several IxFP groups to make connections/know I'm not alone/make sense of my worldview. There are 40k people on the INFP subreddit and 183 members currently online lol. \nOn the other side of things, my husband joins groups to gain information he doesn't already know, like politics or how to achieve goals on a game. He's not very introspective at all. And that seems to be a common ISTJ thread. Perhaps it's the T of ISTJ? I see your flair mentions you're ISxJ so you also have a fairly equal sense of Feeling?
1	I love it
-1	Si doms generally don’t care that much about the MBTI so its pretty normal
2	Am I really ISTJ though?	I have periods of sadness and emotion processing (currently experiencing a turbulent love/hate feeling towards someone I like very much) and during those I'm 90% certain I'm ISFJ.\n\nOtherwise when I'm not hurt or falling into emotional attachment towards a person, I'm an ISTJ who finds the depressed and lonely pathetic af. But, emotional attachment, which has happened twice to me already (this being the second), is *not* an ISTJ thing, right? If I'm ISTJ, I shouldn't have that trait in the first place, nor should I find it hard to detach myself from someone when it's causing me more pain than fulfilment? But, in the first place, an ISTJ *just doesn't* have emotional attachments, right? Right?\n\nLogically, I know what to do. But, I don't have the emotional strength to do it.\n\nSo... I can't decide. Really, what am I? Where am I mistaken?
9	You *do* know that we're not emotionless robots, right?\n\nWe tend to suck at processing emotional stuff, but we have emotions, and we develop emotional attachments.
2	Actually it's kinda the opposite. ISFJs are feelers and feelers are actually better (generally) at handling emotional attachment. As a thinker, you would typically have more difficulty. Especially with Fi in your tertiary spot. 
1	I was convinced I was ISTJ but joined the ISFJ camp after my friends told me I displayed too much extroverted feeling. So you have to decide whether you use extroverted or introverted feeling and extroverted or introverted feeling. Try the type in mind site for type descriptions by cognitive function. https://www.typeinmind.com/site/
1	You do have fi as your tertiary function. Depends on how old you are and how developed your personality is. You probably can access your introverted feeling when you need to but it's not your strength. Introverted feeling is less about emotions and more about what you value. Istjs can also fall into si-fi loops when they don't engage TE.
11	How accurate would you say this article is about ISTJs?	Hi fellow ISTJs!\n\nI stumbled across this article earlier today, titled "6 Things That Happen When an ISTJ Falls for You." https://introvertdear.com/news/istj-falls-for-you/\n\nI wasn't expecting much, but I was surprised at how accurate the six points were to my personal life. However, I'm curious as to what other ISTJs think about the article.
2	5.5/6 this is me. Exactly me as I'm pursuing this one girl I've known for 2 years. The last point is kinda hit/miss for me personally. 
2	I’m dating an ISTJ, and these all ring true for me. When we first met, he actually took notes in his phone about me...where I grew up, the names and ages of my kids, birthdays, etc. I thought it was a little weird but cute at the time. It showed be cared. Now that we’ve been together for two years, I definitely have seen more of his personality to verify that he’s definitely a textbook ISTJ 
2	Okay...  I'm too soft, dependent, attached, and invest too much. I spend a good deal of information gathering and logically understanding the other person's personality and thought process, but beyond that I'm emotionally defenseless and pathetic. I basically go "notice me, senpai". They're literally Kryptonite to me.\n\nPossibility I'm actually ISFJ just increased.
2	6/6. Just ask me to write the article next time!
2	Yes, I agree with this article. I've been with my GF for 4 years now. I need to see an end goal, I need to know that I'm not wasting my time on a fruitless journey to nowhere with someone. I was single for 10 years before her (being single is fun) and I'm so happy. Being with someone who has their own life and friends, but shares and understands my personal values is all important to me. It's nice that we're on the same page.  No regrets or hang ups. I'm marrying this woman.\n\nEdit: fixed a typo.
2	Yeah, this is pretty spot on. I particularly laughed at:\n\n> Okay, so it’s not all logic. You have to be attractive from at least six different angles. We are sensors, after all.\n\nThis is so hilariously true. Ugh. I wish I could lower my standards for looks. 
5	Difficulty articulating thoughts - an ISTJ thing?	I recently described the president of my country as, "having the vision, drive, and philosophy of a king, but a mouth and methodology of a barbarian." But, if you ask how I came to that opinion - I wouldn't have an answer.\n\nThings may make perfect sense within my own internal thinking, but if others can't understand it themselves, then I can't explain it for them.\n\nAnyone else? If so, how do you get around this?
3	I'm not sure if it is an ISTJ thing, but I know for a fact that it applies to me. The way I get around it is by planning out every possible scenario of any possible conversation that I could have ahead of time.
1	Yes, that's why I usually don't talk much. "It is better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid than to open it and remove all doubt".  I know, for example, A=E but I can't explain steps B-D for how I got there.  It's very frustrating.  Just know I'm right and trust I'm right! lol
7	Good romantic matches for ISTJ men?	**What types do you think are good relationship matches for ISTJ men? Or, what traits would an ideal match have?**\n\nFor example, I've seen the INFP female + ISTJ male pairing happening often and I wonder how common it is and if it works well.
10	Yes continue liking INFPs please thx
6	I am married to an INFJ and so far so good. I keep her feet on the ground and she keeps my eyes on the horizon.
6	I keep reading about ENFP women with ISTJ men (as my partner and I are both opposites)  but I rarely see our partnership up there (f: ISTJ m: ENFP). So possibly the ENFP woman to the ISTJ male works?\n(Sounds strange but it works for us)
7	INFP female here in a loving relationship with an ISTJ male. \n\nAt best, we balance each other out. ISTJs help keep us grounded in our emotional lives and we INFPs help them grow in theirs.  They are strong in our weak parts and vice versa. \n\nAt worst it’s like we’re from other planets. \n\nI wouldn’t trade my ISTJ for the world. He is meticulous in his care of me.  He spends a lot of time making sure I’m safe and provided for. He shows his love by doing things for me. He once spent three days detailing my car. If I have an appliance that needs replaced, he spends days researching the specs on all the new models to make sure I’m getting the best thing possible. \n\nI wouldn’t trade any of that for all the spontaneous sex in the world. Seriously though, sex with an istj is pretty much at the same time on Tuesday and Sunday and sometimes on Saturday. 
6	As an ENFJ, I crush pretty hard on guy ISTJs. But maybe that's just me. 
4	I’m a female INFP in a relationship with a male ISTJ. There are times when there is a disconnect in communication, and it almost always stems from me not giving him the correct type or amount of information he is seeking. Other than that, we have a really awesome relationship. We have so much fun together, and we don’t have to force the other person to go out and do stuff because we are both happy staying in most of the time. 
2	My wife is an ESTJ and we are a fantastic match. We both plan, analyze and research just about everything we do, but she's much better at translating things into action. She also understands and respects my limits/rules as far as being introverted, so I fully trust her in to not push me too far in social settings. Think we're great together!\n
2	I've been seeing an ESTP and we just clicked.\nYMMV, of course.
2	> For example, I've seen the INFP female + ISTJ male pairing happening often and I wonder how common it is and if it works well.\n\nHaha, I've observed this too! You are not alone. It's not surprising though, I've met several INFP women and there was the common denominator of easy communication and mutual understanding. No wonder this pairing would happen often. And the fact that they need the same amount of time to recharge as we do is very refreshing, draining eachother is prevented this way.
2	My husband is an ISTJ, and I'm an INTP. We get along wonderfully. the marriage started out great, and has gotten better every year, going on ten years now. We're good collaborators, listen to each other well, respect our differences. Even though we're both introverts, we're good communicators and really like spending time together. We take excellent care of each other and we both dislike drama and place a high value on intellectualism and logic, even though we come at it from different sides. 
1	Commenting for research purposes\n\nAlso, mistyping myself as INTJ may explain why I never matched well with my supposed "best partner types"
6	Weekly Thread: What personality traits do you think can be learned and what are inherent?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's question is: what traits (openness, agreeableness, aggression) do you think people can learn or change about themselves, and which ones are people born with?
9	I think openness can definitely be learned. An easy example is the gay movement. Look at how many people are open to it now vs even 10 years ago.\n\nAggression is something I don't think can be learned. If so, please tell me haha. As a guy, it seems I'm in the small minority of guys that aren't aggressive. Maybe it's cause I'm a pretty big guy and thus people are intimated or whatever, but I've never had a reason to be aggressive. 
4	>Weekly Thread\n\n>Posted by [u/Rawtoast24](https://www.reddit.com/user/Rawtoast24) [3 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/7s2v9l/weekly_thread_what_personality_traits_do_you/)
4	How to kick an ISTJ in the pants?	ENFJ (Female) here wondering how to let an ISTJ (Male) know that he needs to grow up and do something with his life. He isn't planning for the future at all.\n\nWe really like each other and I feel we could be more. But I cannot be with a dude who spends his days gaming and doing nothing.\n\nI want to try to give him the kick in the pants he needs but I want it to be done in a way he will understand and in a way he still knows I really care for him.\n\nSo ISTJs— how would you prefer being kicked in the pants? 
20	As an ISTJ female this is atypical ISTJ behavior. Sounds more like depression than a personality trait. 
5	My bf is an ISTJ and similarly often in need of a kick to get him going, whether it is job hunting or just leaving the house to go to the store. I’m an INFP and grew up in a nagging house, so I usually try not to say anything because I don’t want to upset him or be a nag. I asked him a few weeks ago how I can help him and explained my hesitance to say much. He told me that it would help him if I gave him reminders that he said he was going to do something. So that’s kind of what I have been doing. “Hey honey, did you happen to call the doctor to make an appointment? No? Oh okay, just checking since I know you said you needed to do that.” Or I will actually text him, “Hey! Don’t forget to call the doctor today.” 
3	This sounds like a weakened ISTJ who should be crying for help but isn't. Seems like he's going through something. Get that out of the way first.
2	Are you talking about me right now?? Lol
2	me, an ENFJ female, who is also having issues with an ISTJ male not growing up....... what is with them? I feel thats so against their type? From my understanding of my go, its emotional, and like deep rooted and shoved away in a deep dark closet. I would just voice your concern and try to be supportive and help him talk through it. 
2	Maybe he does have a plan for the future, but he is just lazy or is having trouble starting. Or, he does have a plan for the future and is just waiting for something to happen first (This might be the truth or an excuse to continue to be lazy.)
2	If the dude likes gaming more than he likes you then theres nothing you can do hehehe, unless you get into gaming and play with him! now he will absolutely adore you even more for that, beleive me\n\nand how other people say here, its very possible hes going to something and that gaming is an escape from life, just interrogate him slowly without pushing his buttons too much, find out whats going on
2	Don't try to kick him in the ne or ni. He might run back to his closest . Istj loves comfort and familiarity, most of them I have met are like sloths who just sit at where they  are and do and say stuff they have always told  and did. Something extreme has to happen in his life to force his mind to notice Ne ( slacking off in life ) that he will chnage his Si( slacking off ) untill then you can't move him an inch. Istjs are the most incompetent types that would give up so easily or fear change or new things always . 
4	ISTJ and directness	So i was reading another post that many of you said that you aren't good with hints... \n\nI've been talking to this ISTJ for a while now, and weve hung out a few times (one particular 26hr hangout at his place last weekend) and my roommate was out of town so i said he should come over to keep me company, and we were gonna go to dinner and all this. \n\nHe ended up rescheduling for whatever reason and one of the reasons is that he'd have to drive home/feel rushed, and i so i told him i would have told him to stay over. Thus him saying he didnt know that was being relayed... to which i thought my invite kinda insinuated it... aka big communication issue. which i admit. \n\nTLDR; how do you guys perfer to dealt with this? Im an ENFJ female, and im trying to be lady like here but... any advice on how you guys find its easiest to be in situations like this? what kinda communication do you/want need? also, knowing im E and hes I, im trying to also give him his space/quiet time.\n\nalso, if youve ever been with an ENFJ like me id love to hear bout it.\n\n\nThank you 10000x in advance, y'all hard to understand 
12	I like hearing absolutely every detail come from your mouth/text etc. I don't know if this is for all ISTJ's but I really dislike inconveniencing people and I preemptively assume that if you haven't mentioned it that it wasn't an offer on the table. \nISTJ's prefer absolute communication. Directness and openness is key. He may still be feeling a little awkward and vulnerable so he wouldn't ask if he could stay over. Also he might have thought this would be too forward given your relationship is fairly new. 
8	I never pick up on hints in any way. When I do, I'm not sure if they did it on purpose or not. I like it when people tell me what they mean with words xD
7	My bf is an ISTJ, and I am an INFP. I have learned over the years that I have to be very explicit with everything I say because he won’t assume anything. My explanations always have to be very detailed and contain all of the possible information. It can be annoying at times, to be honest, because my brain doesn’t work that way, but I’ve leaned to deal with it (and he’s totally worth the extra effort).
5	I'm confused.  Or, I think I'm confused.\n\n>He ended up rescheduling for whatever reason and one of the reasons is that he'd have to drive home/feel rushed,\n\nI'm on board up to here.\n\n>and i so i told him i would have told him to stay over. \n\nAs in "your initial intention was for him to spend the night," or "your response to his reason for hesitation was for him to spend the night"?\n\nIf the former, then yeah, there's insufficient information in what you've told us for that conclusion to be definitively drawn.  Maybe he could have guessed at it, but if so, I'm guessing he wrote it off as wishful thinking, over thinking, or something similar.\n\nIf the latter, then, well, that's a wild leap to expect him to make.\n\nSo, *if* I understand your intent correctly, what you should have said is "Hey, my roommate's out of town.  You should come over.  We'll grab dinner, have sex, go to sleep, wake up, have more sex, and hang out."
3	Interested to know if it was a work night. I have rescheduled with exes over staying at theirs as I can't be rushing home and/or messing up my routine. :) 
2	Engaged to an ENFP. Gotta be blunt bro. He says to me ‘what you said then was mean’ and then I know and try to do better. I just can’t pick up on the subtlety. \nJust explain you like him. When we started dating I said ‘what are we doing?’ and he said ‘being blunt I want to be your boyfriend and I want you to be my girlfriend’. 
10	How knowing I am ISTJ helped in rehab.	Two weeks ago I fell and thought I broke my hip.  Luckily, it is just a very bad sprain but I am in rehab for care and therapy.\n\n\nIn the past when new things were thrown at me without details, I would have a panic attack.  This time, I was able to recognize that my mind wanted the details immediately.  \n\nYesterday, they wanted to take me to the shower room.  Being a very large, injured, modest woman, my first instinct is to panic.  Instead, I asked for the step by step procedures to transfers etc.  Panic gone.  Shower taken.  Thanks to recognizing my ISTJ and working with it rather than against it.\n
2	You applied your knowledge of Myers and Briggs. Good job! Thumbs up times 7 and some.
4	I (ENFP Male) made out with one of you (ISTJ Female) during a bad breakup	Hello! (:\n\nWould love some advice from all of you.\n\nMy friend's roommate (ISTJ Female) was engaged after 2 years, and they broke up. It was awful for her. She was, and is very conservative. She never drank or got drunk, she's never been to a bar or club. After this awful breakup, she's been wanting to go out, wanting to drink. And this isn't all the time, just when the occasion comes up, she's totally in.\n\nOkay, so, one night we were staying in and drinking, and her and I end up making out for a while. It was great. She kind of freaked out in the morning though, and it hasn't been 100% normal since. Like she's friendly and acts normal, but I can tell she isn't 100%.\n\nSo, I'm an ENFP, I can make out with people, it's no big deal. I just enjoy the closeness/intimacy/connection. So, I didn't want to date her. I think she thinks I wanted to date her, cause she told me she wasn't interested (lol neither am I?!), and maybe still thinks I'm interested.\n\nJust wanted to know your thoughts and how to proceed. This happened a month ago, she's my best friend's roommate, so I see her constantly. I want to give her what she wants and needs, I have no agenda or goal, just to make her life better. Let me know your thoughts, and thank you.
2	train wreck of a post.\n\nas always, just be direct with your thoughts and feelings towards her and go from there, i don't quite know what you actually want from this post or from her for that matter, but just communicate directly and you'll be golden.\n\ngl
2	Does anyone else have "productive" coping methods	I've been going through some rough times lately and have been feeling under the weather. When I come home from work all I want to do is plan my retirement. (I'm in my early 20s and am still in school lol). \n\nMy friends have been trying to get me to grab food and go to bars but I just really want to stay home and look into earning extra passive income for retirement. It's really silly when I think about it but it just makes me feel comfortable. \n\nI didn't even realise that this might be my coping mechanism until recently I was  reminded of my response to another rough patch I went through in high school. My response then was to put my head down and study really hard. \n\nMy explanation for these "productive" coping mechanisms is that when I feel sad and tired, I need to "recharge" energy by being alone for a bit. As for all the studying/planning, I suppose it brings me comfort to know that I'm being productive? \n\nJust wondering if anyone else here has any strange stories or coping mechanisms to share?
3	Usually, stress affects me in two ways.\n\n1)I hunker down and push through. Similar to your description, but I guess I don't stress about the same things as you, so facing my stresses is both the coping and the solution to the stress.\n\n2)I completely shut down. This has only happened to me a few times in my life, but when the stress reaches some sort of critical mass, I turn off my brain and ignore the existence of my problems. I recognize this as hazardous so I mostly avoid this mechanism.\n\nDon't let other peoples norms make you think that the way you cope is any less effective. If you know it works, then why try to fix it?
2	This sounds normal. I think I handle things similarly. Usually I get stressed when I have a lot at my plate at work and home. Well I just makes lists, get one thing done at a time and do work. Being productive helps me feel better.\n\nOn another note if you want to plan your retirement already you should look into an app called robinhood. Its a brokerage app that allows free trades and stuff. It's beginner friendly. And if you sign up using my code we both get a free stock.
2	Some questions for you ISTJs	ENFJ (Female) here!\n\nQuestion number one: how do you prefer a Feeler like myself, convey emotions and feelings to you ISTJs?\n\nQuestion number two: how can I best show I care about an ISTJ? \n\nQuestion number three: how tired do you get of people coming into your sub Reddit asking questions like mine? \n\n\n\n
5	Disclaimer... I always test as an ISTJ but I strongly associate with INTJs.\n\n1) I view everything from a very logical/practical viewpoint. My wife (INTJ) has said that being direct, using "I" statements, and not adding any unnecessary drama has helped with our communication.\n\n2) My wife said she is still trying to figure this one out after 14+ years... I think the answer to this will be different for each individual person. If you are serious about someone maybe look into something like the "5 Love Languages" book.\n\nI don't actually like any of those books but they can give you a general idea of someone prioritizes different actions.\n\n3) I guess I don't pay that much attention to this sub as this is the first one I've noticed.
7	1) Tell us directly. I don't accept hints, even if I think I know that someone is hinting, I don't act upon anything until they tell me straight up.\n\n2)Be there. Be physically present. Just don't force yourself into our space. Giving up time to be around me shows me that you don't mind being around me, which is a good start.\n\n3) I don't mind that much. It's a good way to put my abstract thought into words.
6	I swear I’m not a mama’s boy or anything, but both my parents (mostly my mom) are feelers and used to have a hard time dealing with the fact that I am not, so all these questions will be answered in terms of my relationship with them. \n\n1) Be literal and direct. We find hints confusing, and personally I won’t even notice if someone is trying to drop hints. According to my parents, I apparently gave off vibes that I was dating my (female) best friend in high school for months without realizing it. We’re so romantically incompatible that we would both find the idea of us dating laughable even if I wasn’t gay- we’re more like brother and sister. That’s not really a direct example, but it shows just how socially oblivious ISTJs can be. Say what you mean, and mean what you say. \n\n2) Show them that you know who they are and appreciate their unique perspective. Help them out with everyday tasks. If you’re going to get a gift, get something that they will use in their everyday life, but nicer than what they’d buy for themself. One of the best gifts I’ve ever gotten is a really nice pen from my dad. It’s not the fanciest or most creative gift, but he knows I like to take notes in gel pen so it was very practical- and I’m still using it two years later, which is more than I can say for most other things I’ve gotten as presents. Otherwise, get or do something with sentimental value to them. I don’t know how better to explain this kind of stuff than with examples, so I’ll talk about my favorite Christmas present this year: it was also from my parents, and it was DVD’s of Fiddler on the Roof and Les Miserables. Fiddler was my first Broadway play, and Les Mis was both the first musical that I saw on my own and the first show I ever marched with a marching band. Neither of these gifts were particularly expensive, but *they showed that my parents understand who I am as a person and what I enjoy in my everyday life*, and that is what makes ISTJs feel loved. \n\n3) I don’t. As I said earlier, I had these kinds of issues with both my parents, and it went on for years. My late childhood and early adolescence would have been a lot smoother if my parents knew of a place like this where they could ask these types of questions, free from judgement, and actually get answers- so I try to help others when I can. 
6	Hi there :) I'm strongly ISTJ, with an ENFP partner, hope I can help a little! Although it's probably going to sound a lot like what'a already here\n\n1. I like literal for breakfast, lunch, and tea. I find it easiest to understand when my ENFP starts by stating a basic emotion (e.g. happy, sad, angry), before going into further details. I also really like examples, they help me see the facts of a situation, and if I don't understand the facts, I have serious trouble keeping top with the emotion.\n\n2. I think the above suggestion of the love languages is an excellent one. One thing I will add though is that as introverts, we need quiet time. Type and quantity will vary widely, and it's quite common for an SO to be included in this. My suggestions for quiet time would be either at home or in nature, well away from any crowds. It's fairly individual, but expect for talking to be minimal. Let them lead any conversation, and try to forget the idea of an awkward silence- an ISTJ is often just enjoying the silence!\n\n3. I like distributing knowledge, even if it's just personal experience and preference.
2	1) I don't understand the question lol.\n\n2) I can tell if someone cares if they are there for me. Also it is very nice when someone shows general interest in one of my hobbies whether they have the same hobbies or not. Or if people just do things for me for no reason. Like nice things that I would appreciate.\n\n3) these questions are way better than "hey I'm doing a study on ISTJs please take this survey!"
2	Great advice in this thread so far! I'll contribute as well:\n\n**1)** Don't be afraid to be open and discuss them directly, be as clear as possible. Also, it would be easier without drama. Like they said, examples are always helpful when you are trying to explain an ISTJ something! We make generalizations and arrive to conclusions from sets of concrete data, not the other way around :'D\n\n**2)** Definitely consider his prefered love languages. I would also add:\n\n- Actively listen to him. Fundamental. Show that you value and are interested in his point of view, try to understand him.\n- Take his needs into account. Understand that different kinds of people have different kinds of needs, and take it into account with him; this is greatly appreciated and resembles care and understanding. You could always talk openly about this with him (and that would show care by itself). For example, extroverts seem to have a hard time accepting that most introverts need a great deal of alone time. It's nothing personal (even enjoyable interaction with people can be draining eventually), and it's not a craving! I've had bad experiences with this haha.\n- Contact him first. Normally this shows that he was in your mind, which is noticed and appreciated in the right context.\n- Offer your help. Needed or not, it shows that you are there for him.\n\n**3)** Not only don't mind but I think it's interesting and encourage everyone to ask! It makes you reflect, there are interesting answers and sharing knowledge to help each other is always nice haha
2	> Question number one: how do you prefer a Feeler like myself, convey emotions and feelings to you ISTJs?\n\nBe straightforward and direct, no bullshit, and never make us guess. Whatever it is you feel - inform us, then explain why.\n\n> Question number two: how can I best show I care about an ISTJ?\n\nReciprocate our honesty, transparency, practicality, clarity, and need for alone time. Still depends on the individual though. Ask *your* ISTJ friend this question, not us. That's also a good rule of thumb: when in doubt, **ask**.\n\n> Question number three: how tired do you get of people coming into your sub Reddit asking questions like mine?\n\nSo long as you have an actual purpose behind your questions and not just asking out of curiosity - we're good.

10	Weekly Thread: What do you love about yourself?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's question is: what do you love most about yourself?
15	That I can laugh at just about anything. Many people think I have a very dark sense of humor, and I'd agree, but it brings me great joy to laugh. 
9	I like that I care about details. It's also a fault, and left unchecked can be a hindrance but I love that it comes naturally. Without effort I obsess over minute details because I care about making something as good as it can be. I would much rather people know me as the guy who needs to reign in his perfectionism than the guy who should pay more attention to his work.
5	My intelligence. How I am able to help others by thinking of different methods/outcomes/choices. I'm also quite tech savy so I'm very useful in this tech heavy world.
3	For most things that I care about working on, I can do a damn good job. You need your admissions essay revised? Done. No one is stepping up to lead the group project? I'll do it. Husband is going to be home late from work? That's okay, I already cooked dinner and walked the dog. I may not be the fastest worker, but I'm absolutely thorough when the end product matters or when things need to happen.

3	ENFJ here. AMA.	\n(Edit: Part 2) Need advice on how to be better friends with ISTJs.\n\n(Edit: 2 part post, AMA first.)
8	I don't know much about ENFJs, but probably give the ISTJs space, talk to them as an individual. State things on the more literal side.\n\nAnother one. No false hopes. Keep promises, say things and mean them.
7	It is difficult when I'm approached by the sort of feeler that thinks they are, well, responsible for my feelings. I can feel them putting more and more energy into the interaction, trying to get me to match their excitement. I won't. I can't. It wouldn't be real.\n\nNow that I'm more familiar with mbti I understand that some folks are like that. I don't know what types exactly, but I'm now more familiar with the idea that some people feel together to bond. I don't and don't know how. Please don't try to make me. It won't work. \n\n
6	Hey, female ENFJ here-- one of my best friends is an ISTJ male and we get along just perfectly... except when we don't.\n\nE Vs I \n\nI need to remember his introvert bubble-- meaning he sometimes doesn't want to talk or listen to me talk or have any social interraction whatsoever with me. He needs that bubble to recharge, that's how he gets his energy. He isn't upset or tired or done with me, he just needs his batteries recharged again. \n\nWhen he doesn't need his bubble though he can listen to me for hours talking and chattering. He’s a great, patient listener who doesn't get annoyed with my talking. He likes it. *Probably because that means he doesn't have to talk.*\n\nN Vs S\n\nHe likes tried and true methods and ways. He likes tangible explanations for things. And I get that-- but sometimes I feel he is rather dumb because he can't just *know* or *sense* or *have a feeling* about something. He *has* to have something concrete and real. Which turns out is actually a good way of doing things sometimes. I have examples of why but they are embarassing. For me. \n\nI go by a sixth sense on a lot of stuff. My intuition is pretty smart... most of the time. This can bother him because he *needs* evidence and logical reasoning behind it and 95% of the time I have none. I just *know*. \n\nF Vs T\n\nHe is logical and not emotional or feely. So I can be frustrated sometimes because I feel he is cold, heartless and mean. But really, he is just processing things logically because that's how his brain works. I need to understand that while he does have a heart-- his mind does the decision making. \n\nUnlike my heart which does allllll the decisions. Okay, well not all of them. But a lot. I mean, I have feelings. A lot of them. Emotions. Feelings. I have enough for the both of us.\nSometimes they overwhelm him. Sometimes he gets frustrated because he doesn't understand them. Be ready and willing to explain what your emotions and feelings are, and why you have them. Word. For. Word. Do it and he will have an easier time understanding\n\nJ Vs J\n\nYeah, we are both stubborn, hard-headed, judging people who don’t like to be wrong. \n\nWhen I am right, I know I am right. \nWhen he is right, he knows he is right. \n\nWe will fight it. \n\nIn these moments, clear, calm communication is key. We usually just need to stop and think and try to understand what the *other* person is trying to say. Hear eachother out. Talk it through. \nWe have always worked it out. \n\nI am no MBTI or relationship or people expert. This is just personal experience. Maybe it will help you. \n\nISTJs are some of the most loyal, caring people I have ever met. Don't lose the ISTJ in your life. \n\n\n\n
4	Be honest and straightforward (although this might be a little bit hard for you as you are an F type). Most of ISTJ friendships gradually form through time anyway so you gotta keep up until ISTJ is comfortable and familiar with you around. Just be you, ISTJ can sense if you're faking. 
3	i don't think this qualifies as an ama if we all just simply tell you things
1	My partner is an ENFP. Best thing he does is talk a lot, listens when I say ‘don’t touch me’ and explains his feelings in detail because I do not understand them. \nHe also leaves me alone when I need it which is like at least twice a week. 
1	OK, I have a question for your AMA:\n\nWhy should we help you when you don't seem to understand the difference between "Ask me anything" and "Please give me some advice"?
12	Achiever Strength = Infinite To-Do List?	The last time I posted here [regarding procrastination](https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/7jnhpr/are_istjs_hard_workers_all_the_time_do_you_ever/), I saw that many ISTJs, including myself, seem to be [Achievers](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/552b3ee0e4b016252ff74ac0/55d14faae4b0e9aecb8ad4ea/565c077be4b09e258562663b/1471830447817/Strengthsfinder+Singapore+Strengths+School+Achiever+3.png), i.e. they feel shitty if they don't accomplish *something* every day. I first heard this concept put into words when I took Clifton StrengthsFinder in college. [Achiever Description](http://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/622/achiever.aspx)\n&nbsp;\n\nThis brings me to a follow-up question, does anyone else have a to-do list that feels too long, maybe never-ending?\n&nbsp;\n\nMine is a running list of chores, work tasks, volunteer tasks, personal things I want to do, etc. It's kind of overwhelming sometimes. My INFJ spouse is usually the one to propel me into starting tasks/projects and help me prioritize. It could also be that I feel less motivated and more tired than I was in school, but my list keeps growing. Maybe one day I will complete my to-do list and achieve self-actualization or whatever... and then I'd probably find that I'm still not satisfied and can never truly "retire."
4	My to-do lists rarely get done. If they weren't on my phone, they'd be collecting dust. They are usually quite idealized versions of my day, and are mostly just reminders. If I got the most important things done, good enough. If I didn't, yikes, that bugs the crap out of me. Most days don't even have a list, because I don't do much during the work week while I'm home. Too tired, save it for the weekend. So yeah, you could say it's never ending. I can write all I want on there, but have difficulty being disciplined enough to finish *everything.*
3	I love to do lists but they never end, I just keep adding to them. It’s actually something I’m working on, to be ok having things on the list that don’t get done immediately. I’ve recently compiled to do lists to one location in a bullet journal. My most problematic to do lists aren’t necessary tasks but interests like an infinitely long list of things I want to research, meal ideas, etc. 
3	It’s the only way I can ever accomplish anything at work. It’s the only way I can really motivate myself to do anything. 
4	Weekly Thread: How are you going to make 2018 better than 2017?	Happy new years, and welcome to our weekly thread! This week's question is, what are your plans to make 2018 a great year, even better than last?\n\nProTip: if you're looking to set goals, use the SMART technique. Set goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-oriented.
5	I'm starting a bullet journal. wow. i really belong here 
4	Skip the fast foods stops on my way to and from work. Get off the computer more often.  \n Small steps.
3	See a doctor/physical therapist to rehab injuries in order to get stronger again, as diet and light exercise has helped me lose weight.\n\nDue to health insurance issues, the timeline is based on the date that kicks in, so:\n\n-Within the month, begin seeing a professional, with monthly check-ins for 6 months\n\n-3 months after start, begin going back to the gym\n\n-9 months after start, reevaluate and take appropriate steps for advancement in personal fitness
3	Wife (INTJ) and I are doing monthly planning at beginning of each month. Something we started in late 2017 but will hit each month of 2018. Hoping this helps us avoid things like "can't believe we forgot to get so-and-so a birthday gift!" and helps keep the "little things" spread out between the big picture things so we don't get too compressed in any given week.
1	I'll post my comment from /r/financialindependence:\n\nMy 2017 goals were:\n\n- Graduate from MBA program \n\n- Get a job\n\n- Start paying off my student loans (two loans, one smaller than the other)\n\nResults:\n\n- I graduated in May! (26yrs old)\n\n- Got two jobs actually: I started one in march at around 39k and after 6 months was hired by a better company at 70k/year!\n\n- I paid off one of my loans, and have one left to go at 10k\n\n- I've been going to the gym 5-6 times week for years now so I guess my accomplishment was maintaining the standard.\n\nOther 2017 achievements:\n\n- 4 Month emergency fund\n\n- Positive networth\n\n- Started investing (VTSMX and 401K)\n\n2018 Goals:\n\n- Be debt free\n\n- Hit a 20K+ networth (hopefully more)\n\n- Achieve a 40%+ monthly savings rate, and push forward with FI/RE principles\n\n- Reach a 6 month emergency fund\n\nNone financial goals:\n\n- Hit 160 lbs at a reasonable Bodyfat % (10-13%). Currently 154 lbs at 15% BF.\n\n- Travel outside to a new country (I am thinking Colombia)\n\n- Learn to budget my time
17	How do I explain to my ENFP that right/wrong is more important to me than good/bad or like/dislike?	
4	ENFP's are good at seeing others' perspectives. Try explaining your inner thought process, and also how you feel. Your inner judgement style is different than your ENFP:\n\nRight vs wrong: Ti\n\nLike vs dislike: Fi\n\nMaybe show her with examples how each of you judges a situation differently, and emphasize how this difference is systematic, part of your characters, and therefore not changing. Then you can each compromise a little, communicate a lot, and work things out. Good luck... 
2	ENFP, here.\nI suspect what "your" ENFP is hearing is that your version of right and wrong is the only version that's permissible.\n\nIf that's truly the case, then you need to be willing to part ways, because ENFP's really are intrinsically motivated, and gut-check absolutely everything to coincide with their own version of right and wrong. So the problem isn't that they have no moral guidepost, it's that theirs is different from yours.\n\nI would suggest, instead, if you open the conversation with, "my views of right/wrong are x; what are your views? I hope that we can at least understand each other, and maybe we can find some common ground on which to build."\n\nIn other words: assume the ENFP has a very strong moral compass, and go from there. Example: If they're not finishing tasks, it's not because they don't see commitments as morally binding, it's because of something else. If you make it clear that you need this commitment to be their #1 commitment, they'll do it or die trying (or leave because they know they can't).\n
7	ISTJs, what are your New Year's resolutions?	Since 2018 is almost here, and we work great with lists, plans and schedules: What are your New Year's resolutions, and what are you going to do to achieve them? Now it's the perfect moment to think about it and plan ahead!
17	Learning patience with others.  I used to have a hard time with people being late, taking their time, or slacking off.  It's outta my control and there's nothing I can do about it.  \n\n\nStop worrying and knowing when to say No.  I'm extremely critical of myself and my job performance.  I often work myself to exhaustion because my supervisor knows that I'll get things done... no matter how long I stay at work.\n\n\nNot having an expectation with people.  I often held people to their word or expected them to do things they say they're going to do only to be let down.  I get irritated when someone else doesn't follow through but I have to realize that I can't control everything or anyone but myself - as long as I get my task(s) done... that's all I can do.  I only have two hands.
3	1. Practice guitar and music more. Really, been too lazy over the course of the years. Already been more attentive with the guitar, but actually COMMIT. Make it so i got every scale and note memorized on the back of my hand.\n\n2. Honestly, quit porn. It's psychological junk. Throw it out the window.\n\n(maybe and probably to some degree) 3. Exercise. Hell, maybe even take up some kinda martial arts. Always been a fragile soul. Gotta learn to defend myself. Needa protect my future ENFP waifu.\n\nHow would i achieve them? All three are commitment based. So, get outta my comfort zone and really focus. Easier said than done. If anyone has tips, hmu.
3	Keep reading a lot, do well at school.
1	Patience, in general and and managing money better than I have the past year.
1	To be less of a workaholic 
8	What do you think about?	A friend asked me this question once and I think it can potentially give some insight on one's personality. The question is "If you are not doing something actively, not talking to anyone, and no one is talking to you, what are you usually thinking about?" It's hard to pin this down but I think you can generally find a pattern in your thinking; if you notice one, what is it? For example, I've noticed most of my thought is dedicated to mentally categorizing people, and this was the answer I gave before developing an interest in MBTI. 
6	You nailed it. For you the J for judging. For me, I do a lot of T. I think about the future, the distant future. I plan for tomorrow. I’m thinking about my agendas and what I’m going to worry about and fidgit with or fix next. I must constantly have a stream of shit that needs my mental hashing. I think about taxes, my next career move, what groceries to queue up on my drive home from work, the right age I might want to become a parent, solving code problem (i’m a programmer). My mind is never in the here and now.  My spouse is opposite and lives spontaniously. Live,laugh, love.  \n\nSpiritually though, I do spend time to reflect on myself. For two hours a day, exactly, one in the morning and one in the evening, my hour long commute in traffic in my only bubble of privacy - no work no friends no family. I use that space and time to emote: sing, cry, bitch, argue with my imaginary adversary. Good entertainment if you happen to pass me on the freeway.
5	Similarly to the others, I spend a lot of "free time" thinking about my to do list that I'll need to complete that day, what I'd like to do that day given if I have the time, what I'll eat for dinner, what'll I'll eat for breakfast the next day, etc.\n\nOther than that, rehashing situations, conversations, etc.
4	I think I either think about ideas or things that I want to get done. The other part of the time is nothing... absolutely nothing...just kind of staring into space looking at things.
3	What I need to do next. I'm like a shark when it comes to planning.\n\nBarring that I time travel to watch old memories, refresh fading trivia knowledge I feel slipping away, think about hypothetical responses or I review conversations I just had to review inflection and vocabulary.
3	I'm usually thinking on things I want to get done and how to do them, how to solve problems (of people I care about, my own problems or programming related stuff), how to improve, where life is heading to and what can be done to shape the path to lead it where I want. Thinking and coming to conclusions, explaining things rationally and getting satisfaction from it. Reflecting on memories and past experiences from a mental scrapbook, replaying conversations. Also just not thinking much, purely observing the environment (enjoying landscapes, small details) and observing people as well. It's relaxing and sensory, it allows the mind to rest a bit haha.\n\nThis is triggered if I walk around with music, my mind gets in blank that way. Podcasts/Audiobooks (good ones), on the other hand, activate my mind and put it at full performance, creating the need of taking multiple notes on a piece of paper, google keep or whatever :'D So I choose one or another depending on the mood/energy
1	I really like this question! But I have to say that I feel like my answer will be biased, since most of the time I am not thinking about what I'm thinking-- it's just happening. So the very act of trying to observe myself thinking may not give an accurate representation of what my usual though process actually is.\n\nThat being said, I spend a lot of time doing self reflection, I guess. Which for me basically looks like "internal dialogues". It's hard to explain, but a lot of the time it's me imagining a course of events (could be past, present, or future), and pretty much reviewing what I think about them.\n\nAt the risk of sounding meta, a recurrent "internal dialogue" that I have actually involves me attempting to explain what I think about to an imagined conversation partner who asks me questions.
1	Could be any number of things... food, sex, my future, work, friends, pets, the state of the country, artificial intelligence, thinkgeek's really cool color changing mugs (not an ad i swear), how much I want to travel, the song that's stuck in my head and then whatever tangent that makes me go on... ect.
1	I usually think about how things work, why things happen. If I'm bored I think about it until I get a solid answer, I usually turn out to be right. However, most of the time I'm reading or watching videos on how things work.\n\n  
11	What's your spirit animal?	Hi ISTJ's of Reddit! I was just wondering what you think your spirit animal is. I'm thinking it's most likely a frog, or a badger. Thanks!
20	A cat!  They are self-sufficient, quiet, neat, solitary, can come across as a little cold, like to work alone, and don't suffer fools - clearly ISTJ!
8	[According to this necklace I found, our spirit animal is an ox\n](http://imgur.com/LQxQw8W.jpg)
5	Cat! 
5	my ISTJ sister says cat for sure. Likes comfort/lounging somewhere warm, being alone, or only being around others when she feels like, being independent and self-sufficient.
3	An owl. I'm not sure why though :P\n
3	I've been told, a turtle. And I do love turtles.    \nWhat do I think? Hm ... I'd love for it to be a raven.. hm.
2	I think mine is a Panda. They avoid confrontation, and eat the same dependable food over and over. If not that, then a raccoon. 
2	The duck is my spirit animal. \n\nCalm on the surface, paddling like hell underneath. 
1	Jackelope, for sure.
1	I love personality typing, so I use the Daemon Forum style to find my "spirit animal". I also use my daemon is an introspective tool but that's a whole other convo.\n\nPersonality-based, I'm a secretary bird.\nPullman/symbolism-based, I'm a velociraptor.\nSymbolism/spirituality-based, I'm a moon bear.
1	This is what I think of when I think of the ISTJ spirit animal.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/T8NHU0z.mp4
1	Was gon' say cat, but everyone already has. So, my spirit animal is an instruction manual to a Windows ME installation disc.
1	Crow
1	I'm actually surprised how popular this thread is, being in an istj sub. I don't/have never even considered this because it is so abstract, and tbh kinda irrelevant.  Like naming your car. I have no idea.
1	an elephant 
7	How do I make an ISTJ less averse to new ideas?	I have an ISTJ friend who is a chef. He can’t find employment not because he is bad, but because of the economic situation of this country. \n\nI suggested that he make a cooking channel on YouTube. He cooks marvelous dishes. He is good-looking. (I know it’s shallow but I can’t deny that looks help on YouTube.) He has nice manners because of his upbringing. \n\nHe’s got nothing to lose. He can film with his iPhone. He gets $4 per thousand views. He was interested initially, then said no. I asked why. He said, “I don’t want that many people to see my face.” (He can be shy like that sometimes.)\n\nSince he said no, I’ll not push the idea anyway because it’s his life. I just want to know if I presented the idea inappropriately for him to be averse to it. Had he hated it from the start, I wouldn’t be writing this post, but he was interested at first and asked me many questions. I think it’s a good chance for him. \n\nIt took me many attempts to get him to upgrade to Windows 10 from 7. (It happened last week.) He resisted the idea at first, but now he likes Windows 10 for it’s somehow faster (on his 7 year old desktop computer).\n\nI wouldn’t be this nosy normally but just last week he got drunk and let out a rant that reeks of depression almost objectively (“I need to do something. But I can’t find anything to do. People tell me to take a break but I’m not sure about that either. I’m not sure about anything. I fear the future. I’m so scared.”)\n\nAnd I agree that he needs something to do. He becomes healthier when he’s doing something. So I really want him to try this idea out. For himself. \n\nIs there anything I can do?
11	He doesn't have to do a traditional cooking show where he shows his face, some of the best YouTubers I follow just show hands and whatever they're working on. 
9	I agree that the introvert is probably a part of his hesitation. He may also be really concerned about failing, especially since many ISTJs are their own worst critic and he sounds depressed about his career situation. If he's realistic he is probably aware of how competitive and difficult it is to "make it" as a YouTube star. I would say, do your best to provide some facts about the opportunity and show him that you and others think he could succeed at it. ISTJs are often times a bit stubborn and have to come around to decisions without feeling forced into them.
7	Yeah, there is. My wife is an ISTJ. What you are running into is the Inferior Ne they have. It can make them think of all the ways something can go wrong, but without providing them any sense of how they would handle it. This causes anxiety and can make them freeze up.\n\nThe way I handle it, most of the time, is to offer my direct assistance. My wife knows that I am good at handling uncertainty and can just "make it work" when things go awry. I reduce the perceived amount of incoming data while she acclimates to it. She then focuses on the most immediately important things, while I deal with any future potentials. I also take the initial responsibility for failure, until she is comfortable and ready to go solo.
7	It's probably the I in ISTJ coming out here.  For someone who's shy, it can intimidating to put yourself out there on YouTube for the entire world to see and criticize.
3	I'm an ISTJ, and I haven't switched to Windows 10 either, because I dislike it's over-monitoring and controlling by Microsoft (and the people/organizations that control them). Why switch to Windows 10? What's wrong with Windows 7 (I think). If someone convinced me that it didn't have as many negatives as I thought, and there was a good reason to switch to it, I think I would do it.\n\nMany times my brother says to me to try things, and my default response is just to stay out of it, because I'm afraid that if I commit I can't go back on it, and there are probably many other good ideas I or anyone else hasn't thought of yet. If someone convinced me that it was the best, and there were no other better ways of doing it, and it didn't have any hidden risks, I think I would probably do it.\n\nMy brother also tells me that "doing one option is better than not doing any option", and I think that might have opened me to trying things a bit more, but not completely, because I'm still not sure if it's worth the risk of committing.\n\nMaybe if you convinced him he's not losing or risking anything by doing something? It also sounds like he's afraid of committing to anything because it all could end up badly. For me, if I was like that (what I'm guessing he's like), I would want to find something secure that I know I can count on to be true in the future (e.g. that I will definitely be good and not lacking what I truly need), and then invest everything in that (if I'm not risking losing out a better option). I can also get caught up in working, but I think that only delays my problem being solved. I'll be busy, but not content, still looking/waiting for what I need.\n\nBut I could be completely wrong, and maybe he's got a different problem then me, what I think works for me might not work good for other people, and he might even be an ISTJ. It's just what I think it could be.
1	Well, I'm quite adverse to the idea of a youtube channel as well. I really don't understand this fixation many people have with youtube stardom and getting views. Yeah, it could get you money, but at what cost? More strangers bugging you? Sounds stressful. I suppose a channel where you don't show your face could be ok. Being famous sounds awful. The other issue would be packaging the channel in such a way that it would be attractive to the average viewer. This would be less than fun for me. I hate that shit. I hate guessing what other people would like, because I really don't care, unless they are a friend. I've spent so little time caring, that it is a puzzle beyond hope of solving. I understand his need to do something. Unfortunately I've been in a similar position most of my adult life. I think I've found something, but I've been wrong before. No, it isn't a fear of failure persay, it's a fear of wasted time. How many more times can I do this tryout before I'm stuck with a job I hate and I'm too old or poor to start a new career? It is a desperate need to find something that you excel at, that doesn't make you feel like you could be doing something more fulfilling, more challenging, more profitable, more insert here. Work is work, money is money, so sometimes you settle. But I don't want that. Indecision is a bitch though. Idk if this is helpful, lol.
5	Weekly Thread: what are your favourite moments from 2017?	Welcome to our weekly thread! As 2017 comes to an end, let’s take a look back at our top moments from the year. What are some of your favourite?
2	The solar eclipse 
1	^ I liked that one too
12	I’m wondering what kinds of sex lives comes natural to the ISTJ...	
34	None
14	[deleted]
5	Im not sexually active in the slightest. I’m unsure why I don’t feel the need for it, since of course I enjoy orgasms. But I think it’s all the other shit that is attached to an orgasm that I don’t like getting involved in...at least that’s part of the deal with me.\n\nPlus I never go out to meet anyone new and I despise taking selfies of myself so online dating is out of the question.\n\nBut in reply to the original post, I’m actually really open to try new experiences.
3	You have to be direct but don't scare. If you say your more experienced start vanilla, like literally just missionary is good. A beer or two can help, but like a beer with dinner type thing, in no way a "get drunk" type drink. \nIf they ever do or mention anything more spicy and you want that make sure to say it cos it be a load of effort for them. Ie the smack your arse, say you like it or moan or whatever, as they will be way over judging if you liked it , if too hard, if bad or good ect ect 
2	Uh, the kind where you have sex at least every day? In my case anything too kinky was a bit weird and unnecessary, since the goal was having good physical feelings. That didn't eliminate the possibility, however, since I wanted both people ti be satisfied.
2	Loyal and monogomous....although I haven't found any woman to trust. Not being sexist.... I'm straight just saying my preference. 
2	Very little. Haven't had sex in like a year. Been single since January. When I was dating it happened like once a month idk. I didn't really enjoy it because I sucked at it. I lasted like 30 seconds lol. It's about the companionship....right???
7	How to show an ISTJ (boy) that I care (love?) them. I’m a female INTP. Please be direct and practical with answers, thank you.	
13	Your question lacks specifics, so it's hard to give a specific answer. ISTJs appreciate directness so telling him how you feel directly is usually a good idea. Don't expect reciprocation right away, especially if this is an unusual thing in your relationship. Give him time to process his emotions. 
4	INTP and ISTJ pairing is platonic, two highly logical and open-minded individuals. The feelings of attraction and love are mutual in this kind of relationship, so, congrats! ;) 
6	Figure out for sure how you feel about him.\n\nFigure out how to put those feelings into words.  Very direct, simple words.\n\nSay those words to your ISTJ.\n\nTell him you don't expect him to respond to those words right away.  You just wanted him to know where you're at, and to get back to you when he's ready.\n\nBe patient.
3	Seems like if you just tell him in earnest, and your actions don't conflict with what you're saying, he probably won't have trouble believing you or accepting it as the truth.  
3	[deleted]
1	Is this a love interest or a committed partner?\n\nRegardless of the stage of the relationship, being explicit about your intentions and feelings is a big deal because it removes doubt and the need to analyze...which basically frees up processing power that can be used more productively. If you can establish a communication link, or even a shorthand, that is reliably trustworthy...you will both benefit immensely from the clarity it provides.\n\nMany people will suggest that you investigate “love languages”. I would add that even if you do something nonverbal, still explain verbally in explicit terms your decision and intent, if you can bear it. This can be simple. A scenario you might encounter is that you do an unsolicited favor for him as a gesture of caring. To do it without mentioning it will probably leave you both dissatisfied: he may not notice your effort, and you will not know how he feels about it. Instead, if you openly state “Hey! I saw that [job] needed doing and I wanted to lighten your load so I took care of it for you!”, you have a dialogue started where you will get a chance to be validated and he will get to notice your effort. It’s a win win.\n\nBe open. Use your words directly. It’s the greatest.\n\nEdit:\n\nLearn his rules. Know what he finds important. You don’t need to be a perfect model if at least you know what “perfection” is and you are making a good faith effort.
1	Why does clicking on the image for the ISTJ reddit go to the general reddit page?	it's really annoying like it should go to the page it says it'll go to and then it doesn't
4	As far as I can tell, all subreddits that use the default CSS theme have this issue. Clicking on the Reddit logo takes you to the Reddit homepage, but clicking on the "ISTJ" text next to the image takes you to the istj subreddit. 
3	Because it's hard to find good help.
10	Do ISTJs make good leaders?	Do you guys objectively think ISTJs make good leaders? Why or why not? After reading the profile, it seems like ISTJs make better subordinates than leaders (not an insult, just an observation). Opinions?
32	My personal opinion as a fellow ISTJ\n\nNo. I would not be good leader. I tend to be short-sighted, and can plan (really well) for the immediate future, but long-term plans? That's scary. \n\nThere's also a great deal of improvisation required with being a leader. Shit gets thrown at you all the time, and when things don't go the way I anticipated, I panic a little. My weakness as an ISTJ is trying to account for everything, which is difficult (and a waste of energy)\n\nHowever, should we find ourselves in that position. We can pull it off, as previously mentioned, a reluctant leader. It requires faith in your team. I think as an ISTJ I'm really intolerant to slackers. \n\nI definitely believe we would make the greatest right-hand man. I wouldn't blindly follow someone because I am told. If our interests and needs align, then I'm willing to work the extra mile to meet those goals.
13	That's primarily because they don't desire leadership. However as a reluctant leader they do fine.\n\nLike all types they have strengths and weaknesses they bring to the table.
3	As someone who works hard and wants to be recognized and/or appreciated, the basic corporate path is to move from being a senior worker bee to management, then director, VP and eventually C-suite. If you don't follow, you get left behind and that looks bad on your resume.\n\nWhere I'm getting stuck is that I like doing stuff rather than trying to manage. It's hard to get people to do what I want them to do the way I want them to do it. Follow? Right now, I manage 3 people (SIGH). They are all intelligent, do pretty good work, and I have trained the shit out of them. I've also provided constructive feedback, further reading, ongoing encouragement. I STILL don't think they rise to the level I want them to be at, so I spend half my day redoing some of their work. \n\nThen I have to run around like an idiot and work longer hours to get other stuff done. It's exhausting.
4	I’m a leader at work and I do very well. My reasonings is usually I know I’ll do it better than someone else and I don’t like being managed by incapable people. 
3	ISTJs are the best judges, resistant to manipulation, highly logical and practical, and with good attention to the details and precedence. ISTJs are also very honorable, truthful, and open-minded (unbiased). They can resist against power and money, and stick to what's right.\n\nThey can make just and democratic leaders, best kind ever! For that to happen, they need counsel from visionary people (ex. INTP), solid public relations (ex. ESFJ), and effective independent agents (ex. ESTP). Every type needs help from others when in a position of leadership. ISTJs are one of the best types to lead. 
2	This's can go for every type. Most people do not make good leaders. We can have a good ENFP or ISTP or ISTJ leader. Leadership, in my opinion, is a skill based off some general knacks, experience, and subset skills.\n\nIn short, who's the ISTJ in question?
2	https://www.idrlabs.com/istj.php\n\nThere are several US presidents, a few foreign Prime Ministers, kings, and emperors, and some generals on that list.\n\nWhether any or all of them are "good" leaders is a matter of opinion.
2	It really depends on the context. I think I am a good leader in my work environment, but that is because the traits that are favored for the work are things at which I excel.\n\nFor one, I have an incredibly good critical eye to quality in process. I am a very observant and efficient inspector. What this translates to is an unflinching awareness of who is right and who is wrong in my operation. I am able to train and shepherd my employees with flaws in their process, and I am able to give genuine approval for those who are near perfection. I am constantly reevaluating quality and performance data that I observe and use that information to take action.\n\nIt isn’t leadership by charisma. It’s doing what we do: be an uncompromising stickler and extend it beyond the self. I make my operation my responsibility, so any flaws there are mine.\n\nWhat I find is that people respect and follow someone who is clear in expectations and fair in discipline. If something is wrong, but it’s always wrong no matter who does it or what the context is, then people can learn to do it the right way. Be reliable. Establish a reputation for being a reliable expert. That is enough.
2	Not particularly. Personally, I’m not charasmatic enough. I can’t influence people verbally. You know, like say a speech and inspire people. \n\nHowever, I have a work ethic that is second to none and absolutely believe that I’m an excellent leader by example. I always do what I’m supposed to do and do good work.
3	Weekly Thread: What quotes resonate with you?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week’s question is: what are your favourite quotes?
13	“At 70 years old, if I could give my younger self one piece of advice, it would be to use the words 'fuck off' much more frequently”  - Helen Mirren
7	An old Cherokee told his grandson, "My son, there is a battle between two wolves inside us all. One is evil. It is anger, jealousy, greed, resentment, inferiority, lies, and ego. The other is good. It is joy, peace, love, hope, humility, kindness, empathy, and truth." The boy thought about it and asked, " Grandfather, which wolf wins?" The old man quietly replied, "The one you feed."
4	Think of how stupid the average person is, then realize that half of them are stupider than that. - George Carlin\n\nThat may not be the exact quote, but there it is.
2	"Don't waste time it slips away, so raise your glass here's to yesterday" 
2	In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on - Robert Frost
1	Butt Monkey	Does it bother any of you that ISTJ characters are often butt monkeys in cartoons? Knowing how smart characters are often portrayed in fiction (no, I'm not an r/Iamverysmart person), it seems like it'd bother me if I were an ISTJ.
6	It doesn't bother me. If you bring MBTI in cartoons you end up purely with stereotypes. It can be relatable to a certain extent but it's to take with a grain of salt.
1	Do you have any examples? 
1	Does not really bother me no
3	Is the Grinch an ISTJ?	
5	Whether he is or not, i think we needa find neater characters for our type than... the Grinch (the thing i was called in school 'cause i don't celebrate). It's bad enough that when Googling ISTJ, it's just a bunch of politicians.
3	I think he is and that's a compliment. 
0	Sorry, but idgaf
4	How do I show my ISTJ sister that I love her?	I love my sister a lot, and say so often, but I don't know if this sounds just like empty words to her. She's not very comfortable talking about feelings or saying she loves me (although I know she does). Is there any way to show her how I feel in a more practical way? (I'm an INFP btw, and we live together. I know I could be better at helping with chores like washing up, etc, but what can I do beyond that?) I also try to be respectful of her need for alone-time and so on, so I'm not a pest with my jibber-jabber all the time! I really am at a loss as I seem to annoy her when I try to help her.
8	I am an ISTJ and my husband is an INFP. \n\nI find it annoying when I want to be alone or I am frustrated and I just need some silence, and my husband is trying to hug me or asks me to talk to him and explain how I feel. I know where he is coming from and I know he wants to help and he also feels frustrated and helpless when I don't communicate my problems and just sit or lay there silent. What I want is for him to be with me, but to also be silent. I want him to just sit next to me and do mind his own business silently. When I am ready to come out of my shell, I don't want him to mention my "silent tantrum" but just behave as if it never happened. \n\nI think that the best course of action for you, when your sister is having her alone time or some emotional troubles is just simply ask: "Do you want me to sit here with you? Do you want me to hold your hand and tell you a story? Do you want me to make you some tea?".\n\nBest thing in the world for me is when someone does something for me like cooking me a meal, making tea, polish my shoes or just do other things that I would have to do anyway, thus freeing my time to be with them. Giving me flowers or writing happy messages, sending smileys in Whatsapp, giving me pep talks, doesn't mean anything to me. Solve my earthly problems for me and I will see that you really love me and I will spend this additional time doing things that you love together with you.\n\nI also really like and appreciate that my husband can teach me new things, but do this subtly. I love learning new things and I love listening to someone reading or telling me something interesting (like how bees understand each other and always find their beehive, how dolphins communicate, how photoelements work). I also somehow really like listening to him explaining feelings, motives and relationships of people I know or don't even know. (Like how his friend went to another city with his girlfriend and they spent a night in a really nice hostel and went here and there). He actually told me that he really enjoys teaching people new things, so maybe this is something you can really use here. But be patient, don't patronise. Do you want to see how I peel potatoes? Do you to see how I turn on the washing machine? Do you want to help me in learning road signs (thus teaching her road signs)?\n\nI know every person is different and maybe your sister is a very different ISTJ that I am, but I think general subtle help with something will appeal to everyone. \n\n\n
4	It’s very nice that you want to speak your sister’s love language! I don’t have siblings myself, but here are things I appreciate from my parents and friends:\n\n-being tagged in memes/pictures the person thinks I would like\n-being complimented on something I take pride in\n-being asked for my input\n-being shown something you care about, like “I care about this and I want to show you so we can care about it together”\n-being invited to things: even if I don’t go it still feels food to know someone wanted me there! Bonus if you offer to accompany her to an event where she would like to go but she may not know a lot of people there/have anyone to go with\n\n
2	Maybe you can try to join her in a hobby she likes. Don't say you love her, *show* that you love her. For example I collect Pokemon cards and my parents and sister surprised me with a few ultra rare cards a while back (like as a random gift) and it put the biggest smile on my face. Like the biggest. 
1	I know my ISTJ sister loves it when I send her some music that I think she likes, and (practical) gifts make her really happy too.\nSpace is really important, but you know that already I think.
1	Not an ISTJ thing, but there's a book called the five love languages. It talks about the five major ways people express love for each other.\n\nI don't remember them all, but an example is Acts of Service. So in that case someone doing the laundry or mowing the lawn is their way of showing love.\n\nSomething to consider.
19	Are ISTJs hard workers all the time? Do you ever procrastinate and feel like a terrible person?	I'm a female ISTJ working as an engineer, 2-3 years out of college. Almost all of the ISTJ descriptions fit me spot on. However, I'm having a hard time reconciling the "hard worker" and "reliable" ISTJ characteristics with my recent behavior. At work I find myself procrastinating and slacking off a bit too frequently. I never get caught, I always meet deadlines (when they are given to me), and all teammates and supervisors don't seem to notice a problem with my work. I would say I'm procrastinating because some of the tasks I'm supposed to do are quite challenging, I don't have much direction, and the project manager is very hands off. I have a perfectionist streak, too, so I am afraid of doing a bad job, but I do realize procrastination is self-destructive. Can any other ISTJs relate? When you get stressed out, are you no longer the reliable, hard worker that everyone can depend on? Are ISTJs also prone to being too hard on themselves?
32	I procrastinate often. But once I get going, I can’t stop. I often perform best last minute under pressure.  
20	I procrastinate when I'm not sure about the task. If I know how to do it, I do it at once. If not, I tend to procrastinate, waiting foe the moment I feel I'll do the job right.
16	I need to feel like I was being productive or accomplished something during the day, if not I usually feel like shit. 
7	I am a terrible procrastinator. The more distant the deadline, the more open ended the assignment, the worse it gets. I perform well under the threat of imminent failure (missing a deadline), but being rushed can be miserable. It may be uncharacteristic of ISTJ'S, but I hate organizing my time. Ridgid structure has always annoyed me.
6	Absolutely not. I'm ISTJ and i'm the biggest procrastinator. \n\nHuh, the way how i said that. Am i too unabashed?
4	In school (computer science), I found that if I started my projects early/right away, the following would happen after I had already started: \n\n - The professor would change the assignment requirements (usually making the project easier)\n\n - The professor would teach us a better way of doing it\n\n - Someone else would point out a problem with XYZ and the professor would explain how to fix it\n\nThese all removed the incentive to start early.  So, I would start my projects with just enough time to get them done.  To me, that feels the most efficient and not like procrastination.\n\nAt work I do this all the time.  I'll spend a few days where I just dick around on reddit all day, and then a few days of busting my ass to get everything done at once.  I work a lot faster than my coworkers, and if I dragged out my projects to last as long as they do, I'd be so bored.  I'd rather do it all at once, quickly.
3	I procrastinate for the challenge.\n\nhttps://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--PeoKe7TW--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/qzcedvsn96nhprm1ouxo.jpg
3	[deleted]
3	I've found that I am extremely hard working and generally act like an ISTJ, but only on things I find difficult and/or important. If I view something as trivial or unimportant, then I can procrastinate pretty strongly.
2	I procrastinate way more than is good for me at work. It was a difficult adjustment from the discrete assignments of school life to the daily/ weekly/ yearly grind of a professional job. It has something to do with how unstructured things feel when instead of time periods being measured in semesters, it's like, the rest of your life. \n\nI am trying to bring variety into my work assignments and figure out how to better create structure in my work day, because it won't be provided for you
2	Do you actually like your job?
2	I actually dislike procrastinating a fair amount. if I can get something done immediately and out of the way, I tend to be impatient and try to do that ASAP - so much so that when I have a schedule outlined in my head and I'm behind, I can become a bit irritated.\n\nI tend to "procrastinate" in a planned way, I suppose. If I feel like I deserved a break, I'll plan for me to resume my work in another time slot later on in the day. But it doesn't have to do with whether or not I feel it's challenging. I typically meet it the same way.
2	I'm lazy AF.  I have a real knack for figuring out the best way to do the least amount of work (and still meet deadlines and expectations.)    But I will never go above and beyond because life's too short for that.
2	If I don't like something or find it useful, I usually end up procrastinating until the last possible minute. E.g. for my boring classes I find myself submitting assignments minutes before the deadline. I always feel awful about it, though, so you're definitely not alone in that aspect.
2	This sounds so much like me. I used to do clerical work that had me doing pretty well the same thing day in day out, and I was certainly very good at it. I switched to an admin job and something about it has left me wanting to put off many of my tasks and I feel so guilty procrastinating. I'm also afraid of doing a bad job so it's leading to quite a bit of anxiety. When I took the job people had high expectations for me to make improvements based on the experience I was bringing in and I feel like a total failure. I think a lot of us are hardest on ourselves... I've had pretty good feedback about my work but I still constantly have "imposter syndrome" thoughts regarding my work. 
1	I'll always get it done by the deadline, sometimes earlier. However, for longer projects (see: essays or research papers for school) I'm likely to start right away and write a tiny bit and then do the rest of it the days before it is due. I am aware that I do procrastinate, but I usually fill the time by doing other simpler/easier/shorter tasks that I also need to get done.
1	Your paragraph describes me quite well. I go in spurts with work and sometimes stress can kill all my productivity. I feel bad when I take a sick day or ask for vacation time because I don't want to let my company down. It's super stereotypical for us 
1	ISTJs are one of the laziest types.... 
1	I hate work and do it out of obligation....yes im an ISTJ\n\nI do my best job the quickest i can so i don't get fired.... other than that i despise working. \n\nOr as Peter gibbons says...i just stare at my desk all day.... but it looks like I'm working.\n\nI just do the bare minimum to not get fired,  it's not that I'm lazy its just that i don't care. 
7	Any tips on not taking ISTJ judgement personally?	I’m in love with and ISTJ man. I’m an Infp female. We love each other very much but sometimes it’s a challenge. \n  One of the biggest challenges for me is dealing with what can be criticism and judgement. Do you guys have any suggestions and insight on how to receive all this? I think my mom could be istj also, and this has always been an issue between us. 
5	We usually only critique if we care. Most of the time indifference is the response. Or we ignore because it isn't worth the effort. And sometimes I just need to be told. I don't like this because x. The why is very important. Many behaviours I find pointless until they are explained. If I can't find the root of an emotional response in my own life, I'm either unnerved (something must be wrong), or I toss it aside as needless complication. I'm also relatively thick skinned. So, it is sometimes hard to wrap my brain around why something I have said is offensive. I want to be empathetic, but sometimes I overlook things. I would hope that he isn't just being mean. Perhaps you both need to explain yourselves better. "I feel that you could.... I would like it if you.... "  If someone is complaining to complain, and provides no solutions, that doesnt work either. For context, I'm also very sarcastic, and my ex was a real shit talker (INFP?), so we kinda had a game where we made fun of each other in a flirty way.  It was possible to occasionally go too far, but that very rarely happened. (To my knowledge ;))
3	I share my life with an INTP. Not the same as ISTJ, I know, but can have a similar emotional tone deafness when doling out criticism (he is not judgmental there, so I can’t help with that). What has helped me is telling him when criticism hurts my feelings, and helping him understand how he can express his criticism in less hurtful ways. For example, I am sensitive to teasing, so he has learned to avoid doing that. \n\nA close friend of mine is an ISTJ. She had a huge heart and cares deeply for those she’s close to. But she often comes across as sharp or cold and she is bothered by it. It seems to be a mystery to her why others react badly to her tone, which can be cutting and impatient. It has helped her to observe other ways of communicating, and to have people who are close to her tell her directly what they need. ISTJs are “fact” people, yet they are fiercely protective and loyal too. They’re great people in my experience, if a little clueless when it comes to reading emotions in others or understanding how they come across. \n\nYou could also look into an author named Gottman. He writes about communication styles in romantic relationships and it’s helped me figure out how to manage the differences in my own relationship. 
2	My fiance is ENFP/INFP if I recall his results correctly.\n\nI am really judgmental and can have a hard time not seeing things and making derisive decisions about how to view them/actions/etc. \n\nBut a lot of my observations aren't made in a judgmental viewpoint. If I say something like "Person did X. What a piece of shit." then I'm being judgmental. But if I say, "Person did X when they could have done Y like this and that." then I'm trying to be logical and offer solutions to what I think is an issue of some kind.\n\nHow is your SO saying these things that you feel are criticisms?
1	>One of the biggest challenges for me is dealing with what can be criticism and judgement.\n\nFirst question is whether these actually are criticisms/judgement or merely comments/observations that you're interpreting that way. Could you give some examples?
1	Weekly Thread: If you could donate a million dollars to a charity, which one would you pick?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's question is: what are some charities that you'd donate to if you had a million dollars to give away?
7	Not sure....I distrust charities
3	Say Trees, Bangalore \nNot a charity. But an NGO\n\nI don’t care about Human Beings >P
2	I don't have a specific one in mind, but likely one focused one adoption.
2	My local volunteer fire department 
1	BOS Nyaru Menteng Orangutan Rescue Center\n\nThe Elephant Sanctuary\n\nThe Gorilla Foundation\n\nSpecial Olympics\n\nPerhaps creating something for homeless or poor disabled single people.  There seems to be help available if you have kids but not for singles.
15	Personality Test With Functions	Hi :) Couple weeks ago I asked for a help with testing one personality test. A lot of people told to use cognitive functions. We did it. Please try test again and comment your result. \n\nIt's Free. No registration required. Congitive functions used. :) \n\nhttps://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test
3	Huh, this's basically 16personalities, but with the coggy funks. It's like when McDonald's gets a NEW Oreo hot pocket or something. But anywho, i got... fuck... INTP-A. How unstable am i? But, now let's look at them coggies...\n\nTe 37%; Ti 68%; Ne 37%; Ni 68%; Se 33%; Si 64%; Fe 33%; Fi 64%. | From greatest to least: Ni Ti Si Fi Te Ne Se Fe.\n\nSomething doesn't feel right about this test. Not because of the result, because i'm just unstable, but just something about how it works. Seems to contradict how things work.\n\nStill, i'm going with ISTJ for me. \n\nI GOT IT! I think it's the slide bar. Can't explain it, but i have a feeling that shows how it doesn't work.
2	great test. thought i was ISTJ with low Te, test says ISFP-A all the functions are about tied, may retake. i would totally recommend to a friend
2	I loved the descriptions of the functions, they were really helpful in getting me to understand what they actually are. Last time I got INTJ-A, this time ISTJ-A with about equal N and S. 
2	Still accurate for me. ISTJ-A
1	I got the right answer, although I have no idea what turbulent means, did I miss the descriptor on the results page?\n\nTest was simple yet comprehensive. But as someone fairly well versed in the cognitive functions it was easy for me to pick out which one each question was referring to. I could answer to obtain any result I wished. \n\nBut it would be good for new people or beginners because it’s easy to understand and not too lengthy. 
1	Why Do You Think You Are An ISTJ (As Opposed To An ESTJ)?	I'm currently feeling conflicted between istj & estj for my type, so I was curious about what decided it for you all.\n\nI think that answers that discuss cognitive functions & their manifestations would be more helpful to me than discussions of how talkative one is...\n\nThanks in advance!
10	Introversion and extroversion have nothing to do with talkativeness. I can be talkative but I absolutely recharge with less not more stimulation and am pretty firmly an introvert.
7	I'm and introvert because that's what the test said! Which explains why I like staying in my apartment so much. \n\nAll sarcasm aside. It's more of how one acts in social situations and/or groups. Like I feel pretty drained and ready to home after doing some shopping. Or parties and large groups make me uncomfortable. I can be real talkative with someone I know or if someone starts talking to me about something I enjoy.
6	Istjs are much more polite and rational than estjs. \n\n-an infj’s humble opinion
3	Inferior function, really. Also, i relate to the Si-Fi loop.
2	Si is absolutely my default. I knew I was ISJ before I figured out whether I was Te-Fi or Fe-Ti (and sometimes I still wonder if I'm the latter with underdeveloped Fe and overdeveloped Ti, but I'm definitely Si-dom). Instantly related to Si when I read descriptions of it (except for the "you are a tea partier who doesn't believe in climate change" stuff I'd fortunately been forewarned to ignore).
2	It was exceedingly obvious to me. I'm not a social person. I can connect with people and join conversations, but only for a while.  I have very few friends, and many acquaintances. I may try to skip social gatherings if I'm not close enough with those inviting me. I hate bandwagoning, and having a ton of friends is work. 
1	Si overpowers Te by a long shot for me. ESTJs go go go. (Thanks Te) I just can't do it like they can \n
1	I just know I’m an introvert in every way possible. I genuinely don’t like other people’s company, I cancel events so I can be alone. I get anxious up to an event of seeing someone and try to find excuses out of it. I prefer going to lunch alone. I enjoy nights in reading, playing games ect. And the biggest one, if I am around a lot of people for a long time I am fkn drained. Like, don’t talk to me, don’t touch me - drained. Social interaction for me is a front. 
5	Do all ISTJs surround themselves with other SJs?	Hi all!\nI work in IT and my job includes hiring and training new managers, I am also heading some projects big and small.\nAfter I became interested in MBTI and identified myself as ISTJ, I offered my colleagues to also type themselves and everyone got pretty interested, taking tests, reading descriptions and all.\nWhat came out of it: almost all people that I hired are SJs. Moreover, almost all people working on my projects are SJs, although I did not hire them, but I tend to get involved in projects only with people I like and trust (because due to my role in company I have the right to choose my projects). ISTJs and ISFJs are prevalent. My only personal friend is ISFJ. My husband is however INFP, but this is a whole different story.\nI remember reading that ISTJs subconsciously surround themselves with other SJs. What is your experience with types of people around you?\n\n\n 
1	Definitely, have a lot of SJ friends, but some of my best friends have been non-SJ, which is probably mostly because I can connect deeper once I can open up since they tend to open up sooner.
1	My family is full of SJs, I work with a SJ and a ST, but my best friends are NFs \n
1	I’ve noticed in the last year that majority of the people I choose to work with and be friends with are actually ENFPs. I think I enjoy the way they push me out of my shell but also really seem to value my logic based thinking.
1	[deleted]
1	Since I'm close to several INFPs and ISTJs I have to ask you, how does that work in a marriage? I find that to be such a strange combo. I don't mean that negatively, but more from a curiosity area. \n\nThis does seem to show up for one of my college ISTJ buddies. He really gets along with an ISFJ girl we know, and does seem to get close to SJ types period. That might also explain why outside of me he hasn't clicked with all the people I frequently hang out. I think he likes my Fe a lot and how bubbly I am one second, then chill the next. He also told me he never knows what kind of perspective on life he'll get when I start chatting with him. I think he's amused/stumped by my energy and sudden deep perspective on the big picture.\n\nBut my mom is an ISTJ. She's quite comforted by people who are either general extroverts, or have extroverted emotion, though she won't act outward squishy and huggy to them by any means. She's married to an ESFP man, and has an ISFJ son, and me an INFJ. She and my brother get along really well. She's not too social, but I do remember her befriending other XXTJs over the years. My mom is also thrown off by my bubbly and intuition sides but she recognizes the merit of these sides. Heck she'll use me as her own councilor to try to understand her insecure feelings or ask for advice when she doesn't understand the big picture. \n\nThe last ISTJ I can think of is... geeze all my ISTJs are all thrown off by me. Anyway she introduced me to an ISTP and INTJ. She's very silly online, but in person she's very calm and serious. \nI guess I can't think of any real patterns except how they react to me. \nI dunno, I guess I just adore ISTJs. You guys are all wonderful. Also incredibly fun to throw into the weirdest of situations. Favorite sensory type. 
1	My current roommate is an ESTJ and we get along splendidly. But I would consider the friends I get along with the absolute best to be an ESFP, ESTP, and ENFP. I'd say among those the ESTP friendship has come easiest because we both have no bullshit personalities and we somehow just understand each other very well. The ENFP friend... I find us to be quite different, but we have similar enough backgrounds and life views to get along well. I always have fun with her!
1	SJs are very common types in general, but especially in IT-related fields I think. I don't know if it's true that SJs are drawn to each other any more than other types. Most of my friends outside work aren't SJs.
1	I'm not sure what you all think of the socionics theory of the "pathetic agenda" where your last (8th) function drives you to attain said agenda but the searching only "activates" if you're missing it. More in post.	The istj agenda is "To believe" but I don't understand what that means exactly. Does anyone know and care to explain?
3	It *might* mean that the ISTJ has a "spiritual" side to him that seeks more beyond his concrete world, but due to Si's excluding nature, he's skeptical. This might be why many ISTJs have interests in the supernatural, to satisfy that small intuitive part.
2	Is that for socionics ISTp (which corresponds to MBTI ISTJ) or socionics ISTj (which corresponds to MBTI ISTP?)
2	I'm so lost!
2	Wait, I thought ISTJ's hate theoretical discussions unless there is a practical application to it, honestly I had a hard time just reading the subject...
1	I have no idea what you’re talking about. Elaborate please.
5	Weekly Thread: what would you like for Christmas?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's question is: what are you hoping someone will buy you for Christmas, or what are you planning to get for yourself? Or what do you wish you could get?
12	I'd like to be informed on Xmas that I have a date with a woman prior to New Year's Eve.
5	I'll tell you the same thing I've told my parents and my friends:\n\n"I dunno."
5	I’d like a kiss from my gf, thankfully I’m going on leave and I’ll see her in 18 days!! 
4	I wish to not be alone or worse—be with my parents on the holidays. 
4	Reconciliation with my ex, no more no less.
3	Perhaps a new phone. I've had this iPhone 5 for four and a half years and while it hasn't crapped out yet, it is slowing down considerably.\n\nI don't plan to get myself anything else in particular. My SO is coming to visit (we're long distance) so we will probably do some shopping.
3	I bought myself and my son a house for Christmas. :3 I'm pretty excited about it. If anyone else gets me something, I hope it's Amazon gift cards.
3	A gift card so I can buy myself a new planner/journal.
3	To get laid
2	Either a Berkey filter or an essential oil diffuser 
2	Protective sleeves for my LIFE magazine collection and some Hollinger boxes.
2	A second monitor for my home office or a rug to cover these ugly cords. Also, in a new house with my wife and have lots of updates that need to be made, so a Home Depot or Lowes gift card would be awesome.\n\nBtw, when friends/loved ones ask what you want for Christmas/your birthday, do you default to *needs* instead of *wants*? Asking for extraneous, impractical things seems frivolous and almost embarrassing for me to request. Anyone else feel the same?

16	gay istj's facing gay culture?	Hey y'all. Any gay ISTJs out there that feel slightly uncomfortable with aspects of gay culture? I've met a couple of new gay friends since moving to a new city and they're ridiculously... touchy-feely with each other (butt, chest, other places...), and I honestly didn't face this aspect of "gay culture" until now. My ENFP friend told me this is actually "pretty normal", and now I'm wondering if anybody else has faced this and felt weird and/or uncomfortable about it. How do y'all cope (maybe not the best word) with this? It seems like everyone else in that friend group is okay with it, so I feel like an outlier.
11	Doesn't matter gay or straight, I hate PDA.
8	I deal with it by not interacting with gay people, because they do tend to take it too far. I find woman tend to act this way more frequently than men, so I don't have any lesbian friends. I realise this is not a realistic option for all - especially if you're single, but it works for me
7	Gay man here, I was so relieved to see this post. I find gay dating culture incredibly antithetical to who I am and my comfort zone and that makes it very difficult for me to engage in it, even if I want to. There’s a sense of over-familiarity where people act closer to one another than they are/expect to get close fast and I just can’t open up to others that fast.
7	Yeah, I can see that. Most gay guys I know are really touchy-feely as well, or at least comfortable getting touched in a more personal way by others. Personally, I don’t do that with friends but if I’m attracted to the person, I’ll probably be more touchy-feely to show interest. 
4	[deleted]
6	Gay ISTJ here. Yes, I feel very uncomfortable with certain aspects of "gay culture" but in my experience, "gay culture" is mostly just people acting on stereotypes. There is no "gay culture", at least in my experience, just stereotypes. \n\nI am a very "straight acting" gay man, so to speak. I don't exhibit many effeminate qualities and typically only date men along those same lines. None of them do any of that touchy-feely stuff you mentioned above. The point is, many other gay men feel the same you feel; you are not alone. \n\nThe only answer I can give is to just get used to it or let them know you are uncomfortable with it. I mean, I assume you value their friendship enough to deal with it, and if they are truly good friends, they will respect your requests. 
3	I carefully curate which parts of queer culture I interact with. I find folks in the club scene especially are touchier than I would like. I focus instead on volunteering with queer organizations in my city. I suppose it depends where you are, but people who support vulnerable queer youth tend to respond more respectfully to "you're in my bubble, dude."
2	I don't like anybody (gays or girls) getting all touchy with me, it feels awkward and invades my boundaries. Normally I accept it, but just seem kind of cold. Why can't you say you like my shirt instead of doing that little shoulder touch thing?\n\nThe only exception is the guy I'm seeing. He's also the only gay guy I interact with lol.
0	Need some help :)	Hello, guys :) I'm MBTI fan and trying to help my friend. He own small social network where main feature is Questions Game - people talk to each with pre-prepared questions or use their own questions list. The main idea to filter users and show related members are totally oposite options: 1) compatible members by zodiac sign 2) compatible by personality type. So, he created personality test which contains 32 questions. I want you to ask to take that test and tell is it accurate or not :)\nYou don't need to create an account or login to take test, but you can create it if you like the idea and want to try other features :) So, link to test is:\nhttps://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test\nAny comments, ideas, critics are welcome!
1	I got INTJ, which I used to type as when I was younger, so I’m not sure whether it was me or the test. But maybe some more N/S questions? I found it harder than for the others to feel out which questions were testing N/S.
1	 Got istj-a. Spot on :)
1	It was accurate for me, too. I'm an INFP. 
7	Any other ISTJ's like knifes?	Just curious, do any fellow ISTJ's collect knifes?  If so?  What's in your collection?
2	Yup, have about 13 in my collection. Mostly Kershaws, a few CRKTs, and a few others from different makers. The two that I mainly use for my EDC are the Kershaw Entropy and the CRKT Vizzle.\n\nI'm currently saving up to buy a higher end Benchmade and Spyderco.
2	I have a small collection. Probably around 15 knifes. Some Schrade's, Cold Steel knifes and some others I can't remember. Mostly cheaper ones. I do use a Kershaw Ken Onion Blur knife for my EDC. 
2	Not me.  Not against, just not interested.
2	I have a few. Couple of Kershaw Blurs, CRKT Ignitor, couple of cheaper Remington and Smith & Wesson pocket knives and a Buck Reaper.\n\nMy dad is the real collector. He may have a couple hundred knives. 
2	Collect?  No.  I decided I wanted to carry one, did my usual research (which tends to annoy my wife!), selected one, and carry it.  Just that one, since that's the one that won the selection.  I also prefer somewhat-worn comfortable things.  The knife has a fair amount of wear on the outside, but the blade still takes and holds a really sharp edge.  I like it.  (Spyderco Delica 4).\n\nI do have a 2nd one as backup, as I misplaced the first one for a week or so once (fell out of my pocket unnoticed in my car, ultimately found lurking in the dark next to the seat track!).\n\nThis is also why I have such a hard time throwing things away.  I put way too much life-energy into selecting, procuring, and using them.  When their usefulness wanes, I just can't easily toss them because I remember the effort invested in obtaining them!  Sigh...\n\n(Oh, and I believe it's "knives", FWIW).
2	*knives
1	Primarily carry Benchmades.
1	I like knives, don't collect them really. Because they're for work.  Otherwise I have a fascination with daggers.

57	ISTJ appreciation post	Been stewing on whether to post this for a week or so and then last night has just pushed me right over the edge into posting it.\n\nThe ISTJ capacity to take in masses of un-judged information for what it is, to avoid emotional rabbit holes and drama, to combine quiet listening with steel-blade lucidness of mind, to combine direct literal communication with deep kindness, to speak with action, to enact solid care, and and to take connection and commitment so very seriously .... for this and so much else, I really appreciate the ISTJ approach to information processing. \n\nI feel very fortunate that my SO has the ISTJ information processing preferences she does. It's such a positive resource in our relationship. \n\nWith appreciation,\n\nan INFJ
7	Cute. 
5	Thank you
3	Appreciated!
3	Very well said. I know an ISTJ and this is on point.
1	Yes, more and more I’m seeing that my dad’s approach to life makes the most sense. Sure I got to achieve my dreams, but in the end, if not for his support, I’d be totally penniless. The world isn’t fair or good or just, and I’m fortunate to have an ISTJ to catch me when I fall! Thanks guys!
3	Need some work advice	Fellow ISTJs, I am having a lot of trouble with my boss at my new job. He is not what I thought he'd be when I interviewed with him. He promises to deliver things and then he never delivers them and it has been a hindrance to me doing my job effectively. I worked really hard (60 hours a week, doing 3 people's jobs because we were trying to fill those roles) my first few months and have been told by multiple people that my team has done a 180 since I joined and is now known as the dream team; I improved my team's output, morale, and there is now a feeling of camaraderie that wasn't there before. I asked him if there was a possibility of a bonus because of my accomplishments, or if there isn't, I would like him to think of some form a recognition that is more than just a pat on the back. No bonus, not even a bottle of wine. Fine. He then goes on to tell me that I did a great job and he wishes one of my peers would do as much as I did. That was completely demotivating, since it came off like "you did great, we can't reward you, and your peer isn't doing anywhere close to how well you're doing but you guys are treated equally."\n\nBecause of his broken promises, my frustration at having to manage him so that I could do my job, and his inability to be a good manager by comparing me with my peer, I have completely written him off and now every time I have to talk to him,  I am abrasive and not a good partner. This is something that I recognize and I am trying really hard not to do, but every time he opens his mouth I just remember his failures. I've talked to him about what I expect from him, and I think he is trying to improve, but it isn't working and I don't have the patience/will to teach my boss how to do his job.\n\nI post this here because I think many of you would harbour the same feelings that I have, and I'm hoping that some of you could give me some advice as to how I can improve the situation. I just feel very disappointed, frustrated, and unappreciated.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my rant.
3	I have no “silver bullet” advice for you, but I can empathize. I’ve been in this position before and it’s infuriating. I could feel the anger building in my chest as I read through your post. Why is a show of appreciation so fucking difficult, especially when we work our asses off and make such a big difference?!\n\nThe only thing I can say is that by being abrasive, though perfectly justified, you will completely undo all your hard work. If anything, stick to your principles and take the high road. Slow your roll and don’t reward such a shitty response with even more hard work. While attitude might bite you in the ass, actions speak louder. If he steps up his game, meet him at that level. But no more freebies of your kick ass work ethic. \n\nStay strong, friend. 
2	You can also start looking for a new job. ISTJs are incredible workers from what I’ve observed. Take your talents where they’ll be appreciated and rewarded.

0	ESFP wanting to help an independent ISTJ Senior— Help understanding his perception?	I met this senior ISTJ  a couple of years ago at a restaurant that my ISFJ friend and I would frequent.  My ISFJ friend said he would see this older man almost every time he  would eat there no matter which day of the week it happened to be.  This ISTJ captured my attention because he would always be looking at the Barron’s stock paper.  I like to think I’m an investor and sometimes I do make the right decisions but you will not see me faithfully reading stock news.  When I first approached him he was very standoffish but after a year he became more open to us and we started eating and socializing together.  He is 83 but very active with exercising and he is strict with his diet.  He and my ISFJ friend seemed to hit it off but he seemed distant with me.  I think he was wondering what my motives might be sense I’m am quite younger than bother of them.  Once he found out more about me he has now trusted me enough to offer to purchase my cell phone since I was think of purchasing a new one.   I was quick to say yes because secretly I knew he might be interested and I also know he might want my help learning to used it.  You know how you ISTJs slip behind times and technology will leave you behind times.  He told me if he bought my phone I’d have to teach him to use it.  I’m fine with it because I think it is good for him to learn.  I’m excited about it.  Before our visit was up he said that I’m too easy and the problem with me is that I think from my heart??  He bid us goodbye but didn’t mention anything more.  I’m guessing he needs to think about upgrading his cell phone plan. But why  am I too easy and so what if I think from my heart?  Is this a bad thing?
2	Haha. Well, he is an old and wise man. \n\nYou have to understand that it is very weird for a younger individual, such as yourself, to take an interest in an octogenarian. I'm sure that he is wary that you are trying to get him to put you in his will or something like that. He's been around the block. So, he knows an ESFP when he sees one. I'm sure he finds people that are highly emotional annoying, which is why he was slow to warm up to you.\n\nBy saying that you are too easy, he means that you are too available and eager to please. It' s not necessarily a bad thing but people can very easily take advantage of your generosity. I mean, you offered to sell your cell phone to him specifically in order to be able to teach him how to use it. That is kind of weird. \n\n\n
1	I don’t doubt he is wise!  Actually, I just mentioned I was looking to buy a new phone and he asked to buy mine which made me laugh because I was fishing to see if he would be interested.  He helped me decide what was the mutual funds to invest in so I was showing my Fidelity Account online with my phone.  I think he would like to trade stocks and research them with a phone.  I respect him and I would love to help him.  You are right about ISTJ not liking emotional people because I dealt with my ISTJ retired boss which taught me what an ISTJ really is.  He was quite religious and judgemental.  This ISTJ seems more compassionate and less judgemental in nature.  I like him better.  He knows I want to save money so he gave me some advice.  He knows I’m not a gold digger. If you looked at him you would think he was homeless.

3	Honestly, Glenn Gould. I'd love to hear his ramblings about classical music, especially why he's so drawn to Webern, Schoenberg, and others I find to be atonally displeasing; also I'd want to discuss how he felt about radio and what he'd think of the advancements in musical technology in the recent decades.

4	INFJ curious about what ISTJs do when confronted on extremely personal and emotional issues...please	
22	I shut down. It’s frustrating for the other party, but I can’t help it.
9	It really depends on context. I'm married to an ISTJ and her ability to handle deeply emotional topics varies by the day and the topic.\n\nOn some issues, she has achieved enough personal maturity that she can talk about them calmly and length. Those are usually things that happened far in the past and are not a current source of trouble or stress.\n\nOn other issues, she can't even look me in the eye or speak without tears. These issues are usually things that have current, negative effect on her life.
8	Error: account is locked because of too many attempts.
5	I have two responses. Logical argument, or shutting down. And it depends on the subject and person. If my husband (INFJ) confronts me I shut down but also I cry. Anyone else I argue. 
4	I would probably stop talking and just say "okay" to whatever I'm being told. I would probably try to leave the area when the person is done talking, and try to process why what just happened.
5	Shut down then leave, explode emotionally if kept from leaving.
5	If I trust the other person I'll struggle to express what I feel. That being said, it will take several months for me to work out my emotions for myself, before I can even think about expressing it accurately to someone else. If I don't trust you I won't talk to you. Attempts to draw out info will shut me further down and erode trust in sharing my thoughts.
5	My bf is an ISTJ. I'm INFP. I love to talk about important things. Haha He, on the other hand, does NOT! Whenever I bring up something serious that might end in a deep discussion, he gets really awkward. He expresses it verbally ("Why are you asking me this? You're making me feel so awkward.") or he will get sarcastic and defensive and shut down. We have discussed this, though, and I know he is trying to be more open to discussing important issues. 
3	Most stuff just bounces off of me.   I rarely respond to personal insults because the person saying them isn't worth my time or effort.  They don't seem "personal" coming from most people...  But If someone does say something that gets through to me I evaluate it and, if it is a legit issue, I try to fix it
3	I will try to answer as best as I can, but try to steer it away from emotions as fast as I can x)
2	Probably ISTJ here. Well, there are many different ways we can go about this. Who is talking to me? Why? What's the topic? Anyways, as for what i'll do: maybe hesitantly spill the beans, argue, shift blame, try to escape, say it bluntly. It depends. I'm typically an honest person and try to be a bit open, but i have a "threshold" where things are too much; however, i sometimes try to get past that.\n\nYeah, it depends.
2	INFJ with a ISTJ SO here. If you would share more of the specifics and context and meaning of what you're trying to understand, I may be able to offer some insight. But I need more information. \n\n* Is this based on something in your life? If so, more specifics would help.\n\n* What do you mean by the word "confronted"? What does that looki like and who has done the confronting?\n\n* What do you mean by "extremely personal and and emotional issues"?\n\n
2	It really depends. I can write up a novel about this stuff through letters/text but actually saying it out loud? Nope. I still struggle with this with my husband and we've been together for 12 years. I remember when I was younger I'd write letters to my friends...lol.\n\nBesides my husband there's only one other friend that I get into talks like this and it's usually built up after me refusing to say anything for months. He's not the type who likes talking about this stuff either and it's ALWAYS through text. I need time to process my feelings and figure out why I feel that way too. We actually had a discussion a couple months back after I blew up and I was all over the place because I didn't have time to process everything. I really just wanted things to be fixed and back to normal, really wish I would have took a step back but that's over with. I also can't ever imagine calling him on the phone to actually voice any of this and if that was the only way of communication...I probably wouldn't.
2	I usually avoid it by finding some way to be helpful. I'll cook, clean, go out of my way to get something done that may have needed to be done for a long time, etc. 
42	Frigid and Icy - ISTJ	For years, I have felt like I am a frigid person. I have a group of friends who I have developed the ability to share my emotions with. But when it comes to non-family/close friends I tend to be extremely blunt and unemotional with people. This has led to me feeling like I am a frigid person who is not emotional... but as I have read over my results of being ISTJ, SO much makes sense. What I have thought was "icy" in my personality is just that I look at facts and information, analyze it and give my honest opinion. If a friend wants to just get in a car and go on a random road trip with no plan, I will look at it and say, "um... ok how about lodging, you need to arrange that."\nLong story short, thank yall for this community, I am happy I am not alone.
7	I get what you mean, but boy it has its pros. I haven’t had ‘friend drama’ in 7ish years? I don’t have relationship fights ect. I’m the ‘cool and calm’ one at work. I don’t feel upset losing random people in my life ect. It’s a very good skill to have. 
6	Welcome!
3	Yep this is exactly me as well, I recently went on a trip with friends and wanted to plan out all the airbnb's beforehand but they just booked them like a day before each place. I always try to plan out everything like that obsessively.
2	I actually struggle with this. I have a friend who gets easily excited about stuff and instead of just letting him be excited and shutting up I'll analyze, point stuff out, etc. I always feel extremely bad after and think to myself "just shut up and let him talk". I honestly don't know why he continues to tell me stuff lol.
1	Um... I had a boss like you.  I’m very emotional and it bother him.  I started studying facts about the common traits you ISTJ have and realized I need to communicate differently with him.  The thing is at times he had a huge heart and showed a loving side but other times he was “frigid and Icy”.  Not consistent and I’m hurt easily by his degrading comments.  But I can say that not ISTJs are like that and vary in their ability to deal with more sensitive types.  In general I really like you ISTJs.  
44	American introverts! Talking on the phone sucks, but not as much as not having a free Internet. Join the battle to save Net Neutrality!	
5	Text RESIST to 50409
2	Wait can I just email? I don't want to call. The only option seems to be email and call.
2	Ok. So I'm an Australian, and I've seen this posted every. single. Bloody. Subreddit.  \nI am sick to godamn death of this bullshit.\n\nI don't come here for politics, I don't come here for American only politics. Don't just reply with "hope you enjoy paying X dollars for that comment" or "you'll feel it too"\n\nHonestly, just fuck. Right. Off.
10	How do you like to be approached?	Both romantically and amicably-
25	straightforward and without ambiguity 
8	That would be an interesting change of pace...
7	with a steak
6	Not at all.
6	I go out of my way to avoid being approached.
4	With confidence and intent. Slightly warm expression is a bonus. 
3	Business first, small talk after (if I'm feeling up for it). If you approach me asking me questions about how I am or what I'm doing, you're immediately suspect in my book. Get to the point. 
2	With confidence. 
2	***I don't*** \n\nJk, probably just pretty straightforward. 
1	Eh, I don't really like to be approached honestly. 
1	Straightforwardly. Pragmatically. Please, “speak up your mind”, I’m pretty lazy for small chat and double sense sentences.
4	Weekly Thread: What do you regret purchasing?	Welcome to our weekly thread! With a bunch of holiday sales around the corner, it seemed like an opportune time to ask, what do you regret buying, either for yourself or for others?
5	The Sims 4, and any shoes or handbags over $100.  $300 shoes don't make me any happier than $50 shoes and that money could be used for much better things.
3	I recently bought a pair of $300 gamer headphones (Astro A40 mixpro) at the suggestion of my friends because apparently they were the only way to speak on Discord and play on the Xbox at the same time. Turns out the software required for the headphone's amps doesn't work with OSX High Sierra so I can't use them until the company eventually updates the firmware.\n\nI also realized 15 minutes after encountering this problem that I can just use my regular earphones and connect them to my laptop while playing the Xbox's sound through my monitor's speakers. 
3	Bathing suits on Amazon. Yuk.
2	1) The engagement ring for my ex-fiancé.\n\nNot that I have damaging feelings about the relationship as a whole. I should have stood my ground about not being ready to take the next step, but was influenced by pressure and an upcoming family vacation.\n\n2) Corn tortillas at the first store I stopped at last weekend (sold out of flour). Should have gone into one more store on the way home to pick up flour tortillas! Lesson learned after we tried them out - which we honestly did try but they're not our taste preference.
2	I  purchased a $35MXN pin for a friend as a sovernier from a trip this past weekend. I really regretted it after realizing I needed the money for something else. \n\n(I know $35MXN may not be much when converted to USD or euros but im Mexico that can purchase a bunch of things)

0	what should I major in if i'm ISTJ-T?	hi also what career job with best pay or highest pay. thinking between doctor or electrical engineering im open for any suggestions 
6	Do whatever you are most interested in that pays well. If you did a job purely for money it will be unfulfilling. Find the balance. \n\nMe personally i would go with doctor, i find trauma medicine fascinating. \n\nI sometimes watch surgeries on my free time.
5	I’m an ISTJ in medicine. I picked a surgical subspecialty. I still find myself relatively exhausted from clinical and surgical work because working with people so much wears me out. I ended up going the route of physician-scientist which fits my personality better than a full time clinician. It is a good balance for me. If I had to do it again, I might do the same, but I also might consider something that requires less interaction. Not sure. \n\nPick what is really interesting to you and fits your personality. I think that’s key. Otherwise you won’t like it and it won’t be a good fit. 
2	ISTJ-A here, am a software developer simply because it's what I enjoy doing. I feel like I don't work a single day of my week (it's essentially getting paid to do my hobby day in day out)
2	The thing that I was going to do right out of high school was major in biochemistry-> medschool-> pathology residency->Become some sort of pathologist. \n\nI ended up losing a lot of scholarship money due to an injury and I took a year off to figure out how I was going to make a living. I'm currently in the navy, but I've looked heavily into things that I would want to do that would \n\na.) challenge my mind \n\nb.) minimize my interaction \n\nc.) actually, give me a job out of college. \n\nd.) be something that I'm good at. \n\nI considered becoming a judge at one point in time. I have always had the ability to find the objective truth because I don't have any bias. The problem with being a judge is that you have to go through law school, become a lawyer, have a successful trial career, and then be elected to become a judge. That's WAY too much interaction for me. \n\nI considered becoming an engineer for a while. That is probably the route I will end up going since that is the route that my military career has been taking me. I'll probably end up specializing in either nuclear or electrical engineering. Electricity is very interesting. It's a constant puzzle trying to figure out how a circuit works or what is wrong with a circuit, but I find that my ability to take everything apart and analyze each component individually to figure out its purpose on the small scale as well as the large scale helps me out and makes me very good at it. \n\nOut of high school, as much as I love medicine and I have a passion for it, I had a lot of self-doubt as to whether or not I would be good at it. A trademark attribute of a doctor is to have a lot of empathy. Being an ISTJ, that isn't something that we have an abundance of. Combine that with the fact that I have little patience for patient interaction, and I'm sure you can understand why being a doctor could be a big problem for ISTJs. \n\nHowever, I eventually found out about pathology. It fits an ISTJ perfectly. All of the medicine of being a doctor with only a small amount of the interaction of one. However, out of high school, another big thing that prevented me from going this route was how expensive it was. If I could go back and do it again I would have gone to my local community college and gotten my associates and license in medical laboratory technology. I would have transferred and gotten my clinical laboratory science degree and tried that for a couple of years. If I still wanted to become a doctor (Which I would have become more informed about because I would have been working closely with a pathologist.) then I would have had a very easy time making that leap. \n\nI thought that hearing how I figured out what I wanted to do would maybe help you out. There you go. If you go the medical route, make sure you get plenty of research/shadowing hours and if you go the engineering route you start getting internships yesterday. Just because you may have that fancy degree does not guarantee that you will have a job, because you need experience even for entry level positions.

3	ISTJ + ISFJ Relationship dilemma	Good evening all, I am a 27 year old female ISFJ. I've been in a relationship with a male 29year old ISTJ for 6 years now, and I feel like we've become "stuck" in this stage. \n\nTL;DR at the end!\n\nI was staying over at his house for about 4 years (because we were both studying and his parents wanted to help us) and everything was fine at the beginning, at least during the first 3-4 years. Afterwards I did start to feel as if though there was very little growth to our relationship, and little growth in him, but I just decided that it was because we were still living at his parents', and that when we moved out we would finally be able to progress. Whenever I mentioned getting a house/apartment, he would always sound excited, and hoped that we could do that quickly.\n\nOne year and a half ago, I was able to get my house, and invited him to live with me, and he said he would. I kept asking him for when he would go, and he would always just say later. As I REALLY don't like pushing people into doing stuff, I wouldn't say anything, but then 3 days later we would be passing by the store, and he would say "oh look at that, that would look perfect in our living room, when I go live with you" and talk excitedly about moving in. Except that it just stayed at that, and he never made a move to actually move in.\n\nSeeing as he had mentioned it so many times, I always asked him about when he would do it, but he just said "when I'm ready". Eventually he did go, about 7 months ago. And he stayed there for 2 months, then came back to his parents'. When we were living together I felt as though I was his mother. The only housework he did was wash the dishes, even though we had talked about sharing responsabilites, and his excuse to not do something would always be "I don't know how to do it". Then when I would offer to show him he would just say "how about later" so he could play his video games/see youtube. Which is fine, again I do NOT like forcing people to do what I want them to do, and it's hard for me to ask for help anyway, so I just took the work load and did the rest... but then he would feel bad. He would say "oh, I never do anything around here, I don't know how to do anything". Which was true, but he never actually took any action to fix that. \n\nHe came back to his parents' house to "learn how to do things" and surprise, he has done nothing to learn things. I have talked about this issue with him before, and it always ends with "I will get better, I will learn how to do things and go back to live with you". Well 7 months later and he has done nothing to fix this. I have been trying to cope with this by lowering my expectations of him time and time again, but at this point I feel that I just cannot expect anything at all from him but basic respect, but I feel no more excitment at seeing him, and I feel as if he was just those summer boyfriends you get for a little while. I have also spoken to him about this, and he has said "I'll work harder so you don't feel that way". Yeah, nothing so far, but he seems happy enoough in our relationship.\n\nIs it me? Am I still expecting too much? I'm aware that emotionally distancing myself from him isn't the best answer, but I just don't wanna be nagging him constantly, but at the same time I feel almost as if though I have already lost him, but his family and his friends are deeply important to me and I don't wanna lose them.\n\nTL;DR: I feel emotionally distanced from my partner and have spoken to him about it several times. He has said he'll do better and hasn't actually done anything.\n\nAny insight would be good, thank you for your time.
8	Sounds like a dead relationship to me. Why are you staying?
6	Girl, red flags everywhere. This is classic immaturity at its finest (worst?) He being immature, not you. You have done more than enough to put in your fair share to try and make things work. Relationships take work, they take compromise and commitment. And it doesn't look like he is willing to put that in. That tells me it isn't worth it to him. I say let him go, for your own emotional health. 
6	Like everyone has told you already "You gots to go!" You already sound like you're over this relationship, and you are just afraid of taking the necessary action to ending it. Will breaking up with him hurt and upset him? Yes, but he'll get over it. Break up with him, mourn the loss of the relationship, and move on with your life.
3	So, my role is a little backwards. I'm the ISTJ and my bf is the ISFJ so I can only speak as an ISTJ, but you really sound like me. I'm always the one thinking about and planning the housework and being responsible etc. My boyfriend is great though, he helps with everything and we both take part in sharing the adult responsibilities. \nYour boyfriend really just sounds immature. He seems like he doesn't want to bother "learning" anything because he has it so easy at home.\nEveryone has a slight variation of their MBTI type, but he really doesn't sound like an ISTJ. \nIf he truly is, he and you will benefit more from having a conversation about the issues you're having in a logical format. If presented to him that way, and he is an ISTJ, he should be able to understand your side of things and what is expected of him. 
1	Sorry to sneak back here from the comment that you replied to me, but I'm curious - are you still in a relationship with him? And is it still the same?
2	Overbearing ISTJ makes me want to kms, HELP!	I'm 80% sure my father is ISTJ. I myself am an ISTP. We as quasi-identicals, according to socionics, do not get along due to the one-for-one opposing attitudes in our functions, and I can 100% verify that. He's an intelligent man but our differences in generation and cultural upbringing mean we hold drastically different values, meaning pretty much everything that comes out of his mouth is more or less a cynical variation of "you know better than to do that", usually referencing his personal experience, "common sense", or most likely, convention.\n\nAs an ISTP, I cannot stand being told what to do without a thorough (reasonable) explanation of why I should do it. I can try asking why but it'll usually be answered with an authoritarian/I know better than you attitude. It's Te vs Ti.\n\nHow do I get him to stop imposing his demoralizing judgments upon me and just leave me alone. He's still the bread earner and I need to get along with him. Advice appreciated.
9	Healthy boundaries and proper communication. So many people come to these MBTI subs looking for interpersonal advice and generally it’s not an MBTI thing and more of a boundaries and communication thing. I am an ISTJ dating an ISTP. These issues you’ve described come up for us too but we set boundaries and communicate and find a solution. 
2	It would help to know the age of your father and yourself. Also if we're sticking with strickly MBTI then you have ISTJ (Si-Te-Fi-Ne) vs ISTP (Ti-Se-Ni-Fe). Those are some drastically different functions from what I see.
18	What would happen if they divided the world based on MBTI?	A penny (upvote) for your thoughts...\n\nThe movie Insurgent got me thinking...
6	I guess it would depend on how they're dividing them. By socionics quadras? By Keirsey tempermants?
6	SP land would be a huge amusement park. SJ land would be a gigantic church. NFP land would be Narnia. NTJ land a huge rocket station to go to Pluto. NTP land a library of books on how to get to Pluto.\n\nAs for NFJ land... see NFP land ;)
5	ENTJs and ESTJs would try to conquer and enslave everyone else, and then they'd all kill each other or have to be killed by ISTJs for the sake of world peace. ISTJs or INTJs would likely restore peaceful order, even if it is a 'benevolant dictatorship' of the world. INFP country would be a forest land with everyone living happily in trees like animals in a protected wildlife park, with no imposition of order from the outside if ISTJs were in charge (hurray!). ISFJs would set up some religious country and then go on religious crusades, smiting non-believers and feeling full of righteousness. ESFJs would try to sell shoes and handbags and jewellry and cakes and chic-lit to the rest of the world, and form social clubs for 'everyone' to enjoy. The rest, I'm not sure...
1	i think infj´s and infp´s should govern the world, it would definitely be a better place :D
1	The ESTJs would come out on top for sure.
9	Anyone in a relationship with an INTP? I'm crushing pretty hard on an ISTJ and I'd love to hear stories and/or advice on this pairing. Thanks a bunch! :) (repost from INTP)	
12	I have been married to an INTP for 12+ years. \nThe pros: he's my best friend and his primary loyalty in life is truly to me. Our wedding vows became foundational facts for each of us. We have similar approaches to many things (religion, politics, work) and complimentary approaches others (parenting, household).\nThe struggles: learning to communicate the family plan took time. He can't internalize the calendar, I wasn't used to communicating it. I run a Google calendar for the family now and have our daily agenda emailed to him every morning. It helps... some. He's never going to need (and therefore enforce) the same level of order in the household as I crave so usually the house is cluttered until a day when i lose my mind and snap and we all go to town.  Because we aren't very social, our kids are awkward in some ways but we do our best to intellectually explain social cues to them and have enrolled them in supplemental guidance programs at their elementary school. \nFights can be difficult because we each believe strongly in our correctness. Stopping the fight and going to bed actually helps us cool down and get rational. \nIn short, we don't like most people, but we really like each other. \nI will note - he pursued me. I do think that's critical for his type. You cannot convince him that he wants something until he convinces himself. Then, good luck being rid of him. \nIf you have any specific questions, I'd be glad to answer.  :)
7	INTP here, currently in a relationship with an ISTJ. This has been the most difficult relationship in my entire life and we, on a fundamental level, have a very hard time being harmonious.\n\nYou guys like order, structure and routine. You proceed very efficiently from observation to plan to action to result. We are the exact opposite. We are the absent-minded professors who jump from one fanciful idea to the next as our attention span dictates. We will procrastinate doing anything that isn't "interesting" to us, though we will generally do necessary tasks... Eventually.\n\nI'm not sure what would attract an ISTJ to an INTP but there must be something. Keep in mind that without considerable and constant effort, your relationship will be very, very difficult after the honeymoon phase.\n\nAlso, INTP is one of the most mis-typed types, so... This may not even apply. 
4	I dated an INTP for 5+ years. We both had pretty severe untreated mental illness, so that was a major factor in why the relationship didn’t work out, but otherwise it was pretty good. His disorganization was very difficult for me to cope with though. Living together was a strain on both of us. But we shared similar hobbies, had similar beliefs, and generally valued the same things. In the end though we were far better off as friends. Major mental illness really sabotaged stuff though, so I’m not sure if our differences were exaggerated because of that or if we truly were incompatible. It’s hard to say. But what I can say is you’re going to need to work very hard on communication. Learn how each of you communicates because if you can do that you’ll be able to work through any issues that may come up.
3	I feel like these two types have a lot in common but very different ways of approaching and arriving at those ideas. I had a huge crush on an ISTJ (I'm INTP). But I could see how different our thought processes were. We had a lot in common but at the end of the day I feel like it would have been an extremely difficult relationship to maintain. Definitely better as friends.
3	Not a relationship, but my best friend of 5 years is an INTP. I don't know if I have any advice, but I can share my experiences. He's pretty different from most INTPs in that he has really strong Fe, though, so that's where we clash most often. He's a lot more idealistic and considerate of people's feelings than I am. However, he's also not at all in touch with his emotions and if I didn't reach out to him to make some sort of contact, we'd basically never talk. He doesn't share much about his life unless you specifically ask because he doesn't want to be a burden on people. On the other hand, I sometimes overshare different problems in my life - often having to do with understanding other people's actions/motives, because my Ne sucks at that - and he can get sick of it. So there's definitely a communication barrier there. We also used to work together and collaborate on projects a lot, and he would love to bounce ideas off me, but unfortunately, a lot of the time my Si would just point out all the problematic details with his ideas, which got him frustrated a lot.\n\nThat being said, we're still friends to this day. Not as close as we used to be, but the good thing about our friendship is that nothing he says ever offends me and nothing I say ever offends him. We both favor logic above most other things, and although he places a greater emphasis on respecting others' feelings than I do, we still agree on most things and we are good at having healthy debates.
2	Know Any ISTJ Musicians? Paste Their Face Here!	Famous or underground, the world must know some ISTJ musicians.
2	Apparently Tom Petty was ISTJ.
1	Sting.
1	I think Eminem is. ISTJs are more musical than people assume.
1	Old thread, but I think Rivers Cuomo from Weezer is an ISTJ (or at least Si-dom, he could be ISFJ).
27	ENTP here. You ISTJs are awesome. I feel like I can always rely on you guys to check the details of my ideas.	
18	can confirm, can decimate ideas in seconds haha
5	Is there a story behind this?
3	Thanks!
3	i have an ISTJ brother - can confirm! lol
2	Details are what I do best!
3	ISFJ here needing help with ISTJ friend going through a divorce.	His wife wants a divorce. She has kicked him out of their home. He is staying with me now. He hasn't fully accepted that they're going to get a divorce yet and still wants to make things work.\n\nHe is in a really bad place right now. It got so bad last night at around 3-4AM he reconnected with his abusive mother just to have someone to talk to when he saw his wife change her last name on facebook back to her maiden name.\n\nI'm trying to juggle his friends around via their schedules so that he's not alone too long since he has told me that he's terrified of being alone. and he's the one friend i always consider in the back of my mind as a minor suicide risk so it's good to have people around him.\n\nHe told me that he picked me to stay with because he feels i'm the most equipped in helping him get over this. and i'm trying to help him slowly accept what's going on, and accept that that it hurts, and accept that eventually it won't hurt as bad.\n\ni'm trying to get him to do new things outside of his routine so he won't be reminded of her. aside from just staying at my place i'm taking him to my gym since his gym is too far to get to. and i'm going to get him enrolled in boxing classes with me since he's shown interest in it and used to do kick boxing. and i'm trying to keep things different.\n\nis there any advice from other ISTJ who have gone through something similar that can help me help him?
6	Can I have one of you please?
4	I don't have much of an advice. It's incredible what you are doing for him. Just don't give up on him. 
8	Weekly Thread: what keeps you up at night?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week’s question is: what’s got you worried in life? 
13	This is going to sound morbid, but my past failures and my upcoming anxieties. I'm not the type of person to "live in the moment" and tend to only focus on past and future, especially the things that bother me.
6	Insomnia. 
12	Lack of companionship
6	Um, the internet :D ??? \n\n Once I close my eyes though - I easily fall asleep, I never have issue falling asleep or being kept awake by issues. Sometimes I think about my stressful issues until I fall asleep - thankfully they don't keep me up. 
4	Work. Because I work night shift ;-)\n\nWhat keeps me awake is money - more specifically the lack of them. We live paycheck to paycheck, my SO has sclerosis, and money is tight. \n\nWorries about my daughter - is she being bullied in school, am I doing a good enough job of raising her, why is her mom (we divorced in 2010) so unconcerned about her wellbeing?\n\nHow am I ever going to find a job I love and care about, or even just a job where I respect the management enough to care a little bit about them? A job that will help with our economical situation. I’ve started taking classes in C# to try and get some kind of diploma so I can make my hobby my work. It’ll take around 3 years before I’m finished so here’s hoping it’ll work out. 
4	That I'll die without making a huge impact in the world
3	Knowing I need to interact with my ex wife the next day
3	Nothing.. I crash hard unless I drink caffeine
3	Prepping for an upcoming move across the country. 
3	The better question is "What doesn't?"
3	Nothing. By the time I’m ready to sleep, I’ve already put my troubling thoughts to paper, and compartmentalized everything in my mind. I go to bed content.
2	Reddit in general, and music. 
1	If you're into MBTI and want to discuss it 24/7	Come join the discussion!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/s62PNyP\n\nThere's a large community of people who love discussing myers briggs, enneagram, socionics, and general psychology.\n\nWe are looking for fun, interesting people like you
5	Skepticism regarding "Types" and self-categorization	Hello, I will be posting this to both this sub as well as the INFJ sub, as I have previously (up until this week) considered myself one. \n\nI've come to believe that, while MBTI can act as a quide regarding people's tendencies, we are far too complex and malleable to be confined to one "type." Using one's results to improve and become more self aware is ideal, but even this is difficult to achieve since the result's accuracy is dependent on the subject, and their answers can be askew due to the barnum effect and self-serving bias. In addition, it's easy for a type to look at their weaknesses and see the justification in them based on their type and motivations, then reason why they need not change at all. This can be suffocating to personal growth. \n\nI wanted to test the magnitude of my own self-serving bias, and so retook the test (I took the "16 Personalities" version) and was as hard on myself in my answers as I could be. I thought of real life examples and asked myself what other people would think my answer should be (In particular, I thought of my mom and boyfriend, both people whom I consider to be critical yet accurate).\n\nMy result, as you might have guessed, was ISTJ. I based my answers on my flaws, not my strengths. Yet upon reading more about the ISTJ, I was able to relate and even liked the qualities of you guys.\n\nI don't feel that I could easily identify with just any type. However, perhaps the context under which one considers themselves and the examples they apply to the questions primes them to look at themselves in a certain perspective. This is why one can so easily relate to their results. If I thought of every example where I behaved in an authoritative, logical manner (I am sure that even submissive, overly emotional people could recall a situation in where they perceived this as their behavior), I could just as easily identify with an ENTJ. \n\nI apologize in advance for these loose examples. I want to know what the rest of you think. Which facts give you belief in this crude classification system? Thanks. 
8	Well first off, have you just been basing your type off of online tests, or have you actually studied the functions? I agree that MBTI has no accuracy or functionality if you just go off the letters, as most tests do. \n\nEven within each type, there are many different kinds of people. Function development is what allows for this. Some ISTJs are very immature and have poor Fi and Ne, meaning they operate primarily with Si and Te, which makes them a more stereotypical ISTJ. But a more mature ISTJ with well-developed Fi and Ne would look nothing like the ISTJ stereotypes. Most people fall somewhere in between these two, because hardly anyone is just a stereotype. People are more complex than that. No type is confined to having to act a certain way all the time.\n\nThere are also other things that factor into this, such as enneagram. An ISTJ 1 would be different from an ISTJ 5, which would be different from an ISTJ 6. And that's not even including the possible tritypes and instinctual variants. If you include those, you get thousands of different ISTJs. The only thing they have in common is their cognition.\n\nThat being said, I don't know if you're an ISTJ. Based on what you wrote, you seem to show signs of higher Ne and potentially Fi. Ne doesn't like to be confined to one possibility and Fi is highly individualistic. If you can see yourself in many different types and from many different perspectives, that's a good indication of higher Ne. Take that with a grain of salt since I hardly know anything else about you, but if you've only taken online tests, then definitely learn about the cognitive functions and reconsider your test results.
2	Solid points. I guess I clearly see how I can move forward from my type. It does give you the path to improvement route, if you decide to use it as such. Instead of it being an excuse.
41	Am I the only one who hates (gets furious) when people waste my time?	The lies and fake promises people make, and the inability to keep their word, much less be punctual.... just whyyy the fuck. \n\nCan’t wait to permanently dis-associate from such folks! (Friends and family)
21	[deleted]
12	Yeah I feel this way. This is how my scenario goes with my friend that does this too me:\n\n me- "hey wanna come over and watch some TV with me tonight?"\n\n Her- "yea sure! Sounds great"\n\n then comes the time she said she would be over "hey I don't think I can make it, I'm feeling pretty tired"\n\nHappens ever time. I just stopped asking her to hang out. 
9	You are not alone. A guy I used to work with had a saying, “don’t punish the punctual” - if you show up to a meeting on time, you should start on time, not wait 15 minutes for everyone else to come. The people who are late should have the responsibility to catch up on what they missed. The people who are punctual shouldn’t have to waste their time waiting or be kept late because others were late.\n\nI have friends and family members who outright lie when asked how far away they are when someone is expecting them. Like they will say, “just pulled out of the driveway” when they really mean, “ still getting ready and have to stop on the way to pick something up.”
3	Pretty sure this is one of the biggest pet peeves of all xSTJs, so yeah. Being inconsiderate toward other people in general is a big pet peeve of mine, because I often force myself to think: "If it was the other way around, would I be annoyed if this person acted this way?" and then act accordingly. A lot of people don't seem to have that filter, though.
2	Oh man do I feel you. I organized an event tonight and like 1/4th of the people flaked last minute. I was like... why do I bother. But the people who did show up had a good time anyway and I only get upset when I think about the people who flaked. So I try not to.
2	Nobody likes when people waste their time tho
2	I hear ya on that one. I think that's something all ISTJ's can agree on honestly. 
3	Hey ISTJs! ENFP here. I'm trying to get some statistics for a speech. If willing to add to the data, do you feel that the ISTJ type is accurate to you?	To attain an average and later share the data \nlet me know on a scale of 1-10 how well you feel the ISTJ type \ndescribes you. 10 = "Fit's me perfectly". 1 = "Not at all".
7	Based on ISTJ stereotypes: 3\n\nBased on ISTJ's functions: 9.5
5	10 
2	8
2	8
2	Difficult to answer because there doesnt seem to be a united understanding of the mbti theory, what definitions are accurate, what description are good, etc. I would say 5-6 under what I think is traditional mbti.
2	8
2	5 
2	8.5 to be honest, but if we're doing whole numbers, I'll round up to 9.

7	Birthday gift ideas for ISTJ	Hello! I am an INFJ with a love interest who is an ISTJ. He is turning 30 in a few weeks (he's kind of making it a big deal that he's turning 30 bc idk he's probably having a mid life crisis) and I have been stressing about what to get him. \nI know you guys are very straight forward and practical, but all the presents I've been thinking about getting requires a good chunk of money and I feel like he will yell at me, especially because he always tells me to manage my money wisely. >__>;;\nHe works in tech so I thought a smart watch would be great since it would probably help a lot of time management and reading work emails without him going back and forth on his phone (I've seen him do this and he almost dropped his phone once :(( )\nOr in a very INFJ manner, I wanted to take him to the aquarium where he can relax and have a nice small get away from his hectic work and maybe a nice lunch/early dinner next to the beach after.\n\nI don't know if I'm over thinking things, but I just want to give him something where I hope he can treasure and appreciate without him feeling too over burdened. \nI just want him to know that he is appreciated and loved.\n\nAny input would be great, thanks!! You guys are kind of scary so I don't want to be yelled at :'(( \n\n**update edit**\n\nThank you for everyone's inputs! It was super helpful and I've thought about what everyone said (a watch was a bad idea you guys were right >__>)\nTo clarify the vague relationship between him and I, we've been friends for awhile but we have been together on and off, that's why I didn't want to get him anything too insane like a get away which is does really need (he's been working overtime a lot and it's driving him insane)\n\nI decided to go with a heated massage pillow that he can use for his neck and back that he can also take to his office if needed, because I realized every time we spend quality time together I always end up massaging him for an hour or so, and last night I found some knots in his back which I massaged out, but I can't do that every day so....\n\nAnd then probably a nice dinner at a place either we have a nostalgic value at, or somewhere new depending on his mood, probably a gaming lounge/bar we first hung out at!\n\nWhat do you guys think?
12	I'd suggest not going for the showy price tag whatsoever. My favorite gifts of all time were  a carpet cleaner service and quality bedsheets, but in your case I would strongly suggest a unique gift from Amazon's "Interesting Finds " section or an activity like you mentioned. Experience gifts like concerts,  museums, urban scavenger hunts, etc. are gifts that last a lifetime.
9	For me, I like gifts where a lot if thought was put into it. It's easy to take me out to dinner and a movie, but it's very predictable. I would prefer practical, thoughtful gifts.  \n\nFor example, I was complaining about my dslr camera and lenses not being organized and a hassle to carry. My boyfriend got me a camera bag to organize all my gear! He did a lot of research to find me the best bag that I can use. I thought it was so sweet :) 
4	[deleted]
4	Food. You can never go wrong with food. A nice dinner sounds good for me. Perhaps then you could let him decide what he would like to do next afterwards? Spending quality time just chatting with our special someone feels more meaningful to us too. I'm an ISTJ with a birthday coming up too. 😊While giving gifts are thoughtful, I've realized that after 33 years of getting them.. no matter how practical they may be.. its the memories that I treasure the most. Or maybe that's just me. 
3	[deleted]
3	Does he already wear a watch? If so, I'd give it a miss. He might feel obligated to wear it to show usage, but might have spent time choosing just the right watch previously that he prefers. And if he doesn't wear a watch already, then maybe he doesn't want one. I (ISTJ) wear a watch constantly and feel naked without one, but I would feel really frustrated if I felt I had to wear one that was chosen by somebody else.\n\nI think I am hard to buy for but don't know if it's ISTJ-related. Example, I hate to have unnecessary clutter around the place. Ornaments etc., which is weird because I used to have loads of stuff like that until I was about 20. I also dont feel comfortable celebrating anything, especially when it makes me centre of attention.
2	Most likely practical gifts. I kinda want a pair of headphones for my birthday since I listen to music a lot, but as others have said, it depends on the person.
2	I'm an ISTJ and I'm the one who always plans the everything. One of the nicest gifts I got from a friend was... she planned the night. She even gave me an agenda! She said when she was thinking about what I like she remembered how much I like structure. She planned a little pub/restaurant crawl to some of our favorite places. It was just the two of us (I don't like a crowd) and we had a great time.
6	How do you relate to each one of these 10 paragraphs, ISTJs?	1. He internally strives towards stability, a world that does not change, relationships that do not change - logically beautiful and coherent, calculated, and well reasoned through. \n\n2. His logical program is meant to be an alternative to any sort of destabilization of his environment and surrounding structures: social, political, physical, biological, and so on. For this very reason, his understanding of consistency, reasonableness, rationality is linked, first of all, to the organization of structural order (the "order of things") within the framework of some real, concretely existing system. Outside of the system the he never examines anything. Any phenomenon is viewed by him as part of certain existing system, that is regulated by certain patters and laws and a certain logical order. Perceiving his surrounding reality from the point of view of its systematization, logical design, and coherence, he is constantly analyzing the systems existing around himself . Asks himself the question: is this an isolated occurrence, or it is attributable to some system? Is this an isolated act, or is this a model of behavior? Is this an accidental actions or motion, or is there some system of views and values behind it? To understand the inner essence of phenomena, to figure out the cause-effect connections between phenomena of the most varied sort, to analyze the observed phenomena, to systematize the conclusions, to derive some more generalized definition and introduce it into an already existing system of views, to chose from all existing systems the one most suitable for achievement of specific goals and to improve it, to adapt this system to the specific social conditions, thinking it over and working through the smallest details - all of this is the sphere of on-going intellectual activity of any of the representatives of this type.\n\n3. Under no circumstances can he be "by himself", "thinking only for himself", "himself only for himself" - this contradicts the program of his intellect too much, not independent; "One for all, all for one" . For this reason he holds conformism and loyalty with respect to the existing regime, since he often attempts to find an application for himself within an existing ruling social system. Even if a representative of this type exists as some "antisocial" element, nevertheless he cannot be "by himself". For him it is difficult to be a "lone wolf"; therefore, he will for certain be organized within the framework some or another social structure, where he will fulfill all entrusted to him duties and hold the responsibility for his actions - another form of behavior for him simply does not exist.\n\n4. In his opinion, the behavior of a person needs to correspond to his position, otherwise public consciousness will be disoriented by models of the "unbecoming" behavior, which will lead to the destabilization of the social system. Respect for the authority - is one of the most important values of his intellectual structure. Orientation at authority - is an important motivation for many of his actions, that in many respects determine the nature of his relationships and behavior. He is always ready to directly counter and fight any manifestations of disorder, incompetence, and irresponsibility in society. He can settle comfortably into any level of the social hierarchy. For him the main thing is to occupy a place in this system. He or she can carry out any official work, and conduct his business relations in accordance to the occupied position: make demands of subordinates and try not to argue with his higher-ups. "The management knows better" - is an LSI phrase, and the argument: "I was only carrying out orders" - is the most convincing one. And it is incomprehensible to the ISTj how it's possible to dispute this. According to LSI's hierarchical logic, within his system the subordinates must obey those standing above them, and the young must obey the elders.\n\n5.  He loves to use verified tried-and-tested methods, especially if they agree with his own point of view and are known by him to bring positive results.\n\n6. He doesn’t agree with the assertion that "any pleasure in this life comes at a price";. In his understanding, the ability to tune and adjust one's experiences with the orientation towards harmony and pleasure - is his own individual capability, his own merit. Therefore, why does he has to pay for it? Under no circumstances does he place his personal prosperity, well-being, and convenience under a destructive blow. Moreover, he tries not to create any precedents for this. If the current circumstances have already folded in an unfavorable to him manner, he will try to come out of this situation with minimal losses for himself. As a result of such attitude and values, he can make an impression of an egoistical, self-loving, insensitive person. Such opinions, that do arise in people around him, indeed substantially complicate his life. However, he will obstinately and stubbornly defend his right to live as he wishes, supporting and motivating it by the fact that he doesn't really want to cause suffering or problems to anyone else, and sincerely feels upset if his lifestyle causes suffering and inconvenience to anyone.\n\n7. His focus on the goal in the development of new procedures and new technologies. They are interested in any scientific discovery from the point of view of its practical application. He chooses a rational approach for any type of work. While at this, his rationalism sets a goal of increasing the effectiveness of labor and alleviating the work conditions to make them less burdensome. He can take on any assignment or task with enthusiasm, if only it would bring some real, concrete, perceptible benefit. \n\n8.  He is able to put strong pressure on other people, while never using a commanding tone. In situations when it is necessary for him to subordinate others to his will, he does this by taking action on his sensations – he begins to express whole "range" of unpleasant sensations: impatience, agonizing desire, irritation, suffering, offence, hostility. As a result of such displays, much sensory discomfort is created, which painfully acts on others. Applying this method, he achieves fulfillment of many of his desires and requirements with relative ease. As a rule, they don't know about the force of their volitional effect. They do not recognize or realize it. Frequently they tend to view themselves as a kind of soft, amiable, and reasonable people. They do not always understand why other people so quickly yield to their wishes.\n
6	I feel obligated to point out that there are only 8 numbered paragraphs.\n\nHaven't read all of them yet, so I can't weigh in on my opinion.
5	I agree with all, except #3 maybe.\n\nYes we are (I am) loyal but you have to deserve it. Break our trust and you're done. I have no problem becoming a 'lone wolf' if my trust is broken.\n\n4 *He can settle comfortably into any level of the social hierarchy. For him the main thing is to occupy a place in this system.*\nI'm not disagreeing but damn.. when you say it like that.. :p\n\n6 got to me. I never thought about it like that, but it's true.\n\n7 *He can take on any assignment or task with enthusiasm, if only it would bring some real, concrete, perceptible benefit.*\nYes!
4	You must really be bored.
2	The paragraphs that apply to my ISTJ bf:\n1., 4. (but he doesn't blindly follow), 5., 6. (he has a knack for rationalizing any of his guilty pleasures...), 8.\nMaybe 2. though it seems to be describing my understanding of Ti. And maybe 3. though it seems to emphasize inferior Fe, my ISTJ still likes to be part of some type of existing social order. Maybe 7. too but he's a bit more reluctant to learn new things; he sees it as an additional chore. I never thought that he did 8. until I read it here... it's true. I guess that's where he does the "woe is me" thing and gets my sympathy so I can be more flexible about his schedule. \n\nI can see 2., 6., and 7. applying to ISTPs too. \n\nSource: was in a 3 yr relationship with an ISTP, and now in a 2 yr relationship with an ISTJ.
1	1-5: Ehh, not really, but I like stability though\n\n2-3-4:nope\n\n7:kind of, I think the description exaggerates a bit here\n\n6-8:Relatable\n\nI identify as SLI and have read some of those before so it might be a little bias. I thought about how SLI and LSI converts to Mbti and I personally think that theres prob a similar amount of each of those finded in people identifying as Istj/Istp.
2	Weekly Thread: what conspiracy theory/theories do you believe in?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week’s question is: what conspiracy theories do you believe in? Original theories welcome!
6	This is borderline, but I believe there's other life out there in the universe. There's no way, with all the billions and billions of planets, suns, moons and other shit out there in space, that there's not something alive somewhere.
3	I wouldn't be surprised if life was found elsewhere. In general, though I don't believe in nearly anything without enough proof to satisfy me.
3	I don't generally actively believe any conspiracy theories 100%. There are some that I find more plausible than others, but I stop there because there isn't really a way to be absolutely sure without the government admitting it or something. Generally, the evidence is circumstantial and that isn't enough for me.
3	Most people wouldn't consider anything they believe to be a conspiracy theory. That said, back in high school I believed that the government staged events (some mass shootings, possibly 9/11) to push policy.
2	Not that I trust the government, but I don't believe in any conspiracy theories. I believe it's likely there's other life out there in the universe, but I don't believe it's interacting with us in any way.
2	I'd like to think there is life elsewhere honestly. 
8	Feelings of Shame	Do you ever feel like you're being made to feel embarassed or shameful as an attack on you meant to force you into doing something you don't want to do? Or that you would subconsciously react to it at least. Like getting really upset because someone said something that you interpreted as a move made to push you into submission through a displeasing remark on your person.
2	Lol, NFPs feel that all their lives until we grow backbones enough to say, "No, this is me, and I'm going to be me, not you." My mother is an ISTJ and I remember the first time I ever told her I didn't care what she thought, because I was going to be me, she was so shocked and thought me disrespectful. But no, I'm not being disrespectful, she was just so used to thinking I ought to do things how SHE thinks is correct.\n\nShe and my grandmother still try and pressure me into being a nurse because it makes sense. Me, it can make sense all day long, but if I'm going to be miserable in it, then why do it?
11	Seeking emergency dating advice (INTP-ISTJ)	I'm the NT; he's the SJ. Both 'T' types. He's...perfect. Exactly what I wanted in a baffling and alarming way. I'm hoping someone can help decode his behavior, explain whether I still have a shot, and advise how best to proceed assuming I haven't wrecked everything. \n\nWe exchanged several emails prior to meeting in person. Immediate and visceral chemistry upon meeting, though he kept it chill in SJ fashion. \n\n"Wow, __...you're incredibly handsome!" //visible shock \n\n"You, too. :)"\n\nHe invited me over, offered the shower (I'd worked a double that day) put on a movie, made drinks, and mine was a bit too strong. That's not why we had sex, but maybe why I was more of the aggressor (initially; he quickly took over *swoon*).\n\nBy then it was around 6am. I don't sleep well in strange beds, so the sex only put me under a few hours. Then I was awake and chatty/"OhShit;SJsarecrazyresponsible.Whatifhewon'tlikemeanymorebecauseIfuckedhimonthefirstdate?"\n\nFifteen minutes into that:\n\n"__, I think you'd better head on out."\n\nThe SJ has decided it's time for me to leave—he needs his sleep—and is kindly efficient about making that happen. Of course, I comply, explaining about and apologizing for my insomnia, etc. Some more light conversation in which I attempt to intuit what's actually happening (sleep, of course—but does he want to see me again?) , this last thing where I look up at him and he shutters his eyes. There's pain, and I can't figure out whether it's pity or regret or what's going on. So I leave. \n\nThis was Friday night/Saturday morning. Last night, I still hadn't heard from him and decided to text my number (only iMessages up to that point). I realize it was a mistake to text and that I should have waited. Then I went one better and told him I liked him, wasn't good at games, needed to plan my weekend and hoped I'd hear from him.\n\nI think I messed up on multiple levels, and I'm not sure the situation can be salvaged. This is pretty embarrassing, so I'd appreciate if people would refrain from being cruel. Give it to me straight, but don't be an ass about it. \n\n\nTL/DR: I'm afraid I've run off an ISTJ by being too intense. What can I expect/what do I do? How can I tell courtesy from actual interest? He sent me home with clean clothes; will he want them back?\n\n\nUPDATE: He "doesn't think we're a match, sorry, but best of luck to me." I  thanked him for letting me know, said I'm sorry too, and I guess that's the end of that. :-(\n\nUPDATE #2: (Scrapped). Gotta let it go. Will let it go. I'm a good person right now. I'm worthy.\n\nUPDATE #3: And yet... :-/\n\nBehold, Judgers: Prospecting in all its lurid finery. :) A nightmare, isn't it?\n\nI really appreciate all of the insightful suggestions. I'm glad I finally delurked. :-)
3	Ok. So just wait. Don’t text more and make it worse. \n\nThere r two possibilities\n1) He’s genuinely busy and can’t get to the phone RN. MAAYY BE IT’S A REALLY BAD TIME and He’s avoiding u, to not take the stress of some other situation out on you, for no reason. \nIt is only logical, to get back to someone you like, when one is calmer.\n\n2) You really fucked up. And he doesn’t wanna see you again. Sooo texting him over and over may only make you look more clingy, illogical and show ur inability to stay calm. \n\nFor your sake I am hoping it is 1. If it is, and he texts you after a week or something, just say “yeah I figured there must have been a goof-up. That’s why i didn’t text more. Hope everything is alright now”\n\nIf it is 2. Then text, Say, after 2 weeks. “Hey, haven’t heard from you in a while. Hope you’re alright. And sorry if I came on too intense. Hit me up if you feel like getting a drink.”\n\nISTJs can be unforgiving. It may be a while before he texts. GOOD LUCK. \n\nP.S. wait for someone to second this advise. 
5	>I think I messed up on multiple levels,\n\nThis is for me a relationship thing more than an MBTI-specific thing but: I don't understand why you think you, specifically, messed it up. You're two consenting adults, you both decided to have sex on your first date, you both made the choice not just you alone.\n\n> I'm afraid I've run off an ISTJ by being too intense. \n\nIf you can't be yourself with a person, then it's probably best to know that upfront IMO.\n\n>Last night, I still hadn't heard from him and decided to text my number (only iMessages up to that point). I realize it was a mistake to text and that I should have waited. Then I went one better and told him I liked him, wasn't good at games, needed to plan my weekend and hoped I'd hear from him.\n\nI personally don't see why direct communication like this would be a problem when sent to an ISTJ. Now, keep in mind that I'm saying this from the outside (I'm an INFJ in a 2-year serious and quite healthy relationship with an ISTJ), so YYMV as they say.
1	Let’s talk privately. 
1	Is he still being confusing, or has he withdrawn? If he's still showing interest even though he's 'cut ties', he's confused about his feelings or scared of making a commitment. If not, he's made the decision to withdraw and pursing him probably isn't a good idea.\n\nIf he's still showing interest, the only question left is why. Is there a moral reason why he would hesitate? (another girl, maybe his friend likes you, ect.) Is he in a point in his life where a commitment would be a bad idea for some reason? If a potential reason immediately comes to mind, chances are that's at least part of his hesitation.\n\nFrom there you can consider whether you can do anything about this source of hesitation. If you can't, I'd give him space, connect with other people, but leave the door open (don't play the jealousy game, we'll see right through that and resent it, just take care of yourself and see how your feelings evolve). If you can... it depends. Too many variables to plan any further.\n\nHope this helps!
7	What other type would you be for a day?	I like being my type, but I think if I could choose another type for a day id be most interested in ISTJ.  If y’all had to pick one, what would it be and why?
16	Probably ENFP because I want to see what it's like to be the polar opposite. 
10	You will pry my J from my cold, dead, hands. Probably my T as well. I like connecting with people, it just exhausts me. And the sensing/ intuitive trait is the one I'm closest to middle on. So I would try entj. Familiar enough to feel safe, different enough to satisfy. 
5	Something with dominant Se. I'd like to experience the world using this instead see what it changes :)
5	ESTP, maybe? Or ISTP. Both types always seem so confident about themselves and their surroundings; it would be cool to know what that feels like.
3	INFJ. Extroversion still doesn't appeal to me, but it'd be nice to see what the creative-happy-feels actually are. Maybe then I wouldn't have a headache from overthinking.
2	ESFP...I don't why but part of me would love to be that person that can handle and seek attention.
8	Weekly Thread: You have to remove all the non-standard apps on your phone except for 3. Which ones do you keep?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's question is: if you were only allowed to keep 3 non-standard apps on your phone, which ones would you keep?
6	Relay, discord, and pokemon go
5	Local bus app, discord, cube cube 
3	Spotify, Reddit, and probably Snapchat based on frequency of use.
3	Downcast, Alien Blue, Ingress
2	That's easy: Twitterrific (I'm on Twitter a lot), WhatsApp (to text with my friends and family), Spotify (music is important).\n\nThere are several apps I'd miss (Google Maps, narwhal, PCalc, and a few more), but I think I could find workarounds for those apps.
2	Thunderspace (white noise/rain and thunder sound generator), Waze (Helps me avoid traffic and cops; vital in the Los Angeles basin), and Alien Blue to get my Reddit fix!
2	I'd keep Instagram, Suntrust, FB Messenger.\n\nI can use the rest in other ways. I would keep Tumblr and YouTube but the Tumblr app is a mess and I don't check YT on my phone all that much.\n
2	Reddit, overdrive, twitch
2	Reddit to stay in the loop; bank of america because who needs brick and mortar banks anymore; & pokemon go because I'm nearly level 30
2	Spotify, Snapchat and Epocrates 
2	Youtube, equaliser+, soundcloud
2	Local bus app, Reddit & Starbucks app.
2	Google, YouTube, Reddit in that order
2	Spotify, Reddit, and Discord.
2	Reddit is Fun, Discord, Duolingo
2	Pinterest, Glassdoor, and Yelp.
2	Instagram(portfolio), Snapchat(social) and Reddit(browsing) I suppose. \n
1	I'd keep MyFitnessPal (to help me stay healthy), PocketCast (to help me learn more about topics i'm interested in), and WhatsApp (to stay in touch with family and friends, most of whom live far from me)
6	Do you like a cappella or choir music?	
14	Not at all, I can barely listen to any classical music with vocals, despite enjoying a lot of instrumental classical music. In 'modern' music I rarely give any consideration to the lyrics of songs. 
5	Yes, both. Been singing in choir for like 15 years. 
4	A cappella music irritates me, but a choir in classical music is nice. 
3	If it counts, I listen to a great deal of Gregorian chant/sacred polyphony. Additionally, tons of choir music. No Acapella, though.
1	I do like a cappella, but I am not a fan of choir music.
1	I seem to have a clear preference for choir music. my current favorite is Africa by the Angel City Choir 
1	I don't listen to choir music, but I like good a cappella. I enjoy groups like Pentatonix.\n\nI do like barbershop as well.
1	In terms of mainstream, I do enjoy Pentatonix. I did orchestra in middle and high school, but we did some concerts with Choir sometimes and Eric Whitacre's stuff is beautiful. Also, "O Magnum Mysterium" is my go-to study music.
1	Not really. I'm honestly into all music, but a capella and choir isn't really my thing. My wife likes it though.
4	Personality and music taste survey -- need some data to back my thesis proposal	hi, anyone you take a quick personality test https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test <-- (don't need to create an account on the site)\nthen take a survey on your music taste? https://goo.gl/forms/lzqPk8jGD6oYXEy22\n\nWould be huge. Help me get preliminary validation for my hypothesis, hopefully I can post the results later on.\n\n(I know it's not MTBI ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
7	You should tell people they need to remember or record their scores from. The personality test.  I didn't do that and now can't do the music taste survey without redoing the personality test which is not happening.
4	Lot's of music genres to choose from: Electronic, Rap/Hip Hop, R&B, EDM/Dance, Pop, ... \nBut you only put down Rock. No metal or punk.\nSo I had to pick Others. Meh.
3	Done! Ended up checking almost all the genres because I listen to most of those on a weekly/regular basis.
1	Good luck!
1	Ok I took your "Tast", probably need more sub genres (Metal, Soundtrack, etc.)
7	Weekly Post: What's your go-to outfit?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's question is: what is your go-to outfit combo?
7	Blue jeans and black undershirt, with some kind of button down casual shirt over (season dependent). Wilderness Tactical instructors belt and Ecco Track II boots. For hot summers, sub khaki shorts and Chacao sandals.
6	Being a guy is great.\n\nI just have a few pairs of slim dark jeans and trousers and a dozen or more long sleeve button up shirts in colours that go with my pants.\n\nChoose one out of each category and I'm sorted.\n\nMost of the shirts are dressy enough that I can pair them with blazers or suits but not too dressy that I can also wear them with jeans and a bomber jacket. It's hard finding ones that meet this criteria though.
5	For winter/fall it's generally a jacket + jeans/leggings + black riding boots.\n\nI have a wide variety of jackets varying from light jackets, rain jackets, dressy/spiffy jackets, snow jackets, etc. I love jackets! :)\n\nAnother favorite look of mine is [sweater dresses + boots](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1920&bih=915&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=sweater+dress+%2B+boots&oq=sweater+dress+%2B+boots&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i30k1l2j0i8i30k1l8.38987.40608.0.40784.8.8.0.0.0.0.93.708.8.8.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.8.704...0j0i67k1.0.M3K0ElVyCVw#imgrc=_)
3	Brown chino pants and a short sleeve button down that has tiny shoes on it. 
4	Tshirt, yoga pants, converse. If it’s cold, add jacket. 
4	I only ever wear black, usually jeans and a band shirt or plain black t shirt.
3	A black t shirt and khaki shorts. 
3	Leggings and a T-shirt/sweatshirt. (College student)\n
3	Jeans.  T-shirt.  Steel-toe work boots.
3	One of my chino pants (grey or khaki or burgundy), a white dress shirt (I have three of the same), and one of my two blazers that both match all of my pants. Can’t go wrong!
3	white/black t-shirt, dark indigo denim, vans or new balance shoes. 
2	I don't really have one. 
2	Black  slip on espadrilles. \n\nCotton Baggy blue/denim coloured track pants with ivory drawstrings. (common cotton pants that have the shape of track pants being a sort of recent style, got a blue/denim look because I no longer wear jeans) \n\nThin lavender cropped flannel shirt with metal snap buttons and-straps to hold rolled up sleeves. \n\nIt's cosy, slightly colourful and easy to wear. I especially love shirts recently and only shirts with the snapping metal "buttons" they-are-a-miracle- product ! Also I've been trying to get back into colour, mostly soft blues and light lavenders as aforementioned.\n
2	Depends on the weather and the occasion. For work, it's going to be business casual, but for school, I tend to go for: blue jeans/black jeans/black leggings/black pants + plaid shirt + flats of some sort.
2	jeans and a polo shirt to work. also bates brand  8" combat boots, for the ankle support.\n\non days off, usually a t-shirt, and sometimes crocs instead of the boots.
2	Print tee shirt and basketball shorts in summer, print tee and jogging pants/sweatpants in fall, print tee, hoodie, and jogging pants/sweatpants in winter.
2	Jeans/Chinos, button down, black shoes. Depending on formality maybe a tie, colors are generally earthy or muted (brown, grey, green, blue, cream, black)
2	I just usually do something simple with not too much color since I am color blind and I want to amer sure it matches
2	Being in Florida, plain color v neck tee and shorts or jeans. Sometimes a long sleeve button up with sleeves rolled.
3	What has been your best Christmas/ New Year’s Eve celebration and what’s your plan this year?	I’ve never had a really good one. Trying to do something different this year...\n\nAsking this subReddit because the majority of the population would say “go to a party! Wear high heels... blaaaahhh.. be extroverted.”\n\nMy immediate internal response to that is always “Hmm. NEVERMIND. I am not doing anything this year either.”
3	[deleted]
2	Inasmuch as parties are not usually my thing, I *have* had a lot of fun at my company's Christmas party the past couple years. \n\nOne of my favourite Christmases involved renting a cabin in the mountains, staying in by a fireplace and drinking cocoa with my fiancee.\n\nI feel like an atypical ISTJ sometimes because I do enjoy spending some time around other people and have been known to enjoy parties (but mostly just at Christmas time). 
2	Usually I just spend Christmas with my wife, and her family as well. We used to go to Church, but we haven't in a few years because there's a lot of stuff we disagree with when it comes to the church in general.
2	>“go to a party!\n\nNope.\n\n>Wear high heels\n\nNope on multiple levels.\n\n>be extroverted.”\n\nNope.\n\nSo, when I was a kid, Christmas went like this:\n\nOpened Christmas presents at home on Christmas Eve.\n\nWent to paternal grandmother's house for dinner on Christmas Eve, a few presents were exchanged, but the show was dinner. Was usually just us, dad's mom, and Paw Paw (only grandpa I ever really had, he was dad's mom's husband, but not dad's dad or dad's stepdad).\n\nGot Santa Claus presents on Christmas Day.\n\nWent to maternal grandmother's house on Christmas Day for Christmas dinner and more presents.  This was usually a production, since it was our family of 5, mom's sister's family of 5, and my grandmother.  Dinner was a big feast, presents were a huge pile for everyone, and I would guess what each person's presents were by sound and/or feel as I passed them out.  After a couple of years of ruining the surprises for everyone, I was no longer allowed to pass out presents, but I continued to try to guess my own with surprising accuracy.\n\nThen we all grew up, some family drama happened, some people died (well, one person, but cancer is an asshole), and all of that stopped.\n\nWe never developed a tradition for New Years.  I usually go hang out with friends, which is mostly sitting on their couch shooting the shit.  Occasionally, there will also be a D&D or Shadowrun game.
2	Thanks to my father, every new year since I was 5 has involved video games due to his work. As a result it has become tradition for me to binge a solo player campaign until midnight. Then 15 minutes before midnight I switch on some music, put a countdown the TV either HDMI from a laptop or a news program. Eat pizza with close friends and watch the fireworks over the back fence/(on TV depending on where I am). After about 5 minutes past midnight I go back to video games and if I finish the campaign game I try something new or play online games with friends I haven't spoken to in a long time/make some new friends to neglect
2	My only consistent Christmas tradition is watching Lampoons Christmas vacation each year. \n\nThis year I am spending Christmas with my boyfriends parents, grandparents, brothers, and their girlfriends. It's my first time meeting his family 
2	Christmas Eve I spend with family, watch Elves (1989) with my brothers, and go to sleep. Christmas day I go to Church/spend time relaxing. Lots of eating in between. \n\nNew years Eve is basically the same thing, minus the movie.
2	I spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day with my family. Normally Boxing Day too but this year I'll be spending Boxing Day flying home, thanks to work.\n\nThe best NYE I had was a two-day gathering with my high school friends at a friend's house near the beach. I probably couldn't handle it now, but at the time I could be "on" for that long around people I was that close with (I did take a couple of days to recover afterwards though).  The nicest one I've had since then was watching Rogue One last year. No plans as yet this year, but now that Netflix has the entire Dollars trilogy... I can't binge that because I'm working on NYE, but I can spread it over three days maybe.
27	What are some important things for ISTJs to learn?	I'm talking about things we particularly struggle with. Something related to social skills perhaps?
31	I'm trying to learn I can't control everything and sometimes people don't want you to solve their problems, they just want you to listen.
19	How to love and show affection.
18	That relationships need maintenance. \nSometimes I need to ignore the mess and cuddle a child. I might be thinking the whole time about what needs to be done, but other people have emotional needs that I don't understand. 
17	Sometimes to maintain work/personal relationships, you can't hold people to as high standards as you hold yourself.
13	If you are open to an outside INTJ perspective, here are a couple things I’ve learned over time I wish I could bestow to every type:\n\n1. Bluntness is refreshing and appreciated, though a bit of tact when it comes to criticisms can go a long way. I want my work, character, or values to  be improved or corrected, not belittled, so Ive learned to practice extra consideration in this area. Respect is lost for people who use truth and honesty as justification for being disrespectful or inconsiderate. It is a moment of self righteousness under the guise of progress. \n\n2. Ask questions before assuming or judging. I’ve had work dismissed as pointless based on what they knew instead of asking why I was doing it. Lo and behold, there were facts they did not know at the time making it worthwhile. But once said, it cannot be taken back, and a simple question could’ve spared a misstep that is hard to gain back.\n\n3. Give credit where credit is due. It takes time to stop and recognize how people around you are showing they care or a job well done, but pausing to express gratitude is always classy.
12	The purpose of friendship?
12	I've always struggled with "If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself" because it makes me really stubborn as a wife and mom. I'll often get irritated when someone is trying to help me because they don't do things my way. I'm recovering from surgery at the moment and I'm really trying to learn to let go of my hang-ups and see that there are many ways my partner can get things done around the house even if they aren't logical, waste time and resources, etc. **I'm learning to let go of what I can't control**. It's been quite the mental exercise, let me tell you, but I'm sure I the long run it will help my relationship with my partner. 
6	I am trying to use more words. 
8	To learn that there are always different standpoints, not just one, which is ours. Haha! \nWhat may seem logical and right to us may not be to other people, so we always tend to argue just to prove our point and hurt the other person, without us even knowing it. 
7	Showing empathy. I'm absolutely terrible at it.
5	That many of the decisions we make are based on our own past experience. If we have experience to drawn on, we’ll use it to make a decision. If we don’t, we often have to gather more information until we feel like we have enough before we can make a decision.\n\nThis can sometimes lead to a) bad decisions based on something learned incorrectly in the past, or b) analysis paralysis as we try to decide what to do when we have no past experience to draw from and we don’t feel like we have enough information to make a decision. \n\nSometimes I have to remember that just because I’ve done something a certain way in the past doesn’t mean someone else’s way is wrong. And sometimes I have to make a decision with what I feel is insufficient information. 
2	Always trust your intuition. You will fight yourself on it, but it's right 
8	ISTJ vs INTJ ~ How To Tell Them Apart	
6	New Job Not Fit for ISTJ?	I'm am engineer who changed jobs 6 months ago from private to public sector. I mainly changed because of the pension (earlier retirement), job security, and the ever elusive 40 hour work week.\n\nOne of the things I did not anticipate was going from working for one manager on large projects to three or more managers all with their own small projects/tasks. The last 3 years I was always working on one, maybe two, design projects at a time for weeks on end, but now in my current role I'm juggling 8-12 different project tasks at a time. Some I'm supposed to take on as designer. Some I'm supposed to manage younger engineers/interns on. Multiple times a week I have to cover for inspectors or complete reviews for them.\n\nOn top of this my reporting manager is constantly changing what task is my priority. Oftentimes daily. I know a lot of my stress simply comes from having to jump from project to project and never really get into them.\n\nMy question that I'm having trouble answering is that even if my boss didn't keep changing direction all the time, as an ISTJ am I still going to go crazy trying to juggle a position where I'm expected to wear the hats of designer, manager, and even inspector all at once? \n\nIve brought up to my manager once before that the constant change of priorities is keeping me from getting anything done. His reply was that I'll get used to it. I don't want to keep bringing this up as my problem if in the end my personality simply can't handle being pulled in so many directions all the time.
7	Don’t look at personality typing as a list of your limitations. It is only a description of how we function cognitively.\n\nContinue to communicate your troubles with your boss. Try to work on adapting as well as you can, but it may honestly be a management problem and not a personal problem. This is the sort of thing that requires communication, reevaluation, and adjustments.\n\nIt’s not wrong to express yourself if the situation is unworkable, and it doesn’t come down to a personality flaw. You were hired because they expected you to fit their needs, but some compromise and adjustment is always needed to make such a complicated system work out.
3	>On top of this my reporting manager is constantly changing what task is my priority. Oftentimes daily. \n\nI think I'd punch somebody if I had to deal with that.\n\n>My question that I'm having trouble answering is that even if my boss didn't keep changing direction all the time, as an ISTJ am I still going to go crazy trying to juggle a position where I'm expected to wear the hats of designer, manager, and even inspector all at once? \n\nProbably a bit until you figured out how to make it work for you.\n\n>I don't want to keep bringing this up as my problem if in the end my personality simply can't handle being pulled in so many directions all the time.\n\nWe can, it just takes us longer to adapt to it.  \n\n>Ive brought up to my manager once before that the constant change of priorities is keeping me from getting anything done. \n\nThis can actually be the case.  I know several times, by boss (the guy who owns the company and signs my paychecks) has pulled me off of my normal duties to assist him with things that have nothing to do with the company (which is even more frustrating to me than constantly getting bounced between projects).\n\nIf questions arise about why certain things didn't get done, I just remind him that he kept redirecting my attention away from those things.\n\nConsider trying this:\n\nFind out the deadlines for each project and create a schedule that budgets sufficient time to meet all of those deadlines.  Rather than having your manager dictate to you the most important thing to do *right now*, show him the schedule based on those deadlines, and tell him if the scope of work changes, you'll adjust the schedule accordingly.
3	> On top of this my reporting manager is constantly changing what task is my priority. \n\nTo me, this sounds like micromanaging. Unless things work differently in the engineering world, in my opinion your manager should be communicating to you what needs to be done by what time, and then let you work out the day-to-day. I have never had a supervisor who attempted to micromanage, but I imagine it would drive me crazy....and it drives a lot of people crazy, not just ISTJs. \n\nYour manager is the problem, not you. \n\nUnfortunately I don't have any advice on how to tell your manager to cool his heels, but you are not the only person to have this issue so you should be able to find other help online. 
5	Weekly Thread: What accomplishment are you proud of but don't like to brag about?	Welcome to the weekly thread! This week's question is: we all do things that we're proud of, but can't always share these accomplishments. What accomplishment are you proud of?
9	I really don't like to brag about anything, and the less people know about me, the better, in my opinion. I don't tell people about myself unless they ask.\n\nHardly anyone knows that I drive a 1975 Corvette, even though I'm 19. Hardly anyone knows how and why I got this car.\n\nJust passing me on the street, I look pretty normal. Nobody knows I have a scar 16 inches long across my stomach. Nobody knows that I almost died in the hospital, that I was on dialysis for 2 weeks, and I had no hair.
4	I don't like to brag about anything, so I don't.
5	I'm a CPA but don't mention it unless I'm asked about it.
3	I'm a really good cook. I love being a good cook but suck at accepting compliments. I'm also a feeder, it's how I show people that I care. I often take food to my friends when they need a pick me up or are sick or just as a random act of kindness. I don't do it for the thanks or praise but damn it sure would be nice sometimes. 
3	I'm a Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do. It's something i'm really proud of, but I don't talk about it often, because I feel like it *does* come off as bragging to be honest. 
2	I enjoy writing music and poetry, as well as cooking.
2	I'm a black belt in Aikido, make Gundam model kits aka Gunpla, decent at origami(been folding for 13yrs now), knitting, and tie paracord.
2	I bowled a 245

3	How can I best help my ISTJ friend grieve?	I made a new friend this year in school. As this is very rare for me (I'm INTP), I want to make sure I'm doing all I can to help him. He typed himself confidently as an ISTJ, so I was curious what techniques have helped you cope with grief in the past. \n\nHe recently lost his grandfather whom he was very close to. He is very introverted (~87%) and isn't one to show any negative emotions. When we were alone, I sat down with him and recommended that he at least vent to someone he trusted--that if he bottled it up, the pressure could eventually break him. I told him he could come to me if he felt comfortable doing so as I pass no judgement. He seemed thankful and did vent some, but now seems to be just going through the motions and "burying it" while he keeps himself busy. This is probably his own way of coping, but I want to make sure I'm doing all I can. \n\nThanks.
14	We tend to work through stuff internally.  As long as he's *actually* working through it internally, he'll get through it.  Once he's through it, he may be willing to talk about it.\n\nIf you want to help, be there for him, make sure he knows you're there for him, but don't push or pester him.
3	Best thing is make a plan to come over and just hang out. Bring him dinner or watch a movie or game. What we need is presence. 
2	I'm an ISTJ and personally believe that each of us should have at least one INTP friend, so glad to hear you two found each other. For me personally, you have done all I could ask for. The rest takes time and reflection.\n\n When I lost my grandmother I had the opportunity to say goodbye and went back to work until such a time as I was no longer needed for enough time to be alone. I spent the afternoon in a bar having a few drinks and all I wished for was for a friend to be there to bounce a few things off of and say they cared. You gave your friend that, so I think all you can do is to keep being available. Don't force anything, just be there.
1	"that he at least vent to someone he trusted--that if he bottled it up, the pressure could eventually break him."\n\nWhat evidence do you have of this? Last, I check i bottle alot of things and i'm pretty well of. 
0	Are ISTJs afraid of blood?	Or is it just my dad?
20	Not afraid of blood 
10	That's not an ISTJ thing.\n\nI grew up helping my Paw Paw in the back of his butcher shop. I've never been bothered by blood.\n\nEarlier this year (February 26th to be exact) I got stupid and careless with a knife and nearly cut off the tip of my left pinky finger. It bled a ridiculous amount, but I applied first aid on my own. It looked pretty nasty glued back into place, but it has healed nicely. 
5	Nope.
3	No.  I like to look at the blood vial when I'm having lab work done. 
2	I am 😂
2	Just because people have the same MBTI type doesn't mean they're clones of each other.
1	No. I'm a nurse. 
1	Not I. 
1	It's just him.
1	Cuts and blood make me nauseous, but it’s not a personality thing. 
1	Nah.
1	I work with blood for a living. I draw blood and do testing on blood. So, I'd say not. 
1	No, 30yr diabetic
1	What the fuck
1	Not really. It never bothered me to be honest.
1	Blood is fine. Bones out of body? Meh...
1	This is a stupid question.

3	How to help an ISTJ in Fi loop.	I have an ISTJ friend who displays the following behavior.\n\n>When Fi takes too strong a role in cognition and overtakes Te, forming an "SiFi loop", the ISTJ may completely and totally withdraw from virtually all surroundings and circumstances which are not immediately familiar and comforting to his sense of stable interpretive meaning. All forms of external interaction seems to involve uncertainty, which makes them inherently unsafe--avoidant behavior becomes the norm, as the ISTJ with poor Te finds himself both unable to confidently take command of any situation or assert his organizational abilities toward any productive end, and irrationally sensitive to any form of experiential input which does not align with the sense of dependable routine which defines the boundaries of his comfort zone. The SiFi loop ISTJ will continue to narrow his perceptual intake further and further, convinced that anything he doesn't already know completely will only attack and further corrupt or damage his easily impressionable sense of personal ethics and ideals. Inferior Ne--as we will see in the next section--leads to a flood of dangerous and threatening external possibilities which must be contained and avoided at all costs.\n\nHe's still using Windows 7 and I offered to buy him Windows 10 but he refused, saying he likes it the old way. He is severely depressed and I want to help him. \n\nI know nurturing auxiliary Te can be beneficial for him, but I have no idea how to nurture Te.\n\nI gave him a pair of earphones because I know Si-doms like to listen to music. Will it work?
5	I'm still a huge fan of Windows 7. A lot of changes made in the Windows 10 OS are designed to force you into services and information sharing that isn't beneficial for you. Hell they even try and trick you into linking your login with a Windows account and I don't trust them one little bit. *hermit intensifies*\n\nSeriously though I don't see what the problem is, if he's depressed there's not much you can do but Encourage him to visit a quack. I don't see what Windows 10 and earphones have to do with much.
6	I am seriously amused that "still using Windows 7 instead of Windows 10" is part of the diagnosis here.\n\nI wonder what kind of cognitive function loop I (INFJ) am in given that I'm into Linux and wouldn't touch Windows 10 with a 100 foot pole unless I absolutely had to.

3	I'm an INFJ in a ldr with an ISTJ... and I'm not sure if he still loves me ...	Hello everyone!\nThis is my first time here and I decided to start with a topic that its stressing me and giving me a lot of worries lately ...\nI met my boyfriend 6 months ago on a dating site and we got really interested on each other really quick and texted each other constantly ... after a month he wanted to meet me and from that day we started dating! He is my first boyfriend, while for him im his sixth, we have an age difference of 8 years and have different nationalities. Not that it was a problem for us ... \nWe started to meet once a month and I even started staying at his place at some weekends but ive notice an 180° change in his behaviour towards me ... he doesnt almost text me or even have long conversations anymore with me and the few and little time we are together he doesnt seem very intimate towards me... almost no talking, kissing or even hold hands or cuddling ... i know we have very different ways of seeing things and different necessities as its normal according to our personalities... ive tried to approach him about that but he insists he is the same and if he is its probably because he is been tired with work ... but it already passed some months and he is still the same ... i think we are really different but if he loves me back as i do then there's no problem, but i really cant tell and it feels like im doing almost all the effort ... he is very supportive but i don't want to annoy him also with all my problems ... we even got into fights because of that and even almost broke up ... \nIm really lost and seriously i cant express all the situation in here unfortunately ...\nHe was very intimate with me and seemed he loved me a lot, but now he changed dramaticly and doesnt even seems to try to be intimate with me anymore ... can someone help me understanding this? Thanks for the attention
7	Hey,\n\nI'm an INFJ in a nearly 2 year relationship with an ISTJ. A few things cross my mind reading your post:\n\n1. This may not have anything to do with your respective MBTI types. \n\n2. If you two are in fact correctly typed: Please take seriously the advice from the ISTJs here that direct communication is the way to go with an ISTJ. It really really is.\n\n3. See below for more general relationship commentary:\n\n>he doesnt almost text me or even have long conversations anymore with me and the few and little time we are together he doesnt seem very intimate towards me... almost no talking, kissing or even hold hands or cuddling ... i know we have very different ways of seeing things and different necessities as its normal according to our personalities... ive tried to approach him about that but he insists he is the same and if he is its probably because he is been tired with work ... but it already passed some months and he is still the same ... \n\nThere is  nothing about ISTJ info processing that would yield not being into physical touch as a means of connection in a relationship. My SO is extremely into all sorts of physical touch in an intimate relationship. It is a major mode of communication for her. Please don't assume that a lack of interest in physical touch is due to your ISTJ's MBTI type! It's not.\n\nApproaches to long conversations, however, may be related to differences in type. INFJs tend to want to process things through dialogue in ways that may not make sense to ISTJs. This hasn't been a problem in my case at all. I have my own channels for processing in dialogue and she and I have healthy verbal communication. But connection through INFJ-type verbal exchange is not something an ISTJ will necessarily be into and it is something you'd need to figure out if this relationship continued and/or became more serious.\n\n>He is my first boyfriend\n\nand\n\n>i think we are really different but if he loves me back as i do then there's no problem, but i really cant tell and it feels like im doing almost all the effort .\n\nMBTI aside, if you're in a relationship that is not meeting your needs, and if you have made the effort to communicate directly what your needs are and if his actions are showing that he can't meet your needs, then I strongly suggest you consider that this relationship isn't right for you. And it's okay, it doesn't mean either of you are wrong or anything like that, it's just that sometimes people aren't compatible (not due to MBTI types, just as people) and that really is okay.\n\nPlease keep in mind that 6 months is within the honeymoon period and that when those chemicals wear off, it feels different and things that seemed one way when the chemicals are coursing through your bodies may show themselves differently after that wears off. Also, LDRs are difficult, especially when one or both people need a physical grounding in the relationship (needing that layer of connection is perfectly normal and I would say is true of both myself and my SO, so can happen with both types).\n\nBottom line, reading your post: Please trust your gut. If this relationship isn't meeting your needs, and if your efforts to clearly communicate that haven't resulted in action/behavior that does meet your needs, that's okay, no one is at fault, it just may not be a relationship that's meant to persist in the long haul. Many relationships don't and seriously, it is okay for that to happen.\n\n\n\n\n
5	LDR? How far away do you live and how hard is it to meet? You seem to mention holding hands and cuddling,  but if you're in a LDR and have very sparse physical contact during the few times you DO meet,  then...... :(\n\n\nI can't imagine myself being in a LDR. I like reliability and would like the idea of coming home to a happy,  loving SO waiting for me.  Not sure about him though.  \n\nI would highly suggest just spending some time and talking directly about it.  No dancing around the subject.  Be clear and get to the point about what you want and what goals you want him to work toward. 
5	Joining the crowd with saying be direct, but in my experience being *clear* with your needs is also very important. I was in a relationship for years where dissatisfaction was expressed, but not paired with clear actions I could take to fix things. Bluntly staying exactly what you need/expect/want in relationship may be helpful.
8	Be direct and forthright in your desires for the future, and suggest practical relationship goals. And for godsake, do realize you're extremely long winded! We appreciate precision- especially in texting.
15	What bit of social etiquette drives you nuts?	 For me, I understand and appreciate the use of a "thank you" text or email. But the reception of a "you're welcome!" text or email just strikes me as a waste of time. 
13	the immediate exchanging of names in random social situations like a university lecture or a party.\n\nwould prefer to only let someone know my name and get to know theirs if I enjoy that person’s company. otherwise, you have this person you don’t necessarily like saying hi to you all the time from then on, or possibly adding you on facebook etc.\n\nmaybe this is an extreme point of view but I just prefer remaining anonymous in most situations. \n
18	Saying "bless you" when someone sneezes. This needs to stop. It's a pointless gesture and becomes even worse when the person sneezes multiple times.\n\nI've resorted to "keep it down over there" when someone sneezes, sort of a half-joke, but I'm so sick of when someone says "bless you" when I sneeze and the implication that I'll say "thank you" or something along those lines.\n\nJust...leave me alone. You can never go wrong leaving me alone. 
5	"Fashionably late", just show up on time please.
9	Ok, I'm ready for the "shut up you autist" comments but the bit of social etiquette that bothers me is talking. \n\nI walk down the street in the morning and instead of saying goodmorning to the neighbours I'd much rather just nod. Through nodding we acknowledge that we share mutual respect for one another and may go about my day without having to stop what I'm doing for you.\n\nWhen I'm buying something at a store, I know the price, I have cash in my hand before I come to the checkout. Sure if you wanna tell me what the price is even though I'm already aware I'm not going to be salty about prudence but I don't care how your day is and you don't care about mine. Just give me a smile as you take my cash and you've got good customer service in my books.\n\nI don't mind if you approach me trying to help. I don't mind if you're trying to optimise everyones experience but needless chatter bothers me.
2	I have a lot but the one I can think of rn is saying how are you or have a nice day...do you really care? 
2	How you're always suppose to always say you're doing well.
1	Dating. \n\nWhat I hate about it is that even if you or your date aren't lying when getting to know each other on the first few dates, you're not exactly being honest either. You always have to be careful about what you say and how you say it, so a lot of people end up trying to display some kind of idealized versions of themselves. I can tell when someone is trying to hold back from saying or doing something for fear of coming off as too offensive or stupid. The truth is I want to see the raw version of yourself. If you're brutally honest, show me that part of you. If something is bothering you, share it. Yeah, it's nice to know all the superficial things about you like where you work, what college you graduated from, or what your cat's name is, but if you want more dates, you gotta be willing to dig deeper for at least one topic of our conversation. 
2	Does ISFP+I/ESTJhave a happy ending?	I'm dating (i think) an I/ESTJ. It's been pretty undefined for a year so who knows what's going on.  This person never says anything about how he feels, and I don't know if I will ever know.  As an ISFP, I'm pretty into the whole 'feeling' thing but he isn't.  And he's definitely not big on affection.  Does anyone have a magic 8 ball that says anything beyond...     \n    ● Reply hazy try again\n    ● Ask again later\n    ● Better not tell you now\n    ● Cannot predict now\n    ● Concentrate and ask again\n    ● Don't count on it\n    ● My reply is no\n    ● My sources say no\n    ● Outlook not so good\n    ● Very doubtful\n?????\n
6	Never assume with an I/ESTJ. Face value is key with us. If the relationship is not define, it needs to be. Flat out ask what’s going on. It may be the push needed to figure it all out. You have a right to some definition. 
2	Hmmmm. I don’t know what that “x” means.  I need to look it up before I really respond. Hold on! 
1	ISTJ here, dated ESTJ for a year. i'm S too, so I used to try really hard to get him to say how he felt but it never worked. Still beats me how to do it. I just know I effed it up 
1	Sounds like IxTJ enneagram 5. They next to never talk about their emotions, which is why it's easier for an ISFP to have a relationship with ExTJ. Those guys are a lot more upfront that you don't have to guess and worry that much. Does he do things for you? Do you have goals together? Is his working to reach those goals? You have to go around reading their emotions, which are typically demonstrated by their actions and general direction rather than lovey-dovey words.
1	You think you're dating them, or you think they're an xSTJ?\n\nIf it's the former and you're pretty sure they're an xSTJ, just ask, and be direct.\n\nSomething like "I really like spending time with you, but I'm not sure where our relationship stands.  I know this may take a bit of time to process, so if you don't want to answer right now, that's fine.  But, are we dating?"\n\nIf you can word that more concisely, even better.  If they're an ISTJ (not sure about E's), you can probably skip all of it except the "Are we dating?" part, and if they don't answer immediately, just tell them to take their time and get back to you.
9	How do you guys handle doing things you don't want to do or that are out of your comfort zone?	I think how I feel rn would be more relatable to you guys so posting here :)\n\nMore in depth story that you can just ignore and answer the main question: \n\nI am extremely used to focusing on one specific thing and putting my heart into it, whilst ignoring everything else, be it health or other tasks I should be doing.\n\nBut my problem is that I do not have enough time to do a Certain Thing(it is a bunch of exams basically), so either I separate my work into chunks and do a bit of each chunk everyday over an extended period of time OR I take on the entire HUGE workload in one go over a tiny period of time and try my best to finish and hope for the best (which every single person I have spoken to about this, including professionals and teachers, has said is a horrible idea because it is 99.9% impossible to finish because the syllabus is enormous).\n\nI'm so used to focusing on specific long term goals though, I feel like if I try doing multiple things at once I'll just fuck it up somehow (I have tried and fucked up before). My heart, my gut, they both want me to just take this whole thing on and do my best, screw what everyone says! I am clinging to that 0.01% chance I have at this to do well.\n\nBut, logically, this is a pretty terrible idea and even if I'm uncomfortable with it I should learn to focus on multiple goals at once, it is a life skill that I should have regardless. I'm currently 16, and I'm sure it will help me a lot to get through work life and university.\n\nSo yeah. I cannot express to you how much I would rather just take on the massive workload instead of push it off for a while and do a little bit of it at a time, I want to get this done and move onnn... I mean, I could just suck it up and get to it since I know what the rationally best option is but, since I have a choice... why not do what my heart wants? :( even if it's a really really shitty idea...\n\nLike, that feeling where you just really want to do something but everything, adults, logic, reality, even yourself, is against you? UGH. Thanks in advance.\n\n\n^^also ^^no ^^I ^^don't ^^have ^^ADHD, ^^I'm ^^just ^^an ^^ENFP ^^:D ^^cheers!
3	I used to be pretty freaked out by things outside my comfort zone, but these days I get off on the anxious adrenaline that comes with trying new things. I look it up and make sure I know what I'm doing (also to double check that it's something I actually want to do), and then I just do it. I focus completely on the moment. It's exciting.\n\nIt still freaks me out, but in a good way. I try to turn the anxiety into productive energy, and if I'm still freaked out in a bad way (or it's something I didn't want to do in the first place) then I focus on the experiance as a learning opportunity. A terrible experiance can still be cool in retrospect, if for no other reason than a cool story.
6	Weekly Thread: What sort of work environment suits you best?	Welcome to the weekly thread! This week's question is: what sort of work environment would be ideal for you? Startup vs. corporate, small team or large, hands on boss or "if there's no issues, we don't need to talk" boss? 
8	Small team, little oversight, lots of autonomy, generally quiet.\n\nWhich is why I'm immensely grateful for my current role (and company), fits all of these pretty well.
7	I'd like to work individually for the most part, but when coming together, small groups are ideal. I'd like the boss to pay attention to us but not like a hawk. Watching our every move is uncool and unnecessary. Honestly, checking in at the beginning and end of the week would be ideal for me, kinda like, "so what's the plan?" and "how did things go?" I like little changes but a whole environmental re-do is unenjoyable. In terms of volume, the quieter the better.
5	Definitely one with a relatively small team in an enclosed area. Being left to crack on in a hushed environment with few distractions is the most conducive environment to suit my particular working style. 
5	Hands off boss\n> I dislike management that doesn't know what they're doing yet insist on directing me. Just rage quit a job because I was forced to take the blame for something my manager stopped me from doing. Part of the problem is my company underestimated the amount of labor required so the team of 8 I was on had to not only take calls for new orders but also had to respond to email requests (average backlog was ~100 emails) for new orders and finish out the above requests all while the phones rang off the hook. I'm good, but I'm not that damn good.\n\nSmall team\n>I really want a team sized for the job required of us, but I like small teams better than large ones. Small teams allow me to identify the habits and ethics of each member so I know who I'll have to clean up after and who I can rely on for backup. Smaller teams also seem to benefit management since they can keep track of who's on what job easier.\n\nCorporate\n>I probably wouldn't mind a startup, but it would require a good boss at the helm. Corporate is my preference only due to my vain hope that years in the industry has ironed out major inefficiencies.
3	My current manager provides almost no oversight or direction, which was disconcerting at first after years of micro managers, but I've found it suits me down to the ground.  Being able to largely work alone, identify my own priorities and work to my own schedule makes me so happy, as well as making me a better employee.  It's largely a result of a sucky manager who can't be bothered doing his job, but I for one am glad he's so hopeless!
15	Feeling Unappreciated	Have you guys ever feel unappreciated by your friends, even close ones? I sometimes just feel that a lot of my friends don't ever seek me out or contact for almost anything unless it is to fix something that they messed up or when sh*t hits the fan. I don't know, I could just be in a rut, been stressed out for over a week from school and working two jobs. Haven't got any real moral support from anyone, except from one close friend, which I don't get to see her that much due to travel distance and conflicting schedules. \n\nWhat do you all think? Anything helps, thanks.\n\n
4	Some people may be blunt enough to do it, but I could never just tell people to reach out more, or ask about this thing in my life, or do a small gesture to show you still care type of thing. It's like I want them to want to do it more, and it's when they don't want to that I get the most disheartened. \n\nThis is all from an INTJ perspective, though. May I ask what physical signs there might be when you feel this way? Something that could clue others into what's going on?
6	Yes, this happens to me a lot. Usually, I'm the moral support, so I don't have much of that myself.\n\nUsually, when this happens, I will treat my self to something. I'll get some fast food, or watch youtube for an hour. Just something that lets me forget about my issues for a little while.\n\nI don't really have any other helpful advice except to tell you that you're not the only one who this happens to. \n\n
3	I'm an infp who's been dating an ISTJ for 2 years. I try to send him occasional texts telling him how much I appreciate him and his hard work.  I would love to get more calls from him and be his trusted confidante but he tends to keep his problems to himself unless it's our designated time to spend together 1-2 times a week. What would you want from the infp to help you feel like you're supported? 
1	There's a saying that relates to things that you feel that you lack: 'to give more of it away'. \n\nWould you be open to test it out for a month? Finding as much ways to appreciate each of your friends? (There are a couple of scenes during the last 30 minutes of '[Before I Fall](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1691916/?ref_=nv_sr_1)' you could use as reference...if you are struggling to find which aspect of the personality of each of your friends you can appreciate...for maximum effect.)
9	ISTJ stuck with inner demons and how to handle them.	
12	Therapy. Sometimes, I don’t think we’re equipped to deal with these demons on our own. You may need to shop around for a therapist who fits you, but they’re out there. Just gotta find them.
5	Yep 100% therapy. Therapy saved my life. I find being an ISTJ made me really effective at using my time in therapy and understanding what I needed. I'm actually studying to my a therapist myself because I believe so strongly in the effectiveness of therapy for mental health. 
2	Hope you get well soon, what do you mean by inner demons tho? 
13	Thoughts on Dancing	This is something that I have thought about a lot in my time and I wanted to know if you all think similarly about this or this is some personal issue I need to resolve.\n\nSomeone recently brought this whole thing up when they said that they wanted to get me out to a party or dance or something (I don't know the correct terminology that would currently be used for such an event). This was a male friend and I am also male, so he wasn't asking me out or anything, but as an ISTJ, I'm not the biggest social butterfly.\n\nMy response was a fast "No". He was surprised at how quickly I shut him down. However, I have a problem with the physical act of dancing. No, I don't believe its wrong to dance or something, but I do feel incredibly uncomfortable. It's a feeling that makes me want to crawl out of my skin and hide in a corner.\n\nI have had several negative experiences in relation to dancing and none that were positive. This probably relates to my personal issue, but how do you guys feel about dancing, especially in social environments?
23	[deleted]
11	I love dancing when I've had a few drinks but if I'm sober there is no chance of it happening. I feel so self conscious and stupid. 
4	I love dancing, home alone. I would just as quickly I'd decline the opportunity around others though same with singing. I don't do stuff like that often, usually I'm just having fun in my own space and that's where it stays. 
5	Not ISTJ, but my gf is, and she likes dancing that has specific steps that can be learned and practiced and honed over time. She had taken a class in swing dancing before we met and likes that especially. She also knows how to waltz and two-step and some other stuff I can't remember. She has taught me some of this. We took a salsa class together as well. When we go out dancing, we go to a place where we can do this kind of dancing.\n\nShe is incredibly uncomfortable with dancing that doesn't have learned steps. The kind where you just get up and move to the music however you feel like doing. (Which has tended to be my organic preference).
3	I got into Djing because I didnt like dancing. Plus djing gives me a task at the party so I'm not bored trying to make small talk. 
2	Under the right circumstances I have no shame in breaking it down. 
2	Try adding a "thanks" or a "thank you" to the end of your "no."\n\n"No" pretty much always comes across as harsh.  For some reason, in a social setting, "no" is the equivalent of "Fuck off!"  Not sure why.\n\n"No thanks" or "No, thank you" get perceived as "I appreciate that you are thinking of me, but I must politely decline."\n\nBut yeah, someone comes up to me and is like "Let's dance!" and I'd probably give them a curt "no" as well.\n\nIt might depend on who's asking, though.  Anyone who knows me well enough to be part of my friend group would know better, which means they'd be doing it to troll me, hence, they get the "no" or maybe even an actual "fuck off."  \n\nIf it was a pretty girl, she'd probably get a baffled look and "huh?" because that's not a thing that happens to me, and I'd be so far out of my element, I'd freeze and not know how to respond.
2	I despise dancing. I’m just not good at it. 6’4”, white. Do the math. \n\nSo I decline any opportunities to dance. Same with karaoke. 
1	I am certainly not the most spontaneous dancer. I'm awkward at it too but part of me often wishes I took it up. I want to learn salsa or lindy hop! That looks so fun!\n
1	I usually feel shy about it nowadays since no one I know seems to like dancing, and I don't want to like, get up at a wedding and dance with a bunch of strangers. But I've personally had a lot of positive experiences with dancing, and I took classes for years as a kid and loved it. 
1	I do not like dancing, and it would be a hard "no thanks" from me unless it was someone I cared deeply for asking me (and I knew dancing was important to them).
1	I’m glad other people enjoy dancing. They are all (apparently) always having a much better time at a party than I am. \n\nI’m way too self-conscious to dance. To me the physical act of dancing is just so ridiculous that I just can’t get over it. I’ve tried to dance but I am less anxious about bungee jumping or skydiving than I am about getting on a dance floor. \n\nI think a lot of it has to do that I don’t like to put on public display things that I’m not good at. I’m a horrible dancer and I know it, and I don’t really have the inclination to learn, so I don’t. \n\nI wish I weren’t this way, but I am. 
1	I love dancing!!! I could spend a whole night dancing in the club without having a single drink! 
1	I had a blast at the few parties I went to when I was in college - went with girlfriends, ignored boys, were basically just being goofy on the dance floor and not trying to attract any attention. \n\nCollege was years ago, and I haven't been dancing since and don't plan to. I refuse to dance with strangers, it's uncomfortable to know strangers are watching me, and it's worse watching my girlfriends dance with guys they just met....plus it's loud and hot and there are too many people. No thank you! \n\nThat being said, I would love to ballroom dance if there were any places nearby that offered that (that were frequented by other young people) - I love a good cha cha!
1	My bf is ISTJ and he doesn't like dancing, but he caught me out of the blue one night when he was drunk and his ENFP friend got him to get up and start dancing. Then he got really into it. He put on some Madonna, he loves Madonna, and he started dancing the Girl Gone Wild dance that she does on stage. It was really entertaining and I have never seen him act this way ever. Usually he just stands there or sits there with his arms crossed in front of his chest with a stern look on his face. Lol!
1	Depends on the practicality. I used to live in a pretty dingy part of town so I picked up martial arts. \n\nDancing in general I personally see it as not practical. However, if a person uses it for social reasons, career reasons, or even health reasons then yeah dancing is very practical in that sense. 
1	I like dancing in front of the mirror, alone. I like slow dancing with my BF when we’re alone. \nHe taught me steps. \n\nHowever, I have always wanted to experience dancing in a club. BUT if someone I know saw me there, I would die!!!\n\nMy dancing is alright. It’s not something i would do at a talent show (Gawd no). So I also feel self conscious of that. 
5	Supervision relationship	So. According to socionics, you guys are in 'supervision relationships' with ENTJ. That is, your relationship with ENTJ come with an imbalance of power in your favour. Now, I've never known anyone who could best an ENTJ. Every other type has always been at the receiving end of ENTJ's uncompromising dom-Te. Please tell me your stories of besting the ENTJ!
3	Actually, my best friend is an ENTJ I believe. Our friendship is definitely interesting, to say the least. He is extremely outgoing and an off the wall person. He constantly is doing stuff spontaneously and coming up with stupid plans.\n\nThe way I "best" him is that I shut down his stupid ideas with logic and common sense. I'm essentially his moral compass at this point, and he usually asks if something is a good idea when I am with him.\n\nHe constantly admires the fact that I put up with his crap because "Nobody else ever could". There is an aspect of him pushing me into social situations, but I would never let him do that if it were actually a bad idea from an objective stance.\n\nWe constantly push and pull, but we are both bettering ourselves every day. In the end though, he would follow what my idea is because he believes that I'm the more mature one (which is objectively debatable). He understands that my process of logic is trustworthy.\n\nIn the end, I "supervise" him because he thinks of me as logical and mature. It's not something I do to him necessarily.\n\nAlso, this may make no sense to you. I just finished my homework and my brain is shot, but I was excited to punch out a response to this thread.
4	As an ENTJ 8 with a close friendship with an ISTJ I can offer a good perspective.  \n\n\nIt's not so much about "besting" an ENTJ, who bests who is a matter of circumstance. The supervision relationship is due to one important factor... Si...  \n\n\nWe both value Te, so on that front neither of us really have to look out for each other in that regard. \n\n\nWhen it comes to Ni stuff like forecasting, big picture thinking, or whatever, I'm more focused on that, but in his Role Ni way, he's also good at it, just it's not his primary focus. So while there have been times where I'm like "considering what you're saying we should focus on, if we do, what do you think will happen later down the road?" and he's like "ohh... yeah this is a bad idea". It's not something he's BAD at and he can keep up.  \n\n\nNow Si... It's his strong point (Si dom after all) and I have virtually no Si. My memory is unreliable as fuck, little attention to detail, meticulousness is not my style, and anything that requires these things I tend to be super incompetent at, which angers him. It was easy earlier on in our friendship to consider my PolR Si ways "laziness", and it's not too far from the truth. I definitely act lazily when it comes to the nitty gritty. But I know how important ironing out the details and fact checking my speculations are (even if it is difficult for me). So as much as I **hate** it, i sorta have to listen to the guy.\n\n\nTl;dr it's more like ISTJs are good at things I value, but I'm not good at things they value hence the supervisory relationship.
3	There is a ENTJ posting on 16T forum who has been married to an ISTJ (SLI) for quite some time until they separated. [He posts a lot about it](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/52815-Long-term-effects-from-intertype-relations?p=1167888&viewfull=1#post1167888). In his case it sounded like the ISTJ was the initiator in their relationship. And ENTJs aren't really all that straightedge and uncompromising. In Socionics they have ['victim' romancing style](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Romance_styles) and are particularly sensitive towards sensing functions.
3	Best friend is an ENTJ. Can confirm. I wouldn't say I "best him" but he will rarely do something I disapprove of without at least asking my reasoning and it usually leads to some healthy debate and doubt in him.
5	Dear ISTJs, what do you think of NFJs?	I got into this MBTI thing recently, and reading about the functions, I think I may be ENFJ or even INFJ. Not sure. \nThen I realized a lot of people in my life are ISTJ and ISTP. \n\nI feel like ISTJ is about everything I am not, and that I am this unpractical, irrational/idealist being with ideas that they may find useless lol. But I like most ISTJs who come into my life. 
7	[deleted]
3	You guys scare me. You're all so dedicated and committed to achieving the impossible which is a pain in the fucking ass because in my experience NFJs get very angry and upset when I explain to them why it simply isn't possible to do what they want.\n\nI think your mind is in the right place but you guys need to stop forgetting that we live on a planet that has physical restrictions. Your dreams may simply not be possible with the materials you have
2	Keep in mind that we can often feel just as useless to you as you might to us. I worry about coming across as too practical or a buzzkill to NFJs I know.
1	I only know one ENFJ and they drive me completely insane, because they ignore factual evidence in a way that doesn't say "let's look beyond this " but just completely disregards it. \n\nThe idealism is refreshing, because beneath all my realism is the heart of an optimist, but the lack of attention to detail is horrifying. \n\nI'm convinced it's not a typing thing, just this person is a pain in the ass with severe maturity issues.
12	Too intimidating?	xxTJs in general are known for being pretty standoffish, whether this is intentional or not. That stereotype definitely fits me well, but during my summer job, I tried to go out of my way (or so I thought) to be friendly and more outgoing than I would be on a regular basis, since I work with kids. Despite all this, I kept getting comments over and over again about how intimidating I am, and how people (even my friends) were afraid to approach me, make friends with me, etc. My friends, before we were friends, all seemed to think that I hated them, and others just thought I was always in a bad mood. \n\nHearing that really came out of left field given how hard I felt I was trying to act more upbeat than I normally would. A lot of it probably has to do with my demeanor; I definitely have a strong case of RBF going, which doesn't help.\n\nHave any of you other ISTJs had similar experiences or comments made about you? Do you have any advice about how to... well... not be so "intimidating?" I'm beginning to worry it's going to affect my opportunities in jobs, relationships, etc. down the road if I keep coming across this way to people.
8	Here comes a novel.....\n\nI've heard this since I was a child.  At 42, I've only come to understand it in the last 2-3 years.  Looking back now, things make a lot more sense.  I somehow ended up with a wife who balances me out wonderfully and can help me understand it.  She actually always had a handle on it and I never really took it seriously.  I know me -  "How could I possibly be intimidating?  There's no way I have that sort of presence, people don't notice me.  I love her but she comes up with some weird stuff." - That was me the first 18 years or so of our marriage.  So, I have some insight into the issue, but I struggle to manage it.  I can see where it has helped me and where it has hurt me.\n\nI've always been focused and able to reach whatever objective I need to.   Over the years it usually lands me in some sort of leading role because I've worked in industries that value that ability - forest products, oil and gas, etc.  On several occasions I've ended up being over those I worked with that were there before me because when I have an objective, I get shit done and I'm not terribly concerned with the politics surrounding it or any toes that may be stepped on.  As long as it doesn't involve bullshit like talking people up and glad handing, I can do it.  I haven't always realized this and it bit me right in the ass when I accepted a job at a new company.  I learned quickly that they placed a high value on things like motivation, inspiration, everyone being super friendly to each other, ass kissing, posturing, etc.  These are all things I refer to collectively as "Bullshit".  What I didn't understand is that bullshit is an integral part of their culture and it made them work and made them effective.  I was shit canned in 6 months.  They gave the the standard "we need to go a different direction" answer, but the also said that "intimidation has no place our culture."  There's that word again.  WTF?  I haven't tried to intimidate anyone.  This was 3 years ago.\n\nI essentially walked right into a world that I'm just not made for.  Mostly because I didn't recognize their values and failed to acknowledge what my wife had told me for years - I have a presence and can be very intimidating.  I immediately made some contacts and fell back into a job that I knew and had a reputation for doing well - the unemployment issue was resolved.  However, I spent the first year fuming and wallowing in anger.  I had never been fired before.  WTF was wrong with these people?  How dare these assholes do this.  For the last couple of years, I've managed to come to terms with it and recognize my almost exclusive role in what happened.  For someone who has always laughed at how incredibly unaware of themselves people can be, the lack of self awareness I've had for years has been a difficult pill to swallow.\n\nSo over the last couple of years I've made some progress.  Probably not much...hell, I don't know, I'm not sure how unaware of myself I am.  I've accepted the fact that I must be intimidating.  For me this has meant being aware of myself physically and emotionally.  I have a large build and I'm strong.  I've always been that way and it means little to me.  I move fast when I want to and I move shit that needs to be moved.  Do you know how many times I've been accused of being pissed off because of the way I move?  A bunch.  I blew it off but I realize now it is something that I have to be mindful of.  Smaller people can see it as a threat, bigger folks can see it as a challenge and it's never been meant as either.  I also have a case of RBF - that's difficult to write - I look like a dumbass when I smile, at least I think I do.  I tend to correct discourse quickly in conversation without realizing that maybe that discourse was important to someone and ultimately may have been important to me too.  I cannot, for the life of me, act happy if I am not.  I can't call someone "buddy" if I don't like them.  the best I can do in those situations is shut up, and guess what that does?  It apparently intimidates people.  I've also learned that when I'm actually really happy, I'm just enjoying that internally - it apparently doesn't get to the surface.  I always thought it did.\n\nI'm not going to try and change myself - I don't think that's possible.  I am learning that a smile at the right time can signal to someone that I'm not pissed.  I can't walk around with a permagrin, but I can get a smile out at initial meeting or at times in a conversation - not to fake happiness but just confirm that I'm not thinking about killing anybody.  I'm careful about how I move and I go out of my way to ask for help moving things instead of trying to figure out ways to do it myself.  These are just some examples of what once person is trying to do to convince the world that he's not a threat.  I'm not trying to convince the world that I'm happy, I'm just trying to help them understand that I don't mean any sort of harm.\n\nMy point is - accept that you aren't fully aware of how you are received.  That does create uncertainty but simply acknowledging it can help you temper it.  More importantly give yourself some credit - you have presence.  You can't intimidate people without that.  You're noticed and that's something a lot of people work hard for and to some degree, you have it naturally.  It feels kind of arrogant to say that, but I think it has to be recognized if you want to steer the ship in the right direction.  I've learned that when you are noticed like that, people try to assess you quickly and a visible smile or kind word might help guide that assessment to the correct conclusion.  I look at it sort of like a shotgun - it's powerful and can fuck things up if you don't know how to aim it (and I don't).  However, now I'm aware that I have a shotgun so maybe I'll figure out what to do with it.  Best of luck hope I've said something that makes sense or even helps.
2	Yeah, a lot of people say similar things about me. I honestly think sometimes that theres people who are too intimidated to tell me that it's why they avoid me. It's honestly a little hard for me to understand their perspective particularly seeing that I'm neither a violent nor physically intimidating person.
2	Too balance out my awkwardness and RBF I've learned to express more personality or more emotional range. I used to be be way uptight but realized I came across real high strung which isn't me at all. I suppose I've mellowed out in the past few years. \n\nIf I dropped a tin can at the supermarket for example. \n\nPrevious more tense version: mumbles under breath and quickly picks the can up and moves on. \n\nMe currently but less tense : expresses disappointment "oh no", check if I made a fool in front of others, pick up can, laugh it off and carry on. \n\nI must say though that in past times I had higher levels of insecurity and probably why I appeared more timid or "intimidating". I'm still awkward as a rock talking to bricks but I've grown out of habits and behaviour that would be considered intimidating. \n
2	[deleted]
1	I am frequently told I am too intense, intimidating, or judgemental. I don't particularly care, since the people who's opinions I value don't say that, though they do say I can come off a certain way. 
1	My housemate is an ISTJ, I'm scared of him, his eyes look like he's judging me all the time and showing disapproval :D\n\nI'd love to be more friends with him, but I also have my limitations and sometimes I just give up. I'll keep trying in future, if you have any ideas on how you would preferred to be approached, please let me know. 
8	ISTJ = hardass?	I've recently met this person, who made me genuinely curious about how her brain works. I showed her the MBTI test, and she scored ISTJ. I think she is an enneagram 1 or 6, but I wonder if she is ISTJ or ISTP. I think her traits are stereotypically more ISTJ tho.\n\n- She has a good memory and reminds about everything in vivid detail. Like very, very vivid detail. I'm INFJ and I basically only talk about my opinions and events from a generalized perspective, and I try to externalize the "essence" of things... I am terrible at dealing with detail. \n\n- Practical, doesn't seem to explore too much abstract subjects. Focused on "duty" and work.\n\n- Complains about a lot of stuff. I mean, a lot. Things she sees as stupid and nonsensical in general. \n\n- Says she doesn't have friends/is bad at making friends. This is probably more related to her being Aspergers.\n\n- Has a super hardass vibe. And I'm not saying this as an offense. It is more like a "definite" vibe, "I-know-what-I-am-talking-about" vibe. She seems quiet and calm for the most part, but hardass at the same time. \n\nHere is the thing, I'm starting to wonder if ISTJ is actually my "opposite" type. Cause where I'm Ni, ISTJ is Si. Where I'm Fe, ISTJ is Te. Where I'm Ti, ISTJ is Fi. Where I'm Se, ISTJ is Ne. \n\nI know intertype relations say otherwise, but I'm starting to think I may be a good match or make good friends with ISTJ. Like... wow. This woman simply amazed me, I can't understand how someone's mind can be so organized, how someone can be so straight to the point etc. So clear, consistent and concise.
21	A lot of that sounds like ISTJ.  A couple of points, though:\n\n>She has a good memory and reminds about everything in vivid detail. Like very, very vivid detail. I'm INFJ and I basically only talk about my opinions and events from a generalized perspective, and I try to externalize the "essence" of things... I am terrible at dealing with detail. \n\nWe use Si, which a lot of people assume to mean "good memory," but it's more (and less) than that.\n\nI don't consider myself to have a particularly good memory.  More particularly, I don't have a good memory for details, which I think is odd, because I tend to be very focused on them.  But if you ask me the specifics of something, or if I try to recall the specifics on my own, I'll probably fail.\n\nI do, however, have a pretty solid contextual memory.  It's pretty easy for me to encounter something (hear, read, etc.) and have a related memory pop into my head.\n\nI've had plenty of conversations that started with someone asking me "Do you remember <this thing>?" and I've responded "No....why?"  They go on to start talking about it and I suddenly interject with "Oh, yeah!  And then..." and I take over the conversation.\n\n>Complains about a lot of stuff. I mean, a lot. Things she sees as stupid and nonsensical in general. \n\nIf stuff weren't stupid and nonsensical in general, she wouldn't have to do this.  Pay attention, because she's probably right.\n\n>Has a super hardass vibe. And I'm not saying this as an offense. It is more like a "definite" vibe, "I-know-what-I-am-talking-about" vibe. She seems quiet and calm for the most part, but hardass at the same time. \n\nWe tend to take no bullshit, and we tend to give no bullshit.  If we do know what we're talking about, you'll know.  If we don't know, we're not talking about it.  We're also very direct in our communication.  Remember the "give no bullshit" part above?  If you ask our opinion, make sure you really want it, because you'll get it.  If we ask you something, give us a straight answer.  You've heard the phrase "beating around the bush," I assume.  We don't do that.  We run over the bush with a lawn mower, and we appreciate the same from others when we ask a question.\n\nHere's the thing, though:  That "hardass vibe" you're getting now, it's just a shell.  When we get to where we trust someone and we're comfortable about them, we're actually nice, friendly, and warm.  We laugh, we tell jokes, and we have emotions, same as everyone else.  We'll still throw some "hardass" moments at you from time to time, because we are pretty serious when we're in "get shit done" mode, but if you can learn to roll with it, we're not that bad.
3	As an ISTJ, I do remember details fairly well and do have a "work, then play" mindset. I'm a quiet and calm person. \n\nNot making friends easily does go along with introvert (in comparison to extrovert). Extroverts, getting their energy from people, are more inwardly motivated to socialize.\n\nComplaints about *stupid* things or *nonsensical* things is consistent with ISTJ. The ISTJ is rational and can pick these out. \n\nUnfortunately, ISTJs sometimes are guilty of projecting superiority, thinking that they have the best opinion or perspective.
6	Mod Update: Discord Links	Discord is a online messaging forum for those of you who don't know whose popularity has risen dramatically this year. There have been a number of users who have seen it fit to post invite links to their MBTI related servers in r/ISTJ and while this in itself is quite understandable it can be somewhat disruptive to the forum. \n\nAs such the mod team have decided to take precautionary measures. From now on we will be restricting discord invites to **one post per server**. If we see multiple invite links to a server posted on this sub we will be deleting the duplicate.\n\nFor the majority of users this won't make much difference but I just thought I'd try and keep you all in the loop.
3	Thoughts? :P	
3	Like... just because as an ISTJ I like to get work done before I can feel fully comfortable playing, doesn't mean that I don't play, too.
1	...Is there somewhere to sign up? Does anyone know if there is a waiting list? Is it some sort of lottery system? This sounds like heaven to me!
1	This is hilariously absurd, like something Douglas Adams would write
1	How can I understand you guys better?	I'm a ENFP, currently working with 3 other I/ESTJs in my school project, with the 5th being INTP. While we appear to be productive, there's a lot of friction within me and the rest of the members.\n\nI understand that ISTJs think logically and act based on specific, scheduled timings. When I met all 3 initially (as fellow classmates), it was pretty cool. But we never managed to click. I feel like they've started to dislike me, especially the ESTJ who is extremely rude to me but not to others (which strikes me as strange because I've been nice to him all along,and he just rudely ignores me or gives me curt replies if needed) \n\nHow can I get along with you guys better? :(
11	Stick to the project aims and order and don't wander off into territory that's more complicated or outside of the scope of the work, no matter how 'interesting' you think it is. Coming up with ways to extend the work and improve the methods is great and all, but if you don't do things according to the rubric you'll get a 0, regardless of if your method is technically better. Also, grades cap out at 100% when you do it the simple and boring way, so there's no benefit to doing better than that. \n\nKeep notes on what you're doing/thinking/trying, especially if this project involves actual equipment and needs precision. I've worked with INTPs in a lab before, and their incessant need to fiddle with things without documenting the original settings or what they've moved has cost me *hours* of my life trying to fix it all again. People who I know to have that trait are now delegated to menial tasks where they can't do much damage, and they're not well-liked by the rest of the group. 
3	> How can I understand you guys better?\n\nJust ask more questions. Simple enough. Is there a specific issue you want to understand better?\n\n> I feel like they've started to dislike me, especially the ESTJ who is extremely rude to me but not to others (which strikes me as strange because I've been nice to him all along,and he just rudely ignores me or gives me curt replies if needed)\n\nThey just suck then. I've never heard of personality type causing meanness. Might mean an awkward or somewhat disconnected friendship, but an MBTI difference doesn't cause meanness.
2	Show them you have good work ethic and that you are reliable. I can totally respect the fact that someone will actually do what they say they are going to do and when they are a reliable hard worker. \n\nIf you are talking about becoming friends outside of the project I thing the easiest way to get an istj to open up is to talk about something that they enjoy. Like a similar hobby or something. \n\nI kinda have trouble with some enfps too though just because they are so wild and loud sometimes lol. I’m just like “calm down and please stop touching me” xD
0	New personality theory discord	Hey everyone. It seems like most of the discord servers aren't serious anymore. A group of us have gotten together to create a new discord server where you can discuss all aspects of personality theory and in an enjoy environment. We are small and brand new so please join us!\nhttps://discord.gg/URJzZqb
1	Very nice server,Parrot's a good admin,very trustworthy
3	Weekly Thread: What TV show are you watching right now and who would you recommend it to?	
3	I've actually been surprised at how good The Orville has been.
2	I don't watch TV, but I do watch YouTube folks do let's plays, and I'm currently watching Super Best Friends play through Dead Space 2. It's like having social interaction without all the actual interaction.
2	The latest season of Twin Peaks. I'd recommend it to fans of Lost Highway and/or Inland Empire who also liked at least the first season of Peaks (and I'd recommend they read *Secret History* first). I'm only a few episodes in, and I'm wavering on whether I'd recommend it to a fan of Peaks who hated Inland Empire.
2	Rick and Morty of course 
1	Victoria. I think it's a relaxing low key sort of drama show you can be interested in without the drama being extra. Historical and aesthetically pleasing with detailed scenery. \n\nI don't know who to recommend it too really... If you want a show to wind down to, visually I think this is great.  \n\nIt's quite understated but I love the series wholeheartedly. 
1	The Good Place.  It's very structured and organized, and the characters and dialog are very well thought out.  I'd recommend it to people who liked the whimsical quality of Defending Your Life.
10	Do you like parties?	I'm going to a big party this Thursday, that most likely will involve alcohol and cigarettes. I'm not looking forward to it at all, since I hate those things, being surrounded by so many people and dancing. Does anyone feel the same?
20	Nope, not at all. I take a pass and don't go. 
18	I don't mind smaller parties where i know everyone, but i hate dancing, and have to be very drunk to do so.
8	Do not like. Especially w/ smoke & alcohol present, that'd be really tough.\n\nFeel your pain.
9	Yea I don’t like parties unless I’m good friends with the people that are there. 
6	I hate parties.
5	I absolutely hate parties.
4	If it's well balanced and nobody has to be the special snowflake that tries to munchkin everything, then sure, I'm fine with parties.  I mean, there's a lot out there you can't solo.\n\nOh, wait..."party" as in "gathering of people to celebrate a thing and/or relax," not "party" as in "group of adventurers getting together to slay the dragon."\n\nYeah, no, I hate those parties.
3	It ultimately depends who I'm with. If it's a party with a house full of people I know then I'm set but if it's a house full of strangers with only one or two people I know then I'm going to have a miserable time. 
2	Unless you're a teetotaler, doing some shots means you'll have a better time. If you're a teetotaler, don't go.
1	Only ever been to a few parties like this, but I can appreciate them even though I dont do anything too wild
1	It sort of depends for me.\n\nI consider myself somewhat interesting...I have many hobbies, had a ton of adventures in my life, lead an interesting career, and I feel like I'm fairly intelligent with my life in order. If I'm in an environment where those things are valued and appreciated containing people with whom I can discuss these things (even if they're strangers), I have a great time.\n\nBut if I go to a party where all people want to do is pound beer bongs with the stereo blasting 140 decibels and see how many times they can get the cops called on them while they try to stick the neighborhood stray cat into the dryer, I drink as few beers as possible to look social so I can quietly leave sober when everyone else is too drunk to realize I've left. \n\nThe second type of party is not my forte and I'm just a fish out of water in that environment. Stick me in a party that many probably consider "boring" and I thrive and have the time of my life. 
1	I don't like going to parties, but I love hosting parties and organizing them.  I help produce warehouse parties with attendance averaging 500 people per event.  I has tasks to do all night so I'm never bored.  
1	I hate parties. 
1	Depends on the type of parties.\n\nOnes with drugs, sluts, and other types of miscreant activities? Nope.\n\nA good clean fun birthday party with people I know, or something like that? Yes, probably.
1	I know I'd hate the scenery and why I'll never go to them. I don't know your reasons but I wouldn't go to an event where there's - stuff/people there that I don't wanna get involved with. You can go to a party with these things and not be a part of it of course but for me being in the same atmosphere is a discomfort. 
1	I haven't been to more than one or two of those parties that involve smoking and drinking. They were okay, but only because they were my best friend's birthday parties. I didn't interact much with people or partake in smoking or drinking heavily - I had just one beer - but the food was okay. It wasn't for me, but I didn't actively hate it. I did try to stay away from smokers, though, since I have asthma.\n\nNow the funny thing is I also don't like family gatherings. Those tend to be more crowded. No smoking, less alcohol. But oh boy, the questions, "Are you and the boyfriend getting married?" "What are you studying?" "Why haven't you graduated yet?" My family is primarily very outgoing extroverts so it can be a bit overwhelming.
1	Love parties
1	I hate going to parties
1	I like small gatherigs.  When it gets crowded and loud thats when I peace out.
11	Have you ever felt like you want to be a gear in the massive system?	Hello brothers/sisters,\n\nI learned that I have istj personality and the outline is pretty cleared that I have these traits.\n\nSo I always think that I would be a great fit, if I was a gear in a massive working system. You can call it "bureaucrats" with tons of paperwork and keeping the order of the society behind the closed doors. its like knowing your borders and getting the best benefits from that. For example, if you are new to system and you want to learn how it is working and get the upper hand by researching its behaviours and all that. In dnd traits (chaotic evil, lawfully good etc), I feel lawful evil/neutral is the most suitable one. That's because, you might want to rise to top, but everything should be performed according to law and order. Moreover, I feel like everything has some hierarcy and responsibilities to fulfill and I am the cpu unit that do the computing and maintaining the order.\n\n\nDo you think in that way?\n\nEdit: I study computer science, if you guys also do scientific subjects :D
6	I'm borderline ISTJ/INTJ.\n\nAnd yeah, I'm the happiest when I'm that person in the background making sure everything is functioning smoothly. The world thinks it loves people who have new, innovative ideas and big plans for new things, but somebody has to keep basic things functioning, and that's my strength. You have a lot of power and responsibility when you understand the inner workings and know how small tweaks here and there can affect massive change (positive or negative) somewhere else.\n\nI work as an academic advisor and program coordinator, and it fits my preferences perfectly. Nobody sees the work I do to keep the program functioning, the students happy, the faculty happy, etc., and I don't need them to see. I just enjoy knowing I'm the one doing it all without people being up in my business.
2	Yep, I do IT support and i like being an 'enabler'\n\nUsually liked playing medic in my games too ...
2	Yes. I love working and I hated going to school. Not because I don’t like to learn, I certainly do! It’s just that I want to serve and to be rewarded, and in school you’re a consumer not a provider.\n\nIn my job, I’m a replaceable part, but I’m modular and able to be used in different roles in the machine to fill gaps. Being there to make sure that things don’t fall into disorder and doing my best to have a special extra bit of positive influence is fulfilling.
1	Sounds like Modron  talk.  All hail Mechanus.
1	yeah. I felt like this for a very long time. Wasn't until I realized how stupid most people are that I decided that there's no point relying on them
1	I don't know if cog is the right word, but I do like having very clear directives and responsibilities, and those seem to be related sometimes.
8	Do you ever feel a sense of insecurity in friendships?	For my entire life, I've been very quick to hide any kind of insecurity or negative emotion in fear of being judged for it. It's something that's ingrained itself into my brain. Me and one of my friends (who is an INFJ if that matters) have gotten extremely close over the last year, but every so often I get the sense that he's getting tired of me and my way of being. It's ridiculous because I don't really think it's true, but my mind keeps bringing the though to the forefront. I've been burned before with friends leaving me, so I don't know if this feeling is a result of that. Do you guys ever feel this way in your friendships or is that just me?
5	May I ask what instances are making this sense of yours come to this conclusion? It might add some context. But yes, I feel like my true friendships are always on the verge of being lost bc I said or did something wrong... or bc I didn't say or do something. I'm an intj though, but can nonetheless relate 
5	Every day
1	>Me and one of my friends (who is an INFJ if that matters) have gotten extremely close over the last year, but every so often I get the sense that he's getting tired of me and my way of being. \n\n*Hugs* from an INFJ whose SO is ISTJ and who really appreciates her way of being.\n\n>I've been burned before with friends leaving me, so I don't know if this feeling is a result of that. \n\nIf this is related at all to MBTI type/cognitive functions, maybe it's the Si-dom (layering of experiences you've had) plus inferior Ne (anxiety about negative possibilities) processes biting you in the proverbial behind?
3	How do you guys deal with left brain/right brain stuff?	As ISTJs we tend to be logical, very left brained, to the point of being compared to robots. I have always tested pretty strongly ISTJ and the logical side of things has always appealed to me, but I'm finding that as I get older I desire more and more... Flexibility? Subjectivity? I'm not sure.\n\nI'm reevaluating my career as I'm going back to school, and I always felt like I'd enjoy an engineering degree or something similar. I told myself that despite my weakness in math, my personality was cut out for it and I'd just have to work at it until things clicked. After about a year and a half of math classes it never did, and I felt/feel incredibly discouraged about it. I find myself drawn more to subjective classes like humanities and social sciences. \n\nI'm not necessarily looking for advice or encouragement, just curious what your experiences have been.
6	I live with an ISTJ. We have the same functions, just in a different stack, but the differences are glaring.\n\nShe is accused of having robot like tendencies, but like you, math is not her friend. Also like you, as she gets older, she finds herself becoming more open to new experiences and challenges. Part of that is her exposure to me and my hyper excited reaction to new things. Most of it, is just her getting her lower functions stronger and better balanced with the rest of her. \n\nThis is likely what is happening to you. My recommendation? Go for what draws you in and makes you excited and happy to do it. You ISTJs have a tremendous capacity for discipline and perseverance, but mine seems to be at her best when doing things she cares most about. So explore and look for something that makes you passionate. You'll find a way to live, either doing it as a job or a hobby that your day job pays for.

6	Weekly Thread: What's the weirdest situation you've found yourself in?	
8	From the top of my head, the weirdest situation was when all of my friends and family thought that I was dead or kidnapped. \n\nThis was a Friday afternoon and I finished class early by noon, so I was thinking to myself, "I'm free, have nothing to do, and most of my friends are busy. You know what? I should go watch Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. (came to theatres the week prior)" So I went by myself *what a loser I am*, around 4:45pm. Got to the theatre at 5pm, sat down in the theatre room around 5:10pm, checked all notificationa on my phone, then proceeded to put my phone on complete silence. \n\nMovie trailers started rolling, so my attention was undivided and I just focused on the silver screen. About 2 hours later, during the multiple after/mid credit scenes(ceiling lights were turned on already) I go check my phone and I feel that it is really hot, so I unlocked my screen and there were over 40 text messages and 200+ missed calls.\n\nI was like, "WTF is going on?" Then I see a call from my brother and father, but I declined them since I was still in the theatre. At first, I thought I was butt-dialing people so I responded to my roommate group text that I was butt dialing. I was then getting a call from my best friend, declined it, then I got a call from her fiance(a good friend of mine and the son of my boss from one job), so I walked out the theatre and picked up the call.\n\nHe asks me if I was doing ok and whether I was hurt or not, and I tell him, "Yeah, why would I be hurt? Everything is ok, I was just watching a movie in the theatres." He then tells me that I was supposed to come into work that afternoon at 5pm, that his dad and my other work supervisor messaged and called me without me responding, so that got them worried. The two then proceeded to call my friends and eventually my friends tried reaching my family too. Once I cleared things up with him, he went to call his dad, my boss and I went on to call my brother.\n\nI call him and he responds with, "WTF IS GOING BRO? YOU ALRIGHT?" Yeah, I was just watching GOTG Vol. 2." I continued explaining to him that it was all because of work miscommunication. I called my best friend after to assure her that I was alive, to calm her nerves, then I called my boss. Turns out he missread a text asking me to work on Friday, which was in regards to the Friday a week prior to this incident. He thought that that text was for the day.\n\nI then called my parents and my other good friends to explain that I am not dead and didn't so something stupid. The whole time calling people, I was walking a few miles to get home inatead of the bus.\n\nOnce I got home to my apartment, I just went straight to shower and thought to myself, "This whole incident was blown way out of f*ckin' proportion juat because of miscommunication and bad timing."
3	Fiancée and I broke up, but we had a trip planned and paid for with her family. So we just kept it quiet and went on the trip, which was very weird on many levels.
2	Can ISTJs and ESFJs be a good match or are they too different?	Hi, so I'm writing a book and since I feel I don't have a good enough grasp on all the different personality types yet, I frequent these subreddits for advice.\n\nSo, my question's basically in the title. I want to create a popular power couple, the guy's an ISTJ, the girl's an ESFJ. Do you feel you get along well enough with ESFJs or is the introvert-thinking/extrovert-feeling balance too big of a difference? I know every person is different, but I just mean generally and hypothetically speaking.
9	**Any** two types can make a good match, we can only quantify trends in what's more or less likely to work. The important thing is that it's all dependent on the individuals. Relationships and friendships between all sorts of different people were possible before MBTI was created, and they will still be possible when MBTI is obsolete or forgotten. \n\nDon't worry about putting two characters together when some article or web page says they might have difficulty in a relationship. If anything, more character-driven conflict between the two will make the book even better.\n\nI'm also 75% sure my parents are a male ISTJ/female ESFJ pair, and they get on just fine, so there's that too.
3	I (an ISTJ) married an ESFJ. My n = 1 experience says it works out great!
3	I kinda know an ENFJ-ISTJ "power" couple. Their biggest source of conflict is the N-S, she finds his S frustratingly detailed when they're trying to get information across. Otherwise, they've leveraged their differences to become an immigrant rags-to-riches story. Running their businesses, she's good at dealing with people, charting a path of growth for them, and he's good at running numbers and making sure all the cogs are running smoothly.
2	Yes, they can be a good match. Type cannot truly dictate with 100% accuracy who will get along and who will not get along. There are patterns and "common" pairs but at the same time, there are always cases of all kinds. \n\nP.S. I am a female ISTJ dating a male ESFJ and while it's not perfect, in general, it works out pretty nicely. If not, common ground and compromise.
1	If you're interested, [this chart](https://falconnl.github.io/TypeSquare/) shows the different Socionic relationships of each type. Just hover over ISTJ and you can see their relationship with every other type.
6	DAE have trouble watching movies (slight spoiler for S.K.'s It)	I'm observant of everything and everyone that I know recently (IMBD, Fandango, friends, and colleagues) have consistently told me to watch the new Steven King's It movie because it's so "terrifying."  However I couldn't enjoy the movie because of the in accuracy of timeline (movie takes place in late 1980's but there is a handful of modern items in the movie such as cars, backpacks, accessories, and garages).  Does anyone else experience this problem ?
5	I don't watch movies often but when I have time I don't mind it. \n\nI have issues with a few things. One is I can't be fully immersed in the movie when there's lack of - logic or realism in the plot. I tend to analyze what's happening with each scene before watching the characters.  \n\n This is probably why I enjoy some fictional and fantasy movies that remove the need to rationalize the amount of realism in some films. \n\nI watched the movie "Life" recently(spoiler?), a new movie out and the genres my style but it was so frustrating to watch, when someone would die. Everyone just stood there like there was no procedure to carry out or there was no tools or intitive to act on. I moderately enjoy horror movies and watched the "Rings" movie with a mate, was a bit creepy but I easily could be the type of person to be pointing out something inconvenient. "Why doesn't she just run out the back door?"
3	Slightly different, but having been in the army, watching war movies makes me call out all the stuff they do wrong. There's a lot they do wrong in war movies.
1	I watched It (twice now actually) and did notice the out of place items the second time.\n\nHowever, I really liked it. It definitely wasn't terrifying, I'd say about average if anything.\n\nI don't usually have that problem unless it's really obvious things. 
1	Since I'm a locksmith, I constantly get pulled out of the story based on inaccuracies, but this movie didn't give me much to complain about. I try to suspend disbelief when watching films, generally.
6	What do you do when your routine is interrupted?	For example, you partied hard last night and slept through 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM today. Now it is 1:00 AM, your supposed bedtime, but you don't feel sleepy because you slept through the day. What do you do?
9	I can't think of a situation where that would happen to me. I would never stay up late enough to interrupt my sleep cycle to that degree. If I were really to do something "all night" I'd most likely stop at 5:00 AM latest and sleep until 11:00 AM and just survive with 6.5 hours of sleep for the next day, and if I actually had something planned for the next day I wouldn't stay up past 2:00 AM because I prefer to wake up no later than 10:00 AM.\n\nIf for some reason I was actually forced to stay up until 10:00 AM I would most likely take a nap from 10:00-12:00 and just write it off as an all-nighter. Getting an hour or two of sleep is a lot better than getting no sleep at all, and then I'd just tough it out through the next day and go to bed early. The few times I've had to pull all nighters for school I usually work until 6:00 or 7:00 AM and then sleep until 9:00 which makes the next day considerably more tolerable.
6	Oh geeze this is me every Sunday night trying to get to sleep for Monday morning.  I just eventually go to sleep and drink lots of Monsters in the AM.  
3	Magnesium + Melatonin and hope that works.
3	Worst thing is to try to go to bed when you're not sleepy. Do something low key like read, then go to bed when you're drowsy.
3	When this happens I stay up until the next night, drink a lot of coffee and spend the next couple days keeping things in rigorous order
2	Play some music. Light classical or something in the chillhop genre. 
1	Smoke weed and go to a Taco Bell drive thru. 
6	Thoughts about Si, Se, Ni and Ne, context, cross-context, worldview, and possibilities	Thoughts about Si, Se, Ni and Ne, context, cross-context, worldview, and possibilities\n\n* Si and Se deal with real experiences directly.\n* Ni and Ne deal with patterns and connections.\n* Si and Ni are concerned with worldview.\n* Se and Ne are concerned with possibilities.\n\nNi/Se and Si/Ne work together as pairs:\n\n* Ni/Se operate within one context at a time. Se usually focuses on the present context, but Ni can mentally shift the context in space/time so Se can have a look at it.\n* Si/Ne are cross-contextual. So Si builds up insights over time, and Ne uses it as a springboard to find parallels between situations, objects, ideas, anything.\n\nTherefore:\n\n* Ni builds its worldview by looking at patterns and connections within a single context at a time.\n* Si builds its worldview by looking at real experiences across contexts.\n* Se finds possibilities by looking at real experiences in the current context.\n* Ne finds possibilities by looking at patterns and connections across contexts.\n\nAny comments, corrections, elaboration, or relevant anecdotes welcome.\n

0	ISTJ relationship	Hi. i'm (M, 21) ENTP and my girlfriend is (F, 19) ISTJ and we are dating for more or less 1,5 years. We both were always worried to tell our parents about the relationship because she is Japanese and i'm korean (howeaver we live and we were born in Brazil). When i told my father about her he started saying silly (and not friendly) things about japanese people so i waited for a year to tell my mom. After that they met each other and the first impression was good the only problem about her ,they say, Is that she is Japanese.\nIn her side, her mom don't like me, she her that she once loved an non-japanese guy and after a while she broke up with the guy because of the non-japanese thing, so her mom is expecting (but not actively telling) her to break with me because i'm korean. My girlfriend tells me that she says bad things about the korean people, just like my father did.\nI think she likes me, we always have a great time when we are together, but she lacks a bit of "romance or something like that" when we are far apart for sometime chatting, and we "fight" but not "fight" (it's basically me trying to get her attention). I'm curently in another country, and we will not see each other for 4 months.\nWhen we started dating i made her to do the personality profile test, and she said she was an ISTJ, you as an ISTJ, what would you do in her position? Would you choose the tradition over your boyfriend? (I had and still have to answer the same question, but i have chosen her instead of the tradition because i think she is worth the price) \nFrom what i think, she has to have a position about our relationship which she is hiding from me. \nI don't want to break with her neither being in the dark waiting for her answer to that (if she is breaking up with me i wish she did faster).\n\nThank you for your attention,\nsorry for my bad english T.T\n
17	Welcome to /r/ISTJRelationsips, where the advice is always "Be direct and ask them."
3	Let me guess. This all stretches back to ww2. With the Japanese war crimes of having Korean women enslaved to be comfort women.\n\nEven in 2017 the Japanese still see themselves as being "white" and part of the "white men's club" and so see all other Asian races as non-white. \n\nThey see the Koreans as cockroaches and Chinese as beast hence the constant stabbing of Koreans dressed in traditional Korean garb by right-wing extremist in japan. \n\nThe Koreans on the other hand do not like the Japanese because of the refusal to own up to their crimes of the whole comfort women thing hence the comfort women statue in front of the Japanese embassy. \n\nAll i'm going to say is that it's going to be very difficult to convince each party's respective family to change their course of believe. Also, I have to say this isn't a thing of tradition or non-tradition at the end of the day if your gf goes against her families desires she very possibly could lose them. Try not to hold it against your gf this isn't an issue of choosing boyfriend or family... this issue is very very deep within the asian psyche due to an unresolved conflict. Unlike, in Europe where they have fought it out completely many of the asian conflicts have either been interfered or abruptly halted hence north/south korea/vietnam. The ongoing animosity with China/Korea toward Japan due to the Japanese war crimes along with their refusal to apologize.  \n\nSo to answer your question if I were her I would have a talk with my parents, and if they say no then it's a no. If she is keeping you in the dark then you should break up with her... life is short... don't waste your time. \n
1	Well, I'm a korean INFP dating a white ISTJ whose 90-something grandmother still thinks of asians as WW2 era "Japs", so he hasn't introduced me to her yet, but I don't think that means he thinks of me as temporary. He does strongly prefer to compartmentalize/separate the different groups of people in his life -- it's probably a control/fear of unnecessary drama thing. \n\nI think how your gf reacts to this situation depends on how extreme either of your parents are on this issue. Asian parents run the gamut from happily embracing to quietly tolerating (my parents) to nonstop harping to outright disowning. 
7	Weekly Thread: What advances in society would you like to see in your lifetime?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what advances in society (technologically, economically, politically, socially etc.) would you like to see before you die?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
18	A shift AWAY from anti-intellectualism and willful ignorance. I'd love for society to move towards respecting facts and reality and away from fear mongering.
12	Anything space travel related. Actual space travel probably won’t happen in my lifetime, but I’d love to see any kind of advances we make on it. 
7	I'd like to see a reduction in the stigma surrounding mental illness. Seeking help for something that isn't purely physical (the way a heart attack is) tends to be frowned upon or ridiculed.
7	A restructuring of the way we treat teachers in the public school system, and a more comprehensive system of support for the students (teachers aides, paid tutors, therapists, counselors, life/job coaches, etc). Education is one of the foundational elements of development and gives people access to great opportunity for both participation in society in a productive manner, and provides a gateway for personal insights and growth which allows for a more fulfilling life in general.
5	Some good stuff here already.\n\nI'd like to see people respect personal responsibility and personal liberty and shun expectations of entitlements.
3	I would like to see most of humanity be able to depend on renewable energy.

2	How to handle ISTJ friend?	I have an ISTJ friend that I mostly enjoy being around, but he has these traits that at times drives me insane, and I get this borderline feeling of both laughing and crying.\n\nNote: Every quote I bring up here is my best translation from swedish into english, so if some of them might not make total sense that might be the reason why.\n\nSo, first things first. I strongly believe that he's got a slight touch of aspergers, judging from the the usual indications such as having trouble to understand when he's hurt people. He can say the most awful things to pretty much anyone if he's in the mood. \nI've on numerous occasions done the same thing to him that he recently did to me or to somebody else (in an educative purpose). But he's seemingly clueless why somebody would hurt him in such a way. \n\nHis self insight is also piss poor, he routinely calls people out and mocks them for things that can be applied even more to himself. Sometimes he even praises himself for something he just criticized another person for.  \n\nIf somebody has a hypothesis about someone or something, and even makes it clear that they're not totaly sure about it, he still almost always takes it as gospel.\n\nA recent example of his poor self insight and totaly devoid empathy is when I, him and his collegaue were on vacation, and he would routinely say things such as "You're such a beta male" or "If you're so intelligent, why won't you apply that into having game and getting laid every other night?". Probably relevant to add that I'm 99% sure he's a virgin.\n\nSo one night his colleague tries to delve a little bit deeper into his mind brings up that being a virgin is nothing to be ashamed of (He has never admitted he's a virgin). He just sits completely still and gives him the silent treatment. His eyes starts watering and he's close to crying. When his colleague realizes that he apologizes and quits the subject.\nI and his colleague later goes out to drink, but ISTJ stays home because he thought his colleague ruined the night for him. Later that night I and his colleague meet 2 girls which we decide to meet again the next night.\n\nThe next day I decide I won't say a single thing back to him when he says things like I've mentioned earlier in hope of him getting tired of it. The only thing it results in is him taking it to a whole new level, seemingly thinking he's stronger and superior as I won't "bite back". Routinely commenting that I will fuck up with the girls we'll meet later.\n\nLater that night he says something like "Oh, you're such a beta male",  as I'm starting to get rather tipsy I for the first time that day bite back with "How fucking alpha are you yourself?", he seems to be taken totally off guard that I actually replied to him. After a few seconds of confusion he replies with "Atleast I'm further up the hierarchy than you". I reply with "We shall not go where we went yesterday(when his colleague talked about virginity)". He just heads straight home without even saying goodbye.\n\nSo how do I handle a person like this? I still want him as my friend, but it's becoming extremely taxing to be around him when he acts like he does.
11	I don't think this has anything to do with being an ISTJ tbh. For starter, he probably needs to get off the internet. That "beta male" shit is a dead giveaway. \nIf you really care about him, perhaps confront him in a friendly way and mention to him that he can't act like he does. It seems you already gave him multiple clues but he's still clueless so try and be more direct about it.\nWhat about him? Does he care about you?
4	As others have said, definitely not a MBTI thing. I'd try talking to him one more time and explaining that if he's going to continue to be an ass, you'll no longer be friends. And if continues to be an ass, cut him out. If he's not willing to work on his poor attitude, hurtful behavior and insecurities, then he's either going to drive you crazy or influence you in negative ways.
3	This isn't MBTI. This is an attitude problem. He needs to get off his high horse and needs to learn what respect is. Respect allows you to value individuals on a basic standard. If he got no respect for anyone and is egotistical and cares more about his  "ranking" or job position.  \n\nIMO people like this need to understand how it makes you feel. Confront them, ignore them or talk it out - whatever. Why is he acting out like that? Is it stress related ? Is he for some reason taking out his problems on others?   \n\nYou mention its ongoing, maybe there actually is a undiagnosed issue as mentioned or he's acting out due to unknown reasons ( in that case he might need someone to take his mind off things ). \n\nAccording to your described circle of friends -is there a form of competitiveness between you guys? How casual is it? An ISTJ may not thrive well and find this frustrating or they may take the "competition" too far. If he feels he's missing out on something he might act more competitive to compensate. \n
2	I agree with the others saying that your friend's issues go deeper than just being an ISTJ, I have a friend much like you've described and he's diagnosed with Aspberger's (as well as being bipolar, by my diagnosis).\n\nHe's quite arrogant and lacks empathy in many ways, but his inflated ego is also quite fragile.\nYour friend seems to be very insecure about himself and tries to make himself feel better by putting you and your colleague down, this toxic behaviour can be hard to deal with sometimes.\n\nI'm afraid the only advice I have is to always remember that he's acting this way because of a deep insecurity, and because his "condition" prevents him from seeing how he hurts other people.\n\nBeing honest and telling him how he's hurting you and others sometimes helps, but I must warn you, these kinds of people usually have a very hard time admitting they've done something wrong.\nBeing friends with such a person really requires thick skin in the end, and I really applaud you for sticking to him. However sometimes you must ask yourself if this sort of emotional abuse is really worth it. Sometimes a short break from each other is in order!
1	[Relevant](https://youtu.be/ZFhubbRugak)
1	You talk about your friend like he is sometype of object... "my istj friend." The problem here isn't your friend. It's YOU dehumanizing him into some category and not seeing him a person who has wants and needs. \n\nAlso, your friend sounds very mentally unstable. He almost reminds me of Elliot Rodgers... go listen to the guy's manifesto... literally a ticking time-bomb. If I were you I would cut loose... this guy sounds VERY DANGEROUS.
2	ISTJ's best romantic/friendship matches:	Tier 1: INTP - ISFP\n\nTier 2: ESTP - ENFP\n\nThoughts? ;)
4	I am an INFP in a happy relationship with an ISTJ, and I thought I'd put my two cents in it... when we are together, we never argue (sure, we haven't been dating for years, but so far that's how its been) because even if our verbal communication styles are different, we can still read each other pretty well by body language and attitudes. It annoys me a bit how passive he sometimes can be, because due to my touchy-feely nature, I cannot tolerate unfairness and when I feel like something is wrong, I have to intervene, while he's more cold-blooded, but because we have the same morals, all goes well. When we are apart though, and can only communicate by text, that's when we do sometimes find ourselves in troubles, mostly due to missunderstandings. I'm good at expressing myself verbally and quite impulsive, while he needs a lot of planning for everything, including expressing himself, so there we can clash a bit when we simply communicate our ideas too differently. I notice it bothers him when I go into more philosophical topics, and he's like "what does that matter? it wont help with our practical life" and I do love to discuss deeper meanings, but it's all about learning to adapt to each other. Love wins and I think an INFP-ISTJ match can be really good when it's healthy in a sense that they complete their partner in something said partner lacks.
4	doesn't make much sense, here is a better one\n\ntier 1: enfp-entp\ntier 2: Infp-esfp\n\nSource: socionics intertype relations
2	But, but, but, what about INFJs? 
2	My thoughts are: Poor dyslexic person, he's accidentally written his tiers backwards. :P
4	Who cares...? 
1	No not INTP! According to Socionics these are asymmetrical relationships which leave us feeling used and unsatisfied. Even ignoring the theory I've been in 2 INTP relationships. The first ended horribly. The second is just starting up and giving me anxiety about whether I should end things already.\n\nENFP has the potential to be great or horrible. But you'll figure that out quickly enough so I'd say go for that one.
0	Break up with an ISTJ	Hello, everyone! I'm an INFP who fell in love with a silly ISTJ male. Shortly after meeting, our careers took us different ways for many years, but blinded by love and thrill, we decided to risk it and have a long distance relationship. After a few months, he decides he doesn't like that he can't touch me and that he's too busy for a relationship, especially if he can't see us being physically together in the near future (we'll be apart for 5 years). While he assured me that he loved me very much and that there was no one else in the picture (we both agreed to 100% honesty), he just didn't want us to be distracted from our careers. We split amicably, and heartbroken. Fast forward three weeks, I'm in a new town and decide to call him about it. I realized that he had barely been messaging me, despite promising to not cut each other out of our lives (as he deemed it too cruel). I was dumb, and asked if he still loved me. And he told me that he didn't know because he doesn't think about love and stuff like that as he's too focused on his training and working out. And that he's not even thinking about relationships at all. It hurt, of course. I couldn't help but wonder if he was really in love with me the past 6 months, or maybe it was just me that needed him more than he needed me. Anyway, is that normal for an ISTJ? A response like that? Do they get so focused that they don't think about love? Maybe it's just me being a hopeless romantic.. I just need some perspective. Am I overthinking this?
1	Long-distance relationship didn't work in the past. You're trying to rekindle something again? What are you? A glutton for pain?
3	Stuck at work until 10pm	I started work at 8 am this morning and I'm stuck at work until 10pm. Only weird thing is, i actually really don't mind it. Usually I'd get all fussy and act like a child but lately I just really don't care what time I'm done work. My hunger seems to have mostly disappeared, I eat roughly around 1-2 times per day and I'm perfectly content. I'm just ranting because it's a bit of a weird behavior for me. \n\nDoes anyone else every experience that ? 
3	I also experience this especially the hunger part for some reason,  I dont need to eat much and can go without eating for 12-15 hours easily. Once you start work, its like everything mecomes mechanical and flows naturally so time flies and once youre done relaxing is more pleasant imo
2	Get me into a well defined project that's engaging, and I'd do the same thing.  I've had to commit myself to leaving work by 5 pm or so.  Otherwise, I just don't even know what time it is.
2	Well... don't over exert yourself. You'll live longer that way.
1	what's your job?
1	Well it's got some good days and bad days. I enjoy building walls and bricklaying. So I guess the hardscaping aspect is what I enjoy more.
1	>8 am this morning \n\nWell, it would be weird if it was 8 AM this afternoon....
5	Weekly Thread: Back to school! What questions do you have about surviving school/college? What advice would you give to younger Redditors?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what questions and advice do you have about going back to school/college?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
4	1) College isn't for everybody. Don't be ashamed to go to trade school.\n\n2) If you do go to trade school, get a job doing the trade you went to school for, because if you don't, you might wind up doing boring-ass data entry stuff for an anal-retentive, helpless, narcissistic man-child.
3	Well, since nobody else has posted yet here is my advice.\n\n1. Caffeine makes life a lot better.\n\n2. Calm down before tests. Going into tests panicked will make your mind go blank\n\n3. Do your homework, especially in math classes. In the end, homework is just practice for tests.\n\n4. Try to not have too much free time. Personally, if I have too much free time, I will procrastinate more. I think it is related in part to use being ISTJs.\n\nThat's all I got for now.
2	Don't get too caught up in grades. Learn networking skills, join organizations, and have fun not stupid fun.
1	Will I have a job that pays well after I graduate? (Going for CS degree)
10	Do you sometimes feel as though people don't take situations seriously?	I mean from an ethical angle: just how far would other people (generally) tolerate the slightest lapse in moral sentiments for the sake of being in a more stable sort of 'social symphony' with others? From my experience, whenever someone mentions something that should in fact be offensive to everyone and others just pretend like nothing happened, I notice, and I decide I would let my hidden comments pass - it plunges the whole environment into an atmosphere where the offensiveness becomes increasingly overbearing but the combined forces of apathy and cordiality manage to curb any sort of dissidence against the stream of deviance before it even kicks. And I just - god - I question why I even sit there and let my coexistence with them linger. Would it be too suicidal to just shout every time people are being too blind to question an immoral remark and not agreeing to never say or hear it again?\n\nOr maybe it's me who's the one at the verge of insanity, and far, far from the normal.
6	If it's *that* offensive, say something.  Maybe you'll get the backing of the rest of the people around you.\n\nMaybe the rest of the people around you will flip out and say you're "triggered" and be offended that you're offended, in which case you should probably stop hanging out with those people, but at least then you'll know.
1	If I'm understanding correctly, your OP seems to be describing a struggle with/from your Fi-tert?
8	How do you define romantic love?	I'm asking as an outsider. I see that some of you don't think you're capable of feeling love at all, while others seem to simply have a difficult time expressing it. How would you describe the actual feeling of being 'in love' and how do you think you typically express it? Secondly, what is you favorite way to be shown love by another person?\n\nThanks so much, guys. ISTJ's are the best.
9	I thought that I've been in love in the past, but lust can be very deceiving... I like to show and be shown love physically, so I get the two confused a lot.\n\nI think that real love is when you would unconditionally support someone, no matter what happens, and when you know that they would do the same.  I'm intentionally leaving "support" very vague here, because it can mean a variety of things.\n\nThe problem with me is that I expect a partner to be able to support themselves, so having to support them is draining.  One girl wanted to try to balance the support given by both sides, so she kept on asking me if there was anything bothering me that she could help with.  There wasn't really much.  I just wanted her to need less support.  So the support just kept on being unbalanced.
6	I know I'm capable of feeling it.  I love my parents.  I love my sisters.  I love my dogs.  Different kind of love, I know, but it's there.\n\n>How would you describe the actual feeling of being 'in love' and how do you think you typically express it?\n\nNo idea.  Check back with me after I develop the social skills required to talk to women I'm romatically interested in.  At the rate I'm going, that should be sometime around the year 2542.\n\n>Secondly, what is you favorite way to be shown love by another person?\n\nAgain, no idea.  See above.
3	The one time I have been in love, the best way I could describe it was a feeling of safety, almost. Like a snowy evening sitting next to the fire with some cocoa, I suppose.
2	I (an ISTJ male), for sure, know that I am capable of feeling love, but the feeling of being 'in love' can sometimes make me to somewhat overthink it too much. Like you said, "have a difficult time expressing it", in which I do at times, but not all the time.\n\nFor me, I would describe the feeling of being in love and how I think I express it is as if there was a slight weight lifted off of your body, but there is another weight on your mind/head, which is me almost constantly thinking about the person I'm in love with. There is sometimes a feeling of euphoria along with my body being a bit more relaxed than it usually is.\n\nMy personal favorite way to be shown love is usually a long, comfortable hug(sounds a bit cliche) that is a front hug, and not a half-a**ed side hug. Another two ways is that she actually tells me that they love me in a romantic way(but with how busy my life is, I don't know when I will ever hear that) and holding hands with her. 
1	Three Ways Introverts can be Better Bosses for Extroverts	
0	How can I tell if this ISTJ wants to be romantically involved?	Dear ISTJs,\n\nThere's this ISTJ I know and I think she may be interested in me as more than a friend, but I can't really tell yet. Could you help?\n\nWhy I think she may be interested: She has this *look* she gives me sometimes. It's like kind of intense but also chill, and her eyes seem kind of soft and affectionate. I really don't know what to make of it. Like the other day, we were hanging out and I looked over at her and she had that look, and I just kind of smiled back at her but inside I was thinking, *"Maybe this is a signal. Is this a signal? Maybe it's a signal. But maybe it's not??"*\n\n^(Probably not related, but: I've noticed that she seems to give me this look a fair amount when we're alone and don't have clothes on. But I'm confused because it also happens when we're dressed. Oh, and I don't know that this is even relevant, but she tells me she loves me sometimes. And spends time with me a lot. And we're moving in together next month and will be sharing the bed. But all that stuff could mean *anything,* right?)\n\nHow do I find out what that look really means? How do I know if she likes me? Should I just keep smiling back at her and thinking she will understand? Or something else?
13	fucking tired of r/istj being r/relationships.\n
5	This post is sarcastic, no? You guys fuck, she tells you she loves you, and you're moving in together. It sounds like you two are seriously dating. ISTJs are honest and practical- she wouldn't be sleeping with you, telling you she loves you, or moving in with you unless she was very serious about you romantically. We don't beat around the bush or play games, we are honest with how we feel. And it sounds like she's being really open and honest with how she feels about you.
4	> I've noticed that she seems to give me this look a fair amount when we're alone and don't have clothes on. But I'm confused because it also happens when we're dressed.

And we're moving in together next month and will be sharing the bed. **But all that stuff could mean anything, right?**\n\nYou can't be serious. How much more explicit do you expect her to be about her feelings?
8	why are people responding to this so seriously? lmao
3	:P
3	Well, now we know what the "TK" in your username stands for: Troll Kitten.
2	Your posts are incredibly helpful, insightful, and clear. I for one am glad you took an opportunity to poke fun at what is becoming sort of a recurring theme on this sub, especially considering the audience.
2	Walk up, Ask her. \n\nYou're sounding like you have no mouth. Like your whole life you've been dependent on telepathy to tell how someone feels about you but this time your telepathy has failed you because she is wearing Max Eisenhardt's telepathic resistant helmet. \n\nYou asking around here is just a cop out. An escape and a justification to stall. Want to know the hard truth? If you hesitate it means you don't like her all that much anyway. Move on. Also, for the sake of others here quit bringing your relationship questions here as you can see we arent' too fond of it.

4	Pokémon Go. I've played it since launch, and although I don't play it as much as I once did, I still usually play at least once a day.\n\nI'm missing 7 Pokémon from Gen 1, and I'm still missing a lot from Gen 2. The only reason I've played this long is because it's Pokémon. Niantic (the developer) is inept, and every update introduces more bugs. Not to mention that they take features away (ie tracker). The game now doesn't even have half the stuff depicted in the trailer. \n\nIt's a sad life, but it's also like the Mafia. Once you're in, you never leave.

2	Fountain pens.  Archaic, inconvenient, and I use one every day.\n\nI use it when writing cursive (which is yet another thing), but quite arguable whether that was a "fad" considering it's been in use and taught for decades.  And even worse, this is writing in a Franklin day planner (even again, yet another thing).\n\nIt occurs to me there may be some here who've never held a fountain pen, can't read cursive, and have never heard of a Franklin planner.  This post is probably useless....\n\nAnachronisms, unite!
11	How to tell if an ISTJ likes you as more than a friend	What are some signs to look for that show an ISTJ might be interested in being more than just friends? I know that every individual person is different, but I'm trying to pick up on a few generalities to look for. How do you guys act when you like someone as more than a friend?
26	The only way to be sure: Ask them.\n\nAs for me, I tend to get really quiet.  Why?  Because as socially awkward as I am normally, when I'm around someone I like as more than a friend, any attempt to speak makes my normal social skills look down right debonair in comparison.\n\nSo instead, I follow the wisdom of Ben Franklin: Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.\n\nNeedless to day, it doesn't get me ~~a lot of~~ any dates.
7	Yes if you want to know ask directly is best.  \n\n\nBehavioural : \nI think with people I'm interested by I enjoy observing them from a distance. Often confused by how I can give them a conversation. Maybe I'll subtly act "nicer" towards them than most people of their group/class ( like acquaintances ). Unless you also have a good eye for picking things up you may not notice this or like another ISTJ they may not act any differently. And if you pick up on this and point it out I'll have a heart attacc-\n\nRemembering your talking about friends who are interested. They could be more initiating with activities or conversations. Maybe more open to new things in your company ? When they want to talk about their future seriously - they may see you in it romantic or not. \n\nAlso if your friend you think is into you, I think it's best if you're NOT interested to be forgiving  and explain why your not interested that way and be understanding. Because for me when I like someone there's a tiny bit of emotions involved (attraction?), since I'm not very emotional, it's a horrible feeling when the little feels you choose to feel get shot down/rejected.\n\n  \nHope this is okay, I haven't had breakfast yet. 
4	Interested? ISTJs and ESFPs are known to get along rather well. ;)  \n\nIt's hard to tell. We're not naturally emotionally effusive or expressive in general, so a little extra effort on their part to get to know you better, spend time with you is generally a good sign. 
2	If I like someone more than a friend I'll go out of my way to do nice things for them, take a little bit of the burden off of their shoulders. I'll also try to find a way to be near that person a little bit more, maybe try to talk to them, and learn more about them. \n\nTime is a resource that no matter how much, we try we cannot get back. So if I'm going out of my way for something, then it is important to me. 
1	i normally ask if they have any weekend plans...because i wanna hang out haha
8	Weekly Thread: What do you judge people for most often?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what do you judge people for?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
17	Not being aware of what's going around on them or considerate to those around them. Example: Driving in the fast lane with three cars on your ass despite there being a giant opening in the slow lane. 
10	Demeanour. If you're loud and annoying I'm not going anywhere near you. Sorry but I don't have time for you. Please approach me some other time when you've calmed down
5	Not doing what they say they will. \n\nIf you make an appointment, be there on time. If you say you'll call someone back, actually do it. If you have a deadline, ensure the relevant work gets done before it's due. \n\nYes, shit happens. Sometimes trains get delayed, your phone runs out of battery, or unforeseen problems arise. But if something is going wrong every time you have a commitment or responsibility, you get a reputation for being unreliable. 
3	Appearance. Not things people can't control, but choices that don't make sense - clothes that are overtly undersized, underwear that is blatantly exposed, garish makeup choices, poor/no grooming etc. It shows a lack of situational awareness to me. 
3	General stupidity.\n\nAnd I don't mean things that a person could have learned but didn't  (unless I know that they had every opportunity and chose willful ignorance instead ).\n\nI mean things where anyone with the tiniest amount of common sense can see the outcome, but the stupid person does the stupid thing anyway. 
2	Not knowing what an Ethernet cable is, when you run a business dependent on the internet.
2	When people are rude (generally, as there are times when a more abrasive way of being is necessary), or when people are carelessly incompetent. I'm fine if you don't know what you're doing, but to just muck things up and not think to find a solution even if it means going to someone else just kills me.
2	Judgementality, ironically enough.
2	Blaming others for things they should be taking responsibility for. 
2	Manners.  \n\n\n\nSpatial awareness.  \n\n\n\nEnergy levels.  \n\n\n
2	Behaviour.
2	Nothing much really. I make mistakes myself.
7	How do you guys meet new people?	So basically I'd like some new friends, good friends. I graduated college 2 years ago and am also single. My college friends have all dispersed throughout the USA. Do you guys have any tips for meeting new people whether it be a bro or a gal. I am very nervous around people sometimes and bars and stuff aren't really my scene. I'd also like to magically meet people with the same hobbies I have (ha). I am like 90-95 percent introverted according to Myers Briggs. 
2	I meet people online all the time if that counts, Im active on discord in servers of my specific interest and its easy to talk with people and form relationships.
1	Where do other people who like the same hobbies you do meet up? Go there.
1	I joined Meet-Up.. specifically a theatre group (as in going to plays, movies, etc), book club, and an introvert group.  Though I find that friendships don't really translate outside of the group.  I only ever see these people at events.  Also volunteering... but I don't really meet people as much since I'm more focused on doing the job that I've been assigned. 
1	You don't
7	Survey for ISTJs about Movies	Hello everyone! I'm an ENFP writer, and I am wondering if you guys could help me with a little project I'm working on. I'm curious about whether or not individuals in specific Myers-Briggs personality types have similar movie preferences as those in their same type, so I figured I'd conduct some surveys to find out. I'd love to have some feedback from you all, so if you are interested in participating, please name your top 3-5 favorite films (and a short description on why you chose them, if you'd like. That part isn't required). There are no wrong answers to how you go about this.\n\nThank you in advance for your assistance. I look forward to reading everyone's comments!

3	I grew up on 70s and 80s action movies (Missing in Action, Invasion USA, Rambo, Commando, Top Gun, etc.).\n\nAs I've gotten older, I've grown to appreciate some depth and story, but I still mostly like to see stuff blow up.

2	Road to Perdition\n\nI love stories about journeys and how they change people along the way. It's a story about loyalty, family and a father's fear that his child may make the same mistakes he made.\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nThe best war movie of all time. I like it for similar reasons I like Road to Perdition. I like the themes of duty, brotherhood and the story is about finding something to be proud about in an altogether shit situation. My favourite mini series is Band Of Brothers.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings\n\nPretty much the same as above. Journeys of discovery, duty, loyalty, brotherhood, hope.\n\nThe Fifth Element\n\nI love the world and the characters. The lead is rather quiet and gets shit done.

I love how he thought little of himself and more for the better of all. Time travel is always cool if done well. \n\nLeon: The Professional - Interesting character. Leon is in a career that most would then classify him as a bad guy. But, his actions to save and give the little girl a better life says otherwise.\n\nTotal Recall! - The dialogue is amazing. Arny's acting is LOLS. Sci-Fi is fascinating. \n\n\n(Honorable Mentions)\nNightmare on Elm Street - Enjoyable. Great Halloween film. This film is probably neck and neck with Child's play as all time favorite horror genre film.
7	ISTJs! What's that one thing your job absolutely, positively must have?	
27	Consistency.\n\nI want to know what my job duties are, and I want to be left alone to do them.\n\nDon't spring new crap on me every other day, and don't pester me while I'm trying to do the job I've been hired to do.
11	Freedom from micromanagement. 
11	Clearly defined expectations.
11	Instructions. Process docs. I like to know exactly what is expected of me.
4	Autonomy.
2	Ability/willingness to improve. 
2	Everything that has already been said!  Though probably the most important (right now anyways) is clearly defined expectations and duties and somewhere to find the knowledge or infi to execute these duties.  For example, they threw me on reception to cover off a break and said to just answer the phone... except I don't know the answers to any questions the callers were asking.  Frustrating!
4	Hello! It is I, an ENTP!	I'm researching how the different MBTI types like to be asked out/approached romantically for an article, and would like (semi) serious answers. So, if someone was interested in you, whether it be a friend or a stranger in a bar, how would you appreciate someone asking you out in a romantic fashion? Thank you!
27	Be direct.  Something as simple as "I'm interested in dating you.  Will you go out with me?" would be perfect.\n\nDon't drop hints.  Don't be subtle.  Don't expect me to "figure it out."  Because I won't.
14	You could say "lemme smash" and I still wouldn't know you meant anything. \n\nJust say it plainly. \n \n"I like you" \n(Oh how nice, they're so friendly :D) \n"I think you're interesting! We should go on a date" \n(Flirt detected?) \n \nIMO I don't like compliments. From stranger compliments seem ingenuine. Talk first so there's some depth between you two, just show your interested in them (socially) but make any intentions/interests clear. \n\n\n\n
12	Be 110% straight forward. Not sure about others, but when someone flirts with me I've got no fucking clue, straight over my head it goes. 
5	I would appreciate "I'm interested in you, would you like to go out sometime?" No games. If you just met me then some convo is needed just to get an idea of what kind of guy you are. 
1	As others have said, be direct. Literally, you can be flirting with me and I would be smiling and stuff without realising, you're actually flirting.
1	Hell, i'd need to get to know them first. And if I kept any sense in me at all in the very moment that stranger first spoke - I would build one pretty quickly. Within a matter of minutes, before I decide I know enough about them to devote my mental participation. Though, I wouldn't really say i'm too fond of romance. I'd do it for the potentials of the connection, first?\n\nAnyways I primarily came here to say some praises for the wonderful and creative username. (Yes, I actually came here for that. It's so beautiful)
7	Day off work, feeling lost.	What can I do when I have a day off work ? I often struggle with this, I want to spend daylight. However part of stuff that needs done is routinely done in the evening. \n\nEveryone else is always busy. Any ideas ? 
10	I realized at some point that being bored was contributing to my depression so I started making a list of things to do. It includes chores that need to be done, errands that I need to run, hobbies such as gardening, knitting, reading. I also usually get 60-120 minutes of exercise in per day, from walking, cycling, or running. Some times I just go out to eat, usually breakfast. 
4	I play a lot of video games. That makes time fly lol.
3	Come to peace with yourself. It very much looks like you are running away from yourself, unconsciously. A lot of people do this.\n\nDon't you have any hobby/interests?
2	I do all my work in the morning time. Dishes, sweeping, laundry. Everything basically. And then after I'm done I do he stuff I wanna do. Like read, drink tea watch a movie. I love to be just be alone lol 
1	Spend time with people you like
8	What is your Learning Style?	We were told to take this short quiz in a class to help us figure out the best way for us to learn and I am just curious what the learning style of other ISTJs are. \n\n[The quiz](https://www.webtools.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/)\n\n[My results](http://i.imgur.com/3PyligT.png)\n\nOnce you have your results, [this](http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/ILSdir/styles.pdf) will provide you with more of an explanation of each style.

5	Weekly Thread: What's something you'd like to experience at least once in your lifetime?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what is one thing you'd like to try in your lifetime, at least once? It can be an activity, an emotion, a substance etc.\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like! This thread brought to you by a sinus infection that I can't seem to get rid of
7	[deleted]
5	Total solar eclipse. 
4	Just doing something absolutely spontaneous and in the moment without ridiculously overthinking it...
3	I really want to try DMT. I've done a few psychedelics at this point and really want to try what I consider to be the big daddy. 
3	Skydiving maybe. Definitely visiting another country would be cool. Spotting constellations, galaxies and planets. Witnessing an aurora. Also reminded by another comment, I always miss eclipses and where I live makes it nearly impossible to see them. 
2	A glass of hot chocolate, a shot of whiskey, maybe an edible, and to sit in the influence of that and look at the northern lights in utter silence.
2	Being able to depend only on myself and never needing help from another person. \nI think that would be a good feeling to experience. 
2	Going to San Diego Comic Con. My wife and I are huge nerds. 
1	Thoughts on racism?	Independiently of what happened in Charolettesville, what do you think about ethnical segregation/racism?\n\nDo you support it? If so, what are your reasons to support it?
10	I judge people more by their own culture and character than the colour of their skin or any stigma around their race. I'm willing to talk to anyone and find something in common, that way everyone can at least get along one way or another.
7	I do not support ethnic segregation and racism. While I do value people based on non-race factors, I do think it's important to acknowledge and try to be aware of the fact that race/ethnicity/culture do play roles in people's lives. Yeah, some people don't know much and are ignorant in certain matters, and it's wrong to shame them and criticize, but we should also place emphasis on the significance of educating others on multiple perspectives in a respectful manner.\n\nI think my beliefs come from a logical place, but first and foremost that they just feel like the right way to think, almost from a moral perspective instead.
4	It is truly something I just cannot comprehend.
3	Not an istj, but I'll throw in my two cents.  I see racism as a form of mental laziness. Rather than exert the mental energy of seeing individuals as they are, or seeing a race/culture in all its nuance, the racist tries to limit people to their most basic categorizations. Some of the racists I know are logical people, others are dumb as they come. The racists I know personally think in extremes. \n\nRacism will always exist, mainly because there's two sides to humanity. There are those who lack curiosity, who never want to step outside their comfort zones, who are content with living with people who are exactly like them. And then there are those who explore, who try new things and who ask questions. These two types of people will always be at odds with each other. 
2	I'm not a racist, but a bigot. Not all cultures are equal. 
2	Racism is wrong, and while I can "understand" how the ignorance persists, the position is basically untenable. \n\nEdit: needed to be a bit more specific.
3	I see the "Racist" insult as a cursing label, carelessly used nowadays by SJWs to shut out any reasonable discussion involving human groups\n\nIf you don't like the message, you either try to find ways to counter-argue against the message, or try to find a way to accept the message, but never try to shoot the messenger
-3	This question comes off incredibly nasty and insincere.\n\nNot only do you assume a position, but you act as if it is defensible to start.\n\nRacism is a cultural problem, a human problem. Not a problem for some personalities and not others. It isn't acceptable, and certainly not "supported". Some people are victimized and brainwashed by racists who only serve to divide people - but it doesn't have to do with personality.
11	How to differentiate between friendliness and romantic interest?	Hi! Without giving out too many details, I met a single ISTJ (100% certain he is one) in the workplace. Because of how our teams work, I don't see him too often, but I have developed a pretty big crush on him, and we got coffee recently since he offered to give me career advice. I was silly and didn't realize that would have been a good time to give him my number to gauge interest, but ah well.\n\nHe said if I try to return (am an intern and will be looking for full-time next year) he would love for me to come back and work on his team---we haven't really had a chance to work together on things/he hasn't seen my working capabilities at all. I can't tell whether he likes me in an impersonal or personal manner---he's initiated the chance to get coffee but besides basic questions didn't really go in depth on asking more personal questions about me which I believe an ISTJ would do if they were romantically interested. It's probably just him being friendly and helpful (since you guys really are that!), but I can see him being hesitant to pursue anything (I'm an intern---age difference of 7 years, not sure if I will be in his city next year).\n\nAnyways, I digress. How can I tell whether one of you guys is interested in a girl romantically vs. just trying to be a helpful person? What does my situation sound like to you all? What's a non-awkward way to give him my number before I leave and would you recommend doing it? Sorry for being an awkward person and thanks!
13	>besides basic questions didn't really go in depth on asking more personal questions about me which I believe an ISTJ would do if they were romantically interested\n\nMaybe.  Or, he might be totally interested, but also be trying not to push, come on too strong, or appear clingy/desperate/crazy.\n\n>What's a non-awkward way to give him my number before I leave and would you recommend doing it?\n\nUm... say "Hey, here's my number.  Feel free to call me."?  And yes, do it.\n\nIf he *IS* interested, he is very unlikey to make the first move, and if he does, it will be a couple of years from now once he's finished analyzing the situation.  He will most likely be the **last** person to know that you're interested in him.\n\nHell, if you're really interested, *ask him out*, and be direct about it.
3	I'm the last person to give advice on this so I won't but I'd like to hear what others say. I can never tell if a girl is interested or just being friendly so I default to she's just being friendly especially at work to avoid any terribly awkward situations that may arise if I assume wrong. I will say that when you develop feelings for someone it is so much easier to misconstrue their friendliness as flirtatiousness...good luck (or whatever the proper thing to say here is :-)
0	You should all watch season 2, episode 4 of Adam Ruins Everything. If you didn't already know, this MBTI stuff isn't real.	
26	Isn't real and being total BS aren't really factual. Myers-Briggs is a tool that shows how a person responds in situations. It should not be taken as the final solution in dictating your personality. There are a ton of factors that go into it. 
16	And as well all know, everything on trutv is real. Says so right in the name. 
16	Great way to light a fire, terrible way to engender a rational discussion.\n\nDid you come here for a fight or did you want to actually talk about this?
10	MBTI isn't a horoscope. You're inputting your own responses and getting a classification out of it. Anyways, when you have a new way to label yourself then you have another way to find like labelled people and can make new connections. "Real" or "fake", good has come from it. \n\nSorry everyone didn't get triggered af like you were hoping.
5	A problem that I have with this video is that they don't talk about the theory at all which would be easy to for me to argument against them because they would probably say misleading information like the part about the feeler which makes no sense at all.\n\nAnyway, most people think the test is garbarge, the test is just to help have a guess of your type by noticing vague correlations. The type description are also horrible for the most part. Another thing is that the dichotomies (the letters of your type) are not a very good way of defining a type which most people that are not familiar with mbti thinks makes the core of the theory. Even if you go in deeper and learn function theory, most of the description are bad. If you want to use mbti, you need to do a lot of research through various sites to find information that isn't crap. So technically I agree that mbti isnt a good system, the only way to use it is to study it a lot and dissect the good parts from the bad. \n\nA better system than mbti is socionics which fix most of the problem that mbti has.\n\nIf you're curious, this post is pretty good at defending mbti validity: http://personalitycafe.com/myers-briggs-forum/283457-another-mbti-debunking.html#post8744961
6	Weekly Thread: What is the most cringeworthy moment you remember?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what is the most cringeworthy thing that happened to you or someone you know?\n\nIf you can't think of any (lucky you), come vote for the ones you think are most cringe!\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!\nThis thread brought to you by a sinus infection that I can't seem to get rid of
7	I was at a funeral for a toddler who had drowned in his family swimming pool and was talking to some mutual friends who were there with their baby asleep in a stroller; I made the comment that 'naw, he's dead to the world' before visibly cringing and slinking away. This is probably about 25 years ago but still makes me cringe.
7	Oh boy I have many but I'll tell one of the least embarassing ones. \n\nOne time I referred to pewdiepie as "a guy I know" and the person I was talking to obviously noticed that I was talking about pewdiepie, world famous YouTuber with 50 million subs\n *sigh*
5	When I was in 7th grade, I accidentally shaved one of my eyebrows off. I didn't know how razors worked and thought I was going to do a bit of a trim. My entire right eyebrow was removed but instead of having common sense, I decided to shave the other one off to make things even.\n\nI drew my eyebrows in for weeks and the next day I went to school and we had an earthquake drill where we had to be in a crouched down position. That position made my eyebrows touch the floor and then one of my friends proclaimed in a very panicked tone, "Your eyebrows are gone!"\n\nNever again.
6	I actually have many because I was a really awkward kid growing up. \n\nI e-mailed a girl when I was in 7th grade and told her I had a crush on her. She was attractive, popular, funny and was also a cheerleader. You know, basically like every boy's dream girl. I was the kid who was labeled as a loser and I also talked with a lisp so honestly, I didn't really have a chance, but you know how that goes.\n\nWe were friends, because we had some classes together, but that was about it. Like I said, one day, my 7th grade boy hormones got the best of me and I decided to send her an e-mail and express my feelings to her and how much I liked her. Much to my surprise, she did e-mail me back, and say we were just friends. I was disappointed and instantly regretted it.
5	I leaned on a "an alarm will sound if this door is opened" door in highschool. Whoops.
3	I'm not one to usually cringe, but I got one. \n\nI've been going to the same gym over the past year and a half or so and have gotten to know the staff more or less. I was leaving and noticed this extremely skinny redhead dude talking to the front counter girl. I would say the girl was an 8/10 and he was asking her to hang out at his place. She said she had other plans tonight and he asked about tomorrow, and she said the same thing. I admire him for being brave enough to do so. I've never had the confidence to so, but I also would never hit on a girl while she is at work.  He made plans like this for 4 days straight before finally just walking away silently. I understand she was in a weird spot as she was working and couldn't be rude, but this dude seemed to have some kind of autism to not understand sooner. I saw the other staff silently laughing at this happening in front of them, but I just felt so uneasy, which I would guess is a feeling of cringe. I've never felt it since then, thankfully. I can't imagine how the dude felt when he left and kind of feel sorry for him in retrospect. 
2	Wow, there are quite a few. Most recently I saw a friend's mother for the first time in years, and she asked how my wife was doing. I was then required to explain that my fiancee had actually dumped me before we actually got married. The feeling of explaining that is enough to make my insides twist even now.
5	Finds watching TV shows overwhelming?	Just a casual post I was thinking about this whilst on the couch with a cold before heading to bed. Theres a British comedy/soap thing on. I always find these shows are cluttered and I can't fully relax watching them. I'm constantly trying to observe the scene and never know where to look. The printed wallpaper,  twenty different cups or three stacks of books I take in piece by piece until I process the whole scene. \n\nWell known show street "coronation street" for example I'd examine the houses, pub before I focus on the characters and the dialogue .\n\n
6	I don't watch much tv. But I can see where you are coming from. I play a lot of video games and I get the same way about those. Some games with a lot of content or strategy involved that I don't already know I just avoid entirely. 
3	I have read books that are like that. They have a very artificial almost scigen feel to them. I believe the word for it is "cliche" which is a rarity in this age of communication. There is certainly an overwhelming emphasis on materialism that is less than empirical and perhaps the subject of some moral turpitude. And here is the kicker they are most often claimed to be "Top Sellers".
16	just stopping by to say i love you guys	& thanks again for all your help with my earlier post!\n\nhave a great day!!
6	I'm glad to see this post. \n\nWould you be willing to share any updates, even if partial/inconclusive? \n\nFor example, have you had a chance to talk with your husband about all of this, and if so how did it go?
5	Do you guys enjoy helping people do/learn new things? What qualities endear you to others?	Just a random curiosity that popped into my head while chatting with another friendo. \n\nI worked with an ISTJ who was a few decades older than me (I'm 22) and although I think I annoying her at first, she seemed to grow rather fond of me after I came to her for help for a few times (although I'm sure it's not the only reason, she deals with people who take her for granted/act better a lot. ppsh, always be polite to people, especially your head admins)\n\nHaving to show someone again and again is irritating, but there are some super obvious things I never learned how to do, being the Damn Millenial that I am. Postage, fax machines, etc. are all super confusing to me so I always went to her for help LOL. \n\nShe would always shake her head and sigh but she always slipped me random cute office goodies and even booked me an extra night free in Vegas for a trip and said "Technically, the convention STARTS that day" hehe. She ended up telling me that she thinks it's amusing and kind of fun to help someone learn something new and kind of be the resident expert, and she doesn't get to do that a lot.\n\nI know there's also a sort of phenomenon I read about where people actually like you more if they do you favors, and not the other way round. \n\nDo you guys enjoy teaching or helping others, in general? Could that be more of a generational thing? I'm an ENTP but very rarely do I enjoy training or teaching, unless that's my literal job. p: What sort of behaviors or qualities do you like in others? \n\n*ijustwantalltheistjstolovemepls*
3	I definitely enjoy sharing knowledge! Especially when I'm still learning about a topic myself. I'm very interested in economics and art history, and I absolutely love telling those around me about the cool things that I've learned. \nI'm currently studying a BCom and when people come to me for help I do enjoy helping them. Teaching others also helps me get the facts into my brain as well.
3	>Do you guys enjoy teaching or helping others, in general?\n\nIn general, no.  Most people are idiots and refuse to actually learn.\n\nHowever, if the person is actually willing to pay attention and learn, then I'm happy to help.\n\nMy first job out of high school was working in a call center doing tech support.  Pretty much the least ISTJ place to work ever.  My least favorite calls were ~~all of them~~ the ones where the person called in and insisted that they knew what they were doing, but they obviously didn't. \n\nSome of my favorite calls were ~~none of them~~ when the person would call in and start the call with "I have no idea what I'm doing."\n\nI would tell those people "That's fine.  Pay attention, follow my instructions, and we'll get you fixed."  And when they did pay attention and follow my instructions, I'd get them fixed.
2	You're an artist too? If you have any stuff I can see I'd love to look!\n\nThe project that I did which was inspired by ancient Egypt was a lino print and I pretty much just used cool patterns inspired by their paintings. From my limited understanding they did a lot of paintings on limestone - rougher surfaces were plastered over. I mostly looked at the sculptures, because the main subject matter of my print was of the bust of Nefertiti. I could link you to a picture of one of the prints if you're interested :p\n\nEdit: whoops I replied to the wrong comment thread lol
2	I like helping others or guiding others however I couldn't teach for the life of me. The second I'm  asked to help someone, I get anticipation and excitement. Then I'm told what to do and I think "oh that's not fun exactly" but I still have that feeling and do it anyway because someone entrusted me to it. \n    \nLearning: I've  always been open to learning new things and gaining understanding and perspective. New cultures, languages, cuisines, architecture, animals, the universe and spirituality.  I love learning and becoming familiar with more things I'm  surrounded by. Sometimes I think of it all and I get so overwhelmed by the universe as a whole and it's wonderful.  \n\nTeaching : I mean I can tell someone 4+4 is 8 but I can't elaborate lengthy idea's or theories.  I can understand  them but wording them according to my own understanding and having to neutralize that for teaching someone is why I don't- it's hard. \n\nQualities I like :     \nHumble.  \nConsiderate towards others.  \nPoliteness.   \nConscientiousness.      \nGenuine.     \nUnderstanding. \n\nIf anything out of anyone I'd ask they be understanding and that is the essential quality I value most. I yearned for understanding as child of things I didn't know. I want to understand and want to be understood.  This is my highest priority because I believe this is something everyone values. 
2	I love teaching people about things that I am passionate about! Very satisfying. 
7	(enfp) please help me with communicating & supporting my istj husband re: job/career change	i tend to ramble so i'll try to get to the point for you all 😉\n\nmy husband is miserable where he works (been there 7 years). he is a veteran marine, didn't finish college (he's 32) & has been in the same field for roughly 10 years (concrete). he wants to be a firefighter or state trooper but doesn't think it will provide enough income to cover our needs. \n\nhe is terrified of leaving because of a few important logistics: \n\n•he is currently the sole provider for our family of 3. \n\n•he is the only one with a retirement/health insurance. \n\n& when i give him (what i think is) a pep talk, it causes him significant existential angst: \n\n•how can i just leave where i've put so much time & work in?\n\n•what would we do for insurance in the meantime?\n\n•it would be far too much stress to learn a new job.\n\n•& continues spiraling into: he has made nothing of his life; he has no transferable skills; he should have finished college; he works a terrible job; he would never be able to do a different job/learn all new skills; i'm not proud of how far he has moved up in current company, etc. \n\ni love him so much & just want him to be happy. how can i encourage & empower him to move forward despite his extreme anxiety regarding change? \n\ntl;dr: how can i encourage & empower my husband to move forward despite his extreme anxiety regarding change & start looking for a new career? i think that is what he truly wants. 
10	How considerate of you! \n\nAs an ISTJ myself, and putting myself in his shoes, I'd say the main reason for him staying at this job is the balance between happiness in his job (I'd assume very little) and how miserable you all would be if he was not able to provide for his family. The latter is more important, so he stays. ISTJs are logical thinkers: he'd be more miserable if he'd have a more fulfilling job but if y'all can't get by financially. \nSo assuming this is the case.. Is it possible for you to provide an income as well, even if it's little? I'm guessing that'll take some of the pressure off. Not judging at all! Just trying to help with finding solutions.\n\nAll the best!
5	>tl;dr: how can i encourage & empower my husband to move forward despite his extreme anxiety regarding change & start looking for a new career? i think that is what he truly wants. \n\nMy guess on this would be that you could help considerably if you were to find a  way you could provide some of the resources that would be lost if he left his job. Can you find work? Insurance for the family? Etc?\n\nHe is in a terrible place because he has serious responsibilities that are making him miserable. ISTJs take their responsibilities so **SO** seriously. \n\nIf you could step on and show him he is not alone in being the provider of these kinds of resources for your family, I suspect it could open things up somewhat. \n\nAnd I can totally see why pep talks wouldn't work. Basically, it's all words and those words are setting expectations and obligations on him that he feels stressed about meeting.\n\nAction works better. Show him with your concrete actions that he is not alone in providing for your family.\n\n(source: INFJ in a relationship with ISTJ) \n\nedited for misspelled word
5	Based on comments I saw you mentioned some web site and design stuff. I knew some developers I used to work with would use this site to get some supplemental income, not sure what your level of skill is though. Might be worth a shot.\n\nhttps://www.upwork.com/i/how-it-works/freelancer/\n\nWeb development/design pays pretty well and several places allow remote work. If you want to keep the stay at home duties you could likely find part time work too.\n\nIf you're design oriented, you could make things on Etsy or on of the other sites like it and sell your designs there.\n\nThe hard part is going to be overcoming his reality that he's built up and overcoming his shame. If you pick something up, it's likely going to mean he failed and went back on the agreement. That's going to be hard for him to deal with. Your approach is extremely important. Make sure he knows it's something you want to do and that you want him to find a job he enjoys being at. That his happiness isn't worth being provided for.\n\nYou might need to show him that your idea is going to produce income, so don't be surprised if he needs some proof before accepting your idea entirely.\n\nI had a similar situation, but I was fired and finishing school. We didn't have kids so money wasn't as tight but a job opened up for testing video games. It had been a dream job since childhood. I sat my wife down and proposed a plan, I'd do this for the length of the contract and then get a "real" job.  She was on board. I had a blast doing it but it paid horribly. It completed and I got an office job. 6 months later, a web developer friend of mine put my name in at his place to be a jr developer. I bombed the interview because I hadn't used the skills for over a year. But they liked my personality and saw the "Quality Assurance" experience from the game testing. That got me another interview with the QA Lead, which got me a job. That job doubled my income.\n\nMoral: Sometimes you gotta go after your dream job. Even if it's temporary. \n\nGood luck to you both. 
1	Dress up as a firefighter or state trooper and fuck the hell out of him. At least that would work for me, but what do I know I'm single and a dude. xD
-7	"He is currently our sole provider of 3" why don't you get off your ass and pick up a J-O-B? 
9	(F) INFP falling for (M) ISTJ	Hey guys, I got a couple questions for you/people who know ISTJ's well.\n\nI have this manager at work that always seemed into me, but very timid and nervous. I found out he was an ISTJ pretty early on. We've worked together for quite some time and only recently became very good friends. I broke up with my boyfriend of two years a couple weeks ago, and this ISTJ has been a remarkable support system and friend. When he found out we broke up, he jumped at the opportunity to invite me over. We watched movies, had a few drinks and talked until 5am despite the fact that he worked the next morning. We did this again a couple nights in a row until he finally made a move and kissed me (which was very surprising, because I assumed he would be very afraid of taking that risk as my manager). We've formed a really deep connection and have had a lot of fun over the last few days together, but everything with my ex is still very fresh. My heart is still occupied by a lot of hurt, which wouldn't be fair to him if he wanted a relationship right away (I've voiced all this to him). He told me he's perfectly okay not getting into a relationship right now, although he's extremely warm, affectionate and thoughtful (he makes me breakfast every morning, asks me all the time how I feel about things when he never does that with anyone else, wants to hang out with me all the time, etc).\n\nSo here are my questions:\n1) I really do like him, but I would hate to hurt him by not being as emotionally available as him for a while. Do you think that would be painful for an ISTJ?\n2) I thought I had read at some point that ISTJ's are not usually into one-night stands. Just because I'm a female, I always have a concern in the back of my mind that someone is using me sexually and they're going to just drop me out of nowhere. Considering everything, does that seem like a big possibility?\n3) How quickly do you guys get emotionally attached to someone, typically? Do you think the fact that he's being so thoughtful, warm and completely ignoring the fact that he could easily lose his job over a sexual relationship with me means he's actually attached already? \n\nFor clarification: I do not intend on hurting him. I very much care about him and I'm trying my absolute best to be as clear as possible. I'm not opposed to a relationship in the future, although I think it qould be irresponsible right now.\n\nThank you for any constructive advice and insight!
6	I think ISTJs tend towards being less "use them and lose them" than other types, but obviously that's not a given. \n\nI would be wary of acting too "relationshippy" with him. You might have warned him that your breakup is too fresh, but that's not going to stop an ISTJ who cares about you from forming that bond and loyalty. He's probably already attached, as ISTJs usually aren't the type to be so forward or nurturing unless they've invested. \n\nJust be careful. We can tell ourselves "I told him that I wasn't ready", but you're still responsible for how you act regardless.

1	tell him everything you told us upfront. The more you tell him the less miscommunication and the more fun you can have
2	Question About Co-Workers	Hey everyone,\nI work register/gift wrapper at a store for the summer (ending at the end of August), just recently when we've been closing our charge totals from the machine haven't been matching up to our charge totals to the register, nothing ever considerably big, but a difference nonetheless. These things happen, my co-workers and I understand, but recently I've been getting accused by my one coworker of being the one to mess up the register thus creating the discrepancy. \n\nAll my other coworkers have been working there a long time and this is my first summer on the register, so, I'll admit, sometimes when things get busy I'll mess something up or press the wrong button or whatever. But 100% if I know I messed up or think I messed up, I'll tell my coworker and they'll see what happened. \n\nThe other night I had no problem when my coworker closed, but the night before and this night, they didn't match up. Two nights ago we had some issues with people using Visa Gift Cards and we knew that it was going to be an issue later. Tonight, we compared totals an hour before close and they matched up. I only used the register once in that last hour and was 1000% sure that the one sale I did, I didn't have any problems. But my coworker is seemingly blaming it on me (he's very nice so he's not actually telling me I did anything wrong, but he keeps saying he didn't do anything wrong)\n\nSo. That kind of pisses me off, but I get it because they've been there for MUCH longer than I have. But the thing that gets me is that they always have their Bluetooth piece in and are on the phone for usually like 40% of their shift which can be very distracting, especially when you're ringing up prices and trying to talk to two or three people at once. I'm not totally blaming them but I'm just saying it could've been either of us. Then my coworker said that our boss might just have to put me on wrapping only duty which, to be honest, I'd be bored as fuck and not a helpful employee and would probably just offer to quit because I'd be wasting everyone's time. \n\nNo one else has previously mentioned me being shit at the register job until tonight, because, once again, it happens occasionally through everyone's faults here and there, so I think that's why I'm really salty and needed to rant. I have tomorrow off so we'll see what happens when I get back on Thursday. \n\nTL;DR - Getting accused by a coworker for messing up the register even though I'm sure I didn't do anything wrong. \n\nAnyone have any tips/similar stories or honestly any input on this situation? I could really use some feedback. \n\nThanks. 
1	Have you completed your training?  If yes you should be responsible for any errors concerning performance. \n   \nAre you able to keep the receipts from sales and show them as evidence ? \n   \nYou mention your coworkers are on their phone and off task at times, when they're not it would be great if they could watch you serve a customer.  \n\nEssentially I think you should be trying to show you're capable and that you're notbto one messing up. Get someone to watch you and ask if you did  everything right or if you need improvement.  \n     \nI have worked with register job and I can do it easily however some customers asked for things that made me uncertain how to input that. In those situations I asked someone to help or I'd quickly realize and fix it myself. That was only one job I worked at, never doing customer service again, always tiring.  \n\nThe only other things I can think of is if the other coworkers process orders differently than you do or of there is a slight difference that causes an error? The sequence of buttons you press? Is there extra charges like plastic bags etc you forget to add?  If it isn't the other coworkers it might be a slight error.    \n\nHowever a big "what if" is what if your coworkers are all charging wrongly  and the second you got a job everything because "normal" but that's not how the job works so your pointed out.  Okay that's enough lol, hope this is constructive in some way. 
1	Maybe your coworker knows they have a bad habit of messing the charge totals up, and they're blaming the new guy to make themselves feel better. Have you talked to your supervisor about it? I would assume that if the charge totals have been a consistent problem lately that the cashier supervisor or admin/bookkeeper would be aware of who the most likely culprit was. It wouldn't hurt to ask them about it directly or ask if they have any tips for you on how you could improve as a cashier in your last month with them. \n\nIt sounds like your credit card terminal doesn't communicate with your POS directly. It works the same way in my store. I always make myself say the total aloud and double check it on both screen before going ahead even after using the register for a few years. Mistenders will happen from time to time, but like you mentioned, I'm usually able to catch myself and either fix it in time or I'll leave a note for the supervisor that counts the drawer saying I messed up. \n\nCongrats though on making it through your first summer on the register! Customer service is always hard, but it's especially bad during the summer...\n\n\n
4	How do I get my SJ family to support me?	I keep going into too many details with this post so I'll try to keep it on topic. Just really jumbled up right now, had a fight with them about this yesterday. Posted this on r/enfp, but thought I'd post it here too.\n\nI'm 16, ENFP. I want to finish highschool (UK system, A levels if you've heard of it) within next year with the best grades possible. I have issues with time management (I don't procrastinate, I just take waaaayyy too long doing things, still not sure how to handle that) but I try.\n\nNow, I have much deeper issues. Almost killed myself a few months ago because depression shit, my sleep schedule has always been fucked since I was a child and at the moment I either stay up 24 hours straight working or get really depressed for whatever reason and sleep all day just to avoid the pain, I'm talking 18 hours of sleep here. My diet is HORRIBLE. I've gone days without eating during exam time because I couldn't think of anything but studying, I'm pretty sure the only reason I'm alive is because of my mother leaving a plate of food for me on the table. And when I do eat it's usually junk because I never have the energy or the time to cook anything.\n\nAnyway. \n\nSo, my ESFJ mother has to pay for each exam I give + tuition, and it's a bit on the expensive side as I'm studying under the british education system in a third world country. Money is a bit tight for my family at the moment, so I could understand if it takes me longer to finish highschool than other people since then it would be less of a strain on my mother. I'm currently working as a teacher's assistant and as soon as I get the qualifications I'll apply to local schools to help pay for what I can. I really really want to finish highschool quickly so I can take some time off to deal with my problems and then apply to uni, without ending up being that one older kid in class (not that that's a bad thing, I just don't want to).\n\nBut money isn't exactly the problem here. My mother can pay, it will be difficult, but she can pay for me to finish by 2019 instead of say, 2020. But she doesn't want to.\n\nMy ESTJ sister wants me to take high school very slowly, much slower than my peers do, because of the issues I have that I described above. She is 26, has a great job and she would gladly help out with my education but she does not believe that she should help me at all because I am not doing things the 'right way', which is sleeping on time, not studying for insane hours, eating right and also not sleeping for insane hours and missing classes because of it. She will not support me because she believes she has no reason to because of these problems I have, and my ESFJ mother will not support me either until my sister does.\n\nWhat do I do? What can I possibly do? I can't fix these things, I've had them for years. I understand now would be the best time to fix them and fixing them would give me better results without destroying my brain and my body, but every time I try I end up failing the very next week. I don't have the energy to try anymore. I don't want to. I would rather work till I'm braindead than be efficient and work slowly.\n\nI don't have much leeway with them aside from my grades, which have been straight As so far, and word from my teachers, who all think I'm an excellent student besides missing classes occasionally. But when I bring these up to my sister she just says that I shouldn't get too cocky/arrogant and none of it matters because I didn't do it the 'right way'.\n\nHow do I get out of this? Please, I really don't want the way I am now to fuck up my future or the things I want to do. It's just fucking high school, you study, you pass. I'm trying my best, I understand I'm making mistakes but I wish they would just let me suffer for making them instead of forcing me not to make them by taking things away.
3	The problem, as I see it, is that while you have a "desire" to accomplish this thing, you are not showing that desire to your SJ family members.  They probably don't think that you're serious about getting this done.\n\nIt sounds like the help you need is different from the help you're asking for.\n\nTo me, it sounds like you're asking "How can I convince my family to pay for these exams so I can get this stuff done?"\n\nHowever, it also sounds like the help you *actually* need is in getting over your depression and learning to focus on the task at hand so you can accomplish it more effectively and manage your time better.\n\nBecause of your unhealthy mental state, you probably actually need professional help.  You should see if your mother and/or sister will help you find a therapist to help you work through your depression.  Sort that out and then see how things shake out.
2	Since you have depression, it is quite hard to understand how you feel because I don't know you at all. The only thing I can try to do is suggest you TRY to change your habits and make very detailled time schedules. \n\nThe average person needs between 8-10 hours of sleep, try everything you can to get the bloody hell out of your bed in the morning. Don't study for more then 5 hours a day. \n\nStudy in parts. For example, if you have 3 subjects, and 5 chapters to study per subject, then your schedule can be something like this: (assuming you have 8h of school)\n\n07.00 - WAKE UP and take a cold shower (it really helps, look it up)\n\n07.15    Try to eat, I read that you have trouble eating but food is \n             like fuel, you need it in order to stay fit, try something \n             light.\n\n07.30 - 15.30 - School (try to eat and drink, make notes, pay \n                        attention etc.\n\n15.45 - Relax for 15-30 minutes: read a nice book, watch a bit of tv\n\n16.00 Homework (Subject 1 - Chapter 1)\n\n16.30 -  Break\n\n16.35 Homework (Subject 2 - Chapter 1)\n\n17.05 Break/dinner\n\n17.30 Homework (subject 3- chapter 1)\n\n18.00 Break\n\n18.05 Homework (Subject 1 - Chapter 2)\n\n18.35 Break\n\n18.50 Homework (Subject 2 - Chapter 2)\n\n19.20 Break\n\n19.30 Homework (Subject 3 - Chapter 2)\n\n20.00 QUIT!! Don't study after 8 P.M if you wanna sleep\n\n20.05 Relax on the couch\n\n20.10 Hobby/Exercise/Socialise\n\n21.15 Shower (Cold)\n\n21.30 Sleep \n\nAlso, try to drink 8 glasses of water to stay hydrated and energised and try to put your phone off in class or when studying. Make a schedule for every week. Also, make a schedule for 4 weeks before an exam for what you want to study what day. \n\nThis is just a suggestion, I just hope it was helpful.\n
4	Weekly Thread: What's the sickest you've been?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what's the sickest you've been?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!\n\nThis thread brought to you by a sinus infection that I can't seem to get rid of
5	A few weeks ago I slowly got a runny nose and thought  it would go away, turned into a serious flu/cold. I had to toughen it out for an assessment day which I had to attend. Reluctantly I took the following day off to recover, prior to that I been working 2+ weeks and studying non stop.\n\nA month or so ago I randomly ending up "being sick", not sure to why as in one what I ate that day. Possibly I ate too much proteins...\n\nI barley get sick and usually try to keep up my immune system with citrus and herbal tea. Also I find physical illnesses emotionally upset me. I like doing what I do and when you can't do that because of your body it's torturous.
3	I had strep throat two years ago, and it was the worse experience of my life. To make matters worse I foolishly continued to go to work because I has vacation time coming up, and I didn't want to take off work before then. Having strep throat made me realize how much saliva the human body produces, which is quite a lot btw. My roommate being the only person to know how sick I was really concerned about me, but being how stubborn I am refused to heel. \n\nWhen my vacation time finally started my roommate put his foot down. He drove me to the doctor, I got reprimanded by the doctor for not coming a lot sooner and then said roommate forced me to bed to rest. I know I could have gotten a lot of people sick, but I needed the money, and desperately needed the vacation. 
3	Wew lad, I have all of you beat.\n\nI was in the hospital for the entire month of June 2015, as well as the last week and a half of May. On May 21, I had a surgery for a liver resection. The operation lasted into the 22nd, and was called off when one of the surgeons nicked my vena cava. \n\nSo with that, my kidneys stopped working, so I was placed on dialysis for a few weeks. After a week of anaesthesia, I woke up and was plagued by ICU psychosis.\n\nSo, at one point, I was psychotic, on dialysis, with crazy high blood pressure, and with a plethora of other complications. My doctor didn't expect me to make it to that Christmas.\n\nAnd here I am 😀
2	I used to get tonsillitis a lot. 2 or 3 times a year. Then 1 year I got it 6 times. Doc finally decided it was time to take them out. \n\nI've had the flu a couple of times.  That's 2 weeks of feeling like hammered dog shit.\n\nAbout 4 years ago, I had an outer ear infection that I ignored for a month  (because I thought it was a middle ear infection and those usually go away on their own). Then one night I was in so much pain despite ibuprofen, acetaminophen, **and** aspirin that I couldn't sleep. I had to have my mother drive me to urgent care. Missed 2 days of work and an entire weekend  (slept for 4 days because of the painkillers).
2	I started feeling nauseous at my desk but pushed it away... but before long it got the signal to go NOW RIGHT NOW to the single restroom in the building. It was occupied. I dodged a co-worker and ran out the door to vomit up my lunch *discreetly* in some bushes outside.\n\nThen I threw in the towel and went home, where I was unable to keep down water for 24 hours.\n\nGood times.
2	Visited my parent’s home country as a child, don’t think they vaccinated me too well before the trip. Caught something over there, was deathly sick but still alive today. Other than than, I haven’t been bedridden sick in over a decade. 
2	I once had a very drawn-out asthma attack. I was then un-diagnosed and had no idea about exercise induced asthma. During one gym class, we had to walk three miles in 30 minutes. I initially thought I was just weak because I could barely do this. I tried to shrug it off. By the time it was midnight, I literally couldn't sleep and was wheezing. I kinda thought I was dying. Had to be taken to the hospital at 2 in the morning. They gave me albuterol. Poof! Problem solved. Diagnosis discovered.\n\nTurns out I was not dying. Unfortunately, most of the gym teachers at my high school were not that understanding and still forced me to exercise past the point I could handle, even saying I was "over exaggerating" my breathing problems. Ugh.
2	While working a ton of overtime last year I ended up getting a cold/the flu so severely it had me in bed for nearly two weeks. Couldn't hold down food or water, bathroom locked, and feverish the entire time. Never been that sick before or since.
1	*invades ISTJ space*\n\nOne time my ribs kinda hurt and my coach thought it was fractured (happens often in our sport), but it started hurting worse so I went to the ER. The nurse had a hunch and did a blood test, then got me into a CT scan. \n\nTurns out I had like 4 or 5 clots in my lungs and one had cut off blood flow to a lobe so that infarcted and died. Oops. It all happened within a day. \n\nFun fact: I was only 20 and very active. The nurse who tested me had a clot in his brain that caused a stroke when he was a college athlete, so that's why he had that hunch. Who knows if I had a different nurse? *Ne shhhhhhh*
4	My dad (ISTJ) is having surgery and will be bedridden for a few weeks. I (ENTP) want to find him some good Youtube entertainment so he doesn't go crazy.	As stated in the title, my dad, an ISTJ, will be going under the knife soon. (The surgery is semi-invasive, but he should be just fine thank God).\n\nMy father is 57-years-old and is the kind of person who (1) gets up at the same time every day, (2) goes through the same morning routine, (3) goes to the office and works way too hard at a business he owns, even though he doesn't really need to financially, (4) comes home and looks for extra work to do around the house, and gets annoyed if he can't find any, then (5) pretends to watch TV in his chair as he slowly drifts to sleep while acting like he is not drifting to sleep.\n\nIt is going to mess with his head being bedridden even for a short while. I myself love to binge Youtube videos, but most videos I've shown him are not the type he enjoys (it makes sense that videos on the mysterious nature of quantum mechanics would be super engaging to an ENTP, but perhaps not as much to an ISTJ who has no interest in physics).\n\nAny suggestions on some channels, or just general video/media ideas, I can show to him? He almost never goes on Youtube (or really even the internet), so nothing you recommend will be something he has seen. Also, his interests/hobbies are fishing, hunting, gun collecting, sports, and indescribable random ISTJ stuff about how things work (must be more sensory/mechanical than abstract/philosophical, or else he loses interest very quickly).\n\nYour guys' and girls' advice would be very truly appreciated!\n\nGod bless.
6	First of all, \n\n>it makes sense that videos on the mysterious nature of quantum mechanics would be super engaging to an ENTP, but perhaps not as much to an ISTJ who has no interest in physics\n\nWhy should an ISTJ in particular not be interested in physics or quantum mechanics? I'm ISTJ and that's my entire job; it's what I love more than anything else.\n\nNo one here can speak exactly to what a single individual will enjoy, but I always enjoy watching videos that are educational. So nature documentaries, history documentaries, and yes, quantum mechanics videos, are all good. There are a bunch of series that talk about more mechanical and scientific stuff as well, like How It's Made and How Stuff Works. I'm guessing he wants knowledge he can potentially apply in real life, which is why abstract things aren't that interesting. You may find quantum mechanics videos fun, but if you can't already do the math behind it then it's kind of a waste of your time since you can't apply it anywhere, and so you haven't actually learnt anything.

3	Hunting and gun collecting are broad hobbies.  If he's interested in anything that goes bang, Hickok45 and tntoutdoors9 have interesting channels. \n\nJerry Miculek also has his own youtube channel. 
3	Oooh, gun collecting.\n\nThis channel is fantastic - Forgotten Weapons.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/ForgottenWeapons/videos\n\n"At Forgotten Weapons I think the most interesting guns out there are the most obscure ones. I try to search out experimental and prototype weapons and show you how they work, in addition to more conventional guns that you may not have heard of before. You're much more likely to find a video on the Cei Rigotti or Webley-Fosbery here than an AR or Glock. So, do you want to learn about something new today? Then stick around!"\n\n
2	All my best to your Dad for a speedy recovery from a fellow Te user. \n\n[Manufacturing videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWCdEh0agh4) are [oddly satisfying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhkDh3kaqu8) to watch. Make sure he knows to click the gear to adjust speed settings. \n\nAlso, try looking for for channels on r/EngineeringPorn\n\n
3	ISTJ vs INTJ, Re: Following traditions, rules, social norms; religion, authority, hierarchy, birthdays/holidays.	I see, over on INTJ that there is a lot of confusion between these 2 sub-types and I'm looking to clear it up for my own mind, using some of my own experiences/feelings.\nI *feel* and *think* I am more closely associated with INTJ (but, again, I think many do or at least *want* to for its description, w/o giving much thought to functions themselves).\n\nBut, our Te function seems to create a strong similarity, especially when applied towards 'work' or problem solving.\n\nSo, on topic: I do not care about nor follow most traditions/religions, I was raised Christian, but as early as a teen I lost most respect for religion in general because it seemed (felt to *me*) like I was just 'blindly following' what a bunch of people (writers of the bible and such) said is to be so...the way...the truth. So, I played along, wore my mask, obeyed as long as I had to, until I grew up enough to make my own choices and decide how to spend my time.  Currently, I'd consider myself mostly agnostic, but I continue to research religion and philosophy, often searching for 'what "good" can I take from this' and apply it towards my own life.  This curiosity has led me primarily to Eastern religion and philosophy. Meditation has helped a lot recently, thus my interests in knowing more about the cultures/traditions that it originates from; Who they are, what they are, how they are, and what have they done for the universe? My understanding is; I'm fine letting you believe what you want to, as long as you allow me to believe what I  want to.  So, this is not meant to bash or make judgement towards a persons *own* choice or belief. \n\nI'm not keen on having *too many* rules/regulations, and limiting or stagnating ideas and evolution of a thing/person/environment/field of study/etc.  I often welcome alternate ideas and pov, at least for consideration; for the data aspect of it; to see how others perceive their universe.\n\nI do not do/keep track of birthdays (not even my own), or holidays. I don't like to *celebrate* (make a big fuss about) things, and prefer to instead make each day unique/special in its own way.\n\nI've worked in some environments with a strong political hierarchy and had very little interest in 'playing along' (sucking up/impressing or 'doing the time'  others higher up the chain for example) in order to advance up the so called ladder.  I much prefer we be equals towards one another, expressing and sharing ideas, collaborating. (This train of thought broke down/was interrupted...and re-reading it appears poorly expressed. Yep, I'll even share my broken ideas. ;))\n\n
5	You should check these out:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5tn2ur/how_to_quickly_determine_ni_or_si_in_type_me/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/63jklk/typing_guide_the_rdwier_methodology_an_analysis/\n\nAlso I believe that /r/INTJ is full with mistyped ISTJs, so other ISTJs will be able to relate strongly to them. Some bad INTJ type descriptions even mention things that are typical of ISTJs but not INTJs
2	None of what you say makes you unable to be Istj/Intj, not really related to typology.\n\nThis is a good thread to differ between the two types: https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/637fh5/differentiating_istj_vs_intj_masterpost/
2	Nothing of what you've said differs from how I work. I also previously tested as INTJ. As I'm sure you know, the key here is in the Si vs Ni. For me I see my Si when I talk to people. I often start a story/point by explaining which past event/situation was triggered by something that just happened. Often it's not even a point, it's just me verbalizing a mind association. \n\nThese Si, mind associations also have made people mistake me for being racist, judgemental, etc. I'll point out that I think someone looks Italian for example. Not cause I have any feelings or judgements about Italians just because he looks like a bunch of people I've seen previously who identify as Italian. I'm just verbalizing a mind association, that's all. In fact I love diversity. It helps create new Si "catalog entries." Like the guy who looks Italian but is actually Jewish. Oooh....interesting. Tell me more.\n
2	Advice on what it would take to override a bad feeling?	I (INFP, 23) was with a ISTJ (F20) for about 4 months. It was her first relationship and my 2nd one. My last relationship was very turbulent with my ex cheating on me and so it's taken some time for me to feel ready to date again. This relationship felt very different, she was always very honest with me and I really loved the stability.\n\nShe broke up with me because although it was 'nice', she said she wanted to experience the feeling of a spark. She said we could still be friends though. This came out of the blue for me and I did not take it very well -  I became very emotional and persistent on changing her mind. My behaviour upset her very much and I am also ashamed of myself for not being able to keep my composure. She is a very private and a fairly withdrawn individual. She said it was the first time someone close had been that emotional/persistent and that it was overwhelming.\n\nI apologised immediately after and we have been talking as friends, but she no longer responds as much. It's been a couple months and I've tried to accept everything that has happened and really want to be proper friends now. Although she was extremely comfortable with me in the past, she told me that she now has trouble/feels reluctant talking to me because she immediately associates me with memories of the breakup, which makes me feel even more guilty.\n\nI really want to know what I can do to try and remedy this. What would help her no longer connect me with bad feelings and feel more comfortable with me? I really value having this person in my life and so i dont want to just cut ties. I have fears that time and space might make us drift more and even consolidate the memory. What have people around you guys done to redeem themselves in your eyes after a negative incident? Or is there anything you wish someone would have done? Any advice/experience would be very much appreciated. Thank you.
8	You are her ex. She's trying to move on with her life. You keep on popping back in, going, "hey! pay attention to me!". The wounds that breakups cause can't heal because of this. You are now creating more negative feelings in her. \n\nRight now the kindest thing you could do for her is give her space. This means: NO CONTACT. Give her 6 months. Then you can contact her again to see if she's interested in seeing you. \n\nIn the meantime, you, my friend, need to move on with your life. Pick up some hobbies. Reconnect with other friends. Make new ones. Focus on taking care of yourself. Good luck!
4	Your fundamental mistake continues in your current actions - you're trying to influence her to do something you want, which is stay connected with you. This pressure to do what you want is not the way to interact with an ISTJ. It is actually the opposite.\n\nShe offered to be friends *before* you went off emotionally. The conditions (experience base) changed from your actions.\n\nMy suggestion:\n\nAsk her directly and with real open-ness/receptiveness to her actual answer and zero implicit or explicit attempts to influence what she says, if she still wants to be friends with you. Do not require an immediate answer. Give her time to think about it if she needs to. \n\n1. If she says no, respect it, let it go and move on. Period. Full stop.\n\n2. If she says yes, ask her how, specifically, she would like to proceed in communication with you. Then do what she asks for. \n\nComment source: I'm INFJ in a relationship with an ISTJ and I have an ex who is INFP.
2	Don't try, if you apologized that's it. It's a rare case where people who break up stay friends successfully and when they do no one actually forgets. You can try to be the minority here but just make sure you aren't deceiving yourself about your intentions (i.e. do you still have feelings for her?).
2	Time is the best healer especially for X amount  of ISTJ'S. They like a form of stability in their life, with an end to any type of relationship  can be hard on an ISTJ. They need to readjust what they consider stable once again after an ended relationship. It also may take time for the ISTJ to heal from losing someone whom they enjoyed having in their life. The best way IMO an ISTJ can heal from this is having time to refocus and time to rebuild confidence in talking to an "ex".  If you the "ex" initiates conversation it's an unexpected reminder of the last experience you both had (the breakup).  If the ISTJ initiates conversation, they've thought  about their decision to talk and have a reason and/or feel comfortable in reestablishing communication). \n        \nMy second last relationship ended horribly for me, completely  unexpected and that was the worst part of the breakup - it took me a year to move on.    \n      \nGive them space and time. 
2	How Do You Get People Do Follow Your Ideas?	I'm an ISTJ and I made this Facebook group about discussing music that intends to explore a multitude of genres. While you can pretty much post any song you want, memes related to music, news about music, anything related to music except self promotion. Oh and there's a MBTI/Socionics theme do it, but that's optional as well.\n\nThere's also a system that sets up a Song of the Day thing (based around a genre of the week) I pick work into, but it seem to not be getting as much attention as I hoped and I just want to know how to promote it in a way that people will actually respond to....\n\nI feel like I'm good at making systems, but terrible at getting people interested in said system, even if they're totally fun. I end up being pushy (in a Te manner,) which I think polarizes people, but if I shouldn't be pushy, what should I do if doing nothing isn't a good option either?\n\nI really want this club to succeed, but I feel like people just aren't giving it a fair chance and I don't know what to do.
3	You're asking a subreddit of 4000 people how to make your Facebook group a 1,000,000 member sensation?  It's pretty hard to hit it big on the internet unless you're filling some sort of big gap in demand.\n\nYour group sounds good enough for its purpose - but having a song of the day on a music discussion group doesn't really fill a deep need in the populace but is the kind of thing you'd kind of just expect to see in a music discussion group.  Not to insult your work - I'm just saying you're trying to enter an already saturated market.  There's lots of places you can talk about music all over the internet and tons of places to get songs of the day and music recommendations.  So you kind of have to hit it lucky to get a significant following for a Facebook group based on music - which I'm sure there are tons of.  \n\nSo don't get discouraged about you personally if your Facebook group doesn't get popular - the market dynamic for your chosen topic doesn't really lend anything to your favor.
3	Find an ENFP to hype it up for you? :D\n\nJokes aside, I hope you know that what you're doing now is okay. Your group stands at 194 members, which when you think about it is quite a lot of people! All of them couldn't fit in one room. The group itself doesn't seem dull at all, you've incorporated fun music oriented activities that I'm sure people have had fun participating in.\nI don't know how long you've been working at this project but you've been doing really well so far, even if other people can't see its value yet, I hope you do at least. >w<\n\nBuut, firstly, it is a tiiiny bit unrealistic to expect people to keep up with your group a lot. This isn't anything against you or what you're doing. It's just that people have busy lives and a lot of them may not be interested in music enough to keep up with your group. For example, if you find that people are not very hyped up about the Song of the Day, maybe the reason why that could be is because some of them are too lazy to click the link or maybe the thumbnail or the genre didn't catch their interest. You can't change that, no person of any MBTI type can, it has more to do with each group member's personal interests.\n\nSo basically, don't feel bad if some people don't engage with you. Most of the time it's really not your fault and there's not much you, or any other person in your shoes, could do about it.\n\nThe other comments already mentioned this but I'll still repeat it because it is honestly incredibly important: create/nurture a sense of community. As an ENFP I'd personally try to make it more of a homely chill environment, maybe you'd like to go for something else? :D\n\nAsk them questions, make posts related to music discussion, post memes and encourage the postage of memes (i'm sorry), make posts about what's currently going on in the music world and ask people about what their opinion on it is. For example, Chester Bennington. He was an amazing musician and I'm sure at least 80% of your group members have at least heard of him if not love him, so you could make a simple post asking everyone about what memories they have regarding the band. Or, make a silly post about Nicki Minaj! "Love today's pop music or hate it?" Encourage civil discussion, discourage jerks. Though, I will admit, your member count plays a key role here. If it has 100 members, realistically it is likely that 0-20 of them will comment. If it has 100,000 members, well, you do the math. Don't feel bad if no one joins the discussion at first, as your group grows and has more active members you'll see the comments/likes coming in.\n\nThere are sooo many things you could do, these are just examples. Another thing regarding building the community is the regulars you have in your group. Love them, remember them, cherish them. These are the people who will help keep the group active when you need some help. These are the people who will invite their friends over to this really fun awesome music group they're in. These are the people who will encourage you to keep going when the future of the group looks bleak. And, while I hope it will never happen, if the group ever goes down these are the people who will look back on it and say, 'Damn. I have a lot of memories of that group. I wish I could have it back.'\n\nI understand you're an introvert though so you might not be too interested in interacting with the regulars often, and want more of a professional relationship with them as an STJ. But, at least make sure you know their name and they know yours. You're not the big scary admin of the group, you're the passionate-about-music friendly dude that everyone knows. Try to interact with the regs personally every now and then. Even a, "Hey Daryl, good to see you commenting here again! Yeah, I agree with you." or "Woah Rose, where have you been? Nice song choice btw!" makes a hell of a difference with how the members know you and perceive you, even the ones you are not directly interacting with. (and i know, bad name choices, i tried XD)\n\nAnother thing I want to touch upon is the promotion of your group. You said you wanted 500 members. If you wait for other people to get new members through their friends and fam it is going to take a long, long time to reach that mark. Don't be that guy who lives and breathes his group of course, but it can't hurt to mention it in relevant places. For example, let's say you're posting a link to a music video by band A. Look for that music video on band A's facebook page and comment, 'Hey, great song! Shared it on my fb group called (whatever its name is)'. :) You're not being pushy, the band is being promoted and so is your group! Boom. \n\nIf your music group isn't on your fb profile already, keep a public link to it there. Comment on some popular music pages. While it is a tiny bit unlikely, someone might see that comment, check your profile, stalk the group and join. Even if it's one person it makes a difference.\n\nTiny thing worth mentioning. When talking about your group, I highly recommend you be confident even if you don't really feel you are. You are doing something cool, don't ever put it down, especially in front of other people. There is a big difference between, \n\nYou: Oh yeah, I have a group about music! We have almost 200 members now, we were just talking about band A the other day. It's a bit inactive right now but it's really cool, why don't you join it? :)\n\nPerson: Hey, that's cool! Sure.\n\nannnd\n\nYou: Yeah I have a music group. Bit inactive though, and we don't have that many members yet :/\n\nPerson: Oh... That sucks. Good luck though :/\n\nAlright, this reply is gigantic as it is and I thiiiink I touched upon everything I could think of? I don't know what you mean by pushy Te as my Te usually manifests in aggressively making really intricate to do lists for ideas I will never follow through with, so can't really understand nor help you there xD Hope this helped you though at least, and best of luck with your group man!\n\nedit: OOOHHH ALSO LOGOS, HAVE A GOOD SPECIAL LOGO AND COVER PHOTO. don't make it a picture of some band or anything, make it something special that people can see and remember. IT MAKES A DIFFERENCEEEEE I SWEAR... sorry xD
1	(This is what is coming to mind as ideas for thought, not as an attack!) \n\nWhere is the participation from the members? They're permitted to participate, but if they decide to go jam on 500 threads other than the ones you start, is that valued?\n\nWhat keeps the country and folk fans there? The rock fans? The R&B fans? The rap fans?\n\nWhat keeps the alphas (NTP/SFJ), betas (STP/NFJ), gammas (NTJ/SFP), and deltas (STJ/NFP) there?\n\nWhat is most important to the integrity of your group? What does the person who loves this group more than they love their mother love about it? The bandwidth of genres? The regular stimulation? The opportunity to explore new music? The exposure to genre defying, genre defining, genre intersecting, and genre expanding music? \n\nIn your darkest nightmares, where your name is carved in stone above the archway to an active and thriving group, but you are ashamed of it... what has it become that has you hiding, not showing your face in public, and crying yourself to sleep?\n\nI go places that are fun in the ways I find fun, or that have lots of room for me to get what I want out of them. A space that demanded excessive commitment, for instance, will never have me in it, or anyone who is looking for a more "whenever you like" engagement. Or a space that is dedicated to mostly things that are irrelevant to me will lose me quickly. "Genre I hate week. What about next-- oh I guess it's genres of underwhelm month." So for instance, if I don't take music Very Seriously, but that is required to enjoy the space, I'll mosey on out. Though if I do, I might hang around, but I'll also be in the minority of people, just by nature, since we all have different interests and intensities of interest. Can your group accommodate the casual as easily as the connoisseur? Do you want it to?\n\nNot knowing your answers to these questions, I think you could inject life by inviting them to share and contribute in a structured way -- for instance, "what is your favorite genre and an example of that genre?" "what is your type and your favorite song?" Allowing multiple submissions for those who can't decide. "What makes a song country versus folk? Do you prefer one over the other? Like both? Hate both? Have examples you want to share of the worst and best of each? Have fusions of the two you'd like to share?"\n\nCreate these alongside your presentation of content -- later, as people participate more and generate those threads themselves, you can focus more on content and people will appreciate the regularity and tending -- but that content has to invite participation in the page or they have no reason to engage it on a social media platform. You might also ensure that nobody has too long of a dry spell. If I'm picky and only like country, I'll love country week... And might stay if every other genre has a country x genre fusion in it! That would be curious and might expand my preferences, and it means I'm at least getting a regular chance to have my preferences touched on more heavily.\n\nAlso it might help to educate alongside presenting -- thread one, here are some country songs -- which do you like? What do they share? What makes them different? What is the essence of a country song? Are there any of these that seem more country than the others, or that you wouldn't call country? You post those questions, then each song is a comment, so they can interact more easily with the content... Then 3-4 days later you give a description of what music theorists say characterizes a country song and ask if they're surprised, etc. Or anything else -- but basically, I know I have no idea about genres so if that is a focus I'm going to be feeling kind of left behind and out of my element. Again, might not be a problem if you're targeting a specific crowd! At the same time, I might join the crowd or stay on if you help me catch up.\n\nNot all of this will probably apply but that is what came to mind! Basically, figure out what unpredictable content you're inviting them to provide, and make sure it's not just patronizing. Identify who you want to be interested, who you don't care about, and who you want to stay away (if the last group draws a blank, here's an example -- the person whose favorite genre is looping dancing animal or clumsy human gifs set to funny music...? ;)). Once there's a strong pulse, ask what they want more of, or what they want different.\n\nIf they feel like they're there for you, they'll leave -- if you create a successful community space I'd expect it to be focused and of great consistent interest, but with small membership, or less focused, with a thriving community, that often engages in conversation and interaction that bores you. But in the latter case, they can still appreciate your creation and stewardship of the space, with a rotating subset participating in your created content! Draw them in, but remember, you can't get them to do anything, you can only kind of... Do what you love and be clear about how far from that you're comfortable straying, and then... Well, love it more than you need others to love it while being grateful when others enjoy it with you! \n\nThe last part is not to say you're not being grateful -- just that is the complete mindset that I have the most success operating on. Like my long-arse Reddit comments aren't everyone's cup of tea but I hope the person I'm responding to wants the variety and coverage -- I know I do when I ask for help! And I enjoy writing them for some reason. Don't ask me why... Haven't had enough rest to confront my well-hidden [from me... from you? definitely from me] egoism ;)\n\nHope this helps!
4	ISTJs: How long does it take you to intiate a commitment to a new partner?	Female ENFP here seeing male ISTJ. I've been seeing him for about 6 weeks. We spend a great deal of time together(on dates or just hanging out), I've met his friends, and we have great sex. In the beginning we had a couple of"misfires" in communication, so to speak, due to our personality type differences. But since then, I bought and read a few books on introverts-I really like this guy- and our communication has been quite smooth. He's expressed he's looking for a serious relationship in the past...and I'm definitely ready to call him my boyfriend. \n\nThing is- I know ENFPs like myself are pretty intense and I don't want to move too fast for him and scare him off, as he contemplates all kinds of desicions for lengthy periods. I know no two individuals are the same, but I was hoping to get some insight from other ISTJs on the timeline of when they decide to commit to a new partner, as well as if I should intiate "the talk" or if I should give him some time to bring it up to me. At this current time, even though I know what I want, I'm comfortable giving him some space (a couple of more weeks, maybe?) to work out whatever he needs to in his head, if that'd be beneficial, but I don't know if I'm just over-thinking it. \n\nThanks for any and all insight in advance!\n\nTldr; ISTJs how long do you wait to intiate a committed relationship with a new partner? Is it you that typically begins that conversation, or is it at the request of your new partner?
15	There's a fair chance he's already committed to you, whether he's said so or not (whether he's even realized it or not).\n\nAs far as "the talk," I wouldn't necessarily wait for him to initiate it, but you might ask some probing questions to gauge whether he's ready for it or not.  Just don't ask me what questions to ask.\n\nWhen you do have "the talk," don't beat around the bush.  Just put it out there as direct as you can.  If it seems way too blunt, you're probably right on target.\n\nAnd remember, we have feelings that we feel just as hard as anyone else, but we're not always (often? ever?) quick to notice that we're feeling them, or what they are, and it often takes us a while to process them.  If he seems to "shut down," that's probably him processing.  If that happens, let him know you're there when he's ready, no rush, no pressure.  He'll catch up.
3	I'd say we're also very intense. I'm usually committed very quickly. I overanalyze new relationships to the point that I know if it's going to work out very quickly.\n\n But if the sex is good, I might be willing to stick around as long as I can if there's no one more interesting around. \n\nSo in your case I think it's best to just bluntly express your feelings and ask if he's on the same page. He will not hold it against you and you will know for sure.
4	Hi there! I've been dating an xSFJ (can't make up his mind whether he's more introverted or extroverted) for almost two years now. He definitely made the first move and I was the one to say "Yes, I agree with that." I'm pretty blunt and straightforward, but when it comes to personal relationships and emotional things, I tend to wait for the other person to bring it up first.\n\nStill, it looks like things are going pretty well with you two. Good luck!
3	I was single for years, and settled into a committed relationship at 29. I dated very casually, and I finally settled down when I realized my now GF wasn't interested in playing games, only wanting my attention or wasting my time with nonsense like jealousy or unnecessary baggage. I like quality and things that last and she provided that emotionally for me. I was very cut and run in my love life and she got past that.\n\nGlad you're happy with this man, I wish you the best! \n\nEdit: spelling
3	>ISTJs how long do you wait to initiate a committed relationship with a new partner? Is it you that typically begins that conversation, or is it at the request of your new partner?\n\n\nMy ISTJ and I had been dating for a couple months, but I wasn't sure how committed he was until I directly "confronted" him about it. In his mind, I think he had been committed or was intending to be or was expecting ME to initiate the process the whole time! Meanwhile, I couldn't tell from the mixed signals he gave off, so I thought he was being a player. 
6	Weekly Thread: What is the last gift you received or bought for someone?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what's the last gift you received or gave to someone for any occasion? \n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
4	Given: An engraved memory box to my SO so we can put stuff in from our adventures together. I filled it with things I kept without her knowing from our dates, days out and holidays. \n\nReceived: All the pretty horses, an American novel from my friend. We had been talking about how I longed for a more simple life, as simple as mine already but one where society is more laid back. He said that book would be appreciated. 
3	Last gift I received was a Book Wyrm tee-shirt.\n\nLast gift I've given was shower gels from Bath and Body Works.
3	Received: Magazines for a S&W M&P\n\nGiven: Bianchi holster for Glock 17 and CRKT pocket knife.
3	Last gift I received: An Elgato HD60 capture card from my GF and her brother\n\nLast gift I gave: A Xiaomi Mi Box to my cousin 
2	Last gift I received was a beautiful Eevee Pokemon canvas from my boyfriend. \n\nLast gift given was a game of thrones book to one of my nephews.
2	Last gift I gave was an espeon tsum tsum.\n\nLast gift I received was a pair of Sony headphones (to replace my broken Audiotechnica ones).
2	INFJ crushing on an ISTJ.	
10	ISTJ (F) here. You need to make it blatantly obvious. I think we tend to fear rejection so it would be hard to make the first move unless we know for sure the other likes us back. Also find an activity that he's into and suggest doing that thing together! Hope this helps! 
7	>I want to in a not overt or awkward fashion let him know I am interested in him \n\nI'm an INFJ in a relationship with an ISTJ and like /u/M9067J and /u/biochembabe10 say, you will need to be completely clear and direct in communicating to him. \n\nAs literal and clear and direct as possible. No deliberately implied implicit meanings, none of that. This really really works with ISTJs. Anything else is just likely to foster confusion and miscommunication.\n\n>though once I start liking someone I become more reserved and quiet. How can I let him know I am romantically interested, or hint to him that he should ask me out on a date without making him uncomfortable? I fear getting rejected, so while I know being overt would be the best way to let him know, it's just not something I can see myself doing.\n\n1. Funny how we INFJs get more reserved and quiet and seemingly cool when we actually are interested. It seems to be a very real behavioral thing across different INFJs.\n\n2. You're going to have to get over your fear of rejection with this situation. Trying to get him to ask you out is not the way to go with an ISTJ. If you're interested, you will have to tell him in no uncertain terms. Preferably with a concrete suggestion for the next step.\n\nYou will also need to be utterly open to giving him time ot process your communication. Lack of an immediate answer doesn't mean anything one way or another if he needs to process some before responding with this perspective. I'd say when you communicate, build in a comment about if he needs some time to think about it and get back to you, that is fine. If that's what he wants, it's totally fine to ask him when he'd like to reconnect and let you know and set that up logistically or just agree on specifically when. This will help your stress and also make it so he doesn't get lost in Ne-inf anxieties for an indeterminate amount of time. \n\n>P.S. If anyone has any INFJ-ISTJ relationship stories (or horrors) they want to share, I'd like to hear them.\n\nMy 1.5 year relationship with my ISTJ sweetie is the most healthy and enjoyable relationship I've ever had (and I've been around the block a time or two or three or ...).  I do have stories but not a lot of time right now.\n\nIf you have any specific questions, let me know and I can try to answer them. Otherwise I'll share one now that may be relevant to your situation, then try to come back when i have more time.\n\nFor now:\n\nWhen my gf and I discussed the possibility of moving in together, we came to a tentative agreement that it was the best path to take. But she asked for time to let it percolate to see if anything came up for her. She asked for a month. There were external factors that made that too stressful for me, so I asked if she would be able to cut that down at all. She said two weeks would work. I said that was absolutely fine. We set a day/time for a follow-up discussion.\n\nWe continued life and hanging out as usual during this time. I did not bring the topic up at all, utterly and completely gave her space at every possible level. A week in, she mentioned (as part of another discussion, not as a topic for us to focus on) that she was having some anxiety as she was processing the moving-in possibility, which upset me some because I hated having anything to do with us cause her anxiety. I asked if there was anything I could do to help/support her in this and she said no, this was her thing to deal with. I continued to give her utter and complete space to do whatever she needed doing. I had my own anxieties related to the external logistical factors I needed to start working on related to the larger situation on my end. But I worked on that myself.\n\nAnd I had to be completely open to whatever outcome she brought back to me. Which I was, organically, because I would not want to move in with someone who didn't completely desire it.\n\nA couple of days before our scheduled talk, she mentioned in an email that she was feeling much more settled and less anxious about the moving in together possibility and that she had moved from "what might go wrong" anxiety into "okay, how will this actually work" territory. When we had our talk, she had gotten to the point of extremely solid and clear desire for us to do this. \n\nI know I can count on her. Whatever she tells me is solid. \n\n-------\n\nI have noticed that I tend to sense where our trajectory is headed before she does. I need processing time and space myself, and there are times when I kind of retreat into that (she is great about it when i do, I just communicate directly that that's what's happening). \n\nIt's crucial to me and for us that she has the real, uncluttered time and space she needs to gather the experiences and process in her particular way. I have learned never to read into anything in that process. Whatever she says or does is utterly and completely the direct and literal truth as she understands it. She doesn't foreshadow implicitly or anything like that. She just tells me the solid truth as it exists in her perception at any given point. It's wonderful, actually. But not what I had experienced in the past with SOs.\n\n(oh, and since you specified genders in your post, FWIW or not, both me and my ISTJ are women)\n\n
1	Yeah, we don't really do the whole initiating thing. So, good luck with that.
3	Do any of you istjs suffer from ptsd or tbi? What things helped you?	
4	I have ptsd and anxiety (and right now depression but it will pass). Anyway for me knowing my triggers helps me coop with the ptsd and removing myself from the situation. I had a trigger go off at work and I had to disclose I had ptsd to my co-worker and had to take a walk. I was fine after my walk. I walk a lot. I'm also in therapy, sometimes I need it sometimes I don't. Zoloft helped me for a time but I prefer to be unmedicated when I can.\n\nIf you have anxiety try a compression garment. Or weighted blanket. I have worn a compression garment under my clothes before when the anxiety is too much. Weighted blanket is more for when you are at home. I also like the vibration of a fidget spinner. It calms me. Music also helps. 
2	I have a friend who has PTSD and TBI.  I don't know if he's an ISTJ, but I know he has gotten better in the time I've known him.  He talks to a therapist regularly and goes to a support group regularly\n\nHe's also on a cocktail of meds, mostly to help him get to sleep, stay asleep, and suppress night terrors.\n\nHe has said that having someone to talk to helps a lot, especially if it's someone who has been through the same stuff.  I know it's against type for us, but there's no shame in asking for help and finding someone to talk to.
2	I don't know about TBI, but there is a lot of support for exposure-based therapies for PTSD. You'd be looking for Prolonged Exposure, or Cognitive Processing Therapy in particular. EMDR could also work -- last I heard, the strategy they use of eye-toggling while engaging in exposure therapy doesn't add that much to the treatment, but it still uses principles of exposure and the eye-toggling isn't going to hurt.\n\nNote, exposure therapy does involve approaching anxiety-provoking memories and triggers. That said, the therapist will work with you on pacing, and there can be other work done in advance to help boost distress tolerance and prepare yourself for the work.\n\nI don't have personal experience with having PTSD, but I have studied psychology and have recent colleagues who work with trauma. Best of luck!
2	I suffer from anxiety, depression and PTSD. What has helped me TREMENDOUSLY is therapy every 2 weeks. I cut off my very toxic family and a lot of needless acquaintances, and in identifying my core values, I now make decisions I'm very happy with and I only associate with people who are happy and healthy and interested in being better than they were yesterday. People who are passionate about their interests or goals. It feel like I'm ripping weeds out of my garden and planting new seeds. It's a beautiful process. 
1	I have PTSD and I haven't tried this, but EMDR is supposed to work wonders on it. 
1	I suspect I might have C-PTSD. In contrast to PTSD the flashbacks in people with C-PTSD are more emotional in nature and not tied with specific memories.
11	Successful ISTJ's?	I have a bunch of extroverts in my family who love being in the spotlight and always act like they know more than I do. They believe they're destined for greatness and think my introversion is a flaw. Could use some stories about successful ISTJ's for a quick pick-me-up!
10	Success is relative.  I dive deep into the things I like and stick with them.  For me, I liked computers as a kid and that hasn't changed in 15+ years.  I stuck with the first major I picked (computer science), took the first job offer I got (that wasn't a complete joke), and have stuck with that first company ever since.  I'm happily engaged, I make more money than I need, I own a home, and I feel I have time to do whatever else I want.  Yeah, I feel successful.  \n\nI've seen more extraverted people hop around through their hobbies/interests/careers and sometimes they 'strike gold'.  I'm happy to work hard and grind my way to the top (or wherever I want to end up).

4	I'm a university professor with a PhD. I think that counts.
3	I'll say like /u/j-mar. Success is relative.\n\nI've been wondering for a while what the hell I'm doing.\n\nBut at some point you get older and you get a better sense of your Fi and you get to know better what you want and what makes you feel good.\n\nI admit I'm not aiming for the biggest goals. I do pretty good at a job I like. I'm financially stable. Although I'm far away from my son, he knows he can call me when something's wrong. I have a girlfriend with a reciprocated love. We're best friends and we do and share a bunch of things together. I also have few introvert hobbies I enjoy doing when I'm alone. I'm slowly getting rid of my anxiety with mindfulness. Every now and then I hang out with friends until my "social quota" is met.\n\nIn my book it's called success.
3	Introversion can be a great tactic for those who understand. I'm an ISTJ myself but I've managed to make great relationships with teachers and even score some internships and research positions in my first year of high school by being upfront with my professor. They understand I'm an introvert and in some ways it can be a plus when I push myself, because they think better about me for my hard work. It's a bit more of a struggle for me even now to go to their office hours, but being you without pretending will often yield more success than even an extrovert. Plus, ISTJs are great at working hard. If anything, this is your speciality and I'm sure you can surpass your family even at something that comes easy to them 👍
1	I'm a Support Manager at Walmart and i've been with the company for 10 years if you want to count that. It's also been the only place i've worked.
3	How to know if I am an ISTJ or nah	Quite unsure at the moment. I am quite certain I an an ISTJ, INTP or INFP (this one is the least likely), but I don't know which one. What are some strong, common traits among ISTJs, that make you certain you are one?
6	[I recommend checking this site out](http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com)\n\nFor years I tested as an intj but it wasn't until I actually did research and a lot of reflection that I came to the conclusion that I was mistyping myself for years. There are a lot of INTJ traits that I identify with like the need for autonomy and the infamous death glare. So I would avoid focusing on traits, and more on your thought process. Focus less on what you are doing, and focus more on why you are doing it. 
2	For the differences between N and S the question I would ask myself is how well do I deal with abstract ideas and how well do I work with my hands and senses?\n\nIf you would prefer to woodwork or work on something mechanical or physical, then you're probably more an Sensing person. If you prefer political sciences and like working with ideas and concepts, you're probably more an iNtuitive person.
3	ISTJ and Sports.	tl;dr Ok. So how are ISTJ's with sports?\n\nI have a brother who I type as either an ESTP or ESFP who seems to naturally excel at sports. I on the other hand although showing some level of talent do require alot more work and consistency to equal my brother's level.\n\nIf anyone has watched the film Gattaca I'm pretty much like the main character played by Ethan Hawke and my brother is like the main character's brother.
4	Anecdotally speaking, I don't know if there's a connection between personality type and athletic ability. To begin with, both terms are so nebulous, I imagine one could prove or disprove a connection.\n\nPersonally, I'm an ISTJ and fairly athletic. Never had issues picking things up, but it'd take a ton of practice to get to a level where I'd feel comfortable saying I'm "excelling".\n\nHope that is helpful.
3	I'm an ISTJ and I played 3 sports a year when I was in high school.  Tennis, wrestling, and Swimming. 
2	I misunderstood the title and thought you were asking about an ISTJ's opinions regarding *watching* various sports, instead of participating in them.\n\nI tested out as an ISTJ and I dislike even watching most professional sports because:  betting --> money  --> power  --> corruption/rigging the sport to make more $$$ = unfair playing environment for the player (this is why I now view the NFL as "sports **entertainment**").\n\nThe only 'sport' I've found pleasing  enough to make a hobby is one that has rules and regulations to ensure fair playing environment and, consequently, is so boring (and politically deplorable) that it's almost never on TV.  No betting; national rules organization promotes fair play; and there's usually very stiff penalties for corruption/cheating.  Once the technology curve is crested, it's all about the skill.  I think that's fair.
2	Depends on the sport.  And the ISTJ.\n\nWhen I was in school, I played basketball, which I'm not really built for, and football, which I am built for.\n\nThe basketball coach recognized my "strengths."  When one of our better players was close to fouling out and we needed to strategically foul someone, coach would tell me to go in for them and "foul that guy."\n\n"Foul him, coach?"\n\n"Yep."\n\n"Like, on purpose?"\n\n"Yep."\n\n"Isn't that against the rules?"\n\n"Only if you draw blood.  Now go foul the shit out of him."\n\n"Gotcha!"\n\nOnly ever got ejected from a game once, and it was, conveniently, my 5th foul of the game and my 2nd Technical foul of the game, either of which will get you ejected.\n\nFootball was a different story.  I went to a tiny school where you had to play not just both sides of the ball, but *all* sides of it.  Offense, defense, special teams, different positions on first and second string, the whole nine.  I was the smallest guy on our line, too.  I'm not now, nor have I ever been built for running, but standing up, smashing into someone, and just generally being in their way?  I excel at that shit.  So there I am, all of 5'3", playing true ironman football (ironboy football?) and I loved it.  But I loved academic pursuits more, so I gave up football during high school.\n\nI was also on our school's track team, but that was a bit of a joke and only happened because the school was so small, had I not participated, we wouldn't have been able to field a full track team.
2	:) This is something my ISTJ would enjoy talking to you about. He would pretty much say the same thing -- in high school he was a total jock, lacrosse, hockey, soccer were the sports he played competitively. Later he also played paintball (lead his team) and ref'd it as well. He admitted he was never the kind of athlete who could do the fancy footwork and maneuvers; he was the kind who was fast, focused, used his sheer strength, worked the hardest, showed up for practice, and was consistently reliable. He wasn't the star, but he always delivered. He really misses the camaraderie, carefree youth, and simple purpose of those days, plus he often reminisces about how he was in the best shape of his life back then (he's almost 40 now). 
2	I generically have quick reflexes however with physical activity it's like everything else keeps going and I slow down ?? \n  \nMe and sports = no, especially competitive sports.\n  \nI was always the kid who got hit in face, yay dodgeball -_- \n   \nHowever I'm  okay at more causal fitness activities like running or workout exercises. I enjoy activities like tramping/hiking and calmer exercises like Pilates. \n   \nSport/activity hasn't been a priority in my life. Though I try to maintain some form of routine to stay "healthy". \n\n
1	I am good at bowling
5	How Would You Best Explain And Describe Your Type (ISTJ) To A Person Who Knows Nothing About Myers-Briggs?	No need to be technical.  I just want to know how you perceive yourselves and others specific to this type.  What do you notice that resonates with the ISTJ personality type? Instead of “traits or characteristics” that are so often used within the Myers-Briggs terminology, I would like to hear examples, stories, and/or perspectives you can offer.  I plan on posting this question in each Myers-Briggs specific subreddit to help foster understanding and create insight through first person experiences and perceptions. 
19	"Google 'ISTJ' and you'll find out pretty much the type of person I am."
17	> What do you notice that resonates with the ISTJ personality type? \n\nWhen I start something, I prefer to be left alone until it is finished.  Interrupting me will lead to substandard results if the task even gets completed at all.\n\nAlso, I hate idle chit-chat.  If you want to have a conversation with purpose, fine.  If it's a conversation I want to have with a person I want to have it with, I'll relish it.  If it's a conversation that I *need* to have, I may not relish it, but I will participate.  If you want to ramble on about weather and kittens and what you ate for breakfast and what color you might dye your hair and this TV show that I just *have* to watch and puppies, you can #*%) off.  Actually, no, I'll talk to you about puppies, because puppies are awesome.  The rest of it?  Take it somewhere else.
11	I've taken the test numerous times now and each time i've come up with the ISTJ personality. \n\nBasically, I describe my personality as someone who doesn't like small talk for the sake of small talk. Honestly, i'm *probably* not gonna strike up a conversation with you unless I find a common interest. Given that, I have a hard time making friends. I'm not sure if other ISTJ's are the same way, but that's way I am.\n\nAlso, when i'm given a task, or i'm invested in doing something, I like to see to it that it gets done in a timely manner. I also like to work alone, but when I have to work with others, i'm often the one people like to work with. 
7	I do what needs doing before you even realize it's been done.
3	People that aren't familiar with mbti should just take the time to properly read and study the theory because if you try to get shortcuts, we end up with a community that is full of stereotypes and misleading information.  While I do stand on this point, I think reading this description can help to have a good idea of this type. Found here: http://worldsocionics.blogspot.ca/2015/09/sli-sensory-logical-integrator.html
1	I wouldn't explain my personality type to a person that knows nothing about Myers-Briggs, because it wouldn't come up in a conversation.  I'm certainly not going to bring it up.
1	I can be social and interact with people and large groups just fine, but it can tire me out. Is need to recharge by being alone, we generate our energy from within vs Es that generate energy from being around other people. Oh, and rules matter, I will always follow the rules. 
5	Si and sex	\nSe-users are often described as indulgent and hungry for new experiences but what about Si-users?\n\nWith tertiary Si I can't fully make sense of it but I noticed that I almost never like something (food, music) the first time I try it. Only after processing the new sensations in my mind can I decide that I like it and only after longing for something for a while can I fully enjoy it. I'm careful about new experiences and mostly stay loyal to my favorites. Unlike Se-users I'm quite picky and pay a lot of attention if something feels right or if I should stop because my body isn't really calling for it. But these are only some vague ideas about what could be Si.\n\nWhat do you think is the Si approach to sex and sensual experiences in general?
3	There was a thread on /r/mbti about Si vs Se on sex 
7	Weekly Thread: If you were asked to submit a dish to a food competition, what would you submit, if you were allowed to ask any friend/family member/SO to make it on your behalf?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: There's a food competition, and you're asked to submit a dish made by a friend/family member/SO/yourself. What do you submit, and who was it made by?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
6	I would make franks buffalo wings with blue cheese dressing... Yum!\n\nIf i asked my mum to make something it would be her sweet soy chook wings with rice. Double yum!
3	As a young adult my grandmother flirted the cheesecake recipe out of a French chef at her favourite restaurant. I prefer whipping up desserts to making proper meals so that's what I'd go with. \n\nMy mum makes the best chicken cacciatore which we serve over rice instead of pasta. I always ask her to make it when I visit so it's what I'd ask her to make for the competition. I don't know if it counts as fancy enough for that sort of thing but I'll be too busy eating it to care about winning! 
2	If I have to cook it, it's going to be an omelet or a hamburger (or, if allowed, jerky, cause I make some damn decent beef jerky).\n\nIf I can have someone else cook it, I'll get ahold of some deer meat and have my mom make some no-holds-barred chili.
0	Hatred for Ambiverts	What is your opinion of so-called "ambiverts"? (aka people who are both introverted AND extroverted)\n\nI call bullshit.\n\nI propose "ambiverts" are just extroverts with poor social skills. For instance, an "ambivert" goes to a large New Years Eve party, feels awkward they don't know anyone there, and come home feeling sad and drained. They convince themselves this is "introversion" because their perfect party would have been small and full of lots of attention from close friends.\n\nMeanwhile, us introverts are exhausted by people. Even our favorite people. We want to cancel every hour leading up to the party and firmly believe home alone with internet/Netflix beats any party.\n\n(Also, we probably made an excuse and cancelled last minute. If we did show up, it's because we cancelled the last 8 times before that.)\n\nWhile socializing is an incredibly difficult skill to master for 99% of the population (damn that 1%), I still believe ambiverts (aka extroverts) can gain more enjoyment out of social events with enough practice at being charming.\n\nMeanwhile, introverts are not going to enjoy extended conversations with other people, even if it's a party where we are the guest of honor and universally thought to be charming and wonderful.
7	Sometimes Fe introverts are described as ambiverts because while we are tired for people and deeply crave alone time, we are relatively good at communicating and people skills. Most IXFJs act as counselors to their close friends and act extroverted for a short while, mainly because we know what people want to hear. \n\nLikewise, Ne-dom extroverts such as ENXPs are described as introverted extroverts since their extroversion is tied to ideas. They could easily be left alone if they have internet access. \n\nAnyways, I usually go to such events if one of my friends really really wants to go because I feel guilty or because I know the host and have to go for a short while. I usually have an escape planned with another introvert though and have it figured out how to minimize my time. It's all just masquerading. 
6	I don't think your understanding of extroversion/introversion is correct if you adhere to the Mbti. In fact, extroversion isn't even related to any sort of social activity or specific behavior, neither is introversion, its all about cognitive processing. The best way to differ from the two is that one is focused inward and the other outward, both in order to judge or perceive the world.\n\nIf you're talking about the normal understanding of extroversion, I personally believe that ambivert shouldn't be a thing, its just people that are balanced individual and don't fit nearly as well in that poor system which would be understandable in that case.
1	Hm, I guess it depends on the introversion/extroversion we're talking about. When it comes to introversion and extroversion, people are mostly going to be in the middle -- that is, there are few extreme introverts and few extreme extroverts. \n\nMost are ambiverts, who get energy from interacting with some specific people, or in specific ways, and by being alone doing preferred activities -- and who are drained by interacting with other people, in other ways, or being alone doing nonpreferred activities. More extreme introverts would be those who get energy by a much wider range of activities they do alone, who get energy from very few types of social interactions, if any, and who are drained by few lone activities, but who are drained from a wide range of social activities. Flipped with extroverts, who are drained by most activities where they are alone, and who get energy from most forms of social interaction, no matter what it involves. Thinking of a normal curve, most of us are going to be in the middle.\n\nThat said, I think you're right on the mark that people misunderstand introversion when they think it is the same thing as being socially anxious or socially awkward. I think that they can go together (if I am drained by socializing, I may also end up getting less experience with socializing, and thus be less skilled at it from the perspective of average social folk). However, they are clearly not the same thing, and people who try to "save" introverted friends can miss the mark in a way that can annoy some of us more extreme introverts.\n\nIn Jungian terms, I don't think of introversion and extroversion as being social -- for instance an ESTJ may be extremely extroverted in a Jungian sense, which is just to say they order and impose logical judgments on the world around them, and that is where their attention lies. They may avoid people like the plague because of the impact on their ability to follow projects and activities they are interested in. Likewise, you could have a very extroverted INFP, whose attention naturally lies most with their internal judgment of ethics and feelings -- but who still very much enjoys interacting with other people.
1	I see the perspective that few people want to be attached to the negative perception of introverts. They enjoy going out and doing things with people, though are ultimately drained by the experience. This is where I think the term ambivert comes, you're not introverted, just tired. You can be social for a bit, but do need some alone time.\n\nThe way I see it, ambiverts are introverts that just won't admit it. Either that, or they have poor social skills or are just awkward.
1	I don't agree with your statements.\n\nFirst of all, there are many differences between introverts themselves. I know that I am introverted, but I still enjoy socialising with friends and meeting new people from time to time and have great conversations.  A lot of people on this forum are exactly like me, but still need some time alone after long periods of socialising. You can't just assume that every introvert is the same.\n\nAlso, you seem to have some kind of false assumption about ambiverts, they are very different then you describe and poor social skills don't always relate to personality type.
16	Ever feel "off" sometimes?	Every 6/7 months I'll have a day hit me out of nowhere and I'll just feel off. I can't quite place what is off or what I'm missing but it always feels almost exactly the same way. Sometimes it's accompanied by a feeling of not being good enough or flickers of what I can only describe as mild depression. It sticks around for a day, maybe day and a half, and then it disappears as if it was never there.\n\nI'm wondering if any of you get this? I'm having one of these days and it's really annoying because I don't know how to fix it. Yeah the feelings aren't fun but being trapped by my own emotions just sucks.
7	I get this several  times a year. I think it's just my emotions  building up and saying "hey remember me?" \n\nI feel anxiety, as described  mild depression or simply really emotional. Sometimes I feel like I'm out of reality  and things don't make sense.\n\n I don't repress negative  feelings, I let most things go and think realistically. But those off days get the best of me. In the past I had diagnosed depression - I'm fine now. \n\nI mean could  it be an existential  crisis of some sort ? \n
5	Yes, I get these often actually (maybe a couple times a month). It throws me off for the rest of the day or a few days and I can never quite place exactly what feels "off", but I can tell something is different and I have had people mention to me that I seem different. Sometimes it comes out as a need to be alone, sometimes I feel a little "on edge" and hyper aware of people's tones and body language. I never have been able to figure it out. I found that just giving my body and mind time to recharge, as well as some deep breathing, has helped to relieve the feeling. 
2	I'll get this fairly frequently (relative to OP); sometimes once or twice per month. I've found that, with regular exercise, I'm able to keep it under control. As far as I understand, the endorphins keep my "demons" away. It's a vicious cycle if I don't handle it as soon as I notice it. Once it gets its grip on me, it becomes exceptionally difficult for me to motivate myself back into the gym to take care of it. If I go for more than a week without exercise, that's usually when it'll hit me like clockwork.\n\nI completely understand the annoyance factor; you legitimately feel like you're not in control of your own mind and it's very frustrating.
1	My 2 cents: I've been practicing mindfulness/mindful meditation for the past couple years, and a "solution" to these feelings is to simply feel them for as long as they reside. We shouldn't attempt to fight/outthink these feelings, which from my experience never worked anyway.\n\nThis process of allowing these feelings to reside until they pass has really helped me, and I no longer see this "off" feeling as a problem, just something that happens. And previous attempts to think out or fight these feelings often resulted in unnecessary agitation
1	Yes, just had this 3 weeks ago. These days I can just feel that if something goes different as usual, everything will just crash, so I proceed very carefully these days (also get this every 5-6 months or so.) \n\nHad this about 3 weeks ago actually. Started in the morning when my toilet clogged, proceeded to fuck up a task at work that I do everyday without really thinking which caught me off guard. By the end of the day, I was so confused as to what was happening, that I just went in and out of the grocery store without even acknowledging anyone. I was terrified and couldn't wait for the day to be over so I could get myself together and evaluate just what the fuck happened haha.
1	I usually have 1-3 days each semester of school where I feel mentally sick, kind of like my brain isn't moving nearly as fast as I'm used to. I can't take tests, focus for more than a few minutes, or even hold up a proper conversation. It has happened less ever since I started walking every day and sleeping a regularly as I can, but I still have a day that just smacks me down every once in a while.
1	So I took a DISC assessment, and it put me as a CD. MB I'm an ISTJ, these things are closely related, right?	Just asking.  I'm not really surprised I'm ISTJ, I've always been introverted.
1	Oh, and it shows me as an A as well.
1	I got D, S, and C with more C and D than S.\n
1	I just recently did DISC and got the same result (with a spike into S). 
1	I got C/DS.
1	I got CD as well I think, yes they are related, I think theres a list where it states the correlation.
4	Do you think this fictional character might be an ISTJ?	The character's name is Louis. I have submitted posts on other subreddits requesting thoughts on Louis's possible type. The most common suggestion was INTP, but I get a gut feeling that Louis is of the Delta quadra (ESTJ, ISTJ, ENFP, INFP).  I thought I'd post here on the ISTJ subreddit to see if you ISTJs can relate to this character. Which MBTI type is most likely to start a conversation or flirt in this fashion? If not ISTJ, then which one do you think? Please provide how you came to your conclusion. Here are the four pages in respective order: http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e237/marllon89/Untitled5_zpsscomwc7j.png http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e237/marllon89/Untitled6_zpsj0dszhej.png http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e237/marllon89/Untitled7_zpspt8orzkz.png http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e237/marllon89/Untitled8_zpsxo2kv6qj.png
1	Some of his observations could suggest Si+Te. He thinks about the logical and ordering actions he takes in the real world (making me think Te), such as how he makes sure to park on the downslope. That choice isn't necessarily indicative, so much as how it is emphasized -- as if it is characteristic that he specifically is noting this to himself. \n\nThen he also makes these observations about the typical forms of his environment without attention to their logic -- if you see this, usually it is paired with that. And his dry lack of emotional expression -- while at the same time I could totally see myself saying something like, "you gotta imagine how bored they get..." Si is comforted by familiarity but the same thing over and over can be boring -- familiar doesn't have to mean identical. \n\nThe focus on logic over emotions/ethics -- to such an exaggerated degree, even in relating to another person -- makes STJ fit better than NFP to me, and the lack of real action/outcome driven stuff, makes ISTJ seem to fit better than ESTJ.\n\nYou posted here about this character with different color highlighting in different sections, too, right? If this is the same thing, then I remember thinking he was ISTJ then as well!\n\nThe one thing that seems wrong about this is that at least for me, I'd need a little more evidence of interest before going on like he did... Or at least I think I would! I could see where someone else might disagree and feel like those monologues come out of nowhere. :) It wouldn't surprise me if an ISTJ who was into films was experienced as being like the director's commentary either. And talking with someone who is interested in my input and expertise is really rewarding!\n\nI don't think every ISTJ would be like them (they seem like an ISTJ enneagram 5 more than an ISTJ 1 for instance, given smoking in a public place, or an ISTJ 6, given a generally nonanxious demeanor). But I think they'd fit in with ISTJs.
9	What music do you fellow ISTJ's listen to ?	I personally have a pretty mixed music collection on my phone right now. From Classic (Chopin, Tschaikowsky etc.) to ZZTop, Cruel Youth and Miley Cirus (the old normal Miley) everything is there. Favourite Band is Green Day.\n\nAlso my Guilty Pleasure is Eurobeat, yes, even i cant believe i unironically listen to that.
7	Mostly Extreme Metal.
3	Trop-Rock, Folk/Americana, Alternative/Hardcore
3	Classical & Jazz, Classic Rock, some Indie, some Electronic, Electro-Swing
3	I agree with the classical. It ranges from  soft rock, soft pop, alternative  (rock), instrumental and classical. \n\nI like relaxed styles of music for the most part. 
3	Metal, Math rock, and Chillstep mostly. I enjoy more melodic/instrumental.\n\nSome Artists include: The Earth is a Man, Delta Sleep, TTNG, Gojira, Dark Tranquility, Skeletonwitch, Chon, Mastodon, Baroness, Kvelertak, and Scale the Summit.
3	Mostly punk. 
4	EDM!
4	mostly Christian rock, lots of classic rock, some folk\n\nEasy upvote for OP's mention of ZZTop!
2	Too many artists to list but mostly black and death metal like Blood of Kingu, Hate Forest, Diocletian, Adversarial, and some more atmospheric stuff like Grimoire, Mare Cognitum, Spectral Lore, Oranssi Pazuzu, etc
2	Baroque-era classical, folk/singer-songwriter, pop-punk (never really grew out of the 2000s emo thing), and classic rock.\n\nI also enjoy: synth rock, symphonic metal, chillwave.
2	[Trip Hop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiK2JlBpzvI&list=PL-sQwttqzmN1YVqnGb9ChiRTffGyyJcA1) or [Down Tempo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9Wa9A-P4OQ). Sometimes a bit of [folk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ6N62r9rp0).  
2	Modern indie folk and 90's alternative
2	I really like Radiohead, Brand New, Alexisonfire, stuff like that. Recently went on a voyage through punk, currently exploring an indie/punk/surf rock kind of style. Stuff like Car Seat Headrest, Parquet Courts, Ty Segall. 
2	Born in the 80s\n\nI'm loving me some Synthpop / Synthwave !\n\nhttps://kiezbeats.bandcamp.com/album/synthwave-vol-2\n\nSome good ones in there. \n\nEsp last one
2	Lo fi or alt (2000-2010) rock someimes even videogame music (like Pokemon) 
1	I listen to all kind of Jazz music nearly 24/7. I also like funk and some fusion music, one of my favorite bands being Steely Dan.
1	I listen to any type of music honestly (except for stuff like "Harsh Noise"). I like mainly indie and alternative though. 
1	Progressive house and trap are my favorite. Rap is also appreciated here and there, by rap I mean post Malone and the likes. The rest can suck it. As far as progressive house goes Zeni, Alex H and Mossy are my favorites.
1	indie, garage, alternative and sometimes punk
7	Weekly Thread: What's your favourite memory of high school?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: high school can be a pretty tough time, but do you have a favourite memory of your time there? \n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
9	Leaving. \n\nOn a more serious note, I enjoyed eating lunch outside with my few friends every day. Lunch was the highlight of my day. We ate (or at least I did) every day, whether it was hot, windy, raining, or cold (we ate outside when it was 7º F one day).
4	My favorite memory during high school was during my Senior year. I was a cadet of the high schools JROTC program for four years ending my high school career as the Battalion Executive Officer (2nd in command of a battalion consisting of almost 200 students/cadets) and also the captain of the Air Rifle team. But my favourite memory of that year is going to the National Air Rifle Championships as a solo competitor instead of like the previous 2 years where I went as a part of the team. Although, I only got 9th place out of at least 300 competitors it's still my favorite memory. 
3	I was the student director of "The Diary of Anne Frank" production we performed at Lincoln, NE after chosen to represent my state at our International Thespian Festival my senior year. We didn't asked to be adjudicated for the chance of that honor. 
3	A trip we made to Italy with the class. My girlfriend and my best friend were also there. Beautiful part of Italy, not the classic tourist area but civilized enough to have everything you need. 'Been the best 2 weeks of my life so far. We drank, partied at the beach till sunrise, laughed, and *stuff*. If people could relive certain parts of their life again i would choose that. Also the day we got the graduation results is a close second.
2	Concert band trips. No other part of high school was good. 
2	I really liked playing in my school's top orchestra. When we gave concerts, it seemed like all the practice was worth it.\n\nAlso, my AP Psych class was pretty cool. My teacher was laid-back yet strict and she prepared me for college better than anything else.
2	I captained the first Scholastic Bowl team to win a Regional Championship for the school my senior year, and even though we had an early exit at Sectionals I was voted All-Sectional by the Coaches' Association.  I don't normally go in for recognition and stuff, but I was pretty proud of this one.  
2	School  camps. The activities,  the food, late night's with friends, silly stories and being isolated  in the wilderness. 
2	There were a few instances of me being a dick to a particular history teacher/football coach in response to his idiocy that I'm particularly fond of.\n\nAnd there was the time I almost got into a fight sanctioned by the principal because another kid couldn't take the same verbal abuse that he dished out.  But the fight didn't happen because the other kid (who was perfectly willing to fight me if he could start it on his own terms) chickened out when the principal suggested we put on the boxing gloves and just go toe to toe.  That one's a fun one, too.\n\nSame principal, by the way, who, upon hearing that one of the students had a firearm in their truck, asked to see the firearm, said "That's a nice gun.  Make sure it stays in the truck."\n
2	Great thread.\n\nHigh school was a very fun time for me. And I'm not even one of the people who peaked in high school, but I will say that I had more fun then than I have since.\n\nSenior homecoming.\n\nHalloween senior year.\n\nMy AP classes (Physics, US History, World History, English Language, English Literature, Psychology).\n\nSenior prom planning.\n\nDebate.\n\nForensics.\n\nMath team.\n\nSo many other things I haven't mentioned too. It's 5AM right now so I'm not going to go into detail, but suffice it to say I had a blast in high school.
2	Honestly, coming home from school and signing on AIM and being excited when your crush was signed on your Buddy List. I loved using AIM because I *always* was awkward on the phone when the occasional girl would call me. 
13	ISTJ Entry Level Jobs.	I'm an ISTJ-A, currently looking for a job. What entry level jobs would be best for someone like me. Hopefully with the potential for a career.
3	Got a job at a warehouse. Mostly pallet preparation, some inventory control, some order fulfillment. Still work there but the company is poorly managed and there isn't any upward movement. I'd say if you can find a good company then inventory control may be pretty suited to ISTJ traits. The other things I've dealt with are just manual labor. 
3	I started as a receptionist/office assistant now I've moved up to office manager/bookkeeper.  The receptionist job was tough at first because some of the bosses I worked for were not nice people.  If you can find a good office it's really great, but I think that's true of most jobs.
3	I'm currently working as a cashier/junior management at a Texas based grocery store. Working on moving to a bookkeeping position while awaiting a class to start for an official management opportunity.
2	I started as a video game tester and now I'm a game producer. It fit my personality and way of thinking perfectly. 
1	My first job was working in a call center.  Pay was decent for the work required, hours were stable, and as my dad always says, "It beats digging ditches."\n\nThat said, as an ISTJ, I don't recommend it.
1	I would say warehouse or manufacturing to start with. Any knowledge gained on the floor with any classes taken for management is a great way to move up with our problem solving skills.
12	Anti-ISTJ moments	Don't you guys have any moments that totally don't belong in the ISTJ usual categories? For example, sometimes I really like to get drunk and forget about next days responsibilities and just let it slip. I also procrastinate from time to time and sometimes I trust on my feelings instead of my thoughts.
16	Occasionally, when I'm struggling to get something done, I finally go "Fuck it!  Close enough!"
13	Yes! I'm extremely sensitive and emotional, despite the ISTJ stereotype of being emotionless.
7	Hm. I use emoticons more than would be stereotyped, and I also have gotten comfortable throwing in *some* acronyms -- the ones that allow you to quickly communicate tone via text. So for instance, if I am talking to someone I am very comfortable with, I will throw in lol all over the place like it is another form of punctuation... because in a way, it is! \n\nI think a lot of people overestimate how much we just *are* structure, versus how much we desire or *need* structure. For instance, I could see some people thinking that if you took an ISTJ and put them in a cave with no signals about time, they'd still get up exactly at the same time each day, do the exact same things throughout the day, and would go to bed again at the same time at night. \n\nFor me, though, without some kind of external structure and schedule to regulate my time (e.g., during the summer when in college), my sleep cycle is extremely erratic, my productivity becomes wildly unpredictable, etc. Sometimes, it can feel like a luxurious weekend, and other times it feels like being lost in an airport, surrounded by mediocre sustenance and entertainment whilst trying to figure out where you are and where you are going. It seems like a lot of people assume ISTJs *are* Swiss watches, when I think it is safe to say that some of us *need* Swiss watches because structure and predictability allow us to bring our best selves more consistently to the table.
5	I'd say I'm more talkative than the normal istj. 
6	I'm always thinking of new ideas in my spare time and I'm a bit sensitive to HOW things are said. 
5	Sometimes, if I really let loose, I'll brush my teeth AND THEN floss!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust kidding. That'd be crazy.\n\n\n\nBut really, I find I'm much more in tune with my emotional side than "I should be" but I also feel it's part of growing and learning. I intentionally procrastinate because it gives me hyper focus and faking deadlines doesn't work for me. And I often go down hypothetical scenarios and come up with the most obnoxious creations in my head that will so obviously never become real tangible things. But then I think about the snuggie and I become afraid my idea will become a reality some day.
2	I love hosting parties.
2	Getting drunk is great tbh
2	I'm a sales associate and I work as a food runner in a restaurant.
2	I once had a casual friendship, a few other that were mentioned  as well.
1	I will occasionally get blackout drunk then ride the hangover to reboot my brain and regain appreciation for the everyday.
3	I guess whoever made this video is an ISTJ. That's my first rule. "Never ask somebody to do something you wouldn't be willing to do yourself."	
2	I'm a Support Manager at Walmart. I live by that rule every single day.
1	Hm, that is my first rule for questions -- never ask a question that I would not be willing to immediately answer back to the person. (For instance, don't ask for an honest critique if I was either not willing or not able to honestly provide a meaningful critique to that person.) \n\nFor asking someone to do something, I understand the notion in terms of not asking someone else to do something that I would consider beneath myself. Out of sheer curiosity though, do you have any way of accounting for things that someone else would *love* to do but that you would not do yourself?\n\nI am not sure I personally do -- I think my rule about asking people to do things looks something like, "Really? Should you *really* though?" I think I would prefer to find someone and pay them to do it -- not because I'd trust them more, not because I want to spend money, but soley because it escapes the issues of interpersonal debt and bargaining... I've never been keen on those either.\n\nI do think some people like that stuff though -- they find it hard to relate with or to someone who does not share in mutual favors, and they don't put a lot of thought or concern into what they would do, versus what they're asking the other person to do... It's all a fluid, mishy-mash of interrelating and negotiation....\n\n(*shudder*)
12	ISTJ description by Victor Gulenko (Socionics SLI "Gabin")	
8	>Cannot tolerate monotony and descent into inertia\n\nWanna bet?\n\n>willingly travel\n\nNope.\n\nAlso, the rest of that description seems close, but not quite right.\n\n[This](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LSI_Profile_by_Gulenko) seems more accurate for an ISTJ.
2	This is socionics not MBTI. As long as everyone understands this fine. I'm ISTJ/j in both, but apparently  socionics ISTj is most often related to ISTP in MBTI. For that reason, many people in this sub might not relate to a Socionics description.
1	This one is also good http://worldsocionics.blogspot.ca/2015/09/sli-sensory-logical-integrator.html
5	Weekly Thread: What advice would you give to someone looking to join your field/position?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: What advice would you give to someone looking to join your field/position?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
14	I would give them bad advice because I don't want any competition.
2	Learn to learn.  One of our interview questions is something like "What do you do if it's 3 am and you can't get a hold of any supervisors or co-workers and the clients' networks are being pwned?"  You Google it.  You find resources that lead to answers.  You have to be able to help yourself first.  We try to nurture young talent but self motivation to seek knowledge is the most powerful asset (and adversary) we have.\n\nField: Infosec.  Position: SOC Team Lead / Sysadmin / DB Admin / Web Dev / Office Manager / ohgodwheredoesitstop
2	Don't.
2	If you don't like memorization and science, go elsewhere.
2	Keep asking questions until you're completely sure what you're doing.
2	Remember that your employees are people and not just parts in the machines they operate.
2	Get off your phone and yes, rotating *perishable* product **does** matter.
2	If you can't deal with annoying, entitled customers and demanding managers, then it's not for you.
2	Funny this should come up because we had a few new people start recently at work. Anyway, here goes:\n\n1. You will fuck up. Admit it when you do. The trouble you will get in for lying is makes the trouble you will get into for making the mistake look tiny. Take criticism, learn from your errors, and move on. \n\n2. Keep a change of clothes in your locker and carry hand sanitiser everywhere. Things can get gross. \n\n3. Pack your food. Or if you don't, at least have some emergency muesli bars or tuna tins in the car in case. I worked 11 hours straight without food the other day and it fucking sucked. \n\n4. Don't take things personally. You will meet a lot of unpleasant people. You will also meet pleasant people who happen to be having a shit day. If you don't have a thick skin already you need to start growing one. \n\n5. Bringing cake or other baked goods to work is a very good way to make your team like you. Just saying. \n\n\n
6	Do any of you have an INFP shadow?	The way I understand shadow functions is, you switch the last three letters of the main personality type, and that is your shadow type. So for you ISTJs, your introverted feeling and extroverted intuition make an INFP shadow. \n\n\nDo any of you have artistic hobbies you enjoy? Do you feel strongly about protecting the weak or oppressed?  A fictional example is Hermione Granger, who is really square when it comes to following rules, but has a fierce devotion to helping house elves. 
6	I thought the absolute shadow type of a type was all the letters reversed, which makes the ESTJ the very 'shadow' of an INFP, with all the polarity it entails.. I think INFPs are more naturally kin to ISTJs than ESTJs.\n\nI've always felt a strong connection to my tertiary and inferior functions. It has in fact gotten to the point that I have to explain myself as ''an ISTJ with an insane Ne''. For starters, i'm often in the realm of fancy, or often attempting to escape into it. There's a constant quality to the immediate reality in front of me that makes it insufficient to sate my need for consistency, which ultimate points to a Si-related inner dynamic I think. I'm also easily one of the most imaginative people in any given circle, always thinking of all the ways that the world could be like instead, better or worse; but this comes with the conundrum that i'm always the first to shut down at any denigrate, nonsensical or commonplace suggestions. \n\nWith regards to Fi, I don't believe i've ever gone through a day without being offended at any and all details that violate my standards for how humans should behave without being a source of tumult, or a violation to my preferred peaceful state of things. I.. er.. besides taking a mostly apathetic stance to most of our usual focuses of activist behavior, I really dislike the idea of breaking off with one's own convictions. It's a horrific thought that we're living in a world where ''change'' is so idealized, commonplace, and enforced with the way our lives progress that people could take this morally guided stance one day and throw it into the trash the next one. I think that makes it a bit of a breeding ground for excusatory deviant behavior. I'm not going to step in further and into the realm of how opportunism has become the driving force in pretty much every aspect of life, but balls. The point is, I feel oppressed and definitely acknowledge that isn't the world for me, but I need to get by and end up doing so anyway. For all of those other people, imaginary and real, who feel the same suck.\n\nAlso, I hate people of authority that just love to flaunt their little high ground. That just warrants a little ''sic semper tyrannis'' whenever it happens... if only I were that bold. (or suicidal)

2	Oh yes, my ISTJ has a wonderfully discerning eye for well-crafted things and their aesthetic appeal. He has a strong sense of *his* ideal interior decor, his fashion style, and how he likes his food prepared, his tattoos which are very well thought through. When it comes to tattoos, I'll probably never be able to decide on something so permanent, because I want too many things and something could always be better that I don't know about yet. I love that he just knows what he wants, and is satisfied with that. It can be calming.\n\nHe has a good sense of moral principles & fairness too, and we generally are on the same page about ethical issues. That said, he is not all that concerned with social justice or what's happening globally. He prefers to focus on matters that directly and immediately impact him. 
8	Confusing "career choices to avoid" for ISTJs	I'm an ISTJ:\n\nPersonality type: “The Logistician” (ISTJ-T)\nIndividual traits: Introverted – 74%, Observant – 77%, Thinking – 64%, Judging – 94%, Turbulent – 85%\nRole: Sentinel\nStrategy: Constant Improvement\n \n\n\nI read on many websites that careers like marketing, public relations, event management should be avoided by ISTJs due to their unstable nature and high social interaction.\n\nHOWEVER, those careers, ie public relations, communications, marketing, are highly desired by me. I think it's because I have a strong desire for "attention" and "validation". I feel through those "fancy" careers, I receive attention through daily interaction with various people at work and those jobs also give me the opportunity to prove myself and earn recognition. I believe the desire for attention may come from my strict upbringing where my parents had not attended to my emotional needs well while constantly requesting me to perform well.\n\nAdding to that, I'm not passionate or excited about careers usually suggested for ISTJs like accounting, legal, finance AT ALL.\n\n\nSo my questions are:\n1. What are other explanations to my desire for those "fancy" careers?\n2. How do I know whether they are really a good or bad fit for me?\n3. If they are not a good fit for me, how do I fulfill my desire to get "attention" on my day-to-day job and desire for a "fancy job"? 
8	Personality typing isn't some prophetic, deterministic solution to your life, it's basically the equivalent of grouping people by age or something and saying "huh, look at all these similarities between 7 year olds, you can draw some predictions from these." When you group people by as many attributes as you consider in MBTI, you end up with very specific types of people which is why it can seem uncanny in its accuracy. However, that doesn't mean that it's any sort of actual rule or guiding principle, not everyone (or anyone really) is going to fit every attribute perfectly and you shouldn't use it to base decisions off of. Take the job you want.
4	You be you. Don't feel pressured into picking a career based on any label you've been "assigned", including but not limited to MBTI. That said, how would you know if something is a good or a bad fit for you? If you're really interested in something, self-initiated, it can't really be a bad fit for you. It doesn't automatically mean you'll do great, say a very short basketball player will probably never be among the best no matter how much he tries and loves it. He can still be good, but he's definitely handicapped. So, how good you'll do at something, only one way to find out, go and try it.\n\nJust, please, don't think that since you're ISTJ, it's set in stone that some career is definitely right or wrong for you. You know better than some test, what you like and whether or not the specifics of a career suit your character and skill-set.
3	Am an ISTJ. Am a graphic designer. Don't take mbti too seriously. If you like the field, pursue it. If you don't, don't. \n\nIn any case it can't hurt to talk to people who work in the field you are interested in, especially if they know you well. \n\nJob shadow if you can. An internship may even better help you determine the right path.
3	It's just correlation. I'm an ENTP and marketing/PR are supposed to be good for us, but I hate it. Some marketing jobs are really good for ISTJs, especially on the analytics side. But I've seen STJs be good in copy, general marketing strategy, and PR. \n\nIt's not really end-all-be-all, it's just "these careers tend to attract/fit the skillset of an ISTJ" and not "you can't be successful here". 
3	Tough love	When it comes to parenting, are you likely to support or oppose it? From a child's point of view? From a parent's point of view? \n\nI ask because theoretically, it would seem to be more tolerable among XSTJ types due to their ability to set feelings aside when accepting someone's decision after evaluating its logical consistency. \n\nOf course there are exceptions, like the time I had a XSTJ professor try to provide for me emotional support (even if it were not to come directly from her) when I started opening up to her about my addiction problems. Never received the preachy lectures I often got from my father in which I was told "you'll hate me now but love me later." \n\nBut from an XSTJ kid's standpoint, even though they like to adhere to structure and order, naturally kids are going to be curious and want to experience the world on their own, good or bad. They may appear to be rebelling, but in most cases they're probably unaware and do not fully understand that what they're doing is considered wrong and let the curiosity take over. For an ISTJ, I sure did get into a lot of trouble, and I point my fingers towards my need to understand foreign experiences. I wanted to evaluate for myself what makes a certain action wrong, frowned upon, or even illegal. And the only way I was able to do that was to jump right in.
5	Why does love have to be tough?\n\n> But from an XSTJ kid's standpoint, even though they like to adhere to structure and order,\n\nAs a kid, I adhered to my *own* structure. The degree to which that differed from my parents changed with the risks and penalties involved. \n\n> theoretically, it would seem to be more tolerable among XSTJ types due to their ability to set feelings aside when accepting someone's decision after evaluating its logical consistency.\n\nThis is a common misconception. Because stimuli hits the emotional center of your brain before it hits the logical center, unless you've specifically practiced mental techniques to combat it, your personality type alone won't prevent you from being susceptible to making suboptimal, emotion-driven decisions. \n\nAs a parent, I would try to be very careful with what I allow my kid to experience. My parents were less careful, as I had unsupervised, unhindered access to the internet from a young age, not to mention my mother's willingness to buy me M-rated games at will (trade-ins willing). Luckily enough for everyone, I was more than mature enough to handle it all. 
1	Parenting should be unconditional positive regard unless the child's behavior would be detrimental to their life or others around them.\n\nA parent doesn't own their child. Their purpose is to guide them towards betterment to the best of their ability.\n\nI disagree with tough love as it will lead to self-esteem issues for the child. It seems to be a convenient option for parents who wish a outcome from their child but do not know how to get them there.  
6	What is your opinion on psychedelics?	I was curious on my fellow ISTJs' opinion on drugs and I saw a thread discussing the legality of them (mainly weed). I didn't see much of anything regarding psychedelics. \n\nAlso, do any of you have experience with them?
9	I don't do any kind of drugs. Lol
5	Never tried. Never had a desire to try.
3	Shrooms changed my life...
4	I like shrooms.
3	I'm glad I live in a state where cannabis is legal. \n\nNormally, I focus on one thing at a time. One thought, one activity, whatever. To the extent that what I'm doing (or hearing) can happen in the background while I'm doing (or listening) to something else, that's about as far as my attention can extend at once. When I'm high, that number is more like 1.5 to 2. It's hard to explain. \n\nTry thinking of a melody looping in your head, then try adding more instruments until you start to forget the sounds of the previous ones. That point at which the old sounds start to go away is several instruments deeper when I'm high than when I'm sober. Also, the melodies take on a... for lack of a more descriptive term, better sound. They're more complex and layered. If I was writing it down, the page would look busy in comparison to whatever I could usually think of. \n\nAll that being said, the two main reasons why I'm a fan of cannabis is that it helps me sleep, as I'm otherwise a chronic insomniac, and that it prevents me from feeling negative emotions. Any sort of anger or sadness simply fails to fully realize itself as a coherent thought, or if it does, it immediately dissipates as my logical brain figures out why I shouldn't be mad or why the "sad" situation is actually beneficial and to be celebrated. And most of the time, I'm able to dismiss the negative emotion without even getting to the introspection step, since there are usually more relevant things to be spending my time and thoughts on.\n\ntl;dr: Cannabis makes me more creative in every conceivable way, helps me sleep, and makes food taste better. Alcohol is crap and should generally be avoided. \n\nEdit: 0 points? Why? I'm sober, and I stand by what I said. Let's see your responses, if you disagree. :)
2	I have had my fair share of drug use. All of it was recreational for I was very curious in my earlier years. Psychedelics were definitely a neat experience, but did not attract me as much that various stimulants did as they brought back nostalgic feelings I recognized (I guess its the Si for ISTJs).\n\nPlease do exercise caution and if you are feeling adventurous ensure you are in a good state of mind and stick to recreational drugs.
2	My username is self-explanatory. 
1	Tripping on acid is one of the most beautiful experiences I can imagine 
1	[deleted]
1	If someone wants to do drugs, and they are not putting themselves or others in harm's way while doing so I can't see too much of an issue, beyond the danger of the legal ramifications.\n\nI have personally only done acid as a psychedelic, and it was one of the worst experiences of my life. Became more depressed and nihilistic than ever before, emotions ran higher than I'd have liked, couldn't seem to control myself. Not something I'd like to repeat.
1	I've tripped on lsd a few times, I've enjoyed it. I haven't tried shrooms because I heard it makes you throw up and I hate throwing up. But I've heard they're pretty similar.\n\nIf you had a good time on lsd you'll probably be good on shrooms as long as your environment is fine.
7	Confusing signals from ISTJ guy?	Long story short, I'm an INTJ female interested in an ISTJ male. Right now I'm confused by his behavior and I'm not sure how to proceed. This whole situation has caused an emotional stir up that I'm not used to feeling, so maybe you guys can give me some intel on this.\n\nQuick backstory:\nWe're around the same age (I'm 27, he's 24) and met unexpectedly at work. I usually don't even notice others since I'm very focused at work. He comes off as very friendly, professional, mature, and these traits made him stand out to me. What made me become interested was how he introduced himself to me, often seemed happy to see me, seemed overly helpful, and was very polite. He comes off as very introverted and incredibly shy as well. It took some time, but he eventually asked for my number, which I later found did require some help from an additional co-worker to encourage him. I could tell he was terrified when he asked for my number (I saw his hands shaking mildly), but it went well. We texted often after that.\n\nWe met up in person twice so far. First time, movie date which I thought he didn't even like but later in a text told me he had alot of fun. He even tried to hold my hand, which seemed to come out of nowhere. It's hard to read him, lol. Second time, his place and things got kinda "hot" but we didn't go all the way. He even asked before I left if I was busy the next weekend, I said I would check my schedule.\n\nSo, it's been about a month since we last got together. After our second date, he seemed to "disappear" (stopped texting me) which really confused me and emotionally hurt even, then I've consistently been getting a cycle of Saturday 1am texts from him asking if I could come over Sunday. I'm assuming these are drunk texts? Why is he asking me out at 1am instead of just scheduling ahead of time?\n\nI've also initiated several times to hang out with him and he often says he has other obligations (family gatherings usually) and starts apologizing ALOT. I'm trying to take him at face value and give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI've found that I've developed some feelings for this guy, which is something that I honestly feared. I've initiated hanging out with him several times and gotten blown off. It hurts. I guess I'm just wondering if he even likes me or was I just another conquest (he doesn't seem like that type but maybe he's put up a great facade)? At this point, I'd rather just know the truth and move on. I would feel much better knowing he just wanted to hookup or already had another girl, rather than complete silence or leading me on. He keeps saying he's busy, but he does tell me when he's free. It also often seems like I have to initiate the conversation first, or ask to hang out, etc. Is this normal with ISTJ guys?\n\nTLDR; INTJ girl pursues very shy ISTJ guy, 2 dates go well. ISTJ guy allegedly gets busy and says he can't hang out with INTJ girl due to family events. ISTJ guy keeps apologizing and seems to stop talking as much INTJ girl. INTJ girl is confused and begins to think ISTJ doesn't really like her, or just sees her as a "hookup."\n\nI really like him but it seems he's avoiding me, and I don't know why. I'd just like some closure I guess and he doesn't seem to like talking about himself or expressing what he's thinking. Is this guy on player level 99 or something or just really obligated to work and family?\n\nThanks..

7	This:\n\n>but he eventually asked for my number, which I later found did require some help from an additional co-worker to encourage him. I could tell he was terrified when he asked for my number (I saw his hands shaking mildly),\n\nand this:\n\n>was I just another conquest \n\nare mutually exclusive.\n\nIf he were a conquistador, he would have taken the time to develop the social skills required to ask for your phone number without trembling hands or encouragement from an outsider.\n\nAlso, from your description, you can't be "just another conquest" since y'all "didn't go all the way" (that's a euphemism for "sex," right?).  Pretty sure "conquest" requires going "all the way."\n\nAnd then there's the fact that ISTJs don't usually do casual relationships.  Not saying we can't (well, *I* can't, anyway), but it's atypical for our type.\n\nSo, I figure one of two things happened:\n\n1) He got scared, panicked, and didn't know what to do, so he clammed up.\n\n2) He actually has family obligations, which he takes very seriously.\n\nAlso, it could be both.\n\nSo, here's my list of advice:\n\n1) Don't be afraid to initiate.  If you're waiting for him to make the first move, you'd better be wearing your comfy everything.  There's a fair chance he *won't* make the move(s) needed to move things forward because he may just not **have** any moves (I know I don't).\n\n2) Next time you talk to him, be direct.  If you want to see where the relationship can go, straight up tell him "I'm interested in you and where this relationship might go.  I know you may have some stuff going on, and I can respect that, but let's figure out what works and put something on the schedule."\n\n3) Be patient.  It sounds to me like he's interested but not sure how to proceed.  He'll get there as long as you can prod sufficiently without railroading.\n
3	I've been in a friendship thing with an ISTJ for a month now. I'm an ENFP, but all my closest friends are INTJ/INFJ/ENTJ. \n\nBe kind but straight forward. It will take vulnerability o your part. Don't focus or talk about the reasons you THINK he isn't around. If you ask him straightforward questions he will give you straightforward answers. \n\nBe patient but consistent. \n\nAs an INTJ you know the "I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING!!!" Panic is a real thing. Have the patience with him you would want someone to have with you. \n\n😊 \nGood luck!
1	I'm actually curious whether you did check your schedule and get back to him after the second date. Because for me if you didn't that would be enough for me to assume you're not that into me. We \n\nI also have a problem letting people go so I'm not sure if his continuing to text you means anything. And yes we're planners so a 1 AM text to hang out the next day is probably a lonely, drunk/sleepy text.\n\nAnd I've always heard that if someone wants to see you, they will make time to see you. This is certainly true for me. A month is a long time...\n\nAs everyone else suggested your best bet is to just be direct with him that you're disappointed you haven't gotten together in a month and want to do it really soon. Or heck I've sent messages like "I get the feeling the reason you cancelled is because you're not into me. Want to confirm?" I've gotten both a "yes you're right this isn't going to work" and a " call me so we can clear this up because that's totally not the case." We really have no problem being direct and he might be relieved if you bring up the topic.
5	Anyone in relationship with ISTP?	Hi.\n\nInteresting in how well the ISTJs get along with ISTPs in relationships (platonic and romantic).\n\nCould you please share experiences if you have any.\n\nWhat are the potential caveats?\n\nWhat did you enjoy / are enjoying in relationship with ISTP?\n\n
3	I don't think I've ever been in a romantic relationship with one, but I suspect that one of my best friends from childhood is one. What I admire about her is her artistic talents, brutal honesty, and take no shit attitude. She is also hilarious without ever trying to be. \n\nWhat I didn't like sometimes? She tried very hard to mask her vulnerability from people even if she was close to them. I'm guilty of partaking in similar behavior, but she is likely to explode if any internal conflict from her so-called "weaknesses" builds up. It is scary for some people, and she has needed the assistance of punching bags to let out any excessive anger when she was younger. Another concern? I don't think this is applicable to every ISTP, but the ones in my life are not very ambitious people. Of course this isn't a deal breaker, but it's as if they are on this constant path of trying to figure out what their true identities are and what they are meant to do for the rest of their lives. Many have been known to quit new jobs after just a few days of starting. They are intelligent enough, have so much potential, and carry college degrees but still would be working through a series of mediocre jobs that they don't always enjoy. \n\nOverall, I like ISTPs because their honesty is always appreciated no matter how harsh. I rarely catch them in a lie, so they are often trustworthy. 
3	YES! I'm just about to celebrate my one year anniversary with my boyfriend who is an ISTP. It's honestly a really fantastic relationship, probably the best I've ever had. I enjoy that we have the same hobbies, communicate in similar ways, and have similar attitudes towards education and future goals.\n\nWhat works: We're both honest, logical, hard working, and devoted. Our love languages are the same and we have similar values. \n\nChallenges: We are both so introverted and homebodies so we rarely go out. Sometimes I wish he'd be a little more verbally expressive.
2	Yep I am. My biggest problem is that he doesn't like me as much as I like him, lol. But I guess the bigger problem is that even if they are in love with you, it will be hard to know. They're generally not good at expressing emotion. I need reassurance that the guy is into me. Either in words or in lots of time spent together. ISTPs are generally not that way.\n\nBut I feel like we totally get each other. We definitely are opposite functions he is a stereotypical ISTP with the exception of the whole risk taking part. I see the Se/Si differences all the time. I can also pick up on the Te/Ti differences but since we're both so smart I think we're both very capable of using both. So the result is that we constantly give each other an interesting perspective that the other one can totally appreciate.\n\nBut he is amazingly loyal, forgiving, nonjudgemental. But if you're a perfectionist it could be a problem because Se means he notices EVERYTHING and tends to point it out too. And since he likes problem solving/fixing things it's usually the bad stuff he points out.
2	I'm curious why ISTJs and ISTPs get along so well even though we have 0 functions in common. Is it the fact that our functions are in the same order and just differ on the I vs E dimension?
7	Weekly Thread: How has your 2017 been going so far?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: We're almost halfway through 2017! How would you rate your year so far?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
8	Bland. Just like every other year. 
7	More eventful than previous years. I'm about to graduate this fall and am currently doing an internship in my field this summer. I feel like I'm getting closer to where I want to be, so at least that's exciting.
3	"....just like last year. And the year before that. And the year before that."
2	[deleted]
2	Has been a surprising year! Really pleasant surprises. Initially some decisions and things that have happened somewhat devastated* me, but they turned out to be a God send. Overall, I **cannot** complain.    \n    \n*for lack of better word
2	Half of 2017 has passed in the blink of an eye. It's been going better than last year (which isn't difficult for me), but not nearly as well as I wish it did. 
2	Busy. Study and work full up my time, trying to get car license in the spare time I have. Got a lot of assessments I need to write up documents for.  \n\nCan't wait until next year when I graduate. 
2	Lots of ups and downs. The biggest down is that my uncle passed away... but the biggest up was that the cancer inside me shrunk even more! I'm still on chemo (1.5 years now), and now my hair is so thick and long that I could very well post on r/fierceflow 
2	[David Byrne voice]: "Same as it ever was."
2	Not to bad. Just recently went on vacation to Nashville with my wife so that was awesome. 
15	Becoming more awkward as I get older?	It seems the older I get, the more socially awkward and introspective I become (and surprisingly, this does not bother me...but it makes for an interesting observation). Isn't it supposed to be the other way around? Good grief, haha.    \nIt is at the point where I'm laughing about it now, but given some time I may amass the EQ of a rock or something.    \nNot sure if *this* is the right sub for this post (perhaps r/SolitaryWeirdosUnite would be better)...but does anyone else here feel the same?
10	The older I get, the more socially isolated I become, and the more socially isolated I am, the less I even want to leave the house, or want anything to do with anybody IRL.  If it was feasable to work from home and shop for cigarettes and beer online, I'd never leave the house.
4	I also think like this is true for me. I think it is an issue with my experiences making me more hesitant to be myself or whatever. I get really nervous during conversations which just plays up my awkwardness.
2	I feel like I am also more awkward and introspective as time goes on, though I think it is partly from increasing EQ, rather than decreasing EQ? Or at least I don't think I am less knowledgeable about other people... If anything, I feel more and more awkwardly aware of how many different cultures exist (especially with the internet), and with how those unspoken assumptions/expectations dictate what is awkward and what isn't, and who is a valid/good person and who isn't.\n\nConversation tends to center around the assumption that we are both "average" people -- which *already* implies different things depending on what setting you are in, and whether you are an in-group or out-group to the other person. If you are willing to play the role, it really lubricates social interactions in the world -- that's really the only value. (For instance, a mother laughing about how men and husbands are, when they're actually a happily married lesbian, or a single mother who got artificially inseminated after a limited and unsuccessful set of dating experiences.)\n\nThat echoes my own experience -- for an example, I am essentially female, but not particularly feminine. As such, it is deeply frustrating, alienating, and annoying when I am treated as if, because I am female, I am a stereotype of women. It is low-grade annoying when men assume I'll be offended by crude jokes, for instance -- because then instead of laughing with them at a genuinely funny joke, I get singled out to receive an apology, as "the woman." (That doesn't even get into situations where the topic of men vs. women is raised -- in which case, it usually becomes a play, where I am playing the role of "the tennis ball on a stick that will be animated in post-production to be an argumentative stereotype.")\n\nMost people seem pretty comfortable interacting within cultures in this way -- which makes sense. Culture developed for a reason. It is helpful to know how others expect you to behave, and how to interpret the behaviors of others. However, I've always been better at knowing the range of possibilities than using limited information to pick *one* script to use. So I can feel awkward until I understand them and their patterns -- and if they have expectations for others, I can come across awkwardly to them. I usually get on best with people who have few firm expectations about how other people feel, think, and behave. It's not a large group, and I don't like one-on-one socializing (or the obligations of a relationship) enough to intentionally go out hunting for them. 
2	The older I get, the more introspective I am, yet the more extroverted I (have learnt to) appear. I've not become more awkward but I've distanced most people in my life.\n\nPerhaps our experiences shape us more than we'd like, more than other types.\n\nTest as both ISFJ/ISTJ
1	im vibing a lot with these posts, it may be that as we spend more time alone our Si/Te loops back and updates our morals as including isolation/alone-time higher on the priority list.
1	I think this is applicable to most people regardless of type. People seem to grow more "introverted" as they age because they increasingly invest their time in providing for their families and worry less about a social life to survive. There are obvious extraverts that I know with families now and they label themselves as introverts just because they stay home more and work to take care of their kids, it kind of makes me laugh sometimes. That's not exactly preferring time alone and being energized by it but rather a matter of being busy. Less time to spend socializing with friends = time apart from maintaining social skills. 
1	Ok so I'm gonna be the dissenter here. I've only in the last 4 years or so realized that I like people and that I am happier with a handful of deep social connections. Maybe it's only a phase. \n\nI've definitely become more introspective as well. But I find that my interactions with others foster my introspection. In processing the social interaction after the fact, I'm constantly drawing new conclusions about how I operate.
5	Weekly Thread: what's something good that recently happened to someone you know?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: What's something good that happened recently  to a friend/family member/colleague that you know?\n \nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!\n\nApologies for the delays in posting this! I'm travelling around Asia this summer so the definition of "weekly" might be looser than usual. But as long as I have wifi I'll keep this running!
7	My brother got married. 
5	Former roommate got his license to be a bartender, allowing him to make enough money to do school at the same time. Current roommate is getting married soon, sister got a car for the first time in 3 years.
3	My friend went on a trip to visit one of her friends that lives at the opposite end of the country.
2	My best friend got into a graduate program that she's excited about and that her work is entirely paying for. 
6	Met this wonderful ISTJ 2 weeks ago and we've spent countless hours together. As an ENFP I have many xNTJ friends, but he is the first ISTJ to want to get to know me. Just wanting to ask some questions of you wonderful humans. 😊	Sorry it's so long!\n\nBackstory:\n\nTwo weeks ago I met this ISTJ at a group hang out of mutual friends. I sat next to him and we immediately. He was very open and friendly and picked on me in the best way. It was like he fit right in. He said he was a stats major and I was intrigued. As the night closed I said, "I WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND! Can I be your friend?" And he added me on Facebook. THEN as I was leaving I said, "oh do you know your MBTI?" And he said yes and had it readily available in his email. \n\nI excitedly messaged him that night and also asked if he would help me with some homework. I rambled and got nervous and sent a bunch of messages. \n\nHe smoothly responded as if I hadn't been all spazzy and came over after work for 5 hours. \n\nLater that day I asked him randomly, "are you happy?" And he answered sincerely. \n\nWe banter and I send way too many messages and invite him all the time to things. But he initiates too. \n\nHe spends hours with me and we talk about so much. I ask him questions and he rarely understands what I'm asking the first time because they are often abstract concepts. \n\nTonight we both discussed the fact we've never trusted anyone so quickly. I told him I enjoyed that he never pressures me. I decided to be vulnerable and told him that I enjoy our friendship so much and that, honestly, i was glad he didn't pressure me to think if we should date. I said words of affirmation is one of my primary love languages and "I was afraid I would say something and he would think I'm hitting on him." And I added, "not that I WOULDN'T, but I like that he doesn't pressure me." \n\nHe told me he trusts me and feels like I get him. That he enjoys listening to me and the way I talk. He said everything I talk about is interesting. That I make him think. \n\nNecessary added info:\n\nI'm an ENFP with a highly developed Te\n\nAll my closest friends are INT/ENTJ's (and one ISFJ)\n\nHe's quite good looking, but I'm demisexual so right now I'm just in the "your face isn't weird at all" phase. 😊 \n\nHe always asks me open ended questions. \n\nQuestions:\n\nCould it be he likes me romantically?\n\nIf so, should I let him make the first move?\n\nHow should I word existential and abstract questions so that he better understands what I'm asking?\n\nDoes age difference matter a lot to y'all?\n\nThank you in advance. I'm just looking for some insight. ❤️ \n\n
3	Honestly, it sounds like this guy is into you. However, that is not a 100% guarantee. Though I would say the odds are above 80%. \n\nAnyway, with the other questions...\n\nI'm not the best at relationships so I have no idea about the first move question.\n\nAbstract questions are typically hard for me to really get into, but if they relate to something that is happening or is around me, then I will generally take more note of it (it also depends if I like the person explaining it). I would need to be asked about a certain situation or my literal thoughts during situations to have a better grasp of the question.\n\nAge does matter to me, but I understand that age is something a lot of people really don't care about. I don't know if has anything to do with type.
3	>Tonight we both discussed the fact we've never trusted anyone so quickly. I told him I enjoyed that he never pressures me.

I said words of affirmation is one of my primary love languages and "I was afraid I would say something and he would think I'm hitting on him." And I added, "not that I WOULDN'T, but I like that he doesn't pressure me." \n\nIf you actually **are** interested in him romantically, with this statement you significantly undermined useful communication on that point, IMO.  \n\n>If so, should I let him make the first move?\n\nI can't imagine an ISTJ making the first move when you have already told him:\n\n>honestly, i was glad he didn't pressure me to think if we should date. I said words of affirmation is one of my primary love languages and "I was afraid I would say something and he would think I'm hitting on him." And I added, "not that I WOULDN'T, but I like that he doesn't pressure me." \n\nISTJs like clear, unambiguous, direct information and communication. If you are romantically interested, you have given him unclear, indirect and ambiguous communication. \n\nSo like /u/vgambit wrote [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/6izmn0/met_this_wonderful_istj_2_weeks_ago_and_weve/djb28vc/), \n\n>If you're into him, you'll have to make the first move.\n\nAnd I would add/reiterate, any such move on your part will need to be clear and direct and unambiguous.\n\n(Source: I am an INFJ in a relationship with an ISTJ)
2	If I was your friend, I would assume that I'm being friendzoned. The "not that I wouldn't" is the only thing that might indicate otherwise from you, but that seems to be a tiny thing in an ocean of "we're only friends lol"-type language.\n\nIf you're into him, you'll have to make the first move.
2	I'm a demisexual male ENFP and I'm in the exact same situation. I don't have any advice, but reading this gave me a bit of hope. Thanks 🙂.\n\n
1	I'm an ENFP with a highly developed Te as well. It certainly makes communication with ISTJs easier- I should know, I'm marrying one in August. :)
1	Before you mentioned you had developed Te I was gonna say! You sound more like an ENTP. \n\nAll over the place I like it. I'm an ENTP and I met an ISTJ that has said the same things to me word for word. He trusts me, I get him, also that I challenge him. Which I find interesting! And I felt the same with the no pressure. I love istjs and i think you should go for it and enjoy yourself with this new found friendship slash whatever the future holds \n\nEdit: I hadn't read your questions entirely. Ah with the questions for me I think sporadically, whereas the ISTJ i know thinks very linearly. I think they ask for the question in detail because they want to be precise. Maybe ask the question in full but I also think you're over analysing it. Just keep asking your questions! \n\nI think the fact that he's spending a lot of time with you is a good sign! Just be yourself go with the flow and if you want the clarification, ask him! 
1	He definitely likes you, that's for sure. Altough it is quite hard to notice whether he is into you or just likes you as a great friend. Look for some signs:\n\n- Does he try to invite you over for an activity for just the two of you?\n\n- Does he give you a lot of compliments?\n\n- Does he reply quickly? Especially when he has something important to do?\n\n\nIf you can confirm the above 3, then he's probably into you :)
1	Hmm demisexual. Didn't know that was a thing. I think I might be that. I would say he likes your romantically. I may not wait on him to make the first move though. You might be waiting a while lol. I would say let it happen naturally. Maybe if you had abstract questions you could compare them to something he knows more about. Age difference doesn't really matter to me as long as it's not a huge gap.
1	1. Maybe. From the profile you provided of him, it sounds like it, but many ISTJs including myself are stupid when it comes to reading other people, so unless someone directly states that they like me, then that's the confirmation I absolutely need to determine if they are interested. \n\n2. Yes. If you like someone, take that chance as you cannot always rely on the other person to initiate. \n\n3. Examples, examples, examples. Providing hypothetical scenarios should work. \n\n4. No. If age influenced my dating preferences, then I'd be screwed because no one my age and younger approaches me.
1	Late to the party. Sounds like he's into you, we don't generally talk that much or trust that easily.  You'll likely have to make the first move or make it extremely obvious that you want him to make a move. Idk what that would look like though.\n\nAs far as abstract thoughts go, if you figure that out let me know. My wife is INFP and she does this often. The problem is that she'll often be talking about things in a bubble of thought and I can't trace it linearly. If she would explain how thoughts connected to one another, it might help me better connect dots.
4	Hi	Hey Istj's, i'm an ENTJ, kinda curios about you guys since i've never met anyone of your type, would love to get to know any of you if you're interested.
18	Query too vague.  Please narrow search parameters.
2	What would you like to know?
2	Hi! My husband's an ENTJ, so I might be able to provide some relevant info.\n\nAny questions in particular? (First thing to learn is that we prefer a bit of direction before we move forward on anything)
2	Well until you ask us specific questions you won't get much. But if you're looking for a sort of pen pal to chat with from time to time, I'd be up for that. I love getting to know people. But I'm gonna want to know EVERYTHING about you, so be forewarned, lol.
2	We're only the most common type. Look around. \nAnd we're probably avoiding you. 
1	My body is ready
6	Advice on ISTJ friend	Hi! I've been friends with an ISTJ for a handful of years. Let's call ISTJ "A". In many ways, A has been one of my closest friends but our dynamic has definitely changed over time since we haven't been in close proximity of one another in a long time. I'm not the best at communicating (replying to messages) and I think it has definitely impacted our friendship in one way or another. Past couple of weeks, I've noticed that A hasn't been as responsive and I'm not sure what to do. I know that ISTJ often are doing their own thing (I think?) and maybe I'm overthinking things. Should I be okay just waiting it out or should I be worrying that things are not okay between us? \nThanks!\n\nAlso - any advice on how to connect with an ISTJ further? Or make them feel appreciated, understood - basically what are some ways that I could be a better friend to A, and other ISTJs in my life?
6	This may be just me, but I've resented everyone I used to call a friend but they never made effort to keep in contact with me or spend time together.\nI'm also a type 6 phobic however and have the propensity to assume the people around me will act as I would in their shoes. If they don't and i don't confront them about it, then I resent them. With increasing confidence and being assertive however, I'm slowly learning to voice my needs and let my friends know how much I value quality time.\n\nI'd recommend trying to keep in contact and being there for them if you want to be friends. Si with tertiary Fi can be a real pain in the ass when theres no communication going on.
3	I tend to lose touch with my friends because I'm not willing to initiate contact. I get friends because they approach me. So yes if you move away and don't stay in touch I'll interpret that as you don't really care about me anymore. But there's also a bit of "out of sight out of mind."\n\nHowever unless someone crosses me, I love them for life. And if my friends need me or invite me out I will go. No questions asked.\n\nSo can you invite your friend to visit or invite him/her for a chat or just send texts on a regular basis. Unfortunately with an ISTJ you might have to always be making the initiative. But we'll show up with warmth, loyalty, and our unique sense of humor.\n\nOh and it might also help if you let her know that you still love her to pieces, x has just really been getting in the way of your ability to respond. I know I'm very insecure in this way and sometimes need to be reassured that the other person is still "into" me.
0	Off topic, why not say Alex? Or Andrea? Why go out of your way to pick a fake name, then make it something like that? Alex won't know it's you, or even him, you know? And his friends won't know you're talking about him. \n\nBetter yet, pick some other gender neutral fake name, refer to them by their opposite gender, and then just go with it.\n\nEdit: Call Alex. Schedule a time, if you think he'll respond. But you might not need to. Just account for any timezone differences.
21	Lazy ISTJs	For an ISTJ, I can be incredibly lazy, but the problem most of the time stems from perfectionism. If I suspect that I will end up half-assing a project, I see no use in continuing or even starting. Other times when I have a full workload, not enough motivation in the world will push me to do the mundane tasks first, and I will come up with every excuse in the book to put it off for later in favor of the more fun projects. \n\nWhat can I make out of this function-wise? I suspect my Inferior Ne could be at play here, but I must admit that my knowledge of the N/S divide is still limited.\n\nI also must add that over the past few years I've been recovering from severe depression that has since transitioned into a more mild form. This might be the actual culprit, but I cannot be entirely sure as my depression has not been interfering with my life and goals lately. 
13	Lazy ISTJ here.\n\nDespite my laziness, I have a "get shit done" mode.  Once I get into it, I'm basically unstoppable until the "shit" I"m working on gets "done."  I'm also pretty much incapable of doing anything else, because when I'm working on something, it gets a minimum of 100% of my focus.
4	Although we are Te aux which makes us efficient in how we proceed to do stuff, we are still Si dom meaning that our natural state is taking it slow and relaxing. I would say that this dynamic is even more empowered because we are on the Ne/Si axis, this means that in contrast to Ni/se users who are always ready to do stuff, we take breaks in between activity.
3	I don't think ISTJ's are immune from being lazy, I suffer from that as well.\n\nI too will push mundane/task related things off until the absolute last possible moment, and then I get mad at myself for not knocking out the easy stuff at least.\n\nThis is a slight tangent, but it might be something to think about.\n\nThere are two schools of thought for tackling tasks - some say you should tackle the most difficult things first because your mind is fresh.  I had a boss who swore by this method, and she heard it in some seminar as "eating the frog" or something like that.  Instead of putting off the task you dread the most - tackle it first.  She gave us little toy frogs to remind us.\n\nThe other method is to tackle the little stuff first - and I will often do that because at least it gives me a sense of accomplishment.  If I choose a difficult task and don't accomplish it within the work day - then I feel like the entire day is wasted.\n\nHave you tried rewarding yourself for accomplishing things you would normally put off?  I've had a little success with that.  A candy bar, a short walk, some sort of carrot to dangle in front of yourself so you'll have some motivation.\n\nAre there areas of your life that you are passionate about?  I have a friend who is incredibly dedicated to biking, but the other areas of his life (financial, career, social) are abysmal.  I keep telling him to apply the effort and dedication that he puts into biking in those other areas but it falls on deaf ears.
3	I will not be able to give you anything helpful as I am not really knowledgeable about this stuff, but may I ask how old you are?\n\nI think age and lifestyle definitely play big roles. Of course like the other guy said, being an ISTJ does not mean you cannot be lazy. I too found the inability to start tasks if I though it would not be completed. I was also not nearly as hardworking in the past as I am now. As I got older (20s) I realized that I should not waste my youth and my work ethic kinda exploded.
1	I go in streaks of being lazy. How old are you? While they say Te should start developing around 20ish I didn't really become more efficient/disciplined until I hit 25. Even if I have a day of laziness I can guarantee you that the next day I'll make up for it 
1	If the things you are having difficulty with are neither part of your goals, nor necessary for your life, is it a problem that you aren't doing them? For instance, if someone got nothing out of making their bed and keeping their desk tidy, then unless there are other people who have a legitimate claim to that space and how they use it, they shouldn't make their bed or tidy their desk!\n\nOr is it possible that the depression symptoms are still affecting your life and goals, just very slightly? I know for myself, I couldn't get myself to work consistently and it was undiagnosed ADHD. \n\nIn MBTI terms, there are the Ne grip (getting stuck in your inferior function), or the Si-Fi loop (hopscotching over your secondary function to stay in a perma-introverted state without sufficient engagement with the outside world) -- if you wanted to search those, you might find some useful things. That said, it might also be one of those things that falls outside of the MBTI...
7	Weekly Thread: What features would your dream mansion have?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: What does your dream mansion look like? Nothing is too impractical or too expensive in this scenario!\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
10	My own land as far as the eye can see with no neighbors for miles.
4	I'd really like to have a batting cage and a bowling alley
4	I have to second the batting cage! None of those shitty hard simple balls that damage your bats, either :). I'd also want laundry chutes and a loft with a slide!
5	An indoor swimming pool with lanes for laps. A mini-library of sorts.
4	A video game cave, multiple lofts, an indoor pool/ jacuzzi/ lazy river, a tower (like a castle), and a zen garden. \n\nAlso, numerous passageways, hidden entrances, trap doors, etc. Think of the secret bookcases in Skyrim. 
4	I'd prefer penthouse, apartment and so on than landed house.
3	Tunnel system/breakfast nook.
3	A massive garage and my own private race circuit
3	Own pool, cinema, restaurant/bar and an amazing view on either mountains, private beach or forest. Large garden as well 
2	Has anyone else noticed that the "weekly" thread hasn't changed in 11 days?
2	Own vast property, think Italian Wine fields and a huge mansion. Cigar Lounge, Liquor Cellar, English Garden, Indoor Swimming Pool, Aircraft Runway and Hangar, Drifting Circuit (Preferably Touge Style) Huge Garage for Cars and Motorcycles, Second smaller Villa for Guests, in the Mansion a big Hall like rich Knights had, a modern Weaponry, big secure Underground-Housing System, a huge terretory for a male and female Tiger + paid Specialists that care for them (i like Tigers is all).
3	ENFP with a crush on a ISTJ	I'm a male ENFP and I have a huge crush on a female ISTJ in my class. She's smart, reliable and our conversation feels so incredibly natural. We've known each other for quite a while (3 years) and I only recently developed feelings for her. \n(I'm demisexual if that matters). She also seems to like me too.\n\nThe thing is, I'm afraid that our differing natures will lead to conflict in a relationship. I grew up with an ISTJ (my older sister) and we've always had a bit of an odd relationship of being extremely close and at the same time very different. My desire for freedom and her desire for scheduled order has lead to a lot of arguments over the years. I'm afraid the same problems will develop if I choose to actually pursue my crush.\n\nSo here I am, asking advice from the people who think the way she thinks. I would love to hear any input you guys have, especially from those of you who have dated other ENFPs. I know we can be a bit of a handful sometimes, with the non-stop rambling and crazy ideas, but I reallly do like her and any advice you guys have on courting her/making the relationship work would be much appreciated.
4	Honestly, just go for it.\nLoving someone is making compromises on what you can't agree on. ISTJ's will help you stay grounded, which you might realise is not a problem in any way. You don't magically lose control when you enter the relationship, so dont worry about it.
3	>My desire for freedom and her desire for scheduled order has lead to a lot of arguments over the years. I'm afraid the same problems will develop if I choose to actually pursue my crush.\n\nIf you do pursue your crush and this becomes a thing, schedule something akin to "anything can happen Thursday" (yes, I totally stole that from Big Bang Theory).\n\nOn that day, your need for randomness and spontaneity is encouraged (as long as it doesn't interfere with important real-world things like paying the bills).\n\nIt works for her because "it's on the schedule" and it works for you, because every moment of the day isn't scheduled into oblivion.
3	Yep just go for it. If she's anything like me she would never initiate even if she had a burning burning love for you. If it doesn't work out, so what? You'll learn something.\n\nI'm not a super rigid planner. I just need to know what to expect. I'm also very open to trying new things you just need to give me time to convince myself, lol. So just give her some heads-up when you're going to want to hang out. If you try to spring something on her at the last minute, expect a no.  She'll also likely get a lot more flexible as she gets comfortable with you so don't dismiss her too quickly based on this. Give her time to show you how awesome she is.
2	Im an ENFP male with an ISTJ girlfriend. Dont worry about 
2	Lazy ISTJ female here. \n\nStructure is important yes but that's only when they're busy, and yes, even ISTJs need their free time. No plans = openness to spontaneity, so I wouldn't be too concerned about her being rigid as long as she isn't stressed with a full workload. \n\nI'd say go for it. I can imagine as an ENFP, you'd be killing yourself wondering about all of these "what ifs" if you don't at least jump in and try. 
13	What is your partner's MBTI and how is the relationship going?	I'd love to hear your love stories and experiences of being with your SO. These may include but are not limited to how you guys met, the rewards and challenges of the relationship etc :)
7	[deleted]
5	My partner is an ISFJ (maybe an ESFJ, actually). It's a bit difficult as he is more outgoing and open to new experiences and very people-oriented. Sometimes we have to communicate more clearly and I'm also the type of person to take a long time to get comfortable with physical affection. However, it's definitely an enjoyable experience, despite the hiccups. I wouldn't have it any other way. It's difficult to grow with a person but I think that sometimes it is necessary.
4	Just another INFP with an ISTJ. We've been dating semi long distance for 2 years. Hoping I will get a job at his city by the end of this year. \n\nHow we met: Plenty of Fish, I knew what I wanted and messaged him first. Our first phone conversation and first meeting in person were both remarkably comfortable though we were strangers and from very different worlds.\n\nRewards: We give each other space to be ourselves. We have similar love languages, but are flexible enough to adjust to each other where needed. He's my solid, dependable, loyal, realistic, hardworking, stable rock. He calms my anxieties and "crazy" thoughts. I'm the one who adds color, whimsy, and different ideas to his life. But also foresight and big picture perspective, as he tends to see only the trees, while I see the forest. \n\nChallenges: The very thing that makes him attractive to me can also be an obstacle. He is predictable and sticks to the familiar, and if that's not what I want, then we are at odds with each other. He has to think of things very thoroughly before even considering moving to another city. This is necessary but sometimes I think he's being too risk-averse. He probably thinks I'm unrealistic or don't think things through enough (which is true). It probably perplexes him why I can be all gung-ho about something, and then give up without finishing it for something else. \nHe works hard but needs to be told that if he's going to work that hard, he may as well do it where he'll be fairly compensated, bc he's sacrificing a lot for it. Work-life balance is tough for him to comprehend.    \n\nAll in all though, I'm deeply attracted to who he is, and he seems to feel that way about me too. I feel that I'd be good for him and be able to make him happy whenever he comes home (someday!) and vice versa. We both value comfort and similar cozy things, and don't need too much from life (what adventure I do need is in small doses), so I think we strike a good balance.
3	Hahahaha, Love? I have no capacity for such things.\n\nFor real though, I got nothing, and I'm in my 20s.
2	My husband is an ENTP. We've been together for nearly 20 years, and we just celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary this week. \n\nLife is great. We balance each other perfectly. 
1	My girlfriend is an ISFJ and we are very similar; we like very much the same things and do everything together. She tends to be more emotional than me but that is not a problem since I tend to take a logical approach to situations and I am able to calm her down and help her through anxiety and such. We have been together for 3 years and are committed to each other and will get married in a few years once we are out of college. 
0	Hi! I'm an INFP and I was wondering why most ISTJs (and some ESTJs) wear so many baseball caps!	Idk if it may be some personal preference or if there is meaning behind the madness (that is baseball caps on xSTJs)
17	Everybody wears baseball caps... this has zero to do with ISTJ's. 
7	I don't think you're typing people correctly.
2	I hardly ever wear any sort of hat.  \n\nI have a crushable leather hat from Khakadu traders that I wear when it rains because it keeps said rain off of my head and glasses.\n\nIf it's raining very hard and I have to be out in it very long, like when I'm walking dogs, I have a poncho I'll wear, and I wear a baseball cap with that to keep the hood of the poncho from falling down over my eyes.\n\nThat's pretty much it.\n\nNobody's reading this, but edited to add: I also wear a hat when fishing.  Why?  Because when I was 3 or 4 (first time I went fishing), my dad told me that you have to wear a hat while fishing, or you'll get skunked (catch very few or no fish).  That has actually been my experience, so I wear a hat while fishing.
2	What? This is so weird. \n\nI  only wear baseball hats when walking the dogs, running or doing yard work. It's strictly for sun protection. \n\nI own no other kind of hat. I never wear hats unless in the above mentioned situations. 
1	I personally will never wear a baseball cap lol.
54	Any other ISTJ's that like to come earlier at work/school/social situation just to prepare yourself for tne day and enjoy the 10 minutes of peace?	Really believe that this might be an ISTJ thing
14	I'm not 100% sure if it's *because* I want to prepare myself/enjoy the peace, but I do have a habit of being early to places. Am usually the guy who shows up on time to parties and other social events, which apparently is frowned upon, but I'll admit it can be overwhelming showing up with a ton of people already there.\n\nTLDR - this guy, most likely (to answer your question).
6	It depends, work/school/other appointments or meetings: Yes, I try to leave a bit early so I'm definitely on time.\nIf I'm early, sometimes I'll just wait in my car and relax and I'll leave when it's time.\n\nFor social situations I've learned to come a bit late, but not too late.\nI don't like being the first and only one there, but like /u/Buddy_Smiggins said: it can be overwhelming showing up with a ton of people already there
5	At least 10 minutes early, usually more.
4	I recently started teaching and I've just been drowning in all the grading, paperwork, lesson plans, responding to parent emails, etc. Bf has to get to work at 7, but school doesn't start till 9:30, so I actually leave shortly after him so I can be in my classroom at least an hour ahead to enjoy a realm of privacy and quiet, get all my thoughts and plans together before the rush of teenagers all day.\n\nI do like that early-morning productivity.\n\nAs for social situations, definitely depends on the "audience" -- I used to get dressed and do my makeup way before a party and then take a nap with all of it on because I'm ancient and I get tired around 10pm, so if I want to survive a party that is supposed to unofficially start at 11pm and last till the wee hours of the night, I have to nap... I just learned to choose a time and always arrive at that time (11:30pm).
3	That explains why my ISTJ coworker likes to assign himself for the earliest shift (7:30) and then still shows up earlier than that.
3	I can start my shift at 6 and most don't come in until 7 or later... oh the peace..so nice.
3	I love it. I started taking the earlier train to work so there weren't as many people to deal with. It's really nice to walk around outside of work for a little bit before I go sit at my desk all day too. \n
2	YES. I work 2nd shift at an automotive supplier. I often arrive an hour early (if I don't have any obligations earlier in the day), armed with coffee and a book and my lunch. I don't like rushing through lunch, so I find eating it there to be nicer. There's a huge space with lots of tables and free drinks. It's peaceful, and I don't have to rush.
1	Well, every MB test I've ever taken says I'm an ISTJ, but I rarely get anywhere early in the morning.\n\nWhen I do though it is quite nice.
1	I arrive at work a whole hour early, lots of times.  First one here, get to quietly make the coffee and have a cup before anyone arrives.  I leave a bit early too, which helps with the rush hour traffic.
1	I usually do to everything but work. I'm usually right on time. But I do like being to places first
1	Yes, if possible. Always at least 15 minutes early, sometimes more. I like how I don't need to worry about walking in and seeing everyone there. I also like to prepare to be early "just in case" (traffic/distraction/etc).
1	Yup, nearly everytime I arrive earlier than the host him/herself...
1	o/
1	Yes! Used to do this all the time at work/school. However, social gatherings I usually show up RIGHT on time to avoid any awkward situations or conversations with it 'not being time' yet..
1	Am ISTP, do the same 
1	Well of course. Being early is punctual and being on time is late. \n\nLiterally for class it's a requirement to be in class ten minutes before the lesson starts or you're late. 
1	Managing moderation	Most ISTJs in my life are ace at balancing their lives especially the older folks, but have you noticed any changes in habits with age? I'm skeptical about this being MBTI-related, but I remember reading somewhere that it isn't uncommon for younger ISTJs to be rebellious and lack discipline until they transition into adulthood. 
2	ISTJ - rebellious and lack of discipline have never been in my vocabulary so for me those traits have nothing to do with age.
2	Interesting that you say that. My ISTJ bf almost prides himself in the fact that he used to be a bit wild and reckless in his younger days. His mother used to worry about him getting injured all the time. Even now, he's very responsible at work but his health, personal and financial life are still not quite together. I've noticed he has a strong impulsive streak, so maybe his Te hasn't really tamed his Si and Fi as much as it could.
2	As a young child (toddler up through pre-teen), I was awful.  Like "Surprised my mother didn't drown me in the bath tub" awful.\n\nBy the time I was a teenager, I was pretty well behaved.  Not to say I didn't have an occasional clash with authority, but I wasn't considered "rebellious" by any means.
1	I think as I have aged I have just become more disciplined on making sure things get done. 
6	[Academic] Perceptions of Self and Intimacy (20-35yo)	Hey there, hope you don't mind me attempting to pick your brains for a minute - I got good participation levels from other MBTI groups so I thought I'd extend it to all groups and try to get a more representative sample. FYI - the study is not collecting personality type information.\n\nMy dissertation for my masters in psychology is looking into one possible explanation for avoidance behaviours in forming intimate relationships. If you are 20-35yo and keen to contribute to my study then you can do so by following the link below. Any questions give me a shout, also I'm happy to discuss and hear your thoughts on the subject off the record if you want! It should't take too long but you're free to stop at any point anyway. It may cause some emotional distress as it involves some self evaluation so if you experience any discomfort and would like some guidance please get in touch.\n\nI will leave the survey open until the end of this week.\n\nCheers! \n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/F3BXHWN
1	Goodluck with your research!\n\nOnly problem: The last page with the true or false questions seemed very repetitive and redundant. The entire page could basically be summarized by asking "Do you tend to avoid thinking about, dealing with, or confronting difficult situations in your day-to-day life?"
3	Weekly Thread: Who is your favourite non-immediate family member and why?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: Who is your favourite non-immediate family member (no SO, children, parents) and why?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
5	The strange hermit uncle who starts every reunion/gathering with "I know you all think you're the black sheep, but don't worry I'm here now."\n\nHe completely vanishes for years at a time, but shows up at important gatherings knowing every bit of gossip about the family. He's a complete recluse, but makes himself available when needed without being asked twice.
4	One of my cousins - he's a supposed INTJ. I get along with him really well because we're both straightforward and quiet. We're also pretty close in age (21 and 30 - all my other cousins are in their 40s and older). My non-immediate family is filled with extroverts who are very argumentative, which isn't really my thing. Our conversations are initially awkward small talk, but it gets better with time. Also, that's probably the only interaction we both get at family gatherings anyway.
4	My uncle.  He's usually got something funny to say, he's always got something to teach you if you pay attention, and he let me drive his Massey Ferguson 1100 tractor when I was 6.
1	One of my favourite family members is my cousin. He's a textbook extrovert - you can't go out with him without bumping into at least one person that he knows. But he talks very gently and always has a new place to show me when I visit. And I don't think I'm the only person in my family who thinks he's easy to talk to - he seems to know every family secret!
1	I guess it would be my uncle. He is a bit socially awkward (not nearly as much as me though) but very funny. But we aren't really close together, I speak to him like once in a year if not less.
2	MBTI Discord server	We have been working on this server for almost a year now, and at the moment we are staying at the 100+ members. We want to branch out, and that's why we're posting this. You're all welcome, even if you don't know your type. https://discord.gg/csDt8Jg
14	My Struggle with American Small Talk	
5	Other ISTJs exhibiting strong Fi in their 30's?	I've been having trouble typing myself lately because I feel very comfortable and interested in people but this has only developed with the help of psychotherapy over the last 5 years.\n\nIn an MBTI meetup, they typed me as an ExFx type. But I do feel the ISTJ does best describe how I've lived my life up to this point. But I also feel like I no longer fit the "emotionally awkward/detatched" description that often come with ISTJs.\n\nSo this all has me wondering if it's just my personality working hard on the Fi that has me so confused about my type these days.
0	yes
6	Se in an ISTJ	
7	ISTJ to INFJ-A	When I first took the test (on 16 Personalities) years ago, I was an ISTJ. I could relate *so well* with this result, and have stuck with it all these years.    \nI just took the same test again today, and am now an INFJ-A! Generally, I do agree with the result...but here are my doubts:    \n>Advocates find it easy to make connections with others, and have a talent for warm, sensitive language, speaking in human terms, rather than with pure logic and fact. It makes sense that their friends and colleagues will come to think of them as quiet Extraverted types...    \n    \nI'm a socially inept potato.    \n    \nOtherwise, I do really relate to the summary results. A nice way of wrapping things up, I felt the [conclusion](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-conclusion) fit to a tee.    \n    \nThe first time I took this test vs. now, a lot of occurrences have happened. Developmentally, as well, I've become quite a different version of myself. Seems that could be the likely reasons behind my personality type change?    \n    \n*(Going to check out the INFJ-A subs now...but I'm still way too attached to this type and sub to leave it) (づ ¯ ³¯) づ  (¯ ▽ ¯) ノ *\n
5	Do realize that the tests are shit. I consistently score with ISTJ or INTJ but I do not have enough knowledge of the stacks to type myself. I do not recognize myself in the INTJ thing with their constant plans. \n\nBut in time one will change, this is inevitable. Even a stagnate person will change because of his experiences so with my limited knowledge it could be possible. 
2	I find, the [results](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/c703063d1e7ad) interesting and fitting...for the most part (e.g. "Introversion vs Extroversion), but other quality measurements are definitely something new for me to think about.
2	Aren't​ the types descriptors more of a guideline and less of a strict bar to meet?
2	Never go infj.
2	Check out cognitive functions, theory does not work that way. A/T is exclusive to 16personalities
1	>I'm a socially inept potato. \n\nMe too!  High five!!!
7	Hello! I'm an ENFP with a friend who is an ISTJ	We get along rather well, most of the time i end up having to fill the silence but i really enjoy his company he is very insightful and very pleasant to be around. Do any ISTJ's who have friendships with ENFP's help explain what it's like from your viewpoint? \n\nI'm really interested because we were laughing about how our personalities are literal complete opposites but we still oddly yet fit together without much friction\n\nIf you could I'd love to hear some stories!
8	> most of the time i end up having to fill the silence\n\n....\n\n....\n\n....\n\n....\n\nI know I'm not the only one...
4	I have a couple enfp friends that aren't really too close. The times Im around then though can be tough for me sometimes. They are touchy feely, very loud and somewhat obnoxious, and honestly annoying sometimes. Most cases I'd rather just be alone than hang out with them, which is probably why we aren't closer friends.
3	I am ISTJ and my roommate is ENFP. I've known her for 8 years now. \nI feel the combination works because ISTJs are great listeners and ENFPs are great story tellers and they often like to be listened to. She is nice to hang around with in spite of us being different on a wide spectrum of things. You get to hear different view points on things and somethings are too emotionally rooted for my ISTJs brain. But I like to hear it nonetheless. \nHowever, it is hard for ISTJs to work with ENFPs. So I keep friendship and work separate. \nWhile sharing a room, situations may arise (due to the polarity of perspectives) that itch the ISTJs brain but I forgive easily, so it's quite harmonious(idk if that's an ISTJ thing or just me) .\n

2	ENFP male engaged to an ISTJ female. We just moved in together and are going to be married in August. :) Because we respect each other's thoughts and feelings and handle most of our challenges as a team, it works really great.\n\nShe has taught me to be more direct and committed to what I'm doing, and to I've had a lot of practice being able to communicate my emotions in a logical, easy-to-follow way. She's learned to be more flexible when things don't go as planned and to also be more receptive to her emotions as well as to others'.
2	Most of my best friendships are with ENFPs. I think we get along because we admire each others' strengths. 
1	I've had a couple of ENFP friends/colleagues. I judged them both negatively at first. I felt like they were "fake" because they were just so nice to everyone. One I ended up feeling close to and spending a lot of time with because she opened up to me about her childhood, etc. but this was almost always in the presence of another friend. Overall I don't feel like I got to know her very well. She has since moved so we've lost touch.\n\nThe other is my work neighbor but I never really feel/felt connected to her either. Again it's that seeming inability to have deep personal conversations. I share with her tons of personal stuff because I'm just an open person in general. She seems kind and receptive and acts in a caring, nonjudgmental way. But somehow I'm convinced that she is constantly judging me! 
1	Weekly Thread: What's your go-to karaoke song?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: What is your favourite song to sing, either at karaoke, at home, or in the shower even?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
4	Bohemian Rhapsody. I sang an a'cappella arrangement of this in my high school choir and then went on to study music in college. I'm a classically trained high soprano so I can sing all the blasting high parts (and sound pretty good). It's a crowd pleaser. 
3	Daydream Believer by the Monkees
3	I have quite a few go to songs when I'm chilling/ showering/ driving.\n\nBohemian Rhapsody, Killer Queen, Gangsters Paradise, Dancing Queen, Ob-la-di-la-da, Hotel California, Stayin Alive, Hooked on a feeling, never gonna give you up, thriller, more than a feeling, more than a woman, paint it black, rap god, livin on a prayer, somewhere beyond the sea, fly me to the moon, etc. \n\nI could go on and on. 
3	I don't generally sing around people.\n\nHowever, when I do pick up a guitar to fiddle around with it, I almost never put it down without butchering "Big City" by Merle Haggard.
2	I Want It That Way by the Backstreet Boys. I have no idea but once I sang it and people loved it so if my inhibitions are lowered enough to sing in public, that's the one.
2	Can't Help Falling in Love by Elvis Presley.\n\nMy Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion.\n\nEdelweiss from the Sound of Music.\n\nHm. I guess slow, emotional ballads are my thing.
2	I can't sing, but if someone plays Edge of Seventeen by Stevie Nicks, **I'm in**.    \nEDIT: Or Good Vibrations by the Beach Boys.
6	How to deal with a crush as an ISTJ	Hello everyone,\n\nI have a huge crush on this girl at my part-time job (at a restaurant(, but the issue is that we rarely talk to each other for two reasons:\n- We work at the same time about twice a month\n- She works in the dishes, while I work in the kitchen, and there are around 15-20 people working on one day. The only chance I have talking to her is when I personally bring dishes to the dishwashers (they are always with 4 people).\n\nI don't see her anywhere else than at work. The only chance I might have is at the annual party which our boss hosts, but that means I've to wait half a year and I might not even have a chance to talk to her then.\n\nSo really do not know what to do, should I just try to stop thinking about her or so I try and get all my courage into talking with her on the rare times that I see her,  which is a hard thing to do for an ISTJ, she is also very shy. Dating is also not really a thing for people of my age and in my country (17, Netherlands), so thats not an option.\n\nThis might be the first time in many years that I've developed a crush on someone, so I really have a feeling that I should at least try to make something out of it, but it's pretty complicated as you've might just read.\n\nAny advice? I will greatly appreciate it...\n\n\n\n
6	Maybe slip her a cute note on a napkin with your phone number? Or tell someone else who'll tell her that you're interested in her? Who cares if dating isn't done in the Netherlands -- is it really that hard to come up with a reason to get several people together to see a movie or show or something and make sure she is one of them? Good luck :)
2	What's your intentions here? if you don't clarify your intentions, then you will go no further, Its' impossible to do what's we can't even imagine.\n\nIf you want to be friends, then you can start from your common realities.\n\n If you work together, there must be things that you can both relate to, I don't know, start by making sentences like : "being here makes me feel X, because of Y" " this thing is X because of Y", " Can you believe this, yesterday this Customer/manager did this Thing" ... As you can see this can't possibly trigger her defence mechanims, and it will come out as neutral. Which is how things naturally start. Forget about movies/shows, where the guy brings flowers to a girl who don't even know the name. That's awkward, trust takes time.\n
1	So if dating isn't really an option for you then what's the end goal here? Like I can tell you to be all romantic and put yourself out there and find other times to talk to her but if you're too young to be dating what's the point? What's your question here?
6	Hot and Cold ISTJ/ISFJ Relationship	Insight would be nice, this issue has got me bothered to the point that I can't sleep. As a result I'm sorry if this is a little long. I'm an ISFJ in love with an ISTJ, and his signals are the absolute worst. I know ISTJs are not ones to admit feelings and are afraid to show any love, but he is so hot and so cold I can't figure out if there is something here or not. We dated for 2 months and broke up, honestly, over a misunderstanding. He thought I was pushing him to be my boyfriend when he wasn't ready, which I wasn't, so we mutually broke up. That doesn't stop us from being friends and playing video games a lot, and occasionally flirting. He rarely initiates conversation but replies quickly, and then will initiate if I don't talk to him for a few days with a random youtube video or something. He'll send me selfies and comment to me in passing how pretty I am, but in a round about way. For example he'll say I look like Sigrun Mercy from Overwatch (which I do) and five minutes later comment on how she's super pretty. He volunteers to do computer stuff for me all the time. I thought he liked me, then when I ask him about what we're doing a month or so ago he says something like we're super attracted to each other, we're great on paper, but he doesn't feel a spark. Fine, got the message, moving on. Fast forward to two weeks ago.\n\nTwo weeks ago we started flirting again pretty heavily, which I thought was odd if he turned me down. I was the initiator in that flirting, but an ISTJ would shut down my flirting if not interested, right? He then started initiating more conversation and suggesting we get together to do a variety of activities (movies, bar, gun range), then shoots me down when I ask for a time and date. I even asked him straight up at one point (cause you like directness... correct?) if my flirting with him was unwanted or overboard. He simply replies "nope" and acts like nothing happened.\n\nISTJs... am I dumb, does this guy not like me, or does he like me and is terrified? I feel like he doesn't like me but our friends are convinced that he does.
6	It's honestly tough to tell. It's possible that his desire is to be with you in a relationship, but his logical side is against it for some reason or another. This can manifest in several ways. For example, in my personal life, I was super attracted to this one girl who would flirt with me back. We could have had a great relationship, but my logical side kept me out of it for various reasons. One is that I thought she deserved better. Another was simple logistics. In the end, these were simple excuses, but I had shut down the relationship in my head and we never grew any closer.\n\nI don't know how else to help you, but don't blame yourself for not being able to tell what he really wants (even I don't know what I really want when it comes to feeling crap like this).
6	> He then started initiating more conversation and suggesting we get together to do a variety of activities (movies, bar, **gun range**), then shoots me down when I ask for a time and date.\n\nWait....  *He* suggested a **date** at the gun range, *you* are down for that and say "let's schedule it up!" and he nopes out?\n\nDate *me*.\n\nKidding, of course.\n\nYour boy either doesn't know what he wants, or he *does* know what he wants, but he's *scared* because it's *different*.  Or he's just a dick.\n\nI really don't know what to tell you.
3	Definitely some mixed signals... I'd say your feelings there are valid. It sounds like he might just be okay with how things are. If you need a clear and defined label then I'd let him know that.\n\nAs an ISTJ I love when people are direct and lay things out. I never take it personally, and in most cases worry instead that the person laying all out did so out of frustration or anger with me. I'd recommend doing that, laying out your position and asking for his. No expectations, just clarity. 
2	How positive are you that he is an ISTJ? We can be kind of odd and uncomfortable with really emotional and personal stuff, but the multiple self-contradictions you describe him engaging in are kind of odd.\n\nI am not quite sure what you mean when you say you were dating, but then broke up because you were pushing him to be your boyfriend too soon...? I am not the most familiar with the stages of a relationship though, so... :/\n\nAnyhow, the reads of this situation (assuming he is ISTJ) that make the most sense to me would be... (1) He is attracted to you enough to want to flirt and maybe have a relationship, but he doesn't see it going anywhere long-term (e.g., he has felt stronger attraction for others and could see himself being drawn away, or he is interested, but not completely excited by the notion) -- and he is afraid that if you guys became an item, he'd immediately be entangled in your feelings about the relationship, so if his feelings changed, it would be potentially hurtful to you; or (2) He isn't attracted to women in general and wants to casually flirt in a just-friends kind of way, without an expectation of a relationship?\n\nIt takes me a long time to warm up to flirting, and there are necessary conditions that have to be in place -- things that assure me they would not be investing in me exclusively, or that they have no reason to expect a long-term relationship with me (e.g., extreme distance, or they are a very warm/flirty person) -- or we'd have to be in a relationship. I wouldn't want to lead someone on by returning flirting if they could reasonably expect us to get together.\n\nI guess at this point, I feel mixed feelings. On the one hand, I almost want to say that you should be direct and ask him, "What the hell, dude?" But then, if he said there is no spark, then I am also not sure why you initiated flirting again...? Were you testing him, or was it just a natural development in the moment?\n\nWhat does it look like when he shoots you down when you try to solidify plans for the activities he suggested for you to do together? Like you say, "Sure! When?" and he is like, "Uh, I don't want to do that with you"?? I don't know about other ISTJs here, but I am usually extremely hesitant to invite people to anything -- I typically engage in a lot of activities alone, and am perfectly happy doing so, so already the multiple invitations seems weird, too, let alone changing his mind on them, as if he's just impulsively doing one thing and then another. Unless "shoots me down" means being ambivalent and unsure or flaky about actually solidifying plans...?\n\nAlso, what would it be like if you got into a relationship and then broke up 6 months later? Do you picture it being a relationship that would really hurt to lose, or could you see it being a casual thing that you could mourn pretty quickly and then move on from? If the latter, it might help him to know that.\n\nThat said, I am wondering whether he might be an ISTP or some other type that can look similar to ISTJ in the vibe that others might get, but that isn't an ISTJ. Some of what you describe makes him sound like his actions are kind of poorly thought-out, and loosely engaged in, in a way that I could imagine if someone had Ti-Se -- that more Se-based orientation to your immediate activities and interactions, and a sensing-type groundedness, but still with a clear thinking preference over feeling preference. But from everything I know and have read here on ISTJs and being one, if personal emotions are involved, we become 10000 times more careful -- we become even less impulsive, and the flexibility required to negotiate the relationship has us anxious, second-guessing, and more serious overall. For myself to be as casual and loose with someone as it sounds like he is being with you, I'd... I don't even know. 
1	> we're super attracted to each other\n\n> doesn't feel a spark\n\nCome again? \n\nThe only reason why my ISTJ used to shoot ideas down was because he had too many other things going on. I think you just need to get him to spill more info on what's going on in his life and mind. But if it's like pulling teeth, save your energy bc that's the sign of a poor communicator or poor communication (and you do not want that in a long term relationship that you intend to go somewhere serious).
1	Hi there! ISTJ female dating an ISFJ male.\n\nIt is hard to tell without being either of you guys. We're only outsiders but it seems like you guys have some communication issues. At the same time, ISTJs are generally blunt and direct but have problems with more personal matters so it's not completely surprising.\n\nThe best thing you can do is just...ask. I personally hate a lack of certainty, and for better or for worse, you're getting an answer, which is a lot better than always wondering.\n\nGood luck!
12	Do you guys micromanage?	I was on a conversation on an MBTI group, and a topic came up about micromanaging. After a bit of discussion, us few xxSx on the chat decided that we all tended to micromanage or prefered/feel more comfortable doing so. \n\nDo you do it?
16	I don't want to, but everyone else is so untrustworthy at following through that I am forced to (or I *feel* forced to anyways).\n\nIt's annoying- but it also makes me good at my job. I'm in charge of quality control.
11	Yes.  Otherwise, they won't do it right, or at all.
7	Yes, otherwise they won't do it right or anything at all. 
7	Yes.
6	I have to micromanage a coworker, and I hate it.  He's been there longer than I have, but he can't seem to learn the most basic tasks required of him, and he can't seem to stay focused on them.  I'm constantly having to remind him that he's not paid to stare at his hands or to solve random math problems that pop into his head.  And he considers every correction, no matter how politely it's presented, as a personal attack on him.\n\nHe is technically my subordinate, and I would fire him, except that I have no authority to do so, and even if I did, he's the owner's son, and we all know how that would go.
3	I absolutely *hate* having to, but unfortunately people can be unreliable.
3	Micromanaging is *precisely* what makes you great.
2	I tend to micromanage myself a lot but this sometimes bleeds into micromanaging others. 
2	I dont like being micro managed and i dont like micro managing people but some people i work with are incompetent and literally force me to micro manage them.
2	Only when I have to, which is hard because I have control freak tendancies! I match my management style to the staff member in question. I have 3 direct reports at the moment, one is experienced/competent/reliable so no micromanaging required, one is quite new to the role so needs more assistance and guidance but not micromanagement per se and will be similar to the first over time. The third needs more of a stepping out of each next part of the process which I suppose is micro management but necessary for this person to achieve outcomes. It's reeeeeeaaaallyyy frustrating having to watch someone do each step of a process over a week that would take me two hours to do myself but that's part of my job so I nod and smile and make it work so everyone is happy and my bills get paid.... Edit: typos
1	Yeah.  It's something I'm trying to work on.
1	Yes I done it a few times, but by experience I learned that it could work against you. What I mean by that is that you lose effficency by micromanaging and it can be make the experience of working a lot worse, theres also the part that certain people are able to work really well if you give them a chance, you just need to give them good instructions from the start.
4	Need Some Advice...	Hello everyone,\n\nLong story short, I need some advice on a few things. Some back story: my girlfriend and I just recently moved and are currently staying with one of her family friends for the summer. The woman we are staying with is very nice and personable however I can't shake the feeling I'm unwelcome there, even though everyone has reassured me I am. I also start a simple host/cashier job at a (very busy) local restaurant and, I know it's stupid, but I'm really nervous about it. I've worked box office before so that part doesn't bother me and is easy enough, but I'm really nervous to be working a register, I've never done before. Any tips? \n\nThanks everyone. Please feel free to ask any questions as well. 
3	Ah! I once worked as a cashier and it personally wasn't the job for me. Sure, I liked that it seemed repetitive and systematic, but some customers weren't the best. You can't really avoid those kinds of horrible people. \n\nAt the same time, it definitely does get better with practice and time. The cashier operations weren't difficult - it was dealing with people. Don't be too hard on yourself.\n\nGood luck!
1	Can't speak to the living situation. Are there reasons you feel unwanted? Is it possible there could be tension with the woman and your girlfriend?\n\nFor the job, that's how I am when shifting jobs. Even when I started working for Activision to get paid to play call of duty and find bugs, I was super nervous. I think it's normal for everyone but I think it's part of our dislike of change that is so primal we can't let it go completely. You'll be fine. And if it's busy there your days will likely go by quickly.\n\nI worked fast food for 5 years and while I'd never want to go back, it was a great experience and I got to meet some really interesting people. It's also where I learned how to fake extroversion, which I've found is crucial for moving up within most companies.\n\nGood luck!
4	Weekly Thread: We're in 1918. What is your dream job?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what would your ideal job have been if you were living in 1918? (Or around this time, not accounting for the fact that a lot of us would have been conscripted for WWI)\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
7	Anything not in a trench. 
4	I would have liked to work at a printing press, I think it would have been an interesting place 
3	Considering my race, maybe farming.
2	Maybe carpentry. Currently a carpenter for the internet. 
2	My country was not in the war but dealing with the aftermath of a revolution. So maybe a war head.
2	It would probably be blacksmith, carpenter, or builder
2	Was kinda thinking about this lately since I've been watching https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGreatWar quite a lot. My dream job would be a zeppelin pilot.
2	Pilot
2	A Hello Girl, but as a guy, directing the communicational flow would be tops. 
2	I think the phenomenon of a "dream job" is mostly an outgrowth of the 70's and 80's; and an obsession of the millennial generation.  Before that, a job was just something to pay the bills, and nothing more.
11	Weekly Thread: When is the last time you cried?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: when did you last cry or shed a tear, and why? Tears induced from non-emotional means (cutting onions, sand in eyes, yawning etc.) don't count unless no one posts.\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
5	I'm slowly losing the ability to cry or just growing up and am less affected by things. Last time I cried was November 2016 when my mom was in the ICU. 
4	I finished the ending of The Walking Dead: The Telltale Game on August the 14th of this last year. It made me cry. I balled like a baby. First time in almost 2-3 years. \n\nThe time before that it was June the 22nd of 2014. I had come to the realization that the thing that was preventing me from being happy was my family and that I needed to cut them out of my life in order to do that.\n\nBefore that it was October of 2013. The dog that I grew up with died of cancer at the age of 7. It was such bullshit.
4	last year, I was failing my education and ran the risk of getting kicked out because of poor grades. and all my coach could say was that it was kinda sad this was happening but there wasn't really anything that could be done. this was halfway the year. \n\nI followed a course about how to study and I was shy of 1 point before getting kicked out, by a miracle I made it and since then I have passed every exam in one go!
4	In the past 13 years I have cried 3 times, once 13 years ago when my grandpa died, another a few years ago from stress overload, and another where I cried in Church for no reason. \n\nI would like to say 13 years ago but that wouldn't be true. I don't know how, but I killed my capacity to be fully sensible and I hate it. I think most of my past problems could have been resolved easily of I had the ability to cry, but no, I was stuck with anxiety and depression for years, not being able to stopped me from growing the way I would have liked to, specially since I just finished highschool. I have thought about it, but I refuse to go to a psychologist. \n\nSorry this turned to a rant, nobody cares but I wanted to express it. 
3	Yesterday. I'm pregnant haha. 
4	Back in 2008 when my grandfather died, but I usually go a bit teary here and there in certain situations. Always trying to actively suppress it though.
3	Last month, 1 year prior to that, like a previous comment mentioned I'm also crying waaaaaaaaay less overall. Generally when I was young I showed it, then teenage years I did in private, now it's just fuck everything.
4	Last summer when my dog passed away.
4	In my younger days I rarely cried. I was very good at controlling my emotions, especially in front of others. Having kids ruined me. I swear I cry at the littlest things now (usually horrible things happening to children in the news). It drives me crazy!\n\nNote: I'm female.
3	A few months ago when we had to have a dog put down because he had throat cancer.\n\nBefore that, it was about a year or so, when we had a dog pass away in his sleep (he was 18 years old, so...).\n\nBefore that, it was a couple of years when we had a dog put down because she had abdominal cancer.\n\nBefore that, mid to late 2008, whenever it was I watched I Am Legend.  Because a scene in the movie reminded me of the fact that we had to put yet another dog down in May of 2008.\n\nThere's a pattern there.\n\nMy Grandmama died in 2003.  I was sad, but didn't cry.\n\nMy Paw Paw passed when I was in high school.  Again, sad, no tears.
3	I can't remember, besides a few tears of joy after getting my final CPA exam score back telling me I ended a three year personal hell.
3	Last time I got a little teary-eyed was maybe a month ago while listening to one of Mahler's Symphonies.\n\nLast time I legit cried was maybe around Valentine's Day while watching sad videos on YouTube (those foreign life insurance commercials or anything with puppies...those are the worst).
2	Can't even remember, probably when I got fired at my first part-time job as a 13 year old. Also, I didn't have any family members or pets passing away.
2	Can't even remember, probably when I got fired at my first part-time job as a 13 year old. Also, I didn't have any family members or pets passing away.
2	I love how steady you guys are at controlling your emotions and what you're affected by, I find it really interesting. Or basically how you experience these things differently. \n\nI just teared up a bit watching TV an hour ago and had full on tears when my car broke down last weekend because it felt like the universe betrayed me. Though, I mostly keep that sadness to myself when I experience it. 
2	I used to cry maybe once a year or less. But the last 6 months I'd say maybe I cry a few times a week. Quite the dramatic shift, I know aha
2	January. Forced it out as an experiment. Results: not easy to do but possible
5	Asperger's Syndrome in an ISTJ	So there's someone close to me with Asperger's who I also just found out is an ISTJ. She had all the symptoms as a child and adolescent, but in adulthood she's worked really hard to behave as a neurotypical person would and now mostly just has aggression and anxiety. For the longest time I thought that Asperger's accounted for her other personality quirks, but I now think they might be typical of the ISTJ type. I just don't know. For example, if anyone is ever a minute late for an appointment, it can send her into a fit of rage and anxiety so intense you'd think something truly terrible happened. Also, she has a lot of trouble empathizing and expressing compassion (even trouble knowing and expressing her own emotional reasoning), or understanding where other people are coming from emotionally or in terms of a personal value system. She is fixated on a particular view of the world, with very rigid morality based partly on conventional morality, partly on a few subjective experiences (that must be tertiary Fi?) and partly on things that people she respects have told her. She seems unable to come up with an original moral structure to live by, has no internal compass. Not to say she is immoral--quite the opposite--just that there's no flexibility at all to her beliefs. As an INFP this confuses me, because refining my ideals and tuning my moral compass is a full-time occupation for me. This frustrates her to no end, of course, because change is extremely frustrating to her (maybe the hardest thing for her to cope with). Anyway, is in-the-moment moral reasoning and empathy a struggle for all ISTJs?
8	Not to the degree you're describing. I would suggest hanging out in /r/aspergers for a while -- for autistic individuals, changes in routine, and certain types of sensory input can be extremely anxiety-inducing. Imagine if the second someone was late, a thousand spiders covered your body and started crawling under your clothes and into your orifices -- you'd become extremely upset too, I would think! That is how I imagine it being -- a sense of anxiety and stimulation that is so overwhelming and intense that it might make you want to scream, run, thrash about, etc, hence the choice of metaphor. Different individuals will have different sensitivities (or hypo-sensitivities), so it won't always be the same things that get negative reactions from different autistic folk, but what you describe is certainly within the range of what I've read about.\n\nAutistics also can have difficulty with learning/forming broad or general concepts based on limited information. This is part of why they can be such detail-oriented, black-and-white thinkers -- though it can also mean a great deal of rigor and expertise in subjects which they specialize in. However, extremely context-sensitive and variable things like social rules can still remain difficult, and a lot of autistics describe following rules (based on observing others, or based on feedback from others) in order to fit in or seem normal. The idea that these rules can change depending on the exact composition of people around you, the exact nature of your relationship with and to those people (which can change day to day depending on what has been going on, as well as gradually over time), the setting you are in, the number and type of uninvolved people around you, the activities you're engaged in, and the time of year... just to name a few things... Unless those interactions themselves become a special interest, the autistic individual is going to need to find ways to cope with the world when they will inherently struggle to navigate the unspoken nuance of social interactions and expectations.\n\nNow, I could see an argument for some overlap between stereotypical traits of someone with aspergers, and someone who has an ISTJ personality (for whom there are equally reductive stereotypes out there). However, just like any other group of individuals, different ISTJ individuals have different things they care more or less about -- the themes are more in the broad content/patterns of behavior (for instance, I'd have a hard time believing a healthy ISTJ was emotionally dramatic and expressive around wide ranges of people for long segments of their day, outside of a career that provides a setting and structure for that kind of emotionality, or a end-of-life kind of opening/freedom reaction). However, not all of us care about timeliness as much, not all of us are neat freaks as much -- we all have Te so we'll have tendencies to be organized, but will organize and order different things depending on what we care about.\n\nAt the same time, individuals with Aspergers can also have personalities that range outside of what is stereotypically described -- not all are the reserved, aloof, hyper-logical characters displayed on TV. In fact, if you search for "active but odd" as a grouping, there are entire groups of individuals with autism who desperately want to connect and interact with others, who are extroverted and emotional, and who are fun-loving and friendly -- yet still in the context of significant social deficits and sensory/environmental sensitivities that can produce angry, anxious, fight-or-flight, hard-to-understand behavior at times. \n\nI would say that individuals with Aspergers are probably more likely to get certain types over others depending on the tests they take (especially to the extent those tests also are assessing social fluency and skill) -- however, I think the broader idea of the MBTI is more useful if we step away from the limitations of the tests (whose accuracy depends on the person meeting certain assumptions when answering those questions), and instead use it to think about how a person of any of the 16 types might be if they also were autistic. Autism is clearly *something*, and so are the types, so there are going to be some patterns and overlap among all autistics, or among all people with a certain personality type... But those patterns can be really embellished upon or altered by other aspects of the person's identity, and I think the more we can multiply these different understandings with each other, the more we can begin to arrive at a complex and nuanced, yet respectful and accurate, sense of human diversity and behavior.\n\nI hope that helps and gets at some of your questions!\n\nTo directly answer the ones you ended with... For me, moral reasoning is difficult because of how the appropriateness of behavior changes depending on the amount of power individuals in that situation hold, on the potential for harm and help, on the issues of boundaries and responsibility, on the difference between what is ideal, what is possible in the circumstance, and whether it is more moral to do your best, or to stand up for what is right... etc, etc. When it comes to empathy, I think it is not real empathy if it is too incomplete or too unwilling to take different emotions or people as subjects of that empathy... but I don't find that to be the case when I look at how empathy is portrayed by society. Society seems to suggest that the suffering deserve empathy, but those who are guarded or lashing out do not deserve it -- instead, they are supposed to deserve contempt and judgment because the belief is that if we risk empathizing with them, then we will endorse and allow their behavior (which doesn't have to be true). \n\nBut that is where I struggle with empathy, is that it can be hard to empathize with the emotions without getting wrapped up in the beliefs and judgments of that person -- it is possible, and I think that is the answer, just to stick with the emotions -- but I don't know that people always feel that as empathy? I tend to avoid interacting with a lot of people though, and I have been looking into possible Aspergers myself, not diagnosed, not sure I meet criteria either, but I might not be the best "just an ISTJ" response nonetheless!
4	I am an ISTJ that pretended to be ENFP for a long time	I am 22 years old and for the past two years I've been pretending to be something similiar to an enfp.\n\nI've been locked in my room for most of my growing up by myself. Because I was totally terrified of society because of my parents, school, whatever.. I've been playing a lot of video games and been pretty good at it.\n\nThen I became 18, here were forced to join the army, and boy what a ride that was. After that ended I really felt lonely and scared as fuck, I wasn't as interesting in gaming anymore, no job, and didn't want to start learning anything yet. Most of all I felt like I had a lot to learn...  so I spent the past 2 years around 2 now very close best friends that have introduced me to a lot of people and experiences! They're both INFPs btw and I felt like they really helped me develop my feeling and sensitivity.\n\nThose experiences and adventures made me develop this weird personality where I am super nice and interested in everything and I am super jumpy and laughs about everything. Not that it's not real but its usually over the top exaggerated. No one knows this because they think thats just how I am. I told you guys, I can do ENFP so well I tested myself on MBTi, I discovered the test around 4 months ago and did it a couple of times. I would get ENFP and would relate with it for the most party.\n\nNONE of this felt fake or unreal to me, I felt honest, I was kind of fooled by myself.\n\nThen a bunch of stuff happened, I basically realized I was conforming to society. I was not putting all of myself out there. And even if I was I was still not being real to me but to this character I created.\n\nThis has taught me how to be an extrovert, and also develop my feelings and sensitivity, social tact empathy A LOT MORe!! It's been a heck of a ride.\nNOW I am learning to let go and just be me. I do not need to please anyone. I am enough. With all my weirdness and introversy. \n\nI tried to sum it up and cover most parts, hey AMA!\n
1	Thanks for sharing your interesting experience.\n\nINFP here, and I'm on the same spectrum of cognitive functions as you. (You are Si-Te-Fi-Ne while I am Fi-Ne-Si-Te). I have the idea/theory that when you have the same functions of different types, you can emulate them pretty well because you're made of the same stuff. (So you and me share the cognitive functions of INFP, ENFP, ISTJ, ESTJ). But what I find is that being in one of our other personas for a period of time certainly not sustainable in the long run.\n\nI can go into ESTJ mode where I assert myself in making ends-justify-the-means judgments about the world around me (Te/Extraverted thinking) without considering anything else, and I feel like I'm inside-out and will inevitably crash and burn. (And unfortunately, the world we live in and the type of work in many situations make me put on this hat a lot more than I'd like.)\n\nI can go into ISTJ mode when it comes to curating my hobbies and sorting through my memories/previous experiences (Si/introverted sensing), and I can keep this up for quite a long time; at least more than ESTJ mode.\n\nI can go into ENFP mode where I'm focusing on the here and now and have a "throw spaghetti against the wall" approach to exploring the world around me and generating ideas. I've been working at a restaurant as a server recently and I can keep this up for hours at a time because I grew up with an older brother and close friends who were extraverted intuitive dominants (ENTPs), so that has given me a lot of creative exercise in my formative years.\n\nAnd my INFP mode...  focusing on Fi/introverted feeling (aka sitting in my mind and musing about what is important to me and who I'm becoming)... that's a lifelong thing that I just naturally do without thinking about it.\n\ntl;dr - when we share cognitive functions with other types, arguably those other personalities are smaller parts of who we are to different degrees. But we must make sure not to stay in those states for too long lest we burn out.\n\nHow was the routine of military service for you?
2	Stability?	So, I don't know if I'm growing up or something, but lately I've seen a serious need for stability in my life, maybe because I'm suffering from the consequences of not having much of it. Also have some issues with depression and incredibly fucking unhealthy Fi (already hated myself for 3 years of my life but it's starting to affect others around me because I'm becoming selfish, resentful and doing dumb shit like not talking to some guy who was in love with me because I upset him for 5 minutes and I felt like shit about that). But don't mind that, I'll be going to therapy next month. But for now, general stuff!\n\nBeing an ENFP, I'm guessing it's time for me to develop Te and Si. Since you guys are naturals at these two functions, I thought I'd ask here. I think my Te is doing somewhat alright, getting the highest possible marks in my classes and all, so I don't have any problems with procrastination I guess. I get done what I feel I need to. Buut\n\nI've noticed the STJs in my life just seem to have everything under control naturally, they try not to get emotionally attached to things they know can break/be lost and they don't even feel bad about it, they have an actual routine to how they live their lives which they follow to a T, and the only time I've ever seen them distressed is when the routine they've catered to themselves cannot be followed, or when they're dealing with something new, something they don't understand and haven't planned for.\n\nThis is something that seems wonderful to me after living the opposite kind of life. I know this stuff will never come naturally to me, but surely it is something I can develop, at least?\n\nThe little idealist in me wants to find an ISTJ partner who will help me grow in this aspect, maybe I'll love him so much that even the thought of breaking a routine between would be unfathomable to me because it would hurt him, and that practice would aid me in developing my own routines. Maybe his cold rational nature could help soothe the emotional chaos in my head so I would stop getting hurt over silly things, silly events, silly people. But of course, that's a load of crap and it's completely implausible, and I know I'm completely alone if I want to make anything better, especially for myself. Not only that, it would be incredibly unfair to just drag someone else into my mess just because I'm having trouble fixing it. But... I dunno. Lemme know where you guys tend to hang out, maybe? Probably a horrible idea until I get therapy and get my shit together.\n\nBut anyway, getting to the actual point, do you guys have any tips or pointers at all for developing these two functions? Anything that could help a young and really dumb ENFP with the issues that I have? Where do I find you guys once I get better and can have something meaningful that benefits both of us?\nThanks!
4	no I don't have actual advise to developing these two functions, I havent nearly done enough research to truly type myself, the shitty tests mostly say I am ISTJ with one INTJ, so here I am.\n\nbut I do have tips for generating order in your life:\n\n1. make a to do list every morning, it can include anything you want from brushing teeth, to asking Jake out to prom.\n\n2. start meditating, this helps alot with awereness and living in the moment as I understand it, I've been trying to introduce it in my routine but I am not really disciplined and I forget. mind you meditation doesn't have to be sitting still for a period of time minding your breathing. something like yoga can also function as meditation.\n\n3. learn what is in your power and what isn't, you can't change what people say, merely how you respond, same with emotions.\n\n4. start thinking positively, fake it till you make it. life gets alot better when you don't think your a piece of shit and a manborn maggot, I've been there and sometimes i'm still there.\n\n5. write down your feelings if you want, this helped me during my depression\n\n6. be completely honest to your therapist, it really saves alot of time and he/she will be really able to help you. enough people go to therapy and waste it by not telling the complete truth. even if you don't know why you feel like shit just say so.\n\ngood luck going to therapy! it is hard and for a time you will probably feel even worse but it will get better in my experience!

Based in your post, I'm guessing "like crap."\n\nHow about when you get everything sorted out and decide you no longer need your ISTJ crutch?  Will you kick him/her to the curb?  Can you live with them hating you for that?  Or worse (better?) yet, shrugging, saying they're glad you're better, and wishing you well?  How will you feel about that?\n\nAll that said, **you know** that you need to get yourself together, and your plan to see a therapist is a good one.\n\nI'm sure folks around here will be happy to help you if/when we can, but as I said, I think you're already on the right track.  You've recognized the problem and you're going to seek professional help for it.  That is a good thing.\n\nFeel free to come back and ask questions (preferably more specific ones) or just update us with how you're doing (or, you know, don't, because it's none of our business unless you want it to be). 
2	It's been a long week so I won't dig into each of your statements but I'll address 2.\n\nFirst off, yes a STJ will likely help you but putting that on someone else isn't going to do anything for you, as you said. You need to make the change yourself and you need to really want it.\n\nSecond, and this is dangerous to do willy-nilly so you need to be extremely careful if you attempt it, use your emotional connection to influence your actions. If you're late, think of the people who are waiting. You're telling them that their time isn't valuable to you by showing up late. Don't take this and best the shit out of yourself over it, that would be counterproductive. Instead, use the emotions to reinforce the behavior you want to produce.\n\nAnd make lists and rewards. If you do something for 30 days it can become habit. So make a habit out of it and reward yourself for the hard work.\n\nIn my experience, NFPs struggle more than most with time management. The "secret" for me is that I just want order that damn much. If I want it bad enough, I'll get it and make it happen.
2	Anyone here disillusioned himself to be ENFP only to later realize their ISTJ nature?	It's difficult to explain but because social conditioning, traumas, mistakes, and the your twisted way you thought things are... you turned ENFP, or lived as ENFP for a long time. \n\nBut not a normal healthy ENFP, kind of an emotionally unstable very TWISTED type of enfp. One that other ENFPS kind of understood but at the same time felt very weird about...\n\n\nAND SUDDENLY I REALIZE.. I AM ISTJ.
3	You should take a step back and try to learn about each function in order to determine your type. I have a feeling you are going off of descriptions which can be very vague 
2	It sounds like you've got a lot of stuff going on... behaving in a way literally completely opposite of your natural born temperament sounds like a reaction to trauma. I'd really recommend you see a therapist or minimally explore more about the function stacks. Idk, I'm not a professional but an ISTJ masquerading as an emotionally unstable twisted ENFP doesn't seem normal or healthy.
2	I'll never understand why people try to "type" themselves. Just take a quiz or two, and trust the algorithm. I took a quiz for college 10 years ago, and took another, similar quiz again maybe 8 years later, and got the same result both times, so there's no uncertainty about my personality type.\n\nI've also only ever read the descriptions of one or two of the other types, and only after my friends took the quiz and told me what type they got. It helped me understand their point of view and way of thinking a little better.
2	I think the MBTI makes the most sense thinking of function axes -- people who are on the Si-Ne axis, for instance, seem qualitatively different to me than people on the Ni-Se axis. Likewise, people on the Ti-Fe axis seem very different from people on the Fi-Te axis.\n\nIn the same line of thought, I think there are a lot of similarities within quadra (groupings that share both function axes). On the outside, an ISTJ and INTJ may seem similar -- both may show an obvious use of Te, and have a tendency towards ordering their environment and activities in an externally logical way. Both may also have a kind of personal ethos and emotional core that is hidden under the surface, and somewhat sensitive and perhaps even outside awareness most of the time.\n\nHowever, the Ni-Se versus Si-Ne can make a huuuge difference in some ways -- for instance, the way the environment is discussed, parceled into bits of meaning, etc. Or how ideas are formed and shared, and what is recognized as adequate proof or description and what is insufficient or excessive.\n\nIn those ways -- ways that I think many MBTI users care about (beyond just being able to describe the surface-level behavior of others) -- I think ISTJs and ENFPs are more similar. Or at least, they will get along and get on with each other better, even if the ENFP is visibly more scattered or idea-based and the ISTJ is more grounded. They're similar enough in their ways of being that it is extremely easy to reason yourself as one or the other -- "I'm a grounded and order-obsessed ENFP due to experiences" or "I'm a scattered, disorganized, impulsive ISTJ, due to experiences" -- whereas with other types, there would be more likely to be a breakdown in understanding, I think.\n\nThat is part of why I like Socionics though -- I think there are other ways you can divvy up the types to come up with new and fresh insights, and Socionics is much more complete in its pursuit of those different angles. (Wikisocion.org is a good source -- or at least one I tend to go to as a first shot. You might find their insights and descriptions useful. We're ISTps there, because we lead with a perceiving function, Si. (In my experience, using the J/P last letter MBTI style is best for describing external behavior -- for instance, my Te is going to be more obvious to others than my Si -- but the j/p Socionics style is best for describing internal behavior -- for instance, my Si, and the generally non-judging orientation of perceiving functions, are more characteristic of my internal experience than a judging function like Te, or Ti for that matter.)\n\nAhem, anyhow, I hope some of this infodump was relevant/useful. For myself, I knew F was not that high in my stack in a millionty years, but I mistyped as INTP and then ENTP for a long time!
1	not to be mean but aren't they complete opposites?\n\nabout the mistakes: dude everybody makes them, don't beat yourself up about them, we all do and it's pretty much pointless. thinking I fucked this up doesn't fix the fuckup.\n\nmaybe get therapy if you find yourself thinking like that alot, it can ruin your selfesteem and life in the long run! and I'm talking from experience and fuck society and her expectations.
1	Maybe you're neither, maybe you are still mistyping yourself. Maybe you just seem weird to other people because you don't think like most people. You don't know, it could be that you're messed up in your thinking, or you could just be an abnormal person. There's no reason to worry about it.
1	Maybe you are an ENFP, but a lot of stress has really brought out your ISTJ shadow side and so you're quite familiar with acting like an ISTJ? From what I've seen of my unhealthy INFP dad who can be very ESTJish when he's upset, he's like unhealthy (depressed, broody) INFP 50% of the time, unhealthy (explosive, critical) ESTJ 20% of the time, and normal (not healthy, just tolerable) INFP 30% of the time. 
1	LOL! I know an ESTP who thought he was INFJ for many years; an ESFJ who was trying to be INTJ and later INTP; three more ESFJs who think they are INFJs. And an INTP who tried to be and live as an ENFP because an MBTI 'professional' told him that's his type - fun times!!!    \n    \nENFPs and ISTJs are [dual types](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Duality) in socionics i.e. they basically have same cognitive functions ordered in reverse, making them be two sides of the same type, so sometimes ISTJs and ENFPs may feeeeel like each other and may mistype on the tests. I think this is also what happened with the ESTP guy, since INFJ is the dual type of ESTP.
9	Initial communication with ISTJ? Need dating advice!	Hi everyone,\n\nI'm an INFJ woman who just started texting with an ISTJ guy, whom I was introduced via mutual friends. We actually have not met yet, he got my number and reached out, and we've been texting about every other day for about two weeks.\n\nDue to both of our work, we haven't found a time to meet yet, but we plan to meet in exactly one week.\n\nI'm a bit confused yet curious about the way this ISTJ texts. He's consistent in that he'll answer all my questions pretty promptly, within 2-4 hours, which is pretty good for his job, which doesn't allow him to be on the phone much (medical residency, working 70+ hours/week).\n\nWhat I find puzzling is that he doesn't really ask any personal questions, or the "getting to know" questions. He does ask what my schedule is like probably because he's trying to figure out a time to meet. But there's very little "warmth" in the texts, meaning no joking around or asking friendly questions or asking about me, the person. Questions he asks are like, when do you get off, when does your graduate program end, etc. As a woman, I do get tired of coming up with more "fun" questions sometimes... and I'm also more used to the man initiating most questions :/ I guess I'm a bit conventional. \n\nDo you relate? Is this pretty normal for ISTJs?\n\nIs.. he interested? lol.\n\nI have some ISTJ family members who are very, very straight-foward in their texts, asking and answering only practical questions. Is this more of a personality thing or a non-interested man thing?\n\nThanks in advance! haha
17	If he responds he's interested.\n\nISTJ's are known for being like the least fun ever. \n\nWe don't find small talk fun, and you really can't get to know someone over text.\n\nMe personally, I need less than five minutes with someone in person before i can sense a vibe of if it's worthwhile or not.\n\nWe just like to get right down to business. Not sex. But, like the game plan. \n\nPRACTICAL IS OUR MIDDLE NAME\n\nAn ISTJ might be way too mundane and boring for you. And where I'm from, residents don't have time to date.... They don't have time to sleep.\n\nI hope he graduates soon. Good luck!
8	ISTJs are often considered bland or boring by people who don't know us, and more importantly, people we don't know well enough to be comfortable with. \n\nA few years ago, I read a thread on a forum where someone had asked how ISTJs flirted. The most consistent answer (other than "they don't") was that an ISTJ doesn't start to flirt until they are already in a relationship. \n\nBe patient and give him time to get comfortable around you.  Once he's there, he'll start joking around and flirting with you.
6	If he texts personal questions, then he'll run out of interesting questions for when you finally meet.
5	I met my ISTJ on tinder so we texted too before we met. He also responded really quickly, and I also felt like our conversation was a little bland. But when we met, I realized that he's actually really cool and interesting - but only to people he likes. Anyway, I'd recommend meeting him because you're probably not going to get a super accurate understanding of him over text. I mean, I've known my ISTJ a year now and he still texts boring sometimes haha

2	Sounds normal, I can almost see myself in that. It usually takes a long time for me to warm up to someone. I only start to joke around here and there and I even flirt a little if I'm certain it's safe to do so and there is a good opportunity. So there may be his natural risk aversion kicking in. You may need to show him what you are comfortable with, and actually spend time doing something with him, otherwise there is not much ground for him to walk on. Prompt responses does not necessarily mean there is interest, but it's still a very good sign. I say give it a chance, you will see in a week.
2	As someone who's been with an ISTJ for almost 2 years, the bland and generally practical texting is part of the package. Don't expect it to change. Occasionally mine can be sweet and send cute lovey emojis (get him to use Bitmoji, it will be your friend), that's the extent of mixing it up for him though. He is worlds different from the ENFJ who used to court me, who asked lots of open ended questions, spent a lot of time texting, tried to impress me with cleverness and wit, etc. My ISTJ will never be like that ENFJ, but I chose him nevertheless. 
2	YMMV, but I generally don't ask questions like that via text.  If I'm going to have the 'getting to know you' conversation, it's better for that to be in person.
2	If he is finding time to text you despite being really pressed for time, I'd say that is a good sign! I tend to feel like I don't have enough time in the universe, and that people are uncertain and unreliable, so even the people I really care about don't always get a lot of time from me...\n\nAs for the texting, my reaction to your post is, "There are personal getting to know you questions? Is there a list? Where can I get it?"\n\nLike most here, I need lots of time to warm up to someone -- though the occasional unguarded personality can get me to open up faster, sometimes. Not necessarily meaning it ends better, just that sometimes I can feel.... sort of in the periphery of an enthusiastic person's presence in a way that makes me feel like there is no chance of offending them, because they don't really care that much what I do. Sometimes I can open up faster then, too.\n\nBut when it comes to personal stuff, there are so many different preferences people have, so many different ways to make assumptions that can offend, and without facial expression and tone, you have no way to gauge it and it seems so dry and functional for something that I actually do want to be more personal and something that can be a connection. If I am learning about your life, your family, your interests -- I am not going to gaze at my phone with interest while you type... I'm going to do something else and then when you message, I'll read it, and then I'll have the information... but it just doesn't feel like connecting that way, not in the same sense.\n\nI can have long and personal conversations via text, but it takes more words, and often I get excited by the ideas and go off and lose the conversation, so it's just a different kind of going wrong.\n\nIn person though, they're telling you in real time, and you're listening to them, you can jump in with questions, you can ask them to clarify, you can ask clarifying questions with just a couple of words and tone of voice that would come off just cold and rude via text. There are just way too many landmines via texting, and without nonverbals, you're going in completely blind, which is awful if you want to actually get to know someone more personally -- more personal stuff is where the landmines *are*.
2	INFJ in a so far very happy, healthy relationship with an ISTJ here (together about a year and a half, so not that long, but solid and good in so many ways)\n\n>What I find puzzling is that he doesn't really ask any personal questions, or the "getting to know" questions\n\nNot unusual IMO.\n\n> He does ask what my schedule is like probably because he's trying to figure out a time to meet. \n\nI would think that that *is* his way of being warm at this point in your interactions.  \n\nMeaning: If he wants to spend time with you, that would be a way for him to be warm. I had a huge learning moment with my ISTJ some months into our relationship in which I learned that for her, spending time together just doing things together  is a form of intimacy. For me, previously, that would have coded as a *distraction* from intimacy. It's actually quite beautiful to see and experience a different form of intimacy.\n\n> But there's very little "warmth" in the texts, meaning no joking around or asking friendly questions or asking about me, the person. Questions he asks are like, when do you get off, when does your graduate program end, etc. \n\nAlso normal IME. This is his way of gathering details about your life and getting to know you. It is about you, the person, just in a different way than you would expect or are used to.\n\nAnd I would also say, don't underestimate what an ISTJ can learn through observation and information gathering! Not that long into our relationship, my ISTJ gave me a birthday gift, a pretty deep and resonating speculative fiction book, that was actually near perfect for my tastes. I was floored. I mean, we had lots more conversation than it seems like you and the ISTJ you're texting with are. But to get me enough to see the combination of elements and depth of that book as connected to my reading desires  ... yeah, don't underestimate what an ISTJ can figure out with their info gathering. And if you two get together in person, that info gathering will be happening even more intensely.\n\n>Is.. he interested?\n\nIf you want to know something about where an ISTJ is coming from, ask - and ask directly and clearly. You will get an honest, clear, no games and no hidden implications answer. One of my many favorite things about ISTJs.
2	My istj doesn't ask much personal qns. Seldom the 'how's your day' kind of small talk. He did do lot's statements about what he observed during the day etc. At first I felt like he wasn't really interested in wanting to know about me. Then agai  it isn't like convos are 1-sided.. He reads my inputs and adds on etc..  Sometimes when he starts asking those straight forward person qns , it's cos he's  running out of steam and fishing for topics to keep talking to me. This happens both over text and in person. Haha. Takes alittle getting use to but when they start on something, the way they get animated talking about the subject, it's kinda cute..
1	Seems pretty normal to me. He is prob interested in you since he spent a lot of time texting you and trying to meet up.
1	Texting is the worst way to get to know someone!!! Stop texting him. 
1	I'll tell you this.. I just recently discovered I am ISTJ, and I can totally understand why he text like that. How old are you?\n\nThe best way to say it we don't get flirt and we don't have fun up until after we talk to a person and get the general vibe, and then once he gets our approval we can begin to become comfortable and even flirt.\n\nNow the real interesting thing is that in order for us to grow we need to engage that side of us, those fears. we need to learn to have fun, to let go.
5	Weekly Thread: Who is a Historical Figure You Admire? (Credit to u/Jesta96X)	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: who is a historical figure that you admire? \n\nThanks to /u/Jesta96X for this question! Hope we start getting more user-submitted questions for our weekly thread!\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
2	Nikola Tesla. He was a great inventor, and he had so many great concepts that never came to fruition (although they could have)! For example, the wireless electricity tower. It's basically like a cell phone tower, but for electricity. You can read about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardenclyffe_Tower) to learn more. He is my favorite scientist. 
2	I have quite a number of favourites, but one that springs to mind is Fela Kuti. I don't agree with a lot of things he did (he was pretty misogynistic, for one thing, and when he contracted HIV he refused treatment and eventually died of AIDS), but man, oh man. Someone once said that if the story of Fela's life was a Hollywood plotline, nobody in the audience would believe it.\n\nHe invented afrobeat while his highlife (basically, pop) band was touring the US. They were there illegally *and didn't even know*, because their manager didn't tell them they were never granted work permits. While in the US he was also introduced to the Black Power movement by the Black Panthers - who didn't know that anything they had to say was news to him; they assumed he already agreed with him because he was from Nigeria.\n\nHe engaged in lifelong resistance to the militaristic Nigerian government, to the extent that he almost-inadvertently established a semi-autonomous zone at his compound/nightclub, with its own rules and laws. Eventually he refused to perform any songs which he'd recorded; single live songs would be hour-long, semi-improvised pieces with audience participation and a ritual element derived from his interest in traditional Yoruba religion (he was raised Christian but later came to believe that Christianity was white people bullshit and an oppressive colonial tool, and I'm pretty sure that's his exact phrasing).\n\nAt one stage, the police raided his compound in retaliation for [a song that criticised the police military](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj5x6pbJMyU). His mother was killed in the raid, and Fela himself was beaten severely. The entire government, police and military denied any involvement in the raid; Fela responded by [delivering his mother's coffin to the head of state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q021-VyLzpk). Throughout his life he was arrested over 200 times, and his compound was repeatedly destroyed by the government and reestablished by him.\n\nHe was incredibly intelligent and perceptive too. His father sent him to London to study medicine at university, and he took up music instead; but from his writings and speeches you'd almost expect him to have had a Masters in sociology or politics (except he didn't use impenetrable academic jargon).
1	[Arthur Wellesley, for beating Napoleon and especially how he did it, by being smart and nullifying the biggest strengths of Napoleon's army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington)\n\nMarcus Aurelius: solely because of Meditations, it really made an impression on me. and it had some passages that really spoke to me. \n\n[Miyamoto Musashi because he won a lot of duels. the whole samurai culture I find interesting but I'll be honest. I did not understand the book of five rings at all.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi)\n\n

8	Let's talk about resumes	How do you other ISTJ's describe yourself for example in resumes and LinkedIn pages, i.e. more professional environment?\n\nI'm currently working on my master's thesis and simultaenously looking for job opportunities starting in a month or two but I'm constantly put off by the "requirement" of the talkative and energetic team player who can connect with people instantly and is able to throw themselves to the new environment and befriend every member in the whole organization in the first week.\n\nHow should I communicate my introverted nature and skills so that I don't feel like lying in my applications and resume? I'm by no means a stranger to team work (and I quite enjoy, up to a point), but I'm still quite uncertain how to describe my, let's say stereotypical, ISTJ qualities and not oversell any personal features that I don't have. I'm hoping to not use my MBTI type, since I'm afraid it might put some people off or be completely unknown to some people.
3	What kind of jobs are you looking at? This will strongly impact how to go about writing about yourself.\n\nUnless it's a job that specifically needs that type of personality, like a sales job or something that is often interacting with people, I would just forget about including extro/introversion pieces.\n\nTalk about your dedication to the project and willingness to go above and beyond for the team. Speak to your desire to make everything as effecient as possible.\n\nI've "learned" how to be extroverted so maybe I'm out of touch on this but my experience has been that people care less about that. So long as you're willing to work with the team and get shit done, people don't tend to care if you're the most introverted and socially awkward person in the world.
3	List your group projects as examples of how you worked with a team.\n\nie - Worked with a team of 3 multidisciplinary students to produce design for mobile application.  Led 4 member team to finals of academic contest.\n\nThat way they know you can work with a group and can ask questions or you can bring it up when answering their question.\n\nYou can also list individual projects to let them know you are comfortable tackling something on your own.\n\nIn the end, if you can do the work, but don't have 'friends' there, you will still be successful in their eyes. 
2	I don't have advice, but I'm the same, see the words "energetic" and "friendly" and I click away hahaha....:(
2	As someone else said, unless you're applying to a job in sales, you don't need to put anything explicit about how charismatic you are on your resume. You list all of your experiences that show charisma, you list awards for those skills, and then you let your references and your interview be the time for your 'soft' skills to shine. IMO resumes are for showing experience and expertise, and the references/interviews are for showing personality. You will also tend to use your cover letter for addressing those kinds of criteria, since it's not so awkward to do when you get to use proper sentences and paragraphs. \n\nNever put your MBTI type on a resume
1	I'm horrible at writing about myself yet the industry I'm in relies more than just words. So I make an online portfolio and sometimes you get trial days as well as interviews. \n\nResumes in themselves I try to keep consistent, short and simple. All I do is use a template and identify words that describe me in a acurate and professional manner. 
2	Finals!!	I'm curious... what do you do two weeks before finals week!? And how do you study for your finals? I have heard all kinds from people who go through every subject and others who never actually study at all , tell me what kind are you!
8	I don't​ ever actually study, just on the rare occasion where I think the exam is going to be very difficult. \n\nWhat I do is, a day before the exam (sometimes with more preparation) I take out my notes (or my book) and read through them, reinforcing concepts I already know, or if it is something I am lacking I practice it for a few minutes. It usually lasts for about half an hour. 
2	It depends on the class. For calc 3 I just reworked a shit ton of problems from the units we did, but for biochem I reread the textbook and wrote summaries of each chapter on notebook paper and re-read that. 
1	I start making summaries of the subjects for the exams. I always say to my self that I'll start with that in the first week, usually I start at the 5th week which usually is two to three weeks before exams. \n\nI'll look these summaries over every day untill the exam, then i put tabs in my lawbooks so I know where to look. and I make all the homework!\n\nI find that this method works best for me vs studying the day before. it also helps that these snippets that I learned just randomly surface to my mind during the day.
1	I normally study quite hard and end up with mostly A's, and one or two B's/C's.  I mostly just rewrite and reread notes. 
1	I just do practice/past exams, usually in the dedicated study week. There isn't enough time to start any earlier than that, and doing any study which is not practice exams is largely a waste of time.
1	Math is an exception, for that I will typically take a pretest and make sure I understand everything.\n\nEverything else... I listen in class and take notes. I do the assignments but I don't study. I've always gotten As and Bs. The only time I got less was my AP classes in highschool​. You had to read the book for those tests and I didn't. I got by with Cs because the teachers graded on a curve and we all sucked. \n\nMy secret is I have a partially photographic/videographic memory. 
1	I don't really study a lot, maybe 1-2 hours barely is spent reading my notes before the exam.
6	I've taken many tests and always found myself as INTJ, which matched me perfectly. However, for work I had to take the official (CPP) test and it returned ISTJ. The description they gave matched me more than INTJ. What am I?	As above. I've always found myself to be a "big picture" guy, and I tend to care more about the general idea of things as opposed to specific details. But, when I see something for the first time, I also tend to notice the smaller details in my initial thoughts. I really have no idea if this puts me in the S or N camp. How do I tell? Happy to provide more details if necessary.
6	I'm confused.  If the description of ISTJ matched you better than the description of INTJ, how could the INTJ description match you "perfectly"?
2	I was confused about where I fell too. I got INTJ, ISTP and ISTJ. I looked at the cognitive function theory and the stacks and that helped me identify myself as ISTJ. I just seem to have a little more access to my Intuition.
1	It's fairly normal to vary on certain criteria. Most people are borderline in at least one category. I'm actually opposite of you. I've gotten ISTJ on official testing but have gotten INTJ in others. If you're borderline results could vary from mood alone. 
1	INFJ in a relationship with an ISTJ here and a good friend who's ISFJ, so I have *some* experience with Ni-dom versus Si-dom (still learning, though). \n\n>I've always found myself to be a "big picture" guy\n\nWhat does "big picture" mean to you - can you give an example or two from your life to illustrate?\n\n>But, when I see something for the first time, I also tend to notice the smaller details in my initial thoughts\n\nAgain, could you give an example or two from your life of how this works for you?\n\n(hoping I can maybe be of some use...)\n\n\n
1	https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/637fh5/differentiating_istj_vs_intj_masterpost/
1	Me too and I recently have been vigorous with typing and testing all over after serious consideration ofy type. \n\nI'm definitely I_TJ. Several testing sites showed a close gap between my percentage on S and N. Whenever the S/N like questions or typing charts show up I always am in the middle. \n\nFor you, it would help if you knew what specific functions you're not sure of.\n\nSadly some testing sites show bias towards diagnosing intuitives over sensors. If you check out the MBTI subreddit they give links to recommended testing sites. 
9	Anyone watch A Man Named Ove?	Ove is an istj to the core. This movie is hilarious and heartfelt. The istj I watched it with was like, "Oh my gosh I feel like this guy." and kept exclaiming that as we watched it. He laughed to tears often so of course I had to share it with you guys (: Here's a link to the trailer: https://youtu.be/g0Xh5Ryxmmk 
3	I saw it at a small local theatre, I loved it!
3	It's also a book.
2	haven't watched it yet but I think I will!
2	Yes!!  I saw it in theatre a couple weeks ago and loved it!  When I saw the trailer I totally identified with him and was all 'Ove man, I feel ya' so then I had to go see it.  
1	it was hilarious! and recognisable although I wouldn't be so stukc up  about rules like the family using their car to move stuff during their move.
1	Yes! I saw it two months ago. Loved it. Now I can't wait to read the book.
7	Weekly Thread: Who is a celebrity that you admire?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: who is a celebrity (in any field!) that you admire?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
7	Chris Pratt is hard to beat for me right now.  He's funny and seems really humble.  He does lots of charity work with sick kids and multiple times on his Instagram and in interviews he gives thanks to God.  Just seems like a good ole guy that loves hunting, fishing, his family, and America.  His snapchats are pretty funny too.
7	Keanu Reeves. I consistently hear good things about him whether it be charity work or just being a pleasant​guy. I respect that he remains genuine even though he has money and fame to spare.
5	Elon Musk, but everyone loves him so I feel like that doesn't count. Honorable mentions include Anthony Hopkins and other celebrities/characters I can't think of while I'm at work. 
5	Edward Snowden is my favourite by far but I'm not 100% sure he counts as a celebrity
3	Venus and Serena Williams.  I have admired them since I was a kid.  
3	Michio Kaku and Elon Musk. Kaku is just a really cool scientist and Musk is a man of many talents who is focusing on what society should be focusing on. Also, Tom Hanks (pretty self explanatory) and Tom Hiddleston because he's just so classy.\n
2	Ryan Reynolds: dude is fucking hot and his characters always make me laugh, I'm hetero but would be gay for him!\n\nElon Musk: I enjoy his go get mentality.[ but I hear he pays his workers shit so that's a huge dissapointment.\n\nare historical people allowed? maybe that's an idea for next week!\n\n
1	How to talk to your ISTP parent about your mental health	**sorry for the typo in the headline, it should be named"ISTJ parent" \n\nI'm 27F, ENFP and I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD. I want to tell my ISTJ mother about it, not only because I want her to know about it, but also for the reason being that she probably has ADHD herself and I want her to get some testing done herself.\n\nMy only problem in this situation is that she immediately shuts down when I start talking about _anything_ mental health related and she always shuts it done with the annoying "This is only made up for economic reasons, you can get your life together just by getting your shit together" argument.\nI have studied Psychology myself for several years and I have only recently found out about ADHD in myself, because symptoms and behaviors differ a lot in women with ADHD compared to men. I learned a lot about those in the last few weeks and I am in the process of finding the right combination of therapy and medication. But since I got my diagnosis I managed a lot better and I saw so many improvements in all the life areas I struggled a lot with previously: time management, University exams, keeping a job for more than a few months, organization and household chores, remembering things, and even simple things as getting shopping groceries done...\n\nI thought about giving her a copy of my psychologist's five pages testing and diagnosis summary, but I am not sure that this might \nbe of any help. I have come some neuroscience studies about ADHD from this year, which show that ADHD patient's brains are in fact different than in non-ADHD people... Maybe that would help to convince her? Facts and statistics? \n\nI'm so emotional about this topic, because I've seen my mum struggle a lot and a lot of her weird behavior (obsessive tendencies, emotional dysregulation, not being able to listen to me for longer than 10 seconds, losing a lot of keys/phones/wallets/you name it, struggling with studying for her language classes, struggling in her programming job, etc.) all seem to make sense to me now after doing a lot of research about ADHD in women per se.\n\nSorry for the rambling, I hope I got my point across somehow.\n\n**TL;DR**\nHow would you go about trying to explain to an ISTJ parent that you have a mental health disorder yourself and that you think your ISTJ parent might have it as well?
6	I wouldn't. I have a few mental health diagnoses, a few of which I'm sure would also fit either of my parents, but I'm never going to mention it. I don't live at home anymore, they're not in any way involved in the upkeep of my mental health, and it's none of their business. There's no reason for them to know, and they haven't expressed any suffering from their own mental health issues. They're adults, and if they want help then they can get it on their own. I have no right to try to diagnose or even suggest diagnoses to other people unless they explicitly ask me to, and it would be incredibly rude to do otherwise. 
2	Show an ISTJ the benefit of something new (in this case, getting treated for ADHD) by being living proof that it works. It's better if there were "hard" evidence, like an official paper trail with figures, as opposed to soft evidence like your own personal testimony. Even as difficult as that is, it's hard to tell people they aren't so good at handling something utterly on their own, especially ISTJs who are known for priding themselves on self-sufficiency. My ISTJ's ISTJ grandmother is 90-something and still refuses to give up driving, and she has severe OCD but it's kinda too late to have her see the error of her ways.
7	Do ISTJs have trouble with variable schedules?	My work schedule has a "base" routine, but things change, whether it's being on call or working outside the usual hours. This causes me some stress, and I'm wondering if ISTJs don't do so well with variable, uncertain schedules?\n\nFor example, I'd like to sign up for certain recurring activities like sports or classes. Because of my somewhat uncertain work schedule I am guaranteed to not be able to show up sometimes, and I hate this. I find better luck with one-time or short-commitment activities.\n\nI think I might actually prefer not to sign up for extracurricular activities at all than sign up and miss some practices, classes, and whatever else. I hate being unreliable. If I say I'm going to be somewhere then I'm going to be there.\n\nWhat do you think? Do any other ISTJs identify with this? If you do have uncertain schedules, how do you deal with it?\n\nEDIT: I should mention that I do leave room for some spontaneity. For example, deciding 30 minutes before to go see a movie, or something similar.
4	I like predictability as well -- I am less concerned with being unreliable (if the class is large enough, the instructor may not even notice I'm not there, for instance), than with missing out. I want to have the complete information, and I can't fully compensate for missing a lecture (unless the instructor isn't good at instructing -- in that case, I'll care less about missing, but still go because the structure of attending a class is still superior to my attempting to read the textbook on my own, with enough regularity, and clear enough boundaries that I knew when to start/stop, and was able to efficiently get through it).\n\nFor me, it is more about the predictability of control. When will I have control and freedom over my schedule and activities, and when will I not? And if my schedule is variable, and I only know a little in advance, then there is a global loss of control over my activities, because I have to always yield to the possibility that on a given day, I will have to work.\n\nHowever, if it is the middle of the summer and I am in college, for instance, I don't mind having full control over my schedule and doing different things at different times each day. Or at least, I don't consciously mind.\n\nI don't know if this is an ISTJ thing or not -- but for me, if I don't consciously impose and enforce structure, I tend not to have it. As one example, if I make no efforts in either direction and have no outside obligations, I can easily sleep my way around the clock, essentially living out 28-30 hour days. It seems to me that some other people who are more flexible and who don't feel the need to impose structure are often also people who naturally possess some inborn structure to their lives and behaviors.
2	When I used to work in fast food, it was a horrible job that I couldn't stand but at least I had the same hours every single day, which was great. I started working at a different retail job with irregular hours, and even though I loved where I worked I was immensely stressed out by not having the same schedule ever day.
2	I think this is something we struggle with. I think it's a mix of reliability (you touched on this) and energy. When our schedules are consistent every day, we can anticipate energy drains and plan to store up more when needed. When our schedules are inconsistent then everything is random. We can plan a week or two out but any sort of recurring event becomes a question mark. That means we can't get into a rhythm and are constantly off our game.\n\nWhen I worked fast food, my schedule became very consistent. I found I had the most energy and best attitude during that time. Then my schedule shifted and would alternate fairly consistently. Even though the alternation became consistent, it was consistently changing enough that it'd start draining me. And if I ever forgot which week I was on, it could send me down a path of extreme exhaustion because I had planned incorrectly for the whole week.
1	I prefer a set schedule. \n\nI normally leave work at 2:30PM, but occasionally I need to stay a little longer. If I know in the morning time that I will need to stay later, then I can plan accordingly because I have 2 sons who play sports, go to school and have their places they need to be. \n\nIf I find out at 1:30 that I'm going to need to stay late, I get upset and irritated. It throws off my plans and I worry about not being able to do what I'm scheduled to do. \n\nTell me on a Wednesday that I need to work late on Friday and I'm fine with it. It gives me time to schedule, and I like to go by my schedule, even if it's not the same every day. 
1	I don't like changes in schedule, I always end up later a few times because of that

1	An istj I know likes this one: [Sonny and Cher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJoqe7LDPU8&index=8&list=PLmkei_XoZNHBJO81YrD98kWJKIyxTu_J2)
22	Do you have a compulsion to elaborate, explain, and/or justify? And is it generally (at least seemingly) unwelcome?	I was talking with an employee at a store (helping me pick out stuff, etc.) when I noticed towards the end of the interaction that she interrupted me right as I was about to start saying something. That, plus her one-word responses to earlier things I had said, made me come to the realization that she didn't give a single flying fuck about basically anything I had to say. \n\nI've noticed a similar theme in phone conversations with friends and family. There will be some (to me) significant nuance to something, and I try to start explaining that nuance, but I'm cut off, and am not given an opportunity to explain why the nuance is even important in the first place (they've already written it off as something they apparently wouldn't care about, even if they found out what it was). \n\nI'm starting to shift to a "they probably don't care" policy when it comes to these details. The thing that sucks is that, that sort of thing is pretty much the main thing that gets me talking in the first place. 
9	That happens to me as well. I usually think that I'm providing context for the actual meat of my explanation, but I end up boring them. I have learned to pretty much just stop talking to most people unless it's absolutely necessary. I don't like overwhelming people, but I do tend to do that when explaining something. The whole "not talking" kinda drives away prospective friends as much as the over-talking, so I kinda just suck at socializing.\n\nI don't think the whole "just don't talk" policy is a good option, but I do understand where you're coming from.
6	Absolutely. It's quite simple why I need to explain everything... oh hang on, I'm doing it again.\n\nYes. My coworker asks me a simple question, long explanation of why (if they walk off, I often keep going in my own head).\n\nPartner asks which spelling of a word is correct, and I'll go into rules of grammar.\n\nBoss tell me I messed up, and I'll stupidly explain why my method is correct.
7	So much this.  I've learned to just shut up, drop it, when someone's eye-contact bounces.  That's when they've stopped listening.\n\nThere is so much background in my mind for what I say, it seems important to give some of that context.  Really, no one cares.\n\nKind of like "energy and mass are related by E=mc^2".  Why is that so?  Oh, that would be a lot of physics, mentally tl;dr.  But the bottom line, the thumbnail?  Easy peasy.\n\nOh, and most people just don't care about much beyond themselves anyway.  They're not listening, they're just waiting until you stop making noise so they can talk.  You can see that moment in their body language too.  They may start listening, but usually only until their mind says, "Ah, now I have something to say!", and from that moment on they're only waiting until you stop.\n\nDo you find it frustrating when you ask someone to explain further, and they have nothing behind what they said?  Pretty much no one ever asks me to "explain further", because they know I can and will!
3	Trying to control this issue myself! Storytelling is an art, and trying to figure out what information to include and what to leave out is tricky. I've ruined many a good conversations by over-explaining something. 
3	Yes! And sometimes I describe things in so much detail that the other person doesn't even understand what I'm actually trying to say.  Lol
2	Does this cutting off response apply to both sensor and intuitive listeners? Do intuitives tend to cut you off more often than sensors or does it not matter?
2	I use too, but I have learned to just shut my mouth and move on to something else. It just isnt worth creating an argument over. 
2	Based on your responses, the only conclusion I can draw from all this is that I should stick to forums, and just keep quiet IRL for my own good.
2	I do this. Sending emails at work has helped me tone it down a bit.\n\nI got shoved into a lead position and had to create a bunch of processes. This meant sending A LOT of emails. Especially since my bosses are hard to get ahold of. One boss approached me and said "I'm not going to read your novels anymore." Another employee said I needed a TL;DR for my emails.\n\nI've gotten into a habit of re-reading emails a few times and cutting out what I can see is "fluff" to other people. It seems to be going well. It's also improved my filtering in verbal conversations.
1	I can do this too - i think the trouble is that we seem like know-it-alls to people, which may trigger insecurities or just general frustration at how nothing can ever be simple with us. I think the key thing to work on is providing information in not just an engaging fashion, but also realising when it is actually appropriate or necessary. Sometimes i think it would be better if we just held our tongue 
1	I have never related to a post so much. Especially the last bit of "that sort of thing is pretty much the main thing that gets me talking in the first place".\n\nIt's definitely how I go about most conversations and unfortunately, most people don't enjoy it. Having social anxiety on top of this is very odd, and very annoying. 
7	Weekly Thread (1 year anniversary!): What are your summer plans?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what do you have planned for the summer? Camping, travelling, playing a league, catching up on reading, learning a new skill, video game marathons?\n\nP.S. We've now had a full year of weekly threads! Thank you to everyone who has commented and contributed over the past year, it's been a pretty successful project and I hope it'll get even better in the years to come!\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
4	[deleted]
3	Mostly work, with maybe a week off around August. And I want to go to the beach at least once, I haven't been to the sea in almost three years.
3	Work and relaxing are my goals. After a year of studying for Mechanical Engineering, I need the break.
3	Taking two classes: one that is for my internship (we present our findings and interview our higher-ups etc), and one that is a synthesis course.\n\nAlso doing an internship at a community health center. Will be working in quality improvement.\n\n[sidenote: boyfriend visiting from the UK for a couple of months so that's cool]
3	Im planning on getting a summer work. Those video games aren't gonna pay for themselves. \n\nIf not, probably going camping a lot. 
3	My wife and are going to Nashville (driving from PA) for a week to spend time with some friends she actually met online (one we did visit last year in Arizona). We're still deciding if we want to attend a Game of Thrones con that is happening while we are down there. \n\n
3	Getting mentally healthy
2	Nothing. :( I'm pretty lame and do off season vacations. 
2	I get out of college on May 5, and my brother gets out of school June 10. In between then, I will likely play video games. Including skyrim, fallout 4, gta online, terraria, kerbal space program, and pokemon go. In mid June we're going to drive to Cape Cod and stay for a week and a half (driving from NC). After that, ill probably just play video games and go to the pool for the rest of the summer.\n\nAlso, I can't believe it's been one year already! This was a great idea u/Rawtoast24
2	I have two weeks off in May to go on a road trip with a former exchange student friend. Outside of that it's winter here, so mostly I'll just be working, watching movies, and catching up on my reading. I might finish Witcher 2 and make a start on something else, but I'm not so interested in games lately.
2	Get a new job
1	I'm doing a spring/summer semester with all online/evening courses.  So between those and working my full time job... not a whole hell of a lot.  My family goes to a music festival every August long weekend though, so there's that to look forward to. 
1	Is this the mind of an E5 ISTJ?	I have been trying to guess the MBTI type and Enneagram of a very interesting character from a short story I have read.  His name is Louis.  My guesses for his type so far are ISTJ, INTP, INTJ, and INFP.  I am even more unsure of his Enneagram type.  At the moment I'm guessing he's either a core 5 or has a strong five-wing, considering he is quite cerebral and has a penchant for technology, science fiction, health, frugality, and astronomy.  My best guess is 5w6, but I could definitely be wrong.\n\nBelow are screenshots of pages from the novel with highlighted text:\n\nhttp://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e237/marllon89/Untitled_zpst2doajtn.png\n\nhttp://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e237/marllon89/Untitled2_zpsckny1qmp.png\n\nhttp://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e237/marllon89/Untitled3_zpswz2e5eog.png\n\nhttp://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e237/marllon89/Untitled4_zpsrn9gbvyh.png
2	For what it is worth, I'm am E5, and I identified with the character, at least with respect to turning his argument against himself. It wasn't an unflattering portrait though so I'm not sure others wouldn't equally identify with him.\n\nNot as much with the imagined rat conversation. I hold random fictional arguments with others in my imagination sometimes when I'm bored and half-occupied, but not imagined social scenes. \n\nI think without really seeing rats in my environment that often it seems too fanciful to go that far. That and I'm in a smaller city and not around people that much so maybe social dynamics aren't part of my thinking as much. I do find myself wondering about the experience of some animals though, like the lone goose in a grassy patch between sidewalks -- I protect a kind of felt character onto it.
1	E5 ISTJ?
21	i love my ISTJ to death	As an ENTP, it seemed (and still could seem) a pretty unlikely thing on the compatibility side of it all.  But.  How we never argue in a disrespectful way.  How we both defer to each others' strengths.  And how loyal she is, unwavering like lava.  She grounds me, and she flies me like a kite.  I appreciate your type quite a bit.
5	INFJ reporting in to second most of this in my case. Except I don't love her to death since that would defeat the purpose :)\n\nAnyway, yes to this in my relationship also:\n\n>How we never argue in a disrespectful way. How we both defer to each others' strengths. And how loyal she is, unwavering like lava. She grounds me,
3	I'm an ISTJ with an ENTP, and I love my ENTP :) I do a good job of grounding him. And he makes me laugh. So it's good :)
2	[deleted]
1	I (f) am with an ENTP (m). It's a fun relationship. 
7	Political views?	Anyone else here extremely libertarian-minded?
12	I was libertarian until I saw the world with the eyes of an adult. Corporations and the people who pilot them are highly sociopathic, so the ideals of libertarianism kind of break down. Libertarianism is predicated on a sort of naively optimistic idea of human nature - that we won't be abusive to one another and that we'll respect boundaries. The bottom line is that without rules, regulations, and structure, we do great evil to one another. I don't know if there's a perfect system, but "laissez-faire" anything flies in the face of reason and all of humanity's talent. We should always strive to engineer a more ideal system.
4	My general bias is towards libertarian, but I don't actively participate in politics.
5	I'm a libertarian-minded free-market anarchist.
5	Constitutional libertarian: Feds only have a few enumerated powers and the rest is up to the states
3	Im a moderate left leaning person, but then I again, I almost never get involved in politics. 
3	To be honest, I don't even know anymore.\n\nhttp://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_libertarianism.html\n\nDeontological libertarianism sounds okay out of these. I've always considered myself a left-leaning moderate who sometimes agrees with libertarianism.\n\nFor the recent US presidential election, I agreed mostly with Sanders but thought he was too radical and thought Clinton was a decent option minus her foreign policy/intervention ideas.\n\nPolitics is exhausting and draining because I *want* to know more about it, but it's difficult to know where to start and it seems to make people upset (myself included).
2	Right wing here
1	I've always been primarily left, with maybe a couple views that lean right. 
1	Libertarian, but with the issue of UBI in the future, libertarianism is unfeasible. \n\nSo now I'll vote Democrat above all else as they are the entity most likely to promote the idea of UBI. 
1	I thought I was pretty moderate, but after the election I've found that I'm skewing left a lot more than right. 
1	Communist here, specifically Maoist-Third-Worldist
6	What are typical actions of an ISTJ?	
19	Muttering about the incompetence of coworkers/people in general.  I've graduated from 'are you serious' to 'oh for fuck sakes'... it's been a long work month. 
12	Retracing things. Life is full of a multitude of experiences, but what I find is that it isn't just a comfort zone thing - I am always repeating certain experiences to know them on a deeper level. To fully understand what to expect, and then, to slightly alter course. Behaviors and interests do change over time, but it's through deliberate repetition such that things get completely ingrained. So "our things" are known on an unconscious level.\n\nNovelty for its own sake isn't interesting to me. My life advances when the things that are specifically relevant to my situation and my understanding improve. My small world is what matters.
11	Like /u/Spekter1754 said, retracing steps is a big thing. I constantly analyze everything I do, see, or experience. My goal is understanding and knowledge. I seek novelty because it grants me new experiences and perspectives. I seek routine to improve what I have already done. 
7	Can you be more specific?\n\nActions vary a lot depending on the person, but one thing to look for is routine. Usually, I keep to my routine every day of every week. I dislike any sort of disruption.\n\nIf you want actions which pertain to relationships, I'm not your guy.
6	Breaking rules when the rules don't make sense.\n\nThis can be justified in many ways (my favourite justification is efficiency), but is often hypocritical in creating unwanted chaos and a new set of rules that doesn't include others. It also poses problems when one doesn't understand the reasons or perceive the implications of said rules.\n\nFor example: when driving, do you use your turn signal even when you're the only car on the road? What is the legal requirement? What are turn signals used for? Do signals *really* matter if no other cars are around? If not, why bother?
3	Avoiding useless things
2	Analyzing pretty much everything and everything. 
11	ISTJ's Wanted! Data needed for spreadsheet!	I'm making a spreadsheet to see if there's any connection between MBTI and Gardner Multiple Intelligences.

12	Anxiety?	In what ways do you deal with anxiety? Medication? Breathing exercises? Coloring book?
9	Therapy & medication.\n\nI also like coloring books, but I'd say my go-to ones are: music (playing & listening), long walks by myself, and reading/writing.
3	Meditation and B Vitamins
6	Exercise including lifting and cardio, meditation, playing with my cats, cooking, walking, mindset shift - actively thinking through the anxiety and deciding what I can and cannot control 
2	Therapy and mindfulness skills. Also medication. 
2	Distraction and avoidance!  I like doing the dishes, cleaning out the closet, or reorganizing the pantry when I feel anxious.   
2	Check out a guy called Wim Hof. He has discovered a breathing technique that is fucking amazing IMHO
2	a combo of breathing techniques and distraction. if I'm at home I distract myself with my cats, or I talk to my boyfriend about easy subjects that we can both agree on (ie: music, video games, etc.), nothing that will turn into a friendly debate because that will add stress and heighten anxiety for me. I also tend to re-read books coz I already know what will happen and it seems to calm me to some degree.
2	Trying to get my mind off it by doing housework, playing guitar, and of course, browsing Reddit. Not really anxiety per se, but I have been given medication for high blood pressure....not sure if that's an ISTJ thing or just something I struggle with in general. 
2	I used to struggle with anxiety a lot. I'd avoid lots of situations because of it. I feel it creep up from time to time but I've found diving into logic has helped a lot.\n\nI still typically play video games or clean if I get stressed, but recently I find myself getting irritated more than anxious, and  video games and cleaning help with that.\n\nFor anxiety, you'll probably find that a lot of it will be silly to you after the fact. So ask yourself a few questions the next time you get anxious.\n\n1. Why? What are you so anxious about. I don't mean the activity or the meeting or party or whatever, but what are you afraid will happen?\n\n2. Now that you've identified the root, ask yourself how big of a deal it really is. How likely is it? What if it does happen? Will it really have that much of an impact on anything? Will anyone else care?\n\n3. Finally, will it matter in a day, week, month, year, 5 years? If it won't matter outside of 5 years, it's definitely not worth spending that much energy on. If it will matter outside of 5 years, then follow everyone's advice for coping and maybe get professional help if anxiety is recurring.
3	Cutting out a lot of my carb and sugar intake helped take the edge off of my anxiety and mood swings. Look into keto or low carb/high fat diets if you're curious.
3	I want to understand my Dad more	Hey guys! I'm and INTP and my dad is an ISTJ. We get along famously. We're so close I thought he was an NT like me. But he's not, and according to test we're supposed to be at odds or something. I want to know more. Please help me!
6	Your dad is an individual, and being close to him you already understand him better than we do! If you have approaches he isn't open to or vice-versa we might be able to guess at why, but it already sounds like you're doing well as far as understanding him goes. Just talk to him, and all that jazz -- which I'm assuming you're doing already. Maybe talk about deeper things, if you don't already? Is there anything specific about him that you don't understand but would like to?\n\nIf you want to understand more about ISTJs in general you could read up on it here and elsewhere, keeping in mind (with the latter) that most descriptions of ISTJs are based on findings from surveys undertaken in the 50s and 60s, which means that some descriptions make us out to be more conservative than we really are.\n\nThanks for the refreshing thread though! With a title like that I expect a post like "my dad disagrees with my career choice?" "My dad doesn't like my partner as much as I like my partner" "Why do my parents give me chores? Can't they understand that Witcher 3 is more important to me?"
4	Weekly Thread: What sports do you enjoy playing or watching?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what sports do you play or spectate?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
3	Playing: Bowling\nWatching: NASCAR (& most other racing), hockey (Coyotes), baseball (D'backs)
2	Don't play. Favourite to watch is soccer; can also be dragged in for ice hockey (particularly the women's game), curling, many Olympic sports (at the Games or otherwise), and maybe baseball if the game is important enough. 
2	I don't play sports, but I enjoy the occasional 9-hole round of golf.\n\nAs for watching, hockey. Canes, Wild, and Bruins. I also enjoy watching the Olympics. And other odds and ends sports like motocross and trophy truck races.
2	Play in the shooting sports: USPSA (pistol only), IDPA (pistol only), and 3 Gun (rifle, pistol, and shotgun). I like the action shooting sports over more traditional ones like clays or target matches. A lot more problem solving, especially in USPSA and 3 Gun.\n\nWatch baseball, American football, a little GT1/GT2 and Moto GP, and of course all the highlights and match footage on You Tube of fellow competitors in the different shooting sports.\n
2	I'm not really into sports but if I had to choose, I'd choose swimming and badminton.\n\nAs for watching, I like watching basketball. Olympic gymnasts are also fascinating, since I have very little skill in balance and flexibility.
2	Hockey obviously. I wish I could play though.
2	Football (soccer) and cycling
2	Come chat about Personality Theory	Hey everyone! I'm from a Discord server focused around personality typology, emphasis on MBTI but with lots of talk about Jungian theory, socionics, and enneagram as well. We're over a year old, have a nice bot that does things for us like channel and role management, and would like to open the gates to newcomers so we can all have fun. What makes us different than most other Discord servers is that we're more focused on actual discussion and conversation with minimal shitposting (we keep that in the #nsfw channel). With that in mind, please join if you want to discuss Jungian theory, get people to try to figure out your type, want to debate the merits of Socionics vs MBTI, discuss the deeper meaning of your Enneagram, or just want to have a good talk.\n\nSee you there (:\n\nhttps://discord.gg/6xE4qMt\nEdit: If that link expires, use this one: https://discord.gg/ct8BRps
1	The invite is expired/invalid :(
7	Trying to reassure an ISTJ dad	ISTP here. So I like to wander around the country alone and for some reasons my dad doesn't like it because he is worried about me. But I don't understand why he is worried and his "worry" is wearing me out. One of the reasons I can think of is that he could be worried for my safety(seeing that I'm 18 y/o and all), but we live in a rather safe country(Our crime rate is one of the lowest in the world in fact.). So I don't see how/why he should be worried..... I have done this many times(Since I was 15 y/o, didn't tell him tho) and so far nothing has happened. I can't really think of anything to assure him and I'm growing very tired of him worrying about me. I wanna keep doing what I'm doing because I like exploring alone, its very relaxing and I can never get that kind of peace when I'm with someone else. What should I say to him so that he will stop worrying?
6	He's your dad, worry is often what they do. My parents are not ISTJ and they worry about me and I'm 31.
6	> What should I say to him so that he will stop worrying?\n\nCan't be done.  \n\nWhat you *can* do, however, is make a list of things you will do to help improve your safety while you engage in your walkabout.  I don't know the nature of your walkabout, but here are some random suggestions:\n\nCarry a backpack full of gear that will help you survive.  First aid kit, shelter (tent, sleeping bag, etc.), food, you get the idea.  Make a list of what's in the pack and show it to him.  Have him help you fill in the gaps.  Knowing you have the equipment to survive will give him peace of mind.\n\nMake sure he knows the area(s) you intend to wander around.  If you plan to stay in hotels, motels, hostels, crash on friends couches, whatever, give him a list of those places.  Knowing where you're at will give him peace of mind.\n\nAgree to scheduled check-ins if/when possible.  They don't have to be daily as long as they're regular.  Every other day, once a week, whatever.  As long as he knows he can expect a call form you on a particular day at a particular time.  If you agree to this, don't be late, and don't miss one.  Knowing you're still alive will give him peace of mind.\n\nBasically, approach it with something resembling a plan, and let him in on the plan.  ISTJs like plans.
2	Seconding what /u/securitysix noted -- essentially, get him to identify what his feared worst-case scenarios are, and then (within your own personal boundaries), do your best to prevent against those outcomes. Some other thoughts...\n\n**I think this comes to a difference in how Si-Ne and Ni-Se pay attention to the environment.** To my sense of things, Si-Ne takes some comfort in predicting and manipulating the environment. If you research what leads to the outcomes you want, and what leads to the outcomes you don't want, you have control. There's also satisfaction with understanding how it all fits together. It feels natural to Si-Ne to say, "I want to have sex, but I don't want to get a disease. So how can I tell if a potential partner might be sick, what prevention measures are reliable for preventing disease transmission, which are the worst and the most important to protect against, what kind of testing might help me be sure they are well before I have sex with them (or that we know what they have and the route of transmission so our sex acts can avoid transmission), ..." This can go on a while, depending on the person, and their interests and motivations. For myself (and I suspect many others), the understanding itself is rewarding, too, when it is an outcome I really do or don't want (or the combination -- wanting to do x, but not be at risk of y).\n\nI think Ni-Se takes more of this approach: "Hey, most bad outcomes are linked to things that *make sense*, and I am smart enough to avoid them. I am not going to try to steal a bear cub or take a nap on the ledge of a cliff. The risks that can't be predicted in this way are just... something you have to not worry about. It isn't worth not living your life just so you can be safe." Ni-Se seems to get more pleasure out of action, in the real and unpredictable world. There simply isn't a reward for staying back and researching risk factors beyond the obvious safety measures. (Is that fair/accurate?)\n\n**You're not going to be able to stop him from worrying, but what you can do, is [identify and communicate your boundaries](https://markmanson.net/boundaries).** You do not have to make him feel better. And if his worrying makes it impossible or unpleasant to interact with him, you don't have to talk to him as frequently... or *ever*! Now, I am not trying to say you should cut him off. More that you should realize those are actual options -- and from that position, you can then begin to think about what you *want* to do in order to maintain a relationship with him, and what limits you need to set in order to do so... while still pursuing your life and priorities. You have a choice, and you want to make sure to remember that, so that you don't feel unnecessarily trapped by his worrying.\n\nGo read that article; it's by Mark Manson, about boundaries. I really think it will help you think through how to handle this (especially since many modern societies are absolutely shitty at teaching healthy boundaries). If you have firm and absolute boundaries, I suspect your Dad will calm down partly (1) because your behavior is stable and predictable, and so he will acclimate to it and include it in his model of how the world works, and (2) if you feel secure in your rights, and yet you'll have considered his needs and desires, I think you will feel better about it, and it will show in how you communicate (in a way that would be reassuring). If you give off the sense "I have thought this through, with real consideration for you, and an honest evaluation of my needs, and this is where we stand," it's hard to argue with that.\n\n**In the end, I imagine it being something like this:** "I will not stop doing this. I already have taken reasonable precautions in [these ways], and [this] is the risk as I see it. I am willing to talk about what other risks and safety measures might be taken into account. [These] are the parts of this travel that are most important to me, and if it doesn't interfere with those things, I might be willing to do a bit more to minimize my risk. However [these] are the parts that are essential (e.g., traveling alone), and are not open to negotiation. I know it puts me at some risk of physical harm and that that is uncomfortable for you, and that isn't my intent. At the same time, this is important to me and my happiness, and I have to ask you to respect my right to do this."*\n\n*Of course, tone will have to be adjusted depending on how he is reacting. I am picturing him as stressed out and worried, but willing to listen.
11	We promised we'd share the survey results, well here they are.	A while back, [we asked folks in this community to take a survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/5wy5tk/mod_approved_make_your_voice_heard_tired_of_phone/) and you all were kind enough to help us out. This post is a high level summary of the results of that survey.\n\n(Note: for this summary, we will be using the term "[extravert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion)" as used in clinical analysis initiated by Carl Jung instead of the popularized spelling, "extrovert." )\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe Movers & Makers company is engaged in ongoing research about introverts, extraverts, age, occupation, and communication preferences. The original hypothesis was that introverts, or individuals in introvert-friendly occupations such as STEM, were more adverse to having a phone call disrupt their time, with some exceptions. In contrast, extraverts, or individuals in extravert-friendly occupations, were more open to phone calls. Our formal interviews showed this hypothesis to be incorrect and revealed a trend based more on age and occupation than temperament.\n\nAs an informal triangulation of our data, The Movers & Makers research team decided to conduct surveys on popular social media and internet forums. The research has not yet concluded, but "Phase 1" of these informal surveys are complete and we'd like to share the results of these surveys. The results of this informal survey coincided with our formal research and also contradicted the original hypothesis. This summary is not an analysis of our hypothesis, our formal research, or of the informal research. This summary is only a brief overview of the informal survey results.\n\n# Summary\n\nIn addition to essential demographic questions, the questions of the survey took the form of "I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself." The possible answers included, "Call your phone number," "Send you an email," "Send you an SMS," "Send you an MMS," and "Send you an IM." We also asked two, somewhat open-ended questions that emphasized the positive and negative consequences of the communication preferences.\n\n## Overall Preferences\n\nOur initial observations, which initiated our research, were that there are some people that don't like to be called on the phone and would prefer to be contacted by other means. This survey supported the observation with less than a third of respondents preferring  a phone call (31.3%) over alternative methods. Email was the preferred method by half of the respondents (49.6%).\n\n[Overall Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/UmRoBq3)\n\nGranted, the spectrum of scenarios may have been biased toward phone-call-aversion, so this is not an absolute reflection of preferences, but merely a summary of the preferences reflected in this survey. \n\n### Introvert-Extravert Preferences\n\nBreaking down the data between introverts and extraverts yielded an insignificant difference between the two temperaments. Introverts preferred a phone call in 30.61% of responses. Extraverts preferred a phone call in 31.41% of responses. This is a difference of only 0.8% and is much smaller than we anticipated.\n\n[Introvert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/p7S4Djk)\n\n[Extravert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/9eww0um)\n\nThe similarities between introvert and extravert coincide with our formal research and are also reflected in the breakdown of most of each questions that follow.\n\n#### Ambivert Preferences\n\nWhile "ambivert" is not a part of some personality/temperament models, many contemporary research make allowances for ambiverts. In our case, we are including the term because people that identify as ambiverts seem themselves as distinct from both extraverts and introverts and they may have a distinct profile. However, the number of respondents describing themselves as Ambiverts is too small to comprehensively study and we recommend a more in-depth study of ambiverts and communication preferences.  Still, as a note of interest, we'll include the results here, though we caution against drawing any conclusions. Ambiverts responded with a preference for email at 54.6% and phone calls at 19.2%.\n\n[Ambivert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/5CHYPha)\n\n### Male-Female Preferences\n\nOur original hypothesis did not account for sex or gender. We allowed for the selection of "sex" in the survey to satisfy any curiosity of biological temperament selection. As we suspected, there isn't a large or significant difference in correlation of sex to communication preferences as borne out in our formal research and reflected in these survey results.\n\n[Male Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/VeC5EeV)\n\nOverall, male respondents selected a preference for a phone call in 34% of responses with females selecting phone calls in only 28.6% of responses. Email was the preferred response for both males and females in 49.3% and 49.7% of responses respectively.\n\n[Female Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/Npq6ZeS)\n\n#### Gender and Non-traditional Genders\n\nWe specifically did not include the word "gender" in this survey because the study of gender is outside of the scope of our current research. We allowed for the answers of "Prefer not to say," and "Other" with an open field to promote the completion of the survey, but this survey is not equipped to tackle gender. Even with this allowance, only 0.1% of respondents answered with a non-traditional sex. Of that 0.1%, some of the respondents showed open hostility to the survey in their comments, indicating that this answer was not truly reflective of the respondent. The answers from these respondents were removed from our analyzed results.\n\nThat does not mean, however, that we do not value research regarding gender. We believe that the identification of gender and that correlation to communication preference might be quite significant. It is simply that we have not begun to tackle the question at this time. We would openly welcome input or recommendations from anyone with knowledge or expertise in this area.\n\n### Generational Preferences\n\nThe first of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in generation. The age groups that we call "Millennials" are the least resistant to phone calls, with 31.6% of responses, and yet 48.4% of the Millennial responses prefer email. Millennials were also more open to "alternative" communication methods such as IM, SMS, etc. with about 20% of the responses in total.\n\n[Millennial Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/fJBFPKj)\n\nThe age groups that we call "Generation X," or "Gen X," are slightly more resistant to phone calls with only 29.1% of responses preferring a phone call and 57.3% preferring email.\n\n[Gen X Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/mAotSZr)\n\nThe age groups that we call "Baby Boomers," or just "Boomers" are the most resistant to phone calls with only 23.6% of responses preferring a phone call and 72.7% preferring email. Boomers were the most resistant to "alternative" communication methods with only 3.6% of responses for SMS and zero responses for the other methods.\n\n[Boomer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/U7Yng1Z)\n\n### Occupational Preferences\n\nThe second of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in occupation, or, occupational "wings" as we call them. These wings are simply divided into occupations that are [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics)-related and non-STEM-related. The survey results reinforced our formal research and part of our hypothesis that respondents in STEM-related fields are more resistant to phone calls than their non-STEM peers. Respondents in STEM-related fields responded with 23.5% of responses preferring phone calls and 57.4% preferring email.  \n\n[STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/QnwxZOc)\n\nResponses in non-STEM-related occupations were more receptive to phone calls, but only with 34.2% of the responses and 46.7% preferring email.\n\n[non-STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/LMluzrF)\n\n## Scenario Preferences\n\nWe asked respondents to imagine a range of hypothetical scenarios and how they'd prefer to be contacted in those scenarios. The scenarios spanned a variety of business-oriented communications that fall onto a spectrum what we term "cold to hot" in order indicate the amount of familiarity the two parties have already established. We also asked about preferences in various degrees of urgency and responsibility.\n\nIt is probably unsurprising that the more distant and less urgent relationships are the most resistant to phone calls and the nearest and more urgent relationships are the most receptive to phone calls. In the "coldest" scenario, *I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself*, responses were predictably low on preferring a phone call with only 8% of responses and 85% preferring email. In this scenario, the differences between introvert and extravert were negligible, but the differences in generation were in-line with the overall responses. STEM and non-STEM responses were also in agreement with the overall responses.\n\n[Cold Business Introduction Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/65J1a3r)\n\nAlso, predictably, the "hottest" scenario, *I have an emergency (business emergency, not life or death)*, included 74.6% of responses favoring a phone call and 5.9% preferring email. As an interesting note, in this scenario, more respondents preferred SMS to email with 13.7% of the responses.\n\n[Emergency Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/IOxd25R)\n\nThe scenarios that emphasized cool or hot combined with responsibility, however, were a little surprising. For the scenario, *I'm a customer with a question (it's your responsibility to answer customer questions),* the responses were similar to the warm business responses. 19% of responses preferred a phone call for customer questions and 72.2% of responses preferred email.\n\n[Cool Customer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/2FOARrW)\n\nThe scenario, *I'm a customer with a problem (it's your responsibility to handle customer problems),* showed a surprising 61% preferring email and only 31.2% preferring a phone call.\n\n[Hot Customer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/FbwgWnW)\n\n## Consequences\n\nWe were also interested in understanding what impact these preferences have on the communication recipient. We set up a pair of questions in the survey to give respondents a chance to demonstrate the perceived consequences, both positive and negative. The negative consequences include, "I mostly roll with it--no big deal" (16.8%), "I find it irritating and frustrating" (24.3%), and "The interruption negatively affects my work" (16.5%), as well as, "I may decide not to reply or continue communication" (17.8%). The most damaging consequences would be "I lose some respect for the person contacting me" (7.3%), and "I may block that person, or mark their contact as 'spam' or 'junk'" (6.5%).\n\n[Negative Consequences Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/RbL1A2Q)\n\nConversely, when the respondents' preferences were respected, there were positive consequences, including, "It helps me manage my schedule" (14.3%), "I feel I'm more productive and efficient" (13.9%), "I believe I can dedicate the proper amount of attention to the communication" (21.5%), "I'm less irritated" (20%), and "It reduces my anxiety" (18.8%).\n\n[Positive Consequences Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/laUXrVA)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nOur initial observations were that most people don't like receiving phone calls. Perhaps it's no mystery that the manner in which communication technology evolved puts the telephone front-and-center to business communication. However, our ongoing research shows that most people find phone calls to be disruptive and intrusive. Using the phone as a primary source of communication could be damaging to business relationships and to the overall economic health of our collective society. \n\nLooking at this research, we can see why "cold calling" feels ineffective and like "a waste of time" to many people. "Cold emails" are more likely to be effective and seem to have a lower downside. In fields like recruiting, it may be damaging for the hiring side of the relationship to initiate contact with a phone call. \n\nYes, the research is ongoing, but it seems relatively clear that the phone should not be the first point of contact in any scenario, unless we know for certain that the recipient would prefer a phone call or we know for certain that the purpose of the contact is an emergency (the definition of "emergency" is somewhat subjective and needs to be judiciously applied). In business scenarios, the least risky option for contacting anyone is to use email and the most risky is to use alternative methods like MMS, or even IM. But, phone calls seem equally risky by the same standards considering that email seemed to dominate the responses.\n\nAs an illustration of the resistance to phone calls, this is a comment from the survey, "I hate phone calls, almost unconditionally.  Texting or e-mails are always preferable unless it's really an emergency." And, another comment, "I do not generally like speaking on the phone because it's a purely auditory activity, and I am a visual person... I like time to process what's going on and formulate a response, otherwise I feel flustered and anxious." These and several other comments are reflective of the overall tone of this survey. There were no equivalent comments showing resistance to email. \n\nOur research currently only analyzes the state of things as they are, not *why* things are as they are. For example, why are Boomers more resistant to phone calls than Millennials? Why are STEM-related occupations more resistant to phone calls than non-STEM-related fields? Why are extraverts as equally resistant to phone calls as introverts? What is the significance of gender in communication preference? How might this study be different if we focused on personal scenarios instead of business scenarios?\n\nAll of these questions push us to recommend further research in this area. We know that we are continuing to research this area, but our small contribution covers only a fraction of needed research.\n\nWe will begin "Phase 2" of this research soon. If you're interested in participating, keep a watch on our blog for updates. This topic will remain a topic of interest for The Movers & Makers Company and our research is ongoing. If you are interested in this research or our other research, please [contact us](mailto:researchers@moversandmakers.xyz); but, please refrain from calling us on the phone, it's so disruptive.\n\nYou can find a copy of this article over on [Medium](https://medium.com/@michaelallenwilliamson/phone-call-or-email-or-informal-survey-results-a4d07e6c392a) if you'd like to read the article with the chart images in-line.
2	> (Note: for this summary, we will be using the term "extravert" as used in clinical analysis initiated by Carl Jung instead of the popularized spelling, "extrovert." )\n\nHaven't yet read the rest of the post, but that just seems petty.\n\nEdit: Also, you should probably move the line about the article being available on Medium to the top, rather than the bottom, of the post.
9	My friend's doing a design thesis on MBTI in the workplace and needs more ISTJ respondents!	
5	Try r/samplesize for survey responses. Also, these questions and response options are super leading and almost all double barreled. Might let your friend know. 
5	I started taking the test and stopped. There needs to be several possible answers to these questions and they should be brief. The responses are too specific and make it near impossible to truly answer one.\n\nIf someone was consistently late, I wouldn't wonder anything about making them better, I'd pull them in my office and call them out on it.\n\nIf some asshat tried getting me to approve a budget at the last minute, a meeting would be had with anyone with knowledge on the subject.\n\nIf I was a manager, I'd have an open door policy for as long as it was sustainable.
14	Curious to see what everyone's sense of humour is like. This Humor Styles Questionnaire said that I have an affiliate sense of humour. Moar categorizations!	
8	Affiliate as well!
14	I typed "mostly affiliative". I always believe that if you have to lie, mislead or demean someone to be funny, you're not actually funny.
5	"mostly aggressive" ha
2	Interesting quiz, got affiliative.
2	"Mostly affiliate" sense of humor.
1	You have a mostly self-defeating sense of humor.\nEveryone's sense of humor is a mix of all four styles, but yours leans most heavily toward self-defeating, meaning you're quick to put yourself down to make others laugh\n\nWell. That's interesting.\n\nTo be honest, I think that "aggressive" would have been right after, but I can see how this result fits for me.
1	"Mostly Affiliative" and "Mostly Self-Enhancing."\n\nInteresting. I know I'm actually really aggressive, but only about certain things and only with people I know pretty well.\n\nThe only way I have ever bothered to categorize humor is a scale between humor based in thought (new ways of looking at things) and humor based in ignorance (unoriginal and base), so this is interesting!
1	I got mostly aggressive and affiliative. 
1	mostly self-enhancing
1	affiliate
1	I got "Mostly Aggressive."\n
1	Mostly affiliative.
1	Self Enhancing
1	Mostly affiliative
1	I also got Mostly affiliative
1	I have affiliative, self enhancing and agressive humor. 
1	Got the agressive one.
7	Job Interviews	Hi all.  So, I'm pulling at all my resources here in an effort to not bomb an upcoming interview.  I know I can just google/youtube things, but I figure it won't hurt to ask you guys what you've personally learned about the interview process.\n\nPersonally I have a hard time fudging the truth I guess.  I tend to think that if they don't like my answers then I probably don't want to work there anyways.  However, I also realize that, when asked if you are a team player, you probably shouldn't say absolutely not...  :)
4	You absolutely don't need to lie. But at the same time, managers need to know that you're able to work in a team environment. They don't expect you to LOVE working with others, but they need some indication that your coworkers will be able to depend on you. \n\nTeamwork doesn't just mean doing group work. It means being willing to help a coworker when they're overburdened, sharing information in a way that allows the team to work better as a whole, or even just understanding how your work benefits the organization as a whole. \n\nI get that you don't want to lie and team work isn't the most fun thing in the world, but if you answer no to the team player question, you're going to give off the impression that you're going to be a problem for the organization and a conflict creator. \n\nThe way I would suggest answering that question is by saying "I'm a big proponent of the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. In my experience, teams always see greater success when the individual skills and performances of its members are combined together. For example, I contributed to X project by providing Y skills, which resulted in the team achieving Z". \n\nThrough this answer, you're not only showing off your own skills, but also showing why you can be a team player without having to lie about it. \n\nBest of luck with your interview!
3	One tip I would offer is making sure you're comfortable. When I was looking for my first job, I got an interview for a stocker at a grocery store. The guy was a type A personality, and I was nervous about trying to get my first job. At one point I stuttered - \n\nHim: "So, in this position, you do wxyz, do you think you can handle that?"\nMe: *that's seems pretty straightforward"\n"I-i think i can handle that."\n"..hmm, you think so?"\n"Yeah." *I messed up*\n\nHe probably micromanages the place and runs it like a well oiled machine. He needs people who can hold up to shouting over loud forklifts without getting nervous, and I probably turned him off. So I'm getting at two things: you can read a little into the work environment from the boss if he's the one interviewing (some places have a manager who only does hiring), and the other is, have presence. Try to stay confident and articulate ( but not robotic), like I didn't. \n\nYou've got the right idea, have some answers you can roll out, but if part of the job is acting in a team, and they ask about how you are at working with one, you don't want to say you don't do teams and you'll hate life if you get put in one. If it's an entry level job your after, I think you can grow into it. \n\nMy dad is also an ISTJ, and from 30 years of work experience he told me all work environments are basically customer service oriented, because each department's employees are each departments customers: everyone wants something. You're always reporting to someone. From grocery to talking about lawn chemicals to warehouse management to an office job. It's a skill.\n\nIf they ask if you have experience, you can say no but you wouldn't mind learning. It's a nice way to stay positive during the interview.\n\n\nThat's all I can think of right now. Be confident, articulate, and optimistic.
2	I was exactly like you when I started looking for jobs up until my last round of interviews for my current position. For me, the biggest problem was filtering information. In a pursuit of being honest, I would often over inform the interviewer and sabotage myself.\n\nBe honest, but make yourself look good to them. There are some aspects of answers that might not be necessary for your answer to be effective. The team player question is a good example. While you might not consider yourself a team player, look outside of your meaning.\n\nFor ISTJs, we often have the mindset, at least from what I've seen, that team work means we pick up all the slack and end up doing most of the work. That's a dysfunctional team. In an ideal team situation, everyone is striving towards the same goal and putting forth the effort needed to make sure their piece is getting done properly and at a rapid pace. If that's what your experience with teams was, I don't think you'd say no to the question. It doesn't mean this team will be that, but that is what companies strive for. So out yourself in that mindset, and when you answer,\n\n"yes, I work very well in a team. I communicate with team members well and make sure my contribution to the team is done to the best of my ability. If I complete my work early or another member is having difficulty, I'm able to step in and help."\n\nYou're being honest. They don't need to know that every other team you've been on has stuck you with the work and made you sour to teams. If they flat out ask if you'd prefer to work in a close knit team or on your own, be honest but explain that you can adapt to anything and are willing to do what's best for the company.\n\nI'd give similar advice about the "weakness" questions. Always give it a positive spin. If your weakness is not being decisive, explain that you've been making efforts to be more decisive in small things and have seen improvements in  bigger things. Never just say "I have a hard time talking to people" and end it there. Add that you've been going to networking groups to expose yourself to different people to become more confident in your speaking abilities. And if you aren't doing these things, do them. If you plan on doing this as a fib, at least look into a follow up response around the thing you say you're doing. For networking, look into meetup groups near you so you can have a specific example to use. Just make sure you're willing to go asap in case they show up looking for you.\n
1	It's all about spin. For example:\n\n"Are you a team player?"\n\nI can work with a team when I have to, but I am at my best when I am given a task and left to work on it alone. 
7	How do you quiet your fears of something bad happening if you don't complete "specific task X" right now?	
11	do task x\n\nno joke, I should be sleeping and yet here I am, freelancing away...\n\nI get it - it's not healthy. I don't have a solution - let me know if you figure something out :(
8	Are these rational fears, like "I'm going to fail the test tomorrow if I don't study for it right now", or irrational like "someone I love is going to get hurt if I don't perform this task right now"? \n\nFor the former, you could try asking yourself "will this matter in five years?" and then proceed based on the answer. If it's the latter, I would suggest seeking professional help as it could be the signs of OCD
4	Weekly Thread: Tell us your April Fool's Day stories!	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what April Fool's Day pranks have you fallen for or have successfully pulled off yourself?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
4	Stereotypically, I don't do April Fool's.\n\nBut when I was in intermediate school, both my class and the one next door which we were attached to put sellotape over the tips of every single whiteboard marker we could find. It was fun to watch the teachers figure that one out, although in retrospect I think they may have been playing along.
3	I don't typically do pranks but I enjoy them quite a bit. My most recent favorite was a guy at work who dumped a bag of dinner rolls into the toilet. This year he also put scotch tape inside the USB plug for everyone's keyboards and mice. 
2	This is a little late, but I was accepted for an internship position starting this summer which was a pretty big deal. For April fools, I faked an email from the employer saying something along the lines of they ran into budgetary constraints and could not longer afford the position. I got everybody in my friend group including my girlfriend to get upset about it. It was pretty funny. 
1	I used to live in a building with 2 other friends, one of which always brought her guitar to every hangout and insisted on playing. So for April Fools, the other friend and I slipped a note under her door that was signed by her next door neighbour (who we knew) saying that he had heard her playing through the walls and invited her to jam together some time. \n\nSo she showed up at his door with her guitar that night day and a lot of confusion ensued. We owned up to it when she brought it up and she punched us both, but it was worth it. 
1	I want your opinion on whether I'm ISTJ or INTJ by reading this.	I've done the 16 personality tests quite a few times and I seem to get INTJ or ISTJ. I've read around the differences between N and S and I'm looking through here to see what others can type me just by the following things I mention about my self. If there is anything missing that cannot lead you to type me properly please do ask any questions regarding my self.\n\nI value my Independence a lot and more so than others. However, humans do need some form of socializing as we are a social being. Therefore, I would only socialize with my close friends. If i were to socialite with other people it would only be for something that I need. I stay alone most of the time whilst I am at sixth form as my close friends go to another sixth form. I love Maths and Chemistry and so I do stuffs like reading ahead and reading books about these subjects as they fascinate me.\n\nAs for my hobbies, they include, playing games like Skyrim, Final Fantasy VII, watching anime (Horror, Slice of Life, Comedy), studying lel, roaming around the internet and working out with my close friends at the gym. I also listen to music such as K-hiphop, Kpop, Jpop, Lofi Hip hop, Indie and Vaporware music etc, pretty much any music that just suits me or any music that I like to be frank.\n\nI do beat my self up alot as I do want to achieve the things that I had planned for the long term (Go to a good university to study maths) and do the necessary things that will get me there. I do compare my self to others alot but I don't necessarily show my emotions and I don't in parituclar show my emotions to my friends and just keep it to my self. And I'm currently going through depression/anxiety because of all this. But I am determined to improve my self and get my self back up to give my self the best possible chance in the future. However, during my lowest days I would end up just watching random videos and withdraw from everything and after that beat my self even more for wasting time. In terms of career wise, I first thought about getting into medicine but I changed my mind as it's far too competitive and I may not even like it as it may be quite demanding also the fact that I don't enjoy Biology A-level anymore and so that put me off from it, (I'm currently self studying further maths) as it seems like the best option to put me. Although my sixth form won't let me study further maths, I decided that I'll just self study it rather than dread biology. In terms of following rules, I first ask my self the point in these rules and whether they are as important as said. If I think it's stupid to follow then I end up not following it. In terms of social/popularity, I tend to follow and listen to my self than whatever is going around other people or follow a certain trend to be liked so yeah. I used to have social media and was quite a narcissists but I stopped after realizing that I need to do things more to my self and not show it to anyone as I feel like I'm just letting them know everything about me. I don't like that. So I deleted social media 2/3 years ago and only keep whatsapp to message my friends.\n\nGenerally, I am quite a lazy person and would rather do things efficiently rather than do a routine as it will make me depressed as there is no variety.\n\nIn terms of helping other people, I would offer help in terms of emotional problems by listening to them and just thinking what they could do and everything. I'm not really good with these kind of stuffs, especially when girls rant a lot and expect me to say something. Got called a brick because I was too busy thinking the possible solutions that I could offer.\n\nI love dark humor, and as well as that, I really think that in general that this world is pretty shit to live in (Could be my depression talking) but, I really think that we as a whole are pretty much better of being dead, in that way we wouldn't have to feel any pain or any inequalities that happens. And I do question my religious belief a lot to the point where if people know that I'm somewhat agnostic and attempt to give me crap I don't care, as I know that I will suffer or go hell if it were to be the truth.\n\n Anyways, that's pretty much what I can think of right now.
5	Have you looked at the cognitive functions for both types? They share two of them but differ on the latter two. Easiest way to tell may be if you use introverted sensing or introverted intuition as your primary way of processing information. Are you more focused on the here and now? Are you more future-focused? Are you more of a concrete or abstract thinker?
3	I would say ISTJ, you seem to be a sensor type rather than an intuitive type. Being future oriented doesn't necessarily mean you're an intuitive type - I think a better dichotomy is concrete vs. abstract, sensing being concrete and intuitive being abstract. As an ISTJ, you will get things done for the benefit of your future - but when you do these things, you will refer to past experiences for guidance, and will probably be comfortable doing things the way you're used to. 
1	I would look into the functions for sure. Just do a search for Cognitive Function stack and you should get some good results.\n\nBased on your info I'm leaning towards INTJ. The only piece that really stuck out was the routine part. ISTJs are more accepting of routine, some even enjoy it.\n\nDo you find that if you have to do repetitive tasks, you end up doing them the same way each time? Or do you approach it differently every time?
1	You sound like an INTJ to me!
1	Do you prefer to work with patterns/hunches or solid experimental evidence?
1	Didn't you post on r/mbti a month or two ago asking the same stuff? 
4	INFJ here, willing to learn from you(s)	I'm just interested to understand your outlook on life.\n\nFire away! How do you understand you Si dom and it's part in your understanding on life? How does your Te inform your Si?
10	I'm not familiar enough with MBTI theory to comment on specifics but I always take information in quite literally. If it hasn't been proven to me (first or very trusted second hand) then I don't consider it to be true. So many people base their opinions and decisions on conjecture, which may not be inherently bad but I prefer to act on facts.  \n\nI think many problems could be solved through empathy and seeking truth, both of which have their hurdles. I think the most important impact someone can make is to improve the lives of those they meet. Remember that person who was awesome to you? Do that for as many people as you can. Remove people from your life who you can't do that for, you aren't doing either of you any favors. \n\nAnyway, that's how I look at things. I do my best to be a better person and try to self correct bad habits. I think about things a lot to try and analyze what's happening, to try to distill everything down to cause/effect. 
4	Preparation preparation preparation. \n\nWhen presented with a new experience, I get frazzled and uncontrollably think of what can go wrong. \n\nFor example, if I were invited to a scuba diving adventure with a group of people, I'd freeze because I've never dived before and I'm not comfortable with anything to do with water or beaches. I'd delay RSVPing for as long as I can because this is new to me and I can't make up my mind on whether to risk going when I don't know anything about it. \n\nIf left to my own devices, I won't go.\n\nBut if I'm embarking on a self development mission and I want to experience something new, I'll think of ways to get around this problem (Te). Do I just go with the flow? How can I make myself feel better about going into this new experience? \n\nAh! I've got it. I'll watch loads of videos on scuba diving. I'll watch instructional videos, look up the gear needed, how to use them, what are the potential dangers and how to avoid them. Wait, I've got a better idea. I'll make a solo trip down to the diving site to watch people dive. Where do they keep their clothes? Are there lockers in the facility? How does the whole procedure work? Is there food around? Are there vending machines? Cafes for when we get hungry after the dive? Is this place remote? Do cabs come by here? \n\nI need all these information to feel comfortable. \n\nBasically, in order to make myself comfortable about a new experience, I'd "scout out" before hand to get a pre-experience which I can draw on (Si) when I'm face with the real thing. \n\nIf you have an ISTJ friend who takes a long time to RSVP to something, this is probably what's going on. Or if your ISTJ friend has organized a hang out in a new part of town, you can bet that he/she has first gone there before hand to scout the place, familiarize themselves. *Then and only then*, would they send out invites. Only when they're very sure that they can handle and take care of everyone during the hang out. Provide and direct whatever everyone needs. You need the loo? It's just round that corner past starbucks. Last train home is 12am. There's a taxi stand to the left of the entrance of this mall. You guys wanna go japanese for dinner? There's a pretty good place on the 5th floor. 
3	Favourite travel destinations	Lets see if there are any similarities.\n \nMine is Switzerland,  love the mountains and lakes.\n\nOn my bucket list: - Norway ,  - Yellowstone Park , - Japan,  New Zealand (I live in western Europe)
10	Home.\n\nLonger answer: I don't like to travel.  When I get vacation time from work, I spend it at home, and I'm perfectly happy with that.
2	I traveled the Swiss Alps by myself and it was perfect.  I need to go back.  
2	Other than Canada I have been nowhere else outside of the US. \nThat being said, I love Colorado, Kentucky and Tennessee. \nOn my bucket list of like to see, Ireland, Scotland, New Zealand, California, Oregon, London, and France. \n\nI actually would love to travel just about anywhere. So I guess I'll see where life takes me. But those would all be ideal places I'd like to see. 
2	I am nowhere near well-traveled and my first answer would be "home" as u/securitysix mentioned since I am a homebody with, like, an ounce of wanderlust.\n\nBut I've loved San Francisco when it's not crowded, and also Toronto.\n\nI'd like to visit Seattle, WA. And various European cities.
2	I live in NZ and need to see more of my own country. My parents travelled a lot with me as a child... I remember the Moeraki boulders and a stretch of one of the passes, and nothing else. I like visiting lots of places on the North Island but because I live here, none of it feels like *travelling* .\n\nI haven't done much travelling abroad, but Australia's Gold Coast was fun. My bucket list includes two or three legs of Europe. One or two trips covering Germany, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic and Italy (or if I get desperate, just Prague, the Black Forest region, Vienna, and Tyrol/South Tyrol/Trentino is fine), and another covering Norway, Sweden, and Finland, and maybe Denmark and Iceland.\n\nI'd also love to visit Turkey, Armenia, and Iran but, uh, we'll see how things go. Might have to reduce that one to just Iran, and maybe not during an election year.
2	I went to Switzerland once and it was my favorite place I've been too. I believe I saw once that introverts are supposed to like mountains and forests better while extroverts apparently like more open spaces, I wonder if it's true?\n\nI went on a cruise this past November and I would love to do something similar again. I like when I don't have to worry about changing plans. 
2	I generally like the coast (I live in Seattle) so getting a hotel on the beach is nice or going to the islands is fun as well, but I am always close to home. \n\nFor more long distance travels, I would really like to go to Japan and Thailand. 
3	How do I deal with my ISTJ mother trying to organize everything about my life?	Don't get me wrong, my mother has helped me tremendously from her perfectionism and I am forever thankful to her for organizing events and prompting me on things.  However, she needs everything to be completely meticulously planned out, is rarely open to trusting me to schedule my own things, and is rarely open to taking risks or letting anyone else do so.  She also has some pretty serious OCD and past negative life experiences that exacerbate these traits.  I find this to be VERY annoying.  The rest of my family also has trouble dealing with it.  I love my mother very much but there has been too much turmoil and arguments that have come from our constant clash in perspective.  Whenever I try to mention her overbearing nature, she gets very hurt and very defensive about it, to the point where it seems to not be worth the effort.  \n\nHow do I explain my concerns to her without hurting her too much?  
6	Be honest, but be kind. I used to be exactly like your mom, but have since gone to therapy and worked through my shit. In an ideal world I would tell you to encourage her to see a therapist, but that might be really the wrong way to go if she's not keen on addressing her mental health, much like my mother. That's going to have to be your call. In any case if I were you I'd tell her honestly the things she's doing and how they make you feel, and then set a boundary with her on some of these issues. A good format for this would simply be "Mom, sometimes when you X, it makes me feel Y. I am able to manage scheduling my own life and will deal with the consequences myself if something goes awry without your help." Take the accountability for your own scheduling and let her off the hook. She is way over controlling about this stuff because she's afraid of the consequences if she forgets something, something unplanned happens, or if there are any kinks in her perfectly curated world. The reality is that life will never be perfect and crap will inevitably come up, EVEN IF she is overly controlling of your schedule. So if you really want to be in charge of scheduling your stuff, tell her it will all be on you and not her, which is your way of acknowledging her anxiety without enabling it and setting a healthy boundary. It wouldn't hurt to tell her some of the things she does RIGHT as a mother, too. That's something I've started doing with my own mother, who struggles with very similar issues to your mom, and it's been really helpful in her willingness to respect my boundaries. \n\nYou are allowed to let your voice be heard and set a boundary with her, even if it upsets her. I understand your concern for her well being, but trust me, you will have a healthier relationship with her in the long run if you're able to be honest (something ISTJs really value) and maintain healthy boundaries (something all people need for healthy relationships). It sounds like she's struggling with some personal mental health stuff that needs perhaps some professional help. Her stuff is no reason for you to be miserable and let her walk all over you, even if it upsets her. Don't be mean, just clear and honest. And remind her that you love her and just want to have a healthy relationship with her.
3	An INFP unable to live up to an unhealthy ISTJ's expectations? Color me surprised!\n\nDude, I am in the same position and it fucking sucks. She's such a slave to detail, I basically need a microscope to see the glaring issues she finds. I like the therapy option that was suggested, but if your Mom is a prideful as mine is, it'll be dismissed pretty quickly. You're just going to have to talk to her and teeter the line between discussion and confrontation with her.
1	this is my life verbatim, want to be pen pals haha
3	Places to work/study outside of the house?	Looking for suggestions on places I can kind of camp out and use wi-fi to work outside of the house for extended periods of time. I honestly can't focus and get distracted easily when working at home.\n\nSo far, the places I tend to frequent include the library, coffee shops, panera, barnes and noble, and sometimes certain diners.\n\nRecently my productivity has dropped a lot so I'm looking for new places. Being the introvert that I am, I crave solitude and need to find a place where I can focus and get a lot of work done outside the house. Any suggestions or recommendations?\n
2	I don't know if it works the same way for ISTJs, but I just normally go to the places you mentioned. I love working near people where I feel bad if I get distracted. \n\nI usually do most of my desk work at a table by the university office with an ISTJ actually. We can sit quietly together but will occasionally have non-draining conversations. \n\nI also recommend doing work outside if it's nice and you don't get a glare. Empty classrooms work good too if you're in a university environment. I see people do computer work in restaurants but that seems to busy. 
2	Here's my advice, but it's not really a place to go.\n\nI've discovered that a good pair of noise cancelling/isolating headphones and music can make anywhere feel like a fortress of solitude. Turn the volume up enough to cancel out any excess noise and then immerse yourself in your work. Instrumental music works well because the lyrics won't distract you.\n\nOver the ear varieties work best for me. I think the act of putting them on makes me feel like I'm entering a different place, helping with immersion.\n\nFor actual places, I've found the library works best for me. Coffee shops are lower on the list because they're so loud. If you can find a good inexpensive diner (Perkins if you have them, maybe Denny's) I can usually get work done there too.\n\nAnother small piece of advice. If you find focusing hard, take 10-15 minutes and do something fun. Sometimes the only way to beat lack of focus, is to give in temporarily. It thinks it's won and let's up, at least that's how I see it.
7	Weekly Thread: Who are your favourite musical artists?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: who are your favourite musical artists? Do you stick to a genre or are you open to anything that tickles your ears?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
5	Radiohead, Brand New, Nine Inch Nails, Fall of Troy, Modest Mouse.\n\nI could go on forever but I'll limit myself to those few. I go on binges for new music I find, but I keep returning to those.
4	My time has come.\n\nI'll stick to a top 25, in no particular order, just the ones that come to mind: The Beatles, Fall Out Boy, Glenn Gould, Kina Grannis, Ed Sheeran, Peter Katz, Evgeny Kissin, Paramore, Evanescence, Panic! at the Disco, Simon & Garfunkel, Imaginary Future, Taylor Swift, All Time Low, The Who, The Birthday Massacre, Bastille, A Silent Film, Fossil Collective, Linkin Park, Owen Danoff, Shiny Toy Guns, The Paper Kites, Pentatonix, and William Fitzsimmons.\n\nI tend to stick to modern alternative, baroque classical, '60s/'70s folk rock, singer/songwriter...but I'm really open to anything. There are genres out there that I haven't explored but just have not discovered yet. Spotify tends to lead me to lots of electronic music and soundtrack music that I'm a big fan of for studying.
3	Breaking Benjamin, Linkin Park, Fallout Boy, Panic At The Disco, etc
3	I only really listen to death and black metal but I'm not sure if I could pick a favorite, there are so many. For death I'd say Desolate Shrine, Adversarial, Grave Miasma, Krypts, Swallowed, and Necros Christos. For black I'd say Aosoth, Sorcier des Glaces, Gevurah, Grimoire, Imperial Triumphant, Thantifaxath, Nightbringer, Mortuus, and a lot of atmospheric space black metal like Mare Cognitum, Omega Centauri, Midnight Odyssey, Mesarthim, and Spectral Lore.
3	My two favorite bands are Guns N Roses and the Eagles.
3	LOL.  I'm sooo very far from those given.  Perhaps it's my age/gender (F/54).  The artists I have the most of are Barbra Streisand, Billy Joel, Osmonds, Prince, and lots of movie musical soundtracks.
3	Does anybody else like EDM?\n\nSnails is my favorite artist.
2	Anberlin, Jimmy Buffett, Tom Waits, and Oh, Sleeper.
2	Oh boy.\n\nTwo Steps From Hell, Audiomachine, Valentin Boomes, Ludovico Einaudi, Omega Rhythm, Metallica, Crystal Castles, Edguy, Hatsune Miku, Lady Gaga, Linkin Park, Metalocalyspe, Evanescence, Blink 182.\n\nTo list a few. \n\nI listen to so many different music it is kinda hard to choose, but those are some of my tops.
2	My absolute favourites are The Veils, Amanda Palmer (including The Dresden Dolls), Nick Cave (& the Bad Seeds), Tom Waits, Screaming Females, MCR, and Nine Inch Nails. \n\nI also really like David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Arcade Fire, Fela Kuti, Hannah Fury, Regina Spektor, Shoutin' Preachin', Sisters of Mercy, Joy Division, The World/Inferno Friendship Society, Mars Volta, Jeff Rosenstock's various projects, Lee Moses, and Johnny Jewel's various projects. And Against Me!, or at least *Crime as Forgiven By* and the latest two albums. And more besides. I listen to a lot of jazz but I don't have any one favourite artist. \n\nArvo Pärt is my favourite composer. In classical music I like Renaissance, baroque, romantic and the occasoinal post-romantic composer, but not so much the actual Classical period itself (and I can't stand serialism. I appreciate the idea but find it horrible to listen to).\n\nI'm "open to anything that tickles my ears", I suppose, although usually it isn't pop and I'm getting a bit bored with rock and alternative rock. I guess I like a lot of theatrical stuff (including glam), but I only like it in a certain way; I don't like hair metal and the novelty of Abney Park wore off really fast.
2	Right now Passenger is my favourite. For the most part though, I listen 90s alternative and indie.
2	I'm a country kid, but newer country and not so much of the classics.  Carrie Underwood, Jason Aldean, Dierks Bentley.  If it's not country then I'm usually listening to top 40 or alternative... I jump radio stations until I find something I like. 
2	Do any of you not listen to that much music?\n\nThe ISTJ I'm close to will listen to music while driving, but besides that, he doesn't purposefully seek it out? Like he doesn't have any on his phone to listen to while riding the train or while doing tasks. I always thought it was kind of interesting. 
2	I like a variety of music. But if I had to pick some favorites I'd say, Chaos Chaos, Red Hot Chili Peppers, the Lumineers, Breaking Benjamin, Mumford and sons, Lonely Island. I just realized I listed lonely island last, but they are actually in my top 3 favorite music artists. The goofy fun side of me loves them so hard.
4	Question for ISTJs	So my mom is an istj, she agreed to get me a computer for a gift\n\nMy style is more to buy some stuff, see if I like it, and try a few times before committing.  I return maybe 80% of stuff I get, sometimes I get something I know I will return just for the experience of it, and I will usually piece mail everything- get this, get this a month later and see if it's worth it individually, etc. this makes her very annoyed so she wants a list of everything I want to get for it before hand. \n\nI am wondering if this is a common thing for ISTJs? \n\nI am an ISFP btw
15	Research before you buy.  Buyer's remorse due to lack of research on your part is a terrible reason to return things. 
5	This sounds uncommon for everyone tbh
3	I wish my mom was more like this. She told me she was going to look at cars and came back with a new car. No research no looking around or anything. I think she bought it because it was red. 
3	Another ISTJ here chiming in. I rarely return things. I research things before I buy. Cost impacts how much research I'm going to do. If it's something like a $5 vegetable brush then I just buy it. Otherwise I do think before spending money. If I'm going to buy something for hundreds of dollars then I spend some time reading reviews and comparison shopping.\n\nEDIT: Basically impulse purchases are not typical for me.
2	Hm, your reasoning about not knowing what you like until you have it is part of the reason I hesitate to get anything. I have an unreasonable aversion to the returns process, and worry about the used object being thrown into a landfill because it can't be sold as new.\n\nThat said, if I was going to get someone a gift, I think I would feel sympathetic to how it feels to have someone attempt to control me or dictate my preferences... So I would decide in advance what my boundaries and limits were, and would give them freedom within those bounds, letting them know, up front, what those boundaries were.\n\nThat said... if that person was my child, and someone who presumably depends on me in order to learn... I would try to strike some kind of compromise, but I might impose my views a bit more -- I know learning is uncomfortable (so it is unlikely they're going to be able to tell me accurately whether or not they are benefiting from my approach). And I would not want to see them lacking a skill in the future just because I mistook inexperience for a preference... \n\nWhen you say she wants a list of everything you want to get for it before hand, what do you mean? Are you talking about parts -- that you will assemble into a whole computer? Or do you mean things like monitors, keyboards, etc?\n\nIs there any way that you can go and experiment with different things at the store and get a reasonable sense of whether or not you like them that way? Is there anything that would prevent you from returning/purchasing once you own the computer? And are there any parts you are sure of that you could have her get -- leaving it to you to purchase any items that you're likely going to need a lot of experimentation for? (Perhaps she could even give you a remaining budget via a gift card so that you could do the rest on your own?)\n\nIn your place, I might also try to explain to her my preferences and the reasoning behind them -- including why other "more sensible" (to her) approaches are not going to work... and ask her why she insists on her view. Does she not see your preferences as valid, or is there a lesson she's trying to impart? What are her fears or concerns with following your approach? Note, don't ask just so you can immediately refute them... but take them away and think about it for a while, and see whether she has any good points, and if you can see room for a compromise between what her values are, for taking this approach, and what your desires/needs are.\n\nGood luck!
2	This is so fucking stupid. If you value your labor at minimum wage at the very least you're losing money with the time you put into fucking around. Make a decision, stop stressing people out with your bullshit. It's literally a computer.
1	Spending, spending, spending. Not my style. If it is <$20 I cannot give any logistics. I just buy it, if I **need* it. But if it is over $20, I know what I need it for, when I need it, how I'm going to use it, and everything in between. Since you are progeny, your parent wants best for you. And all this eclectic spending must be driving her nuts. I'm into r/FI, which is rare among the Americans; esoteric practices. 
7	What does your mind look like?	Interpret the question in any way you wish. \n\nAsking for a friend. Thanks!
21	A contradictory mess, always screaming at itself. It's like each hemisphere is the polar opposite of the other, and they're constantly fighting for control. I can't keep them balanced, so I end up switching between the two many times a day. From the outside I look organised and in-control, but in reality, I'm constantly reining each side in and trying to pick up the pieces from whatever failures they've made. \n\nMy primary mode of operation is maintenance mode: Keep myself alive and fed, and minimise the damage wherever possible whilst still moving forwards. There's no time or point to thinking about the past or future; I don't have the energy to take care of anything but the present. 
9	Mmm. Sometimes I feel like my mind is a barren wasteland, not really thinking about to much, kind of blank. Long car rides can be pretty boring if I don't feel like listening to music. Part of me just does and thinks about things as they come and the other part likes to plan ahead. When I get into a video game or card game my mind goes into super drive trying to come up or create ways to win. I don't really understand why I think the way I do sometimes. I guess over all my thought process is simple yet creative, trying to always figure out the simplest and most effective way to complete a task.
8	I want to answer this question but I don't even know how to interpret it lol. Very good question
2	Pretty easy for you to find out for yourself:\n\n1) Google "Brain"\n\n2) Click "Images"\n\n3) Done.
4	Answer questions: \nWhat am I doing? Am I doing it right? Am I being efficient? Am I on track?\n\n\nDistracted by thoughts of:\nHow will I mitigate x, y, z? What about that thing tomorrow? How about that other thing in a week?
3	A large ball of poorly connected neurons.
3	My mind is full of lists. Shopping lists, goal lists, to do lists.. They just never end. I am always thinking about the step right in front of me, or the steps I have already taken as well. It feels like it's never ending 
2	An excel spreadsheet superimposed over a filing structure similar to the Windows and Folders of computers. The spreadsheet is the index, which points to my memories in various folders and files. \n\nEvery memory has it's place before age and forgetfulness corrupt the files.
12	Ever wondered how many subscribers there are in each of the MBTI subreddits? Well I collected the data in this post. Tell me your interpretation of the results.	general MBTI subreddit: 14,701\n\nall SJs: 8,137 // \nESTJ: 745 // \nESFJ: 732 // \nISTJ: 4,055 // \nISFJ: 2,605\n\nall SPs: 8,137 // \nESTP: 920 // \nESFP: 804 // \nISTP: 4,447 // \nISFP: 2,205\n\nall NFs: 56,097 // \nENFP: 11,243 // \nENFJ: 3,016 // \nINFP: 22,166 // \nINFJ: 19,672\n\nall NTs: 75,270 // \nENTP: 9,400 // \nENTJ: 4,167 // \nINTP: 31,444 // \nINTJ: 30,259\n\nCompare the numbers with this estimated frequency of personality types: https://mypersonality.info/personality-types/population-gender/\n\nNote: I'll be posting this on all of the MBTI subreddits.\n
6	Intuitive types are weird and we like to bond over that and weird ideas? (Or may be more likely to pursue MBTI) Maybe sensors spend their time more practically in general? 
5	Looks to me like all the extroverts are out having fun. They ain't got time for reddit
2	[More data analysis](http://imgur.com/a/Aa7q1)
2	I'm not surprised the INTP subreddit has the most subscribers. It seems that INTPs have an inclination toward MBTI; I imagine it really appeals to their Ti. I'd also add that - speaking from personal experience - many INTPs are not actually INTPs (might even go as far as to say it's the most common mistype), which would also account for the amount of subs. If anyone can offer some statistics on this, I would love to hear them. 
2	Any ISTJs in hospitality or management fields? (From a writer doing character research)	I’m an XNTJ writer here (unsure still if I’m I or E), and I’m needing some help with a female ISTJ main character for a story I’m developing.\n\n\nI’m needing help with two things, the first, could any ISTJ’s in hospitality or management fields tell me what either satisfies you or bothers you about your job, especially how you feel about dealing with people? Anyone who’s ISTJ, in one of those fields, and loves your job, I’d especially want to know exactly why and how you decided your job was a good fit for you. I’m also trying to get a feel for how ISTJ’s handle conflicting personality types, especially in positions where they have to deal with satisfying a lot of people, especially extroverts, who likely rely more on emotion and intuition.  \n\n\nSecond, does this sound like an ISTJ, and if not, what personality type would you suggest fits more accurately? Fiercely strong / motivating / hard around the edges / goes by the book but surprisingly adaptive when no other options are available / slow to trusting anyone / appears outgoing in that she pretends to care about other’s problems for her job, but would must rather be alone /=represses most emotions outwardly, yet easily stressed internally / watchful / jack-of-all trades / blames herself when things go wrong. What makes me uncertain is the fact she rather enjoys her not typical ISTJ job (she owns and operates a bar and often takes the listening/comforting role of your average bartender when things are busy, yet she’s more likely to spend the afternoon playing chess than chatting if she’s free) and the fact she does take risks when doing things the same old way simply isn’t working. Does this still sound like an ISTJ or have I diagnosed her wrong? I know no one fits a type 100% which is why I’m so conflicted here.\n\n\nThank you so much ISTJs for all your help. You have no idea how much I appreciate it. :)\n
2	I'm a nursing student, so can't give the same perspective as a full fledged nurse. \n\nAs far as why I chose it, I'm not gonna lie a big reason is the job security and the decent pay. However, even after doing clinicals, I get that nice feeling that my job makes a difference in people's lives. It also has many avenues as far as specialization, which is a nice plus. \n\nIt definitely is exhausting at the end of a 12 hour shift of interacting with several patients and doctors. I do feel like I have to put up a fake profile and be more outgoing than I normally am, but that's become easier as I've gotten more experience. Luckily it's only 3 days a week once I'm out of school, so I have plenty of time to focus on myself and hobbies. \n\nYou're description of her seems pretty similar to mine honestly. I would say I still enjoy my job even though it's an extroverted job (though not as much as a bartender on a busy night I'd assume). The fact that I can comfort and treat someone in a very vulnerable time is a great feeling. Seeing a patient improve over your shift and hopefully discharge feels like I accomplished by job. \n\nHope I helped. Feel free to ask more questions if need be.  
1	This is my Hospitality Management major girlfriend to a T. Good job. XD. We both are ISTJ but I am IT student, yet we constantly talk about stuff like this. What makes her love her job is to help her staff and coworkers plan and be prepared to give guests the best service they can give, even when the odds are against her. Events are her thing. SERIOUSLY. But she is a super hard worker and she expects people to work hard, suck up their negativity, and work with each other to do the job. She sees the end goals and each task as important and makes sure they are done to the best abilities. It bothers her when people are too lax about why things are important and when they need her to "save the day" instead of doing what she said the first time. \n\nWhen it comes to dealing with other personalities, she tries to be diplomatic yet firm. She will not back down from her beliefs and if necessary will not hesitate to remind others of her title and their place. She is not mean when she does it, she just is assertive. Honestly she just loves real honest conversations with people when there are disagreements to see both sides of an issue and try and work things out. And no matter how annoyed she gets, she will try and not let that show during the altercation. When she does show it though, you best know you've royally pissed her off. She's known as She Hulk LMAO. As for introverts, she uses the "hospitality charm" as her professors call it and just works her way through things. It tires her out to no end and can annoy the ever-living crap out of her, but she does it to maintain professionalism. She loves her job, and she makes sure to let that show on and off the job. Her family is all in hospitality and she just was raised on it. It's her passion.\n\nOne of the ways she keeps her sanity when on a job working with all sorts of people is that she is very specific and up front about her expectations. She runs clubs and events all across our campus and she tells people what she expects from the get go. She sets deadlines for when she expects her tasks to be done and will help anyone and their mother with doing tasks, but she expects honest efforts and professionalism from all. She also expects communication ahead of time if things can't be done so she can see of others can finish a task, but will pour her heart into it if needed. She lives off of schedules and to do lists, and will alter her time if need be. Drives her insane, but she takes pride in her work.When my lady is not working hard on jobs or in school, you can find her curled up with books or doing some cool crafty thing. She wants to open an agritourism bed and breakfast (a small hotel with an interactive farm on the property) with a farm store for all the produce and products she and I make (and yes, she has this planned out too).\n\nIn short, you diagnosed your character correctly.  She sounds like she would be best friends with my girl. I hope this helps you out and could help her as well. :)

It used to be 3 oreos when I got home and 3 at night with a glass of milk. But since I got a job and can buy my own, it generally ends up being just the once in bed with a bowl of cereal and an entire sleeve of Oreos. Then I set the bowl on my chair, roll over and sleep to the white noise of my cat snoring.\n\nTL;DR It would be really easy to assassinate any one of us.

2	Am I ISTJ?	Hello, I'm one of those people who are forever confused about their MBTI type. I've looked a lot into it, looked at the cognitive functions, whatever. I can see myself all over the place. For the past little while I've been pretty consistently getting ISTJ (or ISTp for the socionics stuff) on tests, and my SO has read many profiles and agrees the ISTJ/p ones fit the best. \n\nI can see ISTJ, it makes sense. There's just some things that seem off to me.  One of the biggest things is how they seem to be aesthetic and dress well. I am pretty apathetic to how things look. I let my SO decide how our house is decorated and I often dress in just comfy clothes. I also have purple hair and tattoos. I don't wear makeup or like to wear dresses. I think I dress like a tom boy for the most part, often sporting a baseball cap with my purple hair just naturally hanging below. \n\nAlso, my rationale for having purple hair is that I always thought coloured hair looked pretty, and I am studying engineering so I know I wont be able to have crazy coloured hair when I am older. I might as well indulge myself now while I still have the chance. My hair isn't super well maintained and it looks pretty faded most of the time, but I find it really fun even looking kinda shitty. I just love the aesthetic of tattoos.. They are all easily hidden however.\n\nAnother thing that I really don't relate to is the classic "J" traits. I mean, I am bossy and I am never late, but I can be pretty messy and unorganized. I don't care for cleaning and I could easily live in a mess. Obviously, I feel better when my house is cleaner but it isn't a real priority to me. My partner is the one who usually initiates cleaning and he does the bulk of the work.\n\nWhere I do see ISTJ in myself has a lot to do with my work ethic. I am a very responsible, dependable person. I am the type of girl who gets her homework assignments done a week before they are due. I currently have a A average, and considering I am studying engineering, that's pretty good (most students are at around a C since most fail a few classes). \n\nI am the type of person who works really hard. If I am going to do something I give it my all. I'm always highly regarded at my workplaces, I often put too much stress on myself by trying to get everything possible done. However, once I get home I just want to cuddle into the couch and watch tv shows with my SO. \n\nAnother big thing I relate to is having emotional problems. By that, I mean I am incapable of dealing with my emotions well. When I am having a conflict I just close down. I don't understand emotions well, of myself or others, and I would rather never deal with them. I've been called cold by previously partners because of my reluctance to discuss feelings. It just doesn't seem relevant most of the time. My current partner is either a ISTP or ISTJ and we get along super well never talking about our feelings. On the odd occasion we have had to discuss emotions and its like pulling teeth for me. \n\nI am also extremely reserved. I basically only have 1 friend outside of my relationship and I am perfectly happy that way. However, I am very engaged in class, willing to answer questions and participate in the lectures. When comfortable with people I can be rather talkative and almost silly. I like to fool around and play, but with most people I am very formal. \n\nAt home with my SO, I like to sing, dance, joke, make funny faces and swear. I am a really silly, high energy person when at home with him. He's the only person I am like this with as I am totally comfortable with him (we poop in front of each other).\n\nI don't know, what do you think?\n
3	I don't dress well at all. I also went through a few years of random colored hair. I have 12 piercings and 1 tattoo. I never wear makeup and plain black and gray comfy clothes with moccasins are my "style". All the other stuff sounds pretty classic ISTJ for me. I'm also dating an ISTP/J and we get along super well because we're both kinda emotionless and cold haha.
3	I'm a messy istj. I like to say I am mentally organized but not physically organized. \n\nWhat I have read about istjs is that they will put hard work into things they find to be priorities and may neglect things they did to be extraneous. I'm not particularly concerned with physical organization or appearances just for the sake of those things.
1	I think you're more ISTP. Too relaxed to be an ISTJ. \n\nThe letters/cognitive processes are a spectrum. You're not just one or the other, but you do favour a certain side.\n\nI don't think either of ISTJ/P dress well or care about aesthetics. Practical people who want practical things. \n\nWhich of the following do you think describes you more:\n\nA: You identify logical patterns that exist in the external environment and have keen perception of any deviation from these patterns. Also, you desire to experience and experiment with the sensory aspects of life you have deemed to be most enjoyable and useful.\n\nor\n\nB: You have a powerful memory for what has worked well in the past and desire to structure your life around the traditions and positive outcomes of past experiences. You are also able to take concrete and effective action of your analysis too what the best thing would be to do in any situation.\n\nAnd if neither or both then you either have the wrong types totally or you're too young to properly type yourself as some of these things don't develop well until later in life.
7	Challenging Hobbies	Do any other ISTJs enjoy hobbies that allow you to feel a sense of self-improvement or productivity?\n\nSome examples for me right now are: Words with Friends, Rubik's Cubes, Competitive Pokemon, TF2, Programming. Anything with a learning curve.\n\nI'm looking for some more ideas too, so share yours below!
6	Ever kept an aquarium?  There's a lot you can learn from it, like water quality, fish biology, ecosystems, etc.  It's really fascinating for me.  I can sink hours of my time into research & reading, and then--here's the best part--I actually get to put it into practice.  (I'm also a chemist and used to work in an environmental testing lab, so it's really neat to use water quality principals irl.)
4	I love chess, I'm sure many ISTJ's think the same/
4	Cooking is a really great one too. Save money from not buying processed foods, eat exactly what you want, feel better from eating healthier. 
4	Is enjoying the learning curve a trait of ISTJs?  I sure do.\n\nI built my own 3D printer, just to learn the details hands-on.  Physical build, electronics, controller, firmware, all of it.  Once I've learned about all I can from it, suddenly I'm kind of cool to it and on to something else.  Usual cycle is 6 months to 2 years, depending on the pursuit.\n\nIs this normal?
3	I am occupied by Words with Friends, Overwatch, LoL, Web development
2	Almost exclusively. My hobbies are: 1:1 realistic combat trainer flight simulators (Falcon BMS), Kerbal Space Program (modded for maximum realism to learn how real life rocketry works), reading technical documents about rocket engines, highly granular physics based space combat engineering simulators (Children of a Dead Earth), programming, lifting weights, playing/practicing with my band. I'm in college now working towards an engineering degree and am very interested in space so my favorite hobbies all revolve around it. Almost all the video games I play (Arma, DCS, Falcon BMS, Kerbal Space Program, Children of a Dead Earth) have brutally steep learning curves and I love the process of tackling these hurdles, and the deep satisfaction that comes from playing games that have so much complexity.
2	Playing guitar (obviously).
2	I read a lot, and if I'm particularly interested in the subject I will read numerous books and websites on it. I'm currently studying a technical track in the I.T. industry. I don't know if it's really a hobby but I'm doing it on my own time and dime. Self-study is a big part of what I do in my free time.
2	This is awesome. Most of the type descriptions for ISTJ don't mention this facet of our personalities. But thinking about our function stack, it makes perfect sense. Our introverted sending lends itself nicely to remembering how we did something and how it felt to us, making mastery of things easier. Paired with our extraverted thinking, which helps us become efficient and organized, we're practically  programmed to want to pick up difficult tasks and Excel at them.\n\nI do this with similar things mentioned but also with stupid things. Like flipping a hammer. Or a water bottle. Or really anything. I've done it as a fidget most of my life to the point that I can get a decent feel for any object and "master" flipping it exactly once, twice, etc in a very short period of time.
1	I've been getting into lifting. Something that I thought I'd never ever do with my precious free time/alone time. And so far, just like I'd predicted, I think it's been one of the most challenging activities I've ever engaged.\n\n...been doing it once a week, then it became two. Now it's fluctuating between two and three times a week! Still challenging as hell, but my sex drive has improved =)
1	I would go with Shiny hunting pokemon and I normally go for the more "difficult" ones like the legendary/mythical ones. So far I only have Mewtwo in regards to legendary/mythical shinies. And recently I've started trying to make competitive pokemon and a few teams of them because I'm finally caught up in terms of Pokemon Games.
1	Definitely!!  I would add to that a sense of accomplishment...car repair, home improvement projects, reading....mostly done by myself. :-)
1	Mom and I are both ISTJs. Is this common?	So I'll cut to the chase. I just convinced my mom to take the MBTI test upon my suspicion that she was likely an ISTJ like me. As suspected, she is. Is it common for a mother and son (or any parent/child combo for that matter ) to have the same MBTI personality? Does this beg the question of nature vs. nurture?
1	Both my parents are both extroverts. I see many cases on other mbti subs or even here about people talking about their different type parents (or siblings) except for the rare occasion such as yours. So no I don't​ think so really, although I have no real evidence to say so, take it as a blank statement. 
1	Yea it happens.\nMy mom is actually the same type as me, so you're not alone on this one. \n\nAnd seeing as MBTI delves into how our brains function, I think it's more of a nature thing than a nurture one. I have 2 other brothers and they are drastically different than I am. \n\nWe were all raised in the same setting, went to the same school, etc. I know it probably isn't the best argument to base theory on personal experiences, but it doesn't hurt to throw that out there.\n\n\n\n
1	Considering ISTJ is the most common type, I'm sure this occurs often. 
1	From anecdotal experience, yes, you will inherit your personality from one of your parents. 
1	My father is an ISTJ, and I am exactly like him in most every way. \n\nMy mother is - big time extrovert, not sure of her MBTI, but I think they have made it work through 51 years of marriage because they complement each other. \n\nEdit: Corrected the extra "sure".
10	Weekly Thread: Superpowers! Which one would you want and why?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: if you could have a superpower, which one would you want and why?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
12	The ability to delve into others' minds and seek out information I desire to know.
12	Teleportation; cuz travel is such a hazard lol 
9	[deleted]
7	Mind reading and invisibility both sound incredibly cool and useful, but I am also interested in time manipulation. I could just do it with my mind haha. I always feel like there aren't enough hours in a day to get to do everything that I want to do. I would rewind time (like a Time-Turner) and also be able to freeze time.
5	Stop time. Make everyone shut the f*ck up every once in a while and being able to just be alone on the world for a little while.\n\n(And you can ofcourse do some kickass things)
5	Telekinesis 
3	To read minds.
3	This one's a toss-up. I'd want the abilities of Master Mind Excello from Marvel, who is so smart that he literally sees data in the world around him, but I'd also want The Multiple Man's ability to instantly clone himself. His thing was that he'd send a clone out to do something, then reabsorb it later, adding its experiences and memories to his own. One went through law school, another became a Shaolin monk, and so on. Imagine being able to focus your motivation to get something done into creating a copy of yourself who pretty much just wants to do that thing!
3	I would like to create portals/pathways similar to teleportation, but could exist indefinitely and have observation through possible. Like having a sort of at-will portal gun built into me, without having to see the target destination, and allowing variation of size and shape of the portal. \n\nAs for why, I would choose it because it would simultaneously be very practical in terms of travel, transport of objects, and could be used for great fun in general.
3	I would go for telekinesis. Given a strong enough mind you can have a lot of other powers (flight, pyrokinesis, super strength, time/space control [maybe? Idk much about that sort of physics]. 
3	I would go for perfect muscle control and perfect spatial awareness.\n\nOr the ability to fully control a Green Lantern ring.
2	I would like Darth Vaders force grip, just to ya know, send a message to the one annoying me.
1	To be good at anything I tried (and still gain satisfaction from it)
16	DAE feel bad because they're introverted	I don't know how to title this.\nI was supposed to be doing something out with my friends but after like an hour I all got way too much for me to handle. I was uncomfortable and my anxiety was through the roof. It was a new setting for me, lots of new people. I tried pretending I was enjoying myself, but I eventually said I was tired and left.\nI now feel shitty for leaving them and I also feel left out but that's really my fault. \nSometimes I just wish I could handle social situations better.
11	I used to but not anymore.\n\nSometimes my friends ask me to do something and I say that I have have plans, and by plans I mean drinking and playing games / watching TV by myself or SO.\n\nI'm guessing it becomes easier with age.
7	I sometimes get upset because I never get invited to things anymore. I only find out about all the fun things my friends are doing after the fact, or if I happen to check Snapchat stories. Work on Monday mornings is full of things that everyone did together, but without me.\n\nBut then I think about it: if they had asked me to join them, would I have gone? No. Did they used to ask me? Yeah. But I almost always said no. The few times I went were awful for me. So the invitations stopped coming, because why ask someone who says no every time?\n\nI don't mind this. It saves me having to come up with excuses. Working in an office full of people is draining enough. Just the thought of more social time makes my throat close a little. I never turned anything down rudely. I just mentioned other plans or begged off enough times that it solved itself. Perhaps your situation will do the same.
4	I do sometimes. My friends and family try so hard to include me in things and I either don't want to go or just feel like I want to escape the whole time I'm there. Nine times out of ten I'll refuse any offers and enjoy my time in my fortress of solitude.
3	This is funny you say this. Yesterday I was super excited to go to Pokemon league at my local hobby shop. Now I'm older, mid 20s. There were kids there. No big deal, I'm a kid at heart. Man by the end of that I was so ready to go. Ready to get away. It was very fun though. 
3	I don't. I've leaned I'm a much better friend in situations where I am comfortable. They all know that and accept it. \n\nThey'll be kind and invite me to parties but they'll say they don't expect me to go. \n\nIt helps I'm not on Facebook because a lot of things are arranged on there. \n\nI will go to milestones like birthdays of close friends, christenings, weddings and funerals - things like that. \n\nOtherwise I just make arrangements where it's intimate and I don't get the anxiety. \n\n
3	Not at all.
2	Never.
2	I used to.\n\nThen I talked to some old friends and they got it, even at that time. They knew I was introverted, they just wanted me to feel included.\n\nIf you feel bad, talk to them. Explain. If they don't get it and don't accept you, find new friends.
7	Struggling with career path. Any ISTJ designers?	Hi guys. This is my first post here. I learned that I am ISTJ only recently, but reading about this type of personality helped me connect the dots and realize that it fits like a glove.\n\nI work as a junior graphic designer at a branding firm in Poland. On a daily routine I am asked to create websites, concepts, and creative copy from a scratch. It is very difficult for me as I am a perfectionist who suffers form impostor syndrome. Long story short, I am never satisfied with my work and I am having doubts if I picked the right path of career.\n\nI am creative when it comes to ideas, but as far as graphic design is concerned, I find it demotivating to see so many better designers out there. They make me feel like my work is worthless. My co-workers have high expectations of me and demand creativity that I do not have, I am afraid.\n\nSo here's my question: are there any designers among you? How do ISTJ cope with creative tasks? If not design, would you choose a different career path? I was thinking about UX design (less visual design, more conceptualization) or QA testing (which requires programming skills that I do not have).\n\nI look forward to hearing from you. Thanks for each and every response in advance.
3	I'm also an ISTJ--an illustrator/3D artist who deals with a lot of character design work. Years ago, I used to think that I'm creative but it turns out that I'm more technical than creative. Having a strong imagination is obviously a plus in this field but because I've become quite a bit of a realistic person, I often feel weird about creating my own stories and characters. It's difficult when my technical side takes over my creative side sometimes. I tend to think a lot about the work process, especially in 3D work where there's many ways to get a certain thing done. And then it becomes worse when I can't figure out which solution works best for me unless I try it myself.  \n\nAs far as coping with creative tasks goes, I like to break down the major tasks into smaller chunks and give myself mini-deadlines. It's important for me to have these written down in my notebook so that I have a solidified objective to follow. I honestly don't enjoy the process of doing research but I can force myself into doing it if it's truly necessary. I get nervous if I'm given too much freedom in my work because I heavily rely on details. Can't say much about my creative process besides studying works of my favourite artists and trying to keep my art style different enough.  \n\nIf I had to pick a different career path, I'd probably go into software engineering or even UI/UX design too.
2	Impostor syndrome is tough. As someone who has struggled with it, I found as I progressed in my field (architecture), I realized that my doubts were not based in reality. I always considered my design sense to be "less than" people around me. It took a few years but I realize that the design sense is only one aspect of any creative job. You still have to manage details and timing and people and budget and a million other things. As an ISTJ, I am also your stereotypical "completer-finisher." This makes me an invaluable asset on any project team. Everyone has ideas (including me), but most of them simply can't get it accomplished. I've accelerated quickly in my career.\n\nTl;dr: don't worry about it. Don't let your self doubt get you. You very likely have a great mix of skills that will help you go far. Do what you want in life; the passion is what makes your career worthwhile.
2	I'm about 90% certain my dad is an ISTJ, and he's a excellent mechanical designer.  I know it's not the same as graphics design, but there is quite a bit of creativity required.\n\nThe past 10 years or so, he's been working as a pipe designer in the oil and gas industry.  He frequently refers to himself as "a dumbass draftsman" or "a dumbass machine designer working as a piper."\n\nHe is also an expert with AutoCAD and knows the ins-and-outs of the software much better than the majority of people working in his field and does quite a bit of work troubleshooting and setting up AutoCAD for coworkers.

1	Yes! I'm a surface/product designer in the US. I went to art school and all, knowing that I didn't really fit the artist stereotype. I wouldn't say I'm creative or think outside the box, but I am a problem solver and that why I'm a designer and not a fine artist. \n\nI didn't really have a backup career choice, though I was interested in dietetics and nutrition in high school. The medical field was always a top result when I took career aptitude tests, but I'm not sure if that's for me either.
1	Hi /u/kreativtek and all others who have already participated in this discussion and the ones who would keep this thread going in future!\n\nOkay, first of all I'm sorry for being a bit late for the party but I'm still doing this because I can so relate to /u/kreativtek's story here!\n\nEven I recently found out that I'm an ISTJ after which I read about this type of personality a lot over the internet. This might not have helped me seek answers to all the questions that have been bothering me for over two years, but the information has certainly helped me find logic for my shortcomings.\n\n\n** 99% Introverted | 75% Observant | 62% Thinking | 90% Judging | 53% Turbulent **\n(A sentinel whose strategy is constant improvement)\n\n\nI'm an industrial designer and I have been working on and off (either with design firms or as a freelancer) since I graduated (3 years back). But it hasn't worked out for me so well because of the following reasons:\n\n1. As put very precisely in the first post, I also get demotivated to see works of other designers who I feel are so better than me. Being a perfectionist I'm never able to work up to my own standards. So I'm never happy and always end up doubting my ideas unless someone backs it up by appreciating it. This attracts stress on a regular basis.\n\n2. I recently realized that my analytical brain is dominant over its intuitive/creative counterpart and I rely on facts and details, hence I'm more technical/fact-oriented than creative. I mean I am good when it comes to solving a problem (with defined parameters) -- I'm always looking for a definite problem and a systematic approach/process to deal with it -- but if I'm given freedom in my work I get very nervous of the unknown, I need specific details to move ahead otherwise I would just be lost (as an industrial designer it's difficult for me to critically analyze intangible parameters like shape of a product, surfaces purely focused at defining aesthetics, etc.\n\n3. Being faithful to one of the important personality traits of an ISTJ, I always try to stick to what's tried and tested without feeling the need to explore much (a trivial example, I always try to take the known routes around the city to get to a place even if I know I can find a probable alternate and shorter route). -- living my life with the mentality "If it ain't broken, why fix it?" -- this restricts me from ideating with as many ideas as possible during any design project.\n\n4. These three years, while I was trying to survive in the industry, made me realize that having a good design sense isn't enough to be a good designer. One has to deal with many other practical aspects of design like constraints and not-so-reasonable expectations from the client's end, managing vendors, costing, etc. Now I'm not so good at dealing with people/managerial skills, I would rather sit alone and work in peace (even if it requires me to work my ass off).\n\n5. I don't readily accept changes and if there is a sudden change of plan/idea/timeline during a project I get nervous. I just have to take some time out to re-plan things before acting and set my brain along the new direction.\n\n6. I also have come to realize that I have turned into quite a realistic person who often questions things before working towards them. If it doesn't make sense to me I would try my best to avoid doing it. \n\nNOW MY QUESTIONS ARE :\n\na. How important intuitiveness is for a designer to be really good at work?\n\nb. Would it be wise of me to choose a different career field, which is more detail based and demands structure? (I would also prefer pursuing a career which allows me to help people on a one-on-one basis, it really brings joy to me OR working with/for the environment).\n\nc. If not (b) then I can even divert my career towards digital design -- a more structured area of design like UI/UX (I'm not so keen on doing this) or Animation and Game Design (but I fear I would end up facing the same problems from my experience in Industrial design).\n\nI'm really sorry for being this elaborate but I could really use some advice at this point of my career! Thank you so much for staying with me till the end. Cheers!
9	Is this accurate? If so, what now? Formerly scored INTJ several times	
3	It can be accurate, but also inaccurate. Read about the theory now and decide for yourself.
2	I don't know if it is accurate but I used to get INTJ all the time too but now that I am older I get ISTJ.\n\nEDIT: Also got ISTJ on this test
1	I've done the test multiple times and i've come out as ISTJ each time.
9	What's the biggest mistake you've personally ever made?	I've noticed you guys tend to think things through very carefully, so I was just wondering what you guys have done that wasn't so well thought out or didn't exactly work out as planned.
5	I gave advice to a friend during a tough time in his relationship.\nAll the blame fell on me.
3	[deleted]
4	Fell into heavy drinking during a tough time, and caused the end of a 12 year relationship in the process with the clamming up and being "distant" and unhappy.
3	I kept in my life for years people that I considered friends when actually they did not care about me and were just waiting for the opportunity to hurt me. They sorta ganged up on me and I ended up alone. It's all well now and I'm ok and happy but at the time I was devastated. One of them after a year or so sent me a long apology letter that confirmed my initial suspicions (that they were only envious of my success, and the envy/hatred towards me was the only thing that kept them together). I probably should have felt happy but I just pitied them.
3	Thinking everything through carefully is probably my biggest regret, ironically.
3	Nearly sliced off the end of my left pinky cutting open expired packages of "Lil' Smokies" sausages to dump out for the cats.\n\nThat was a hair over three weeks ago.  It's closed up and I can mostly do everything I could before.  I still can't quite play guitar with it; not that I was any good with that instrument to begin with.
3	Doing drugs. It's like looking at yourself in the mirror and seeing what you could have become but can't anymore because your mind doesn't work anymore. 
16	How do you guys act during extroverted exhaustation?	I don't really know how it is called, just made that up.\n\nI'm referring to occasions when because you had no time to recharge or opportunity to administrate yourself you burn out your outgoing "extroverted" rope.\n\nPersonally, I just become dead quite. I instantly lose any and all motivation to speak or do things and just stay put watching things while waiting for my bottom battery (1-10%) to recharge or to have the opportunity to slip away and if possible listen to music. I have been told that when that happens I look so serious I actually look scary. \n\nEDIT: Viewing some submissions I have to add, that if I am in a stressful environment I can act quite aggressively or rudely, which seldom happens. \n\n\nWanted to know how people of the same type react when that happens.
10	I usually put up a facade and reduce my functions to the bare minimum while at the same time trying not to be unpleasant. Then I go home and I don't go out for a few days. 
10	I become incredibly grumpy. I say rude things, I stop caring about people or what they have to say, I see everything as an imposition, and a lose all mental focus. I hate it.
5	I'm usually pretty sarcastic but when burnt out, my sarcasm hits a new level and my frontal lobe loses some function. I also get irritated by the smallest things. It usually shows on my face and people ask "what's wrong?" which is the exact wrong thing to ask. 
3	If people are paying attention to me and I'm 'extrovertedly exhausted,' I become so viciously bitter. I say rude, awkward things that make people want to stop interacting with me (I guess it works). This can snowball badly when people become 'concerned' about how I am acting, and want to give me attention so I don't feel 'left out.' I have had to just leave situations before and am kinda known for the spectacularly poor first impressions I give people in large social situations.\n\nWhen I'm exhausted and people are fine to leave me alone, I am just 100% quiet and very observant. But then I can recover a bit, so it's nice. It it a pleasant feeling being 'alone' with a group of people, when none of them want to interact with you, but you can listen and watch and laugh at jokes. It's too bad lots of people feel uncomfortable when there's a quiet dead-weight in their social group :/
2	Im in this state right now, so I can describe very accurately: \nI strive being in a cozy spot not talking to anyone, and I don't want anyone to talk to me much since I can get pretty grumpy and react rudely (which is not very common). In this state I don't have stamina to deal with what other people want from me and I just want them to not bother me and let me do my own thing, aka relax, introspect and get my stuff done, listen to music or maybe nap/lay around if I'm too tired. \nFor example, I can get in this state just when I get home after college.\n\nHowever, I don't necessarily have to be left alone; I've observed that I can recharge sharing the room with my girlfriend (ENTP). She understands my needs, so sometimes we just are in the same room together but doing our own thing separately and maybe cuddle randomly and calmly exchange a few words. This is a great time to recharge for both, I can fulfill the needs I exposed before and she can do whatever (reading, watching something, chores...) while being around people (me in this case), which is something that helps her recharge. This way it flows perfectly.
2	I just go on my phone and ignore everyone 
1	OH MY GOD that is exactly the description I was looking for. I just showed this to my friend because I could never explain this properly but yeah this happens to me often. For example I am used to being around people in school and I usually have afternoons to myself. When for some reason I have to be around people all day, after some time I get exhausted of talking and socializing. It's not that I don't want to hang out with people, it's just that I need some alone time. I am often asked whether I'm okay- and I am. But that seriousness you were describing made me laugh out loud because it is so accurate. I love this sub.
1	"exhaustion" is a real word.  So "extroverted exhaustion" does capture well what happens.  I like it!\n\nI've actually just walked outside during a family gathering to "get some air" when that happens.  My E tendency has me eagerly anticipating such gatherings, and I really enjoy it for a while.  Then, not so much.  Then, my I tendency takes over and I need some space!\n\nMy I vs E is nearly at 50/50 when I take these surveys.  In practice, this results in some kind of balancing system.\n\nIf I'm alone too long, I need to find people.  If I'm around people too long, I need to get alone.  My wife's the same way.  Fortunately, we understand that about each other, and we can give each other space when needed.
1	One of my best friends is quite extroverted.  He invites me to music concerts a lot.  I go to be social, and it's good to see him and his girlfriend.  After about 3 hours of loud music and trying to hold conversations over the music, I shut down and quit trying to communicate with anyone.  20/30 minutes later, I do my handshakes/hugs and bail out, to enjoy my solitude and quiet.  They've gotten to the point where they expect me to bail "early" (they don't mind though).
6	Weekly Thread: What are your guilty pleasure movies?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what are your guilty pleasure movies? The ones that you've seen a dozen times, but will always go back to if you're looking for a movie to watch? \n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
8	The Devil Wears Prada. I mean, I can't stand Anne Hathaway whatsoever but Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are total win.
8	Pitch Perfect.  I loves me some Anna Kendrick singing.
5	Star Wars Ep. IV & V\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas\nLord of the Rings Trilogy (mainly Two Towers)\nHobbit Trilogy
4	Shawshank Redemption anytime, anywhere! And There Will Be Blood. I love the ending when he bashes Eli's head in with a bowling pin like it's just another day. Totally cruel but I get a good chuckle every time, LOL. 
3	I'm going to have to go with Superbad and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Maybe I have a thing for Michael Cera.\n\nAlso, not a movie but The Office. Currently rewatching for the 8th or 9th time. 
3	Goodfellas. I love Scorsese (especially his directive style for this movie), the main cast is a great fit. Narrative style is engaging. I also just really like the 50s-60s mafioso/wise guy culture (for entertainment purposes anyway) and I think Goodfellas really does it well. 
3	Hot Rod, Fight Club, and any Lord of the rings movies. 
2	The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Something about it just resets me mentally. 
2	The Raid 1 or 2, whenever I need my fix of mindless but well choreographed violence with a basic and decent plotline.
2	How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days.  I don't even know why.... it's cute, ha.
2	I don't know if it is a guilty pleasure, but in terms of movies I have seen dozens of times I would have to say Riki-Oh!: The Story of Ricky. I have seen it an obscene number of times.\nI don't think I have any movies that I'd be embarrassed to watch.
2	The Sound of Music, Mulan, 10 Things I Hate About You, Les Choristes, and some others but those are the main ones.
2	While You We're Sleeping. 
2	ISTJ: will not put a little bit of natural chaos? as you get up in the morning do you do order?	???
6	Your question is unclear.\n\nI have a morning routine, if that's what you're driving at.
3	Are you asking if we will put up with a little bit of natural chaos?  If so, then yeah. Personally, I wouldn't be able to stand the exact same schedule for my whole day like down to the minute. However, I like having things such as my night and morning time routine be the same. 
2	My fiancé is the natural chaos around me, but I like to keep a standard routine if at all possible in the morning.
1	I have absolutely no pre-defined routine. I wake up when I wake up, I go to sleep when I go to sleep, and I do everything else when I get around to doing it. I keep track of what needs to be done in some amount of time, but I rarely schedule myself for things. Life is too unpredictable to not welcome some amount of chaos. 
5	Looking for a major that can be finished in 3 years tops with best job availability, gaining higher positions, income, and overall best fit for an ISTJ like myself	This is a similar topic I posted in INTP because I thought I was an INTP but I took several cognitive function tests on different websites and got the same result: ISTJ. So, I will post this question to my fellow ISTJs out there that are hopefully in these careers (first-hand perspective) or know other ISTJs who are currently in these careers (second-hand perspective).  \n\nHi I have been confused about the myer Briggs personality test in the past and have read a book on the subject as well as visiting several websites and have switched from intj to intp to intf and finally I believe I am istj. My reason for believing this is that I have quickly realized after reading on many topics in this subeddit based on others topics and the way they react in their personal situations dealing with other people, their thoughts in public/private situations, their description of their behavior in public/private situations, their hobbies/personal interests, and even their view on life.. that I definitely am close to an istp for most of my daily life (mostly with my family and by myself..and then the F comes in when I work at my retail pharmacy technician job or my other retail job which involves a lot of customer interaction and listening as well as showing as much emotion that I can convey to the best of my ability.. which drains my energy). I am currently a graduate with BA in biology under my belt and would like to pursue another degree (preferably a masters for better job market opportunities in the greater Detroit area where I live). I am considering the following options and would like a short timeline in terms of acquiring the degree, the required skills, and easy availability of job since I am focused on making more money; however, I'd like to enjoy the job somewhat. These are the careers I am considering based on reading and interacting with professors in these fields and reading in this subreddit (a lot of software developers/ comp sci majors on here):\n\nsoftware development/software architect\n\n\nFinance (my hobby involves creating a money management system along with a wagering system for the pick 3 lottery using software that generates lists of numbers and finding the best ROI for short term and long term goals of a gaining the best investment for my money.. I play on pen and paper and it's interesting to analyze and test different systems.. a career similar to this would be awesome.. I figured finance or investment management would be close to this).\n\n\nIndustrial engineering\n\n\nGlobal supply chain/logistics\nNursing (because of high availability of jobs although I'm not very social but I have experience as a pharmacy technician in catering to patients needs somewhat.. although most of what I do is refill prescriptions and take care of rebill issues with a somewhat friendly demeanor within the pressure of retail get-it-done fast and move onto the next patient queuing system that retail pharmacy is based on..)\n\n\nRespiratory therapy (found this in This subreddit looked interesting the jobs in Michigan aren't too high though but I'd still pursue it if possible and it's a short timeline to obtaining the degree, need to read more on this career)\nComputer science in general (until I find a specialization)\n\n\nData scientist (the university i graduate from - wayne state - is releasing a new program that is roughly 3 years long that involves the engineering and systems engineering department, business school department, and computer science department into a masters of data science degree.. problem is that it requires GRE and my comfort on taking those kind of tests is at an all time low but I'd probably be willing to study for it if I find the right resources to study from and prepare for it efficiently). This program interests me because of the data analysis and tests as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence/neural networking used in analyzing data which relates back to my hobby of analyzing pick 3 lottery data for my test and backtesting systems to establish wagering and bankroll management systems in order to recieve highest ROI.. something that really interests me like a game or puzzle I need to solve.. and can make money from with proper discipline and established rules for my personal betting style.. This degree flips that investment management into quantitatively analytical view that I'd enjoy to gain as a skill for my own personal enjoyment).\n\nSo those are my options at the moment\n\n
2	This seems interesting (the bringing the money to the organization part is an interesting skill to obtain) because I enjoyed my English classes a lot in high school and college and writing papers was sometimes boring but relaxing and an interesting experience of using my creative side which I didnt use a lot in other classes besides English ( a bit time consuming but once I get into the flow writing is just a great outlet for me to present my ideas clearly about topics that I do research on). I wonder what the job availability and pay are for this career in my area. Thank you for sharing this career with me I'll do more further research. 
1	What about Physician Assistant? If you have a degree in Biology you likely have all of the prerequisites already. The PA program is typically a master's degree. Job outlook is expected to grow considerably and pay ranges from 80-120k on average
1	Have you considered a coding bootcamp? They seem really rigorous due to their compressed timeline. 
1	Software engineering.
1	Already have a biology degree and pharmacy experience, why not just make the jump to pharmacist? Seems logical to me. If you don't like retail or normal pharmacy, check out Nuclear pharmacy. I'm a nuclear med tech and can say nuclear pharmacists have it pretty good. 
1	Wow very thorough answers will re-read this and check those websites out thanks for taking the time to answer.. this is so close to my hobby as well it's exciting to know I can finish much quicker than I thought because I used to read about people who started coding at age 12 and was discouraged by my lack of experience but if I can still gain the skills and knowledge in 3 years for this career then I will keep this as an open option. Thanks! 
1	Awesome thank you.. that is quite pricey and I'm currently on student loans at the moment but I can figure out a way to save some money on the side for one of these programs or hopefully they have a monthly payment plan.
1	Interesting I wonder if the Detroit area has a decent availability of jobs for this career. I'll check this out and read more about it and it's programs and number of jobs in my area. It seems like a really cool career to get into especially the IT side you mentioned.. I'm beginning to favor the technology careers the more I work in retail pharmacy (I just don't know if I can handle interacting with patients anymore.. it is overwhelming in a retail setting and it might only be slightly better in a hospital setting with less of a crowd of people trying to get their prescriptions ready in only 10 minutes such as in retail pharmacy). But, this career if better than hospital setting (like you said) is definitely an option thank you for letting me know about it I will check it out and look more in depth. 
1	This is a great question that I have been recently contemplating.. in my own work environment of retail pharmacy. Patients come in crowds and have high expectations of us (filling prescriptions within 15 minutes, yelling at us if their medication isn't ready when they get a phone call from our very imperfect computer system, yelling at us for a simple rebill issue that can be fixed with a few strokes of a keyboard and a few clicks of a mouse button to rebill the updated or not-on-their profile insurance or to fix another techs mistake of billing the patient as cash from the day before). On top of that there is drama between the coworkers that I cannot stand.. I just want to work and finish up the day by completing my tasks as efficiently as possible and patiently getting yelled at all the time on top of hearing about so and so not working and saying this and that about someone else is irritating.. but that is in a very fast paced retail environment and if it was a slower paced work environment I'd definitely be able to handle it.. nursing comes to mind because although they move around a lot they do have to stick with one patient for a certain amount of time before going onto the next while doing "rounds." Also, I heard from other people working at hospitals that the environment is more friendly and slightly more relaxed than retail which intrigues me. The detail oriented part isn't so hard once you eliminate the fast paced, anxiety filled environment of retail in my opinion. I'll check out public administration and it's availability.. it seems interesting. Also will keep nursing open for the same reason. Thanks.. oh and I am a man lol I can't believe I didnt mention that haha 
18	A short video summary of the ISTJ personality type	Hey Guys, I am an ENTP and I am creating short video summaries for each type as a side-project.\nI just finished the ISTJ video and thought I'd let you know :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLVc59lM444\n\nI really love reading feedbacks so let me know what you think! Enjoy! :)
10	Some quick thoughts because you mentioned liking feedback -- and if you want to hear more, just let me know! But the biggest points...\n\n1. This is fairly good in terms of ISTJ videos -- I would say it is definitely in the top half, and probably in the upper quartile! (This tentative phrasing is primarily because I haven't watched every single video out there -- of those that I've watched, it is a strong example I'd be comfortable linking to someone else as a reasonable review of ISTJs.) It avoided several of the major issues that other ISTJ videos fall into, such as implying that ISTJs need to learn to think instead of obey, or implying that ISTJs are like a quaint, old, outdated watch that is fun to admire and look at, but that is unnecessary and overdone in the modern world.\n\n2. I do think videos generally understate the extent to which ISTJs value *sensible and effective* tradition, not just tradition for tradition's sake. That is, we value the things that someone might say, "That is so stupid," but then when they get experience they go, "Ooooooh that is why it is done that way - that makes sense." We like to do things by the book -- if the book is a good book. But this is where our strong opinions and perfectionistic tendencies come into play. Where some types say ISTJs are essentially bureaucrats par excellence -- we will be just as frustrated and even outraged by inefficiency and stupid procedure as anyone else. And so we're unlikely to ever be in the happy position of finding a book that is so well written that we'd live by it. However, we will try to find something as close as possible. After all, people don't hire you if you say, "Yeah, I think there are a lot of problems with how you do things so I am going to do things my way and it will be better." And we're not going to lie to get hired. So if "the book" is poorly written, we're probably not going to be found in that job.\n\n3. ISTJs might be encouraged to check out that emotional intelligence book also simply because we are less likely to check it out on our own -- and/or more likely to put it at the end of our reading list after books about task management, efficacy, etc! I think making an argument that our reading and research is out of balance will make a strong case for prioritizing that book. I mean, I could feel myself thinking, "...if I ever have free time, yeah, that would probably be a good one." But by now, I know I never will feel like I have enough free time to read that book. So you might argue, "I know you have a reading list that you are trying to get to -- but it is exactly your tendency to read those books first (on things that have nothing to do with emotional intelligence) that makes this topic an area of potentially greater oversight and harm than you realize! However, this is a good book to quickly get you to a basic level of competency in this area that you might not be as comfortable with."\n\n4. Another *really* overlooked mistyping is INTP. We are both thinking introverts -- and the judging-first approach of INTPs (Ti) plus the open-minded exploration of their perceiving function (Ne) can look very similar to the perceiving-first approach of ISTJs (Si), which is naturally uncritical and more about categorization, accuracy, true perception, sorting and processing of incoming information about the world, as supplemented by their externalized logic and judgment (Te). I can speak more to the similarities and differences if you like, but for now, I will just say that I think this is a hugely overlooked mistype (and I think ISTJ/ENTP would not be unthinkable either, as an ISTJ who thought they were an ENTP for a long time). Given the stereotypes out there, it sounds laughable in a way... but there are solid function-based reasons that those mistypings could occur.\n\n5. I would be curious to hear more on the over-representation of ISTJs in business and finance. Particularly in the USA (where I'm at so the only experience I can speak to), there is a lot of income inequality that leads to suspicion and distrust towards businesses and finance. So when ISTJs are over-represented in those fields, I feel like it can play into the bias of some individuals towards seeing ISTJs as unfeeling bees hoarding honey and stinging anyone who comes near. A hateful nuisance that gets in the way of what the people want, which is the delicious, sweet, bee-goo that is honey. (The more direct example would be people feeling like taxes are a huge paperwork nonsense that is designed to steal money from people and stuff it into an over-fed government -- and like we're not even the masterminds behind it, we are the obedient hallway guards and desk-monkeys that carry out the plan.) So... in the research showing we are over-represented, does it do any measure of quality? I imagine ISTJs would be more likely to be represented in the Swiss bank than in a bank that tries to take advantage of its customers, for instance -- but I don't know that my intuition is correct. But if it is, and that were true and were shared alongside that other factoid, it would do a lot to resolve the potential for a bias being reinforced/projected.\n\nHope this is of some value -- and overall, while I can always see room for improvement in anything, your video is nice. Nothing triggered my relatively sensitive "arg, you stereotype-peddler" sense :) Which may sound like faint praise, but believe me, it has been very sensitized by some of the stuff that is out there. In watching it, I trusted your motives, and I didn't sense bias, which is rare and something I strongly value. Some of my advice is more about proofing it against misunderstanding from people who will be inclined to project bias (as we all are, to some degree!) than about any explicit issues with your work.\n\nThanks for letting us know about the video, and for soliciting feedback from us, too! :)
2	I really liked that! Going to watch some more :) 
2	I really liked it too. You did a great job, keep it up!
2	This was really good!
1	TIL I'm actually an ISFJ. Shit.
10	Can you help me differentiate between Ni and Si?	As you can see from my flair, I'm still uncertain whether I fit better into the INTJ camp or the ISTJ one. The main point of confusion is whether I lead with Ni or Si, since they seem so similar to me. I tend to test as INTJ, and when I pick out the cognitive functions myself I nearly always end up with INTJ (except when I pick a combination that doesn't exist), but other people think I sound like an ISTJ. So, super confused. \n\nThis probably gets asked a lot here, but since you guys are the experts in being ISTJ, could you ask me some questions that you think would differentiate between Ni and Si? Is it possible that I might just not fit into either? 
3	when you look at something (clothes, food, cars, people, animals, etc) do you think about what concrete impression it makes on you (pleasant/unpleasant, etc) or does it represent/*mean* X in an abstract conceptual framework?  \n\nIf you don't really understand what the second would feel like you're more likely in the first camp\n\nthe first looks at objects as being the things themselves that really matter, with any abstract categorization being not particularly real, but rather a kind of useful fiction or secondary layer.  the second looks at objects, while still "real" but, as being understood primarily in terms of what they *stand for* i.e.: their meaning: how they fit into the meaning of everything else\n\nboth types can go back and forth--either can think of objects in terms of concepts or as concrete things which they are experiencing directly via the impressions (subjective sensations) they're making, but its which you default to that determines which you value\n\nthe difficulty in differentiating the two in concrete scenarios is that they fulfill the same function and often lead to identical results.  take for instance picking out a shirt:  the sensor would look at it and take in the impression it makes on a more or less gut level and decide then if that is the impression he wants to make on others, subject, of course, to the approval of the impression it makes on themselves (how it feels to wear it).  with the intuitive they would more or less go through the same process but by conceptual means, in other words they'd be like "does this make me look fat"  "will this match with my other stuff" "will sally like this" "is this pretentious or overdone."  the sensor does not isolate the abstract conceptual representation of the object but rather deals with it directly.  the intuitive will abstract out the relevant factors it elicits and then plug them into a broader conceptual understanding.  *in this way* sensing is actually somewhat "intuitive" according to a colloquial understanding of the word [1]. \n\nsensors are more likely to like what they like and not think in terms of abstract inter-connectedness, but when pressed could probably provide excellent reasons as to the "why" (sensors tend to be *better* than intuitives at taking care of themselves, because of how finely tuned their Si is, whereas Ni is not particularly strong in this area)\n\na lot of this comes down to 2D Si + 4D Ni (INTJ) v 4D Si + 2D (Ni) ISTJ, hence the overlap.  Meaning INTJs use intuition to understand and meet society's standards when it comes to dress, hygeine, etc.  Whereas ISTJs use Si to gauge how they're doing in regards to society's expectations of their conceptual understanding of things: in other words things break down and fail to work or begin to create negative sense impressions once things are conceptually messed up and the conceptual understanding needs to be updated or improved.  ISTJs look to how the world (or their internal state) is functioning to diagnose a potential conceptual problem, whereas INTJs would look conceptually as to "the why" in understanding a concrete problem\n\nISTJ: something is not working for me (could be aesthetic, or an internal sense of discomfort or a literal mechanical breakdown in the world, creating a negative sense impression) I need to investigate possibilities as to why and how to fix it (Ne)\n\nINTJ: these concepts have contradictions I need to update my concrete understanding (knowledge of facts) in order to find some way to reconcile them (Se)\n\nthey both use Te to solve problems, but they use either Si or Ni to identify them to begin with.  Si starts with the concrete impression something makes on you, Ni starts with the conceptual meaning of the thing\n\n[1] my explanation here sounds a lot like the thinking function, but I think its the inevitable result of trying to describe intuition in thinking terms.  this is not meant to represent a *systemic* bottom up Ti understanding of "what to wear"--that would look qualitatively different--only the intuitive perception of the implications in general terms of clothing, whereas it is left to thinking to *judge* how to proceed
2	Please watch this [ISTJ Video](https://youtu.be/Go-4DZHKJdI). Its the only video that gives ISTJ's the respect the respect they're due.\n\nISTJs and INTJs despite what people will tell you are both future oriented. The difference is their attitude toward the future.\n\nISTJs prepare for the future in a **defensive** way. Their focus is preparation for an uncertain future based on concrete facts. ISTJs wont assert things unless its been meticulously analyzed. Their nature has a skeptical bent to it. Not to say that ISTJs are more inclined to atheism than INTJs. But ISTJs are more skeptical of new things based on pure mental *conjecture*(meaning projection into the future). Things need to be more played out than just with a person's vision. In this way ISTJs are more meticulous than INTJs.\n\nSi has been notoriously hard for people to describe. Part of this is because Carl Jung was an INFJ and describing Si is almost as hard as describing a new color to someone who has never seen it. The other problem because Typology does rely on baseless assumptions to begin. You must assume you fit into a category for your category to be found. And we must assume almost everyone fits into a category. For me at least Myers Briggs has played out and passed my scrutiny for being valid. Unfortunately because of this double catch Si dominants have trouble putting their Si into words. Its used so frequently that it is viewed as just normal to the Si type.\n\nI think its is a huge misconception that Si is not abstract. What I've found is that introverted functions have an affinity for abstraction. Ill let someone else explain why because I won't do it justice. [Empirical vs. Interpretative, Part 1](https://youtu.be/PslZmOXOChE) and [Empirical vs. Interpretative, Part 2](https://youtu.be/y3fEi1EgmQ4)\n\nI'm an ENFP so yeah. ISTJs rock tho.
1	If you read through the personality profiles for both, which fits better?\n\nMy I and S are both quite middle valued, and may vary to E or N depending on the day and whether I answer a couple of questions one way or the other.  So I looked up all 4 types combining the first two possibilities, and ISTJ is my clear type.  The other 3 all had deal-breakers in them, that said "Whoa, that's *not* me.".  ISTJ was all comfortable and familiar.  It's also the one I most often get when doing the surveys, so I guess that's me!
3	Weekly thread: what do you miss about your childhood?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what makes you nostalgic for your childhood? \n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
6	Simplicity.
5	I miss being excited by the simplest and stupidest of things, like spontaneous trips to the ice cream store, or being allowed to watch an extra half-hour of TV. I feel like as an adult, life has to try a lot hard to get me to that same level of excitement. 
4	The lack of responsibility and the abundance of time
5	Not knowing what hardships were ahead of me. Everything was so simple. I've recently seen pictures of me as a young (3-4) child. I was smiling stupidly, like I had nothing to worry about. I had no clue what I was in for. It's that *innocence* that I miss. Only in hind sight though, because I didn't realize I had it until recently.
3	Not having to worry about money.
3	This might sound silly, but coming home from school, signing on AIM, and seeing that my crush was signed on my buddy list. Just innocent little things like that are the things I miss about my childhood. 
2	I'm only 18, but I already miss how simple things used to be. No complex relationships, no anxiety as I grew  with the same people since age 6 and didn't realize I had it (its better now tho), no carrer/future concerns. Everything was fun and games.
2	Not having to worry about anything. The joy of possibility.
2	I kind of miss playing football.  Playing at a podunk school meant playing both sides of the ball, so I got to trash talk people and smash into them for an hour.
2	I was thinking the other day how I miss climbing trees and staying there for what seemed like hours and eating candy.  \nI'm in my 40s now so I also miss being able to eat whatever I want lol.
2	The normal stuff. I think what I miss most is how little I worried about anything. And that I was more imaginative as a child and had a free spirit. Where as more that I'm an adult I worry about things everyday and don't take time to just enjoy the world around me. 
2	I miss having fun recklessly and all the energy I had when I was a kid. Growing up made me so risk-averse, and now I'm afraid to do fun things (e.g. somersaults on a trampoline) because of the nagging feeling that I have to play it safe.
16	Keeping Friends in Separate Boxes	Do you find that you subconsciously put friends into categories based on there place in your life?\n\nI, [ISTJ, 5w6], hate it when people from different parts of my life know each other.\nIt's hard for me to figure out the new social environment, when people groups mix.\nFor example, recently my friends from college and I went to my house for a break, and I had a lot of anxiety from the fact that I didn't know how to think or act because I have different ways of interacting with each group.\n\nDo you all find similar problems?
22	I'll find some friends and let you know
3	You must remember the Seinfeld ["Worlds Colliding"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBZVaNpwub8) sketch.
2	I totally feel you on the part where you said you have different ways of interacting with each group and feel unsure about mixing them. While I do like to talk about my friends from one group to my friends from another group (mostly to share interesting/funny things they do) I do think there's a line drawn between how close they can come to interacting with each other. Personally it's only if I really trust a friend (ie. know they won't judge me regardless) that I let them mix into my other group of friends.
2	Same here, almost exactly as you described. Part of it for me is that I'll be friends with one person or group of people because we have some interests in common, and then I'll be friends with another person/group because we have a different interest in common, and so when you mix them I don't know what to do because I can't talk to either group about our shared interest because the other group won't understand anything and be left out.
2	Don't put them in boxes! What if you forget about them and they can't get out? \n\nI actually kind of relate to this. Not that I have enough friends to keep separate, but I act different around workmates than I do around acquaintances from the Internet and from my family. If they ever met I'd be freaking out. 
1	This exactly. I recently had a friend from one "zone" come into another and it really messed me up
1	Ugh, same! ISTJ 5w6 as well!\n\nIt's like... these people are supposed to be separate mentally! I don't like these groups mixing with each other! How am I supposed to deal with this new biochemistry?
1	What does 5w6 mean
1	When this happens, I'm usually just sitting at the side, very amused, seeing how the interaction is going given how little these two groups have in common. It's not stressing at all for me since I'm comfortable. I can talk to both sides when I want to, and if I want to. \n\nBut I prefer to let them sweat it out a little before I try to do anything. Keeps things fresh.
5	Self Expression?	How do you guys express yourselves, artistically or otherwise? Do you feel the need for a creative outlet? What form does that take?
6	I don't think I really express myself that often. If I'm creative at all, it's at coming up with weird scenarios in my mind. I don't do much externally.\n\nIf I do something externally (like sing or something) I hate other people being around.
1	Makeup or cake decorating. 
1	Code.
1	I compose music. Improvisation can be relaxing if I'm in a decent mood. Other than that, I like to write. If I have an interesting dream, I'll add it to my dream journal and maybe it'll inspire me to write a story of sorts.
1	I write poems and songs a little. I want to start composing music again, but I fell off the wagon during university and I've forgotten a lot of the little I knew.\n\nI play the guitar, but the vast majority of the time I play music written by somebody else, so it's less "creative" (though there's interpretation involved with classical) and more "outlet".
1	I do like to paint (with watercolors mainly, sometimes acrylics) and sketching, I like to use my hands on my free time, to keep busy, rather then just watching tv or something,  so I guess it's more of a need to do something hands on rather than a 'need' to be artistic, I do enjoy it thou!  
1	Through playing music honestly. I play guitar and a little bit of bass.
1	My bf is ISTJ. He's always been artistic. But wasn't a fan of abstraction. :P His art teacher would always tell him he didn't have to perfectly finish things down to the last detail, that he could be a little looser and freer, etc. His dream was to go into Industrial Design as a major (which was a nice meld of his aesthetic and technical abilities) but he couldn't afford the tuition so he went into technical school instead and has a career in Construction now. 
3	Sup! You guys are still missing from this thread.	
5	we are istj, of course we are
2	Just an ISTJ thing.
1	Of course we are.\n\nStill, [I shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5wxyu2/_/del46bk)
1	I don't do much in the way of pictures, but I attemtped to share as well. \n\nThis: https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5wxyu2/z/df0sf2e
10	Confused ENFP with an ISTJ father	I'm an ENFP, so having an ISTJ father is kinda hard in the sense that I can't really tell what he's thinking. I feel like it's hard to bond with him at times and I'm not sure if he even cares that much. Sometimes his actions will say that he really cares, like a lot. Other times, it seems like he doesn't give a living crap about me. I mean, he's my dad so he has to care at least a little bit but just how withdrawn he is a lot of the time makes me question things. Plus it always seems like his expectations are unreachable. For example, the first time I took the ACT, he said a 30 should be my goal, which I thought was insane to begin with. I ended up with a 32 with a perfect score on the science section. A month later, he said that it would be nice if I could get a 33. I took it again and got a 34. Now he's saying it would be nice if I could get a 35. Like, um sir I am well above a 30 which was the *original* goal are you friggin kidding me? I get that some ISTJs are like this, but still it frustrates me at times. Since you all are ISTJs, could you guys possibly give me a little insight into what he's thinking? 
11	> I'm not sure if he even cares that much\n\nHe does.\n\n> he's my dad so he has to care at least a little bit\n\nNo, he doesn't.  Do you know how many deadbeat dads are out there that don't give a gerbil's ass about their kids?\n\n> For example, the first time I took the ACT, he said a 30 should be my goal, which I thought was insane to begin with. I ended up with a 32 with a perfect score on the science section. A month later, he said that it would be nice if I could get a 33. I took it again and got a 34. Now he's saying it would be nice if I could get a 35.\n\nFirst of all, congrats on doing so well on the ACT.\n\nSecond, what he's saying, without saying it, is that he knows you can do better, and he's pushing you to do so.  \n\nWhat you don't know is that he's probably bragging to all of his friends and coworkers that will listen that his kid got a 32 the *first* time he took the ACT and has done better every time since.  \n\nAnd even if he's not bragging to everyone about it, I guarantee he's proud as hell of your achievements, even if he doesn't know how to say so straight to your face.  Watch his eyes next time you tell him you've achieved something he should be proud of.  I bet they light up, even if he otherwise looks completely stoic and says something like "Meh, you can do better."
6	Not an ISTJ, but as someone with the Te-Fi access, one way that we show we care about people is helping them to succeed. If we don't care about them, we don't care when they fail.\n\nIt sounds to me like your dad wants to set you up to be as successful as possible for when you go to college, so you can get into the programs you want to and get scholarships as well. He knows that student debt is incredibly stressful and wants to spare as much of that as possible. Sure, it's cool you did better than he expected, but until you've gotten the same score twice in a row, he's not going to believe you've gotten the best one you possibly can. (Which is a fair assumption.)\n\nBasically, your dad doesn't have high expectations just for the sake of having high expectations, though that might be difficult for him to explain to you. It also sounds like he has a better grasp on what you're capable of than you do--you thought a 30 was crazy and look how well you did! This indicates to me (along with your general ENFPness) that you probably have some insecurities about your abilities, which your dad is probably aware of. He probably thinks that the best way for you to overcome your insecurities is for you to have repeated success and improvement. And for you, this feels like he's saying that you're never good enough, which only makes you more insecure, and it creates this negative feedback loop.\n\nIf your dad is putting too much pressure on you, I'd sit down and say, "Dad, I know you want me to succeed because you love me, but it can be really stressful for me sometimes because I feel like I won't be able to meet your expectations." The communication might be difficult, but I think if you go into it level-headed, you'll end up at a better place than when you went in.
4	I'm an ISTJ with an ENFP father lol. \n\nTrust me he cares, he's just bad at showing it through words. ISTJs show love through action, so look out for things he does for you.
3	It sounds to me like he just wants you to keep getting better. He was simply saying you should shoot for 30, and once he saw that you surpassed that he said it would be nice for you to get higher. I tend to do this with myself, as it's a way to constantly improve. I'd also do this for anyone in my life, be it friends or family. \n\nI'm not going to set some unrealistic goal, as I know that will just lead to disappointment and giving up. I see that your dad did that as well. He didn't say your initial goal should be to get a perfect 36, and I feel like him saying you should go for a higher score is just to give you some goal to work towards. 
3	I wish I could say that being withdrawn will change, but I don't think it probably will.\n\nFrom my perspective, having someone emote strongly at me is intense. If it is strong happy emotions, I can enjoy it, but I also feel slightly afraid, and later, I feel drained. If it is strong angry emotions, it is like they're dragging their fingernails on the inside of my skin. It's insanely unpleasant.\n\nI just can't bring myself to emote to others in an intense way when I know how it feels (to me) to be emoted at. Even if I know they don't feel it that way, I feel self-conscious about it -- and even if I *could* bring myself to emote, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to let myself emote intensely at others, but then ask them not to emote intensely at me.\n\nI also feel similarly about my time and territory though, so if I really strongly care about someone, they can see it in the time that I give them and the access I give them to my space and things. And even then, it might not be as much as they get with others, but the close friends I have are ones that seem to understand and be able to maintain connection under those terms. (Which some people can't -- and no judgment at all to them for that. I know there are some people I adore, but that I just cannot be friends with regularly because of how frequently they'd want to be hanging out.)\n\nAs for the ACT -- I don't know about your Dad, but if I were him, I would want you to tell me that what I am doing is making you feel like you're not accomplishing anything. Like you're not good enough. I can imagine setting a high goal and being like "try for this -- I don't expect you to get there necessarily, but you want to aim high because everyone falls short of their aspirations." And when you can do higher than that, it is like "Wow! We need to find you some even higher aspirations!"\n\nMaybe everyone doesn't always fall short of their aspirations though -- but for me, I have to fight to be inspired by aiming high, instead of being disappointed for falling short all the time. I just let myself know that the nobility is in aiming that high, but also making realistic choices in the moment that sometimes involve sacrificing that goal so that I can take care of other things that matter to me. I tend to become paralyzed by perfectionism, so if I ever consider my goals to be the things I will Definitely Accomplish, I would never be able to function. I would have to set my goals so low because it bothers me so much not to meet a goal that I've approached in that way.\n\nThat might not at all be like what your Dad is like though -- but I do expect that if he cares about you, he doesn't realize what pain this is causing you, and if you told him in as emotionally neutral of a way as you can (i.e., don't try to be an ISTJ, but if you're normally really intense, it will probably be easier for him if you are as calm as you can be without sacrificing your personality), I think he'd want to change. And when I say being emotionally calm -- I say this because it is going to be something that *might* make him feel like he's done really badly by hurting you. \n\nIf it is presented as "I know you didn't mean to, but I just wanted to give you the heads up that this hurts me because I trust you care and would not want to hurt me" that would help me at least... I'd feel bad, but I'd be able to fight the impulse to disconnect, because there'd be a "I trust you are good and I want you around and this is just a way to be more effective at the people thing." Whereas if it is like... you were angry, yelling, sobbing, I would feel like I had fucked up so bad that it was better if I just left you alone because clearly I am making you more upset by being in your life, and you think I am a bad person, and probably I am, so I'm outta there.\n\nFor what it is worth, I would not say even a single syllable of this -- I feel slightly silly typing it out, but if I am honest, that would be the emotion in words. Like "*Fuck I dropped the baby, I never can hold babies again, that is a risk not worth taking!*" I would nod a lot, look worried, apologize profusely, and then make myself scarce. You'd maybe think I was giving you the cold shoulder because I was mad at you, but I would be afraid and insecure about our relationship. I would not have seen that coming, and would be questioning whether you have always been upset with me and this was the last straw when I thought things were okay. It really shakes up my perception of a relationship when something like that happens, like I have to re-establish reality and until then, I can't engage. Which isn't to say you have to be perfectly calm -- more that I want to give pointers to what might make things go more smoothly, depending on your goals for the conversation, and to how to interpret his reactions, if I am able to predict them with any accuracy.\n\n**tl;dr --** Try to give your dad something like a user's manual to you, as much as you can. Try to figure out how it is that you see things differently (and sometimes that might be asking to have a conversation about how he sees goals, and then sharing how you see goals), and frame that as useful information he can use to be an inspiring and encouraging father to you, as a specific type of person.
2	Perfectionism and high expectations of themselves projected onto you, especially because they care about you -- not in how you *feel* per se, but in your success and achievement in life. 
1	I'm going to add on here and say that while frustrating, Te users are very into seeing the people they care about succeed and grow. \n\nI have a friend who I think is an ESTJ (he thinks he's ENTP but I don't think so) who kept badgering me about some things I was working on and it came off as condescending and hurtful. He'd say he doesn't think I have an end goal or a solid plan or that I won't find success without those things. \n\nI was really peeved, but he said something very earnest that was along the lines of "I just care about you a lot and it would crush me to see you not succeed and I'd feel bad if I didn't help" and I think that's when it clicked that he didn't mean to be a dick or make me feel inferior. He just really, genuinely is concerned that my way of doing things wouldn't get me where I wanted to be. I actually found it very sweet and endearing. \n\nI mean, one of the things I had to get across to him is that my idea of success and what brings me happiness is very different from his, and to keep in mind that what works for him might make me unhappy. I enjoy the lazy, lackadaisical learning process and my dreamy attitude drives him a little bonkers, I think. \n\nYour father is probably similar in the way he expresses love and concern. Your dad does care for you, and that's how he shows it. I don't think he means to shame you or make you feel like you aren't good enough. He likely thinks that you have the capability to do better and he wants to set you up for a secure, happy life in the future. \n\nMy dad is an ENTJ and was similar. "Oh, you did that? Well then do this!" He figured the encouragement "You're smart, capable and I know you can succeed" was implicit in the goals he set for me. There's nothing wrong with explaining to him that you understand why he has those goals for me, but that you would like more praise and to have your hard work acknowledged by him. C:

13	Is anything ever truly perfect in an ISTJ's eyes?	Hey all ISTJs! I'm an ENFP and my boyfriend is ISTJ and we've been together for several years. I absolutely love and adore him but I feel as if he is constantly criticizing everything. It's as if he spends his entire day attempting to make things perfect (whether it's washing the dishes, his work, our relationship) but he's never actually happy with the results. I spend the majority of my time just analyzing his facial expressions and words trying to figure out what I can do to make him 100% happy and comfortable, but I feel like I'm rarely ever successful in doing so.\n\nHe has so many fantastic traits that I lack and he completes me in every way, except for when it comes to the way we look at the world.\n\nIs this a common trait in ISTJs? If so, isn't it incredibly exhausting to see the world in such a flawed and imperfect way?
15	from the understanding of an ISTJ, perfection simply isn't humanely achievable, so don't worry if he doesn't think things are "perfect." and don't worry too much about his facial expressions, ISTJs are known to be bad at expressing emotions, so you might just be getting worked up over something trivial. best would be to just ask him directly.
14	I'm very rarely simply "happy".  My wife says, "It must be hard to live in your head.".  She has no idea.\n\nYears ago, we went to Disney World.  There was a time at one of the water parks, when the kids were having fun, my wife was happy, no one expected anything of me, I didn't have to plan anything, and for about 20 minutes everything was.... perfect.  To this day, I remember that as being about the most relaxed and centered moment I've ever had.\n\nI'm used to being disappointed in some way by almost everything.\n\nThat sounds depressing, but it's not really.  I've lived with that my whole life, so it's just the way the world is.  My wife just lets me live my way.  She can't "make me happy", though I sure enjoy many things.  I don't want her to focus on that effort.  It makes me unhappy pretending to be happy!
8	Just in case you are my ENFP with an obfuscated username, please try to keep the table tidy and don't use it as a dumping ground. Thanks babe 😄
5	Well, my waifus are perfect, so there's that.\n\nJokes aside, I don't know. Some food, maybe? Even then, I'm picky about how it ends up being.
3	I'm not sure my ISTJ bf is unhappy as in depressed, but like yours, mine is also negative and critical by default. I doubt it exhausts him, since it's likely how he just is naturally -- like how NFPs are naturally more positive than ISTJs (barring depression). Might it exhaust *you* though, to have to counter his perspective all the time?\n\nI don't know what to suggest, but it sometimes occurs to me that my ISTJ could benefit from getting out more, seeing different walks of life, and realizing that he has it pretty good and that he should practice more gratitude. Rather than complain that his "pasta is not perfect" or whatever, maybe he ought to reflect more on how amazing it is that he gets to have that meal in the first place. \n\nIn the meantime, I feel that humorously teasing him about his negativity is a gentle way to make him think twice about his attitude. I call him out on it ("No more negatives now, Nelly ;)"), to which he's responded "Ouch!" 🤔  I guess he knows it's a weakness?\n\nMaybe I should send him motivational memes too. Also, my ISTJ seems happier when he's physically away from all his responsibilities. So maybe yours needs to take more breaks and do some traveling with you -- if you can convince him! 
2	I feel like this is more of a enneagram 1 trait which is still common in istjs, maybe you should look into that
2	'perfection' is a relative term, and to an ISTJ perfection is not usually an obtainable thing, such as finishing a project or a relationship, they are always growing.\n\nhowever, to me, perfection is complete use/satisfaction/fulfillment of Si. \n\nfinding comfort in a familiar food that is nostalgic is perfect. receiving a large amount of my favorite shampoo that lush only sells during a certain season as a gift is perfect. in an ISTJ's life there is a constant struggle between change and the solid past, and what gets 'added' to the foundation of the past.\n\ni think perfect is what is 'added' to the growing mountain of Si memories and rituals.\n\nEDIT: i just want to say that the best gift i got for my birthday was two huge bottles of my favorite vape juice, that i would have bought anyway, but the fact that i am fully supplied and my friend knew that i like being stocked up was perfect.
2	I would say that maybe you should get in touch with your critical side. I'm an ENFP and I certainly allow it. I'm not necessarily judgmental but I enjoy recognizing all the aspects of something warts and all. I like watching criticism of movies and video games. Its the necessary dark side of idealism. How can you get closer to an ideal with out cutting out some bad things from your ideal goal? Sometimes, but not always, the fun isn't reaching that goal but enjoying the journey.\n\nOn the 100% happy and comfortable subject... Is he ever upset about not being 100% happy? Maybe you should try just having fun and letting it rub off on him. If you can live more in the moment he might be able too as well. \n\nIronically you seem to have the same problem with things not being perfect except in your case its the intuitive feeling side of things. That is one of the hilarious things I love about ENFP ISTJ relations. You look so different but when you look closer you'll realize you have a so much in common and that your world views aren't really so different. \n\nMy favorite thing I realized about ISTJ is that they are **Optimistic Pessimists**. ISTJ are at base Pessimists. Things suck, anything and everything could go wrong so all precautions and preventative measures must be taken. Things need to be in order. Here is the great part, ISTJs aren't the type to actually be upset about things sucking. It's not often that they recoil from this world view, instead regard it with annoyance. They thrive in it and deal with it. It does not halt them as you could imagine could be the case for so many other types. Things suck but this does **not depress** them **but annoys** them. They know they can deal with any obstacle with their relentless dedication. ISTJs start out in life knowing things are bad, but they learn that they can deal with it with their relentless dedication. \n\nWhy do I say this is connected to the ENFP? Well if you're an ENFP you know what Optimism is like. I've always experienced it through my awareness of the possible events that could come to pass, paired with my judgement of good and bad I quickly see the most appealing version of reality before me. I fantasize all day about what could be, but if you're an ENFP you know reality almost never plays out how you wished. Which I hope you realize is often for the best. You know how boring things can get if you know exactly what is going to happen. The stereotype about ENFPs is that we're happy-go-lucky bundles of joy. Unless you've been extremely coddled your entire life you've become acquainted with darkness, disappointment, and disillusionment. Recently I saw a post on r/ENFP where some other type came to thank us all for our incredible constant happiness and asked us how we do it. An ENTJ had the top comment saying "wtf what are you talking about? I know 3 ENFPs dealing with depression right now." All the ENFPs chimed in with agreement. \n\nThe truth about ENFPs is that **we can get depressed** but **we can often rise above** this. We see that things could be better, and in the end we always want to strive for a better world tomorrow. \nIn other words ENFPs are at base Optimists, we become **Pessimistic Optimists** but that's what drives us on.\n\nI hope this message resonates with you. I think ISTJs and ENFPs are on the same road. The ISTJs were actually driving up the hill and the ENFPs were ironically driving downhill. It's time to meet in the middle and enjoy the ups and downs of life together.\n\nI hope this give you an even deeper appreciation of your ISTJ. Go give him a big warm hug and a kiss for me. Hopefully he's the one for you.
1	My wife says that i'm never happy and that nothing is ever perfect for me. The funny thing is, she's actually right. I have a hard time accepting anything is perfect for any reason. 
1	except from the jam on toast I made last night with Warburtons toastie loaf.. nothing is ever perfect :)
22	Question about anger	Hey guys.\n\nI've recently taken the test twice and got told both times I'm an ISTJ, and the more I read and think about it the more I see.\n\nAnyway onto the question.\n\nWhen at work, if dealing with incompetent co workers or co workers who are slack, do you start to get extremely triggered? I was at work tonight and there were 3 of us on (cinemas, I was in candy bar for the night) and the other 2 did nothing but talk the entire night, which drove me mental, to the point where I nearly flipped my shit at them. \n\nIs this normal for people with this personality type?\n\nThanks
17	As an ISTJ who just spent the last hour cursing under my breath a coworker for his lazy, half-ass work which I now have to deal with, yes I would have to agree that that is common. I can't stand when people don't do their fair share; it really irks me. 
16	Yes, holy shit yes. Any kind of willful ignorance or incompetence drives me up the wall. 
5	I can't stand when people don't pull their weight. Even if it doesn't directly effect me, I find myself judging what I believe to be their poor work ethic. In cases where it does directly effect me - a group project in school or a team at work - I get really angry. I have to talk myself down a lot in these situations. 
4	I think ISTJ's in general tend to think of slackers as the poop of society, but it's in the person's own personality on how to manage their anger. I personally get pissed off inside, but I let karma do its thing for when the slacker gets their treatment. however, if I was in a supervisory position, that slacker will definitely have an ear off by the end of the discussion I give them.
3	I don't know if it's normal for other people with this personality type, but it certainly is for me personally (ISTJ).\n\nI hate when folks are slacking, especially if work needs to be done. If everything (and I mean *everything*) is completed to my level of satisfaction, *then* I'm good with horsing around for a bit...until a customer approaches!
3	it's that hardcore Si, buddy. i definitely recommend learning about the ISTJ cognitive function stack, but the first two are Si (introverted sensing) and Te (thinking extroverted).\n\nISTJ's tend to have a very strong set of core morals, and they usually tend to be an upstanding citizen and keep everything under control and obey the laws around them (hank hill).\n\nwhen you are doing your job and those around you are goofing off, that's a complete breach of laws put in place by your job, and that will piss you off. \n\nISTJ's usually are the ones that clock in, work hard, and clock out, and respect the workplace.\n\nEDIT: i think a good ISTJ motto here is "i expect back the respect that i give you"
2	I think anger is more of an enneagram thing, but I can still relate to a certain degree with this.
1	As someone who has group projects in all of my classes this semester - yes, I have felt like that. I'm not sure if all ISTJs are like this, but I would think that inefficiency and incompetence would aggravate most ISTJs.
1	I think this would be normal for quite a few personality types, your own way of dealing with anger/frustration are more important. I find myself annoyed but almost never to the point of extreme anger, understanding not everyone is as motivated/passionate as another about certain things.
1	I'm about as angry as they come. I try not to take it out on my coworkers and try to bring people together and seek solutions. I also try not to take it out on anyone lower ranking than me. Anyone higher ranking than me is fair game...
1	Growing up with an istj father, hell yeah. But I fucking agree. There are roles and responsibilities and rules that should be respected. Not talking in a theatre is one. Bless you for not committing manslaughter lol
1	I'm more forgiving for those who are not all the caught up or slack off since I've been there.\nI was thrown into many situations where I needed to get a grip on how things work, so if I see someone else struggling with that sort of stuff, I can sympathise with them.\n\nAnd I procrastinate a lot, so getting mad at people for being lazy would make me a hypocrite.\n\nHOWEVER.\nIf you take me for granted and just leave me to do the majority of the workload, then fuck you.\n
1	Hey everyone. Been busy lately so haven't had a chance to reply until now. Just want to say thanks to everyone, really puts it in perspective
1	Oh my god, yes. I hate it when people don't see the urgency of situation and take their own sweet time getting things done. I dunno if it's just me but I like submitting things in advance so if someone (especially the last person in the project pipeline) drags their feet I start getting really stressed and frustrated especially when they finish just barely on time to complete the project.
1	Extremely. I'm a very hands-on, gotta be on your feet type of guy. Which I think is beneficial given my job (I work at Walmart as a Support Manager- it's the highest paid hourly supervisor job). There is nothing I hate more than seeing other managers (typically salaried ones) sitting in the office doing nothing while i'm unloading trucks or making subs and salads in the Deli. 
1	Yesssss. I'm a store manager, so I've learned to curve my expectations of what people can/will do, but I still feel that initial anger/frustration when my employees are slacking. I'm constantly finding something for them to do which they hate, but I see it as that's what they are literally getting paid for. Also people coming in late really frustrate me as well, or calling off a lot. 
1	I was fu*king fuming today at work. (Work in IT support so deal with f*cktards daily) had a particularly shitty ticket that was, should we say, not following protocol. Lost my shit, and spilt my tea! I find it incredibly normal for me to be angry while at work, trying to do my best with what I have. Which is why I gotta get high after work :)

5	They are not INTJ	Hello! I've come to the conclusion that one of my best Friends is an ISTJ, although nothing I say can convince them that they are not INTJ. This person has done zero research on the functions, and it doesn't help that everything online depicts ISTJs as boring rule-followers(no offense; I love you guys <3) which doesn't match them at all. I don't want to force them to look at the functions and do research, even though I know that it would be the most effective way to convince them; they have a tendency to resist MBTI in general because they believe it interferes with individuality. "I understand why you want to have I type, but I just *can't*, ok?" I didn't push it. However, lately they are seemingly more open to the idea of MBTI, but utterly convinced they are INTJ(again, they haven't looked at functions when I have). In my opinion, it doesn't matter what they think, but I'm just wondering if it's *healthy* for an ISTJ to latch onto something like I'm seeing them do. Is it common for you to stick with an idea like this? Is it normal for my Friend to reject MBTI, or is this something more personal? Do you have any idea why they originally disliked it but are now open only to the idea of being INTJ? What is going on? *I'm sorry this is very vague and awkward and confusing but that's ok I'm also awkward and confused*
5	I often latch onto ideas if they first make sense. Even if I am brought an alternate idea with some good evidence, I can still be stubborn. It takes an overwhelming amount of data for me to get past the stubbornness.\n\nWhen I first started looking at my personality type deeper, I knew it fit me, but I was upset that I wasn't one of the "cool" ones. It seemed to me like everyone wished the ISTJ would just leave. It was when I figured out the true value of having ISTJs in people's lives. I tend to be the sturdy and trusted place people go to when they need help.\n\nFor an example, my friend had been abused by his parents since he could remember. When he moved to my hometown, we became friends and I would be there for him (this is a natural state for me). When he turned 18 he left his family and came to live with me and my family. He has always thanked me for being the one there for him when nobody else would, and while other friends would help him feel better for a while, I would be there with him sorting out his issues and helping him with his material needs.\n\nEven though he had support in other areas, the story could have turned out much differently if I hadn't been there.\n\nIt's not about standing out (because everyone is trying to do that), It's lifting up others to stand out. Usually, we don't really want to be in the spotlight, and people don't like that about us (this may be what your friend is experiencing), but I think it can be one heck of a strength.
3	What's the point?\n\nHear me out. MBTI is amusing, but some people use it for very strange reasons. \n\nIt's good because it helps us to understand common differences in the way people think, and that there are many viable personality archetypes that humans take.\n\nIt's bad when people feel they need to change or restrain their behaviors based on conforming to a model.\n\nUltimately, we are all individuals who can't be put into easy boxes. So I ask again, more clearly: what is the point? What is there to gain from identifying his type, and what does he lose by misidentifying? I'm sure he was perfectly fine at being himself before he learned that this idea existed, and it isn't going to make him change his personality. Why does it matter?
2	If it is unhealthy for them to latch onto INTJ instead of ISTJ, it will be unhealthy for reasons that won't be fixed by getting them to latch onto ISTJ instead... Sometimes, the best help you can give someone is being with them, despite the impending catastrophes, and stay kind and gentle to them afterwards. \n\nWhen help is forced on me, it feels like a violation of my autonomy, which usually gets me to stand my ground (because giving up autonomy is its own mistake which I see as more severe), and if the other person was right, it can feel shaming to be around them after. But if they suggested it but then backed off and do not seem interested in being right as the end goal, I feel more supported, and more comfortable saying, "Hey, you were right." So your best bet might be to back off of making this suggestion and let them do as they will -- and then maybe someday they'll come back around. If they want to, in the meantime, talk about how INTJ they are... I don't know what to suggest, then!
2	I just dealt with this in the main MBTI sub. Apparently ISTJs REALLY don't like being told they're ISTJs. \n\nAlthough honestly I think ISTJs are the bomb. I'd be annoyed if I were an ISTJ and saw the way people recoiled from being typed as such, but that's just me. 
1	I guess it might sometimes be a matter of identity? I used to identify as other types before coming to the conclusion that I am an ISTJ, but there were times when I was reluctant to accept it since I felt that MBTI was quite a core part of my personality and it couldn't just...change like that? It's kind of like clinging onto/being attached to a certain identity and therefore being  reluctant to accept something different than what you've been used to this entire time? I'm not really sure how to explain it, I hope I make sense!
1	What if you're both wrong?\n\nI initially scored between INTP and INTJ on tests, but neither of them fit properly, so I figured MBTI was simply too vague to be useful.\n\nLater I found out about cognitive functions, and it turned out I use both Ti and Ni. Once I realized that neither INTJ or INTP was correct, the other pieces started falling into place.\n
1	no one wants to be an ISTJ. with how meyers briggs is online, it's a contest for the most unique type. i thought for the longest time i was an INTP, because i wanted to be albert einstein. \n\ntell them that types do not matter, you are not defined by your type. it is simply a tool to help recognize how you analyse and process information.
1	My profile is equivocal on both the I and the S, very strongly T and J.  It's always nearly 50/50 on I and S, so one question one way or another can swing it.\n\nSo, to settle it in my mind I researched the four types possible with I/E and S/N with TJ.  Reading the profiles in detail, it became quite clear that I'm definitely the ISTJ type.  So it's some quirk of how I perceive the questions in those surveys that affects the result.  I am ISTJ, and embrace that.\n\nDoesn't that very process just sound like something an ISTJ would do anyway?
8	How do you feel about gambling?	I'm wondering if there's a connection between MBTI types and gambling. I personally do not care for gambling. It's not that I'm afraid of losing. Losing a few hundred bucks at Vegas wouldn't get to me. But I also wouldn't get much of a thrill from winning. Deep down, overall, I am a bit risk-averse. Does that characterize most ISTJs?
23	I approach it logically, and knowing that the house always has advantage means it's not worth it and I abstain.
7	Completely agree. It just isn't fun for me, even if like you said, I've set aside money for this purpose. In fact, my dad once gave me a chunk of change to go gambling with him --  no risk at all, since it wasn't my money, and I still didn't enjoy it much. \n\nI'm definitely risk-averse too though. 
9	I don't care for it. I'll buy the occasional Powerball ticket, but I don't go to casinos and such.
4	It's a system designed to make a profit for the casino so clearly not. If I were in power I would put heavy restrictions on this to help people that developed gambling problems from the manipulative tactics of this system.
2	I only like slot machines.  
2	I enjoy playing some games like poker or blackjack but I don't spend much on playing. The one time I went to Vegas (can't go to Vegas and not play in a casino) I set aside $40 and viewed that as my play fee. I would either lose it all or I would get ahead and cash out. I lost it all, of course, but I didn't care because I'd expected to. It was my price for playing. 
2	Gambling feels bad to me. You're taking a significant "real world" risk to get the chance of a happy surprise.\n\nIt's pretty easy to simulate the same kinds of emotions without the same potentially negative repercussions.\n\nJust play a video game, people. Don't go to casinos.
2	Aside from playing bingo, i've never done it, nor had a desire. 
1	I'll never go gambling. For me it's the atmosphere. Talk about out of my comfort zone. Loud people, smokers, drinkers, etc. \n\nAlthough I collect pokemon cards and buying packs is basically gambling lol.
1	I, too, am very much risk-averse. I am afraid of losing, but winning also makes me very excited. I don't gamble because the chances of winning are so slim and it doesn't seem like a responsible use of your money.
1	I hate gambling, even small sums of money. If by chance I do gamble, I plan that I will lose whatever I put up.
1	I see why people do it but I don't view the payout nor the thrill as worth the likely losses. I buy a lottery ticket very infrequently, generally when I'm already out to get one for my dad or grandfather, both of whom enjoy them quite a bit. I can't say whether that's a result of personality or economics training.
1	I am only willing to bet in card games with a substantial aspect of skill, but at that point, I would rather just play for fun.
1	Tried slots when I went on a cruise.  Lost my $10 and stopped.  I have enjoyed going to the arcade.  Not gambling, simply playing a game.\n\nI will buy a Powerball ticket if it gets over $100mill but never more than 2 tickets.\n
1	it depends on the situation. going to las vegas is a dream of mine, i love the different designs on the hotels and how you can spend 24+ hours walking throughout the entire town with a constant stream of people.\n\ni love playing poker, especially with friends. poker is just really fun, and it's also fun to see statistics work irl right in front of you.\n\nplaying at a casino is different. again, it is all about going with friends. it's fun to get a free drink while wasting twice the price of what you would have paid for it in a slot machine.\n\nmy sister put it perfectly: 'i'm gunna find the machine with the most noise and buttons and lights, and get my money's worth.'
1	well my hobby involves gambling somewhat.. if playing money on an online casino website such as 5 dimes. I play groups of numbers in the pick 3 lottery and keep track of a wagering (progressive wagering - martingale), set up a playing window of draws to play the list of numbers that I am looking at, and keep eye on budget to ensure best ROI if I win within the play window of draws (if not I set up a stop loss limit that isn't too high and will break my bankroll). So, I mean I don't feel bad about gambling as long as its done in a methodical manner with a lot of self discipline and energy devoted towards creating and maintaining a system. 
1	Tax on the stupid/poor just like the lottery imo
1	I don't like math, loud environments with diffuse noise, blinking lights, and smoking. I don't judge others, but it isn't my bag.
9	Weekly Thread: Tell us about your favourite animal!	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what is your favourite animal and what's a cool fact that you know about it? Pics are welcome!\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
6	I love cats! All kinds and shapes.
5	I like wolves
5	Giraffes but I really don't know why.
4	Horses, especially Arabian horses, they're freaking majestic! Wish I could get one, but that costs way to much
4	Cats here. Relatively easy to take care of, and they are fairly independent unless they want food.
5	I'm a dog person.  Dogs are awesome.\n\nDogs can be trained to detect cancer in humans.  They can be trained to alert diabetics of problems with their blood sugar.  A dog will sit/lay next to its dead owner starving for days.  \n\nDogs know when you're sad.  They know when you're happy.  Dogs understand unconditional love.
3	Polar bears are my favorite,  so big and pretty and powerful.  I like a lot of arctic type animals,  seals and foxes.  Maybe it's something about their environment.  \n\nI'm also pretty obsessed with insects and love moths.\n\nMore specificly my favorite animal was my cat Emma, who died anout a year and a half ago.  She was just sweet and cuddly and always knew how to make me feel better.  
3	I really love foxes. Cute, fluffy bastards.
3	I don't like animals much, the old me would have said fox or spearfish though.
2	I love cats, especially Maine Coons (I think the fact that they can grow really big is awesome, and they're so furry)! Deer come in second to cats.
2	Domestic-Cats\nWild-Penguins
2	I'll be the odd one out and say Russian Dwarf Hamsters.\nThey're like running puffballs
2	I have lived crows since the first time I saw one while camping in Colorado as a young child. They have incredible memory, and their brain to body ratio is equivalent to chimpanzees. They can also be playful and mischievous. 
23	Any ISTJs here endlessly attracted to the Feeling types?	You know, the sort of people who are just so kind and compassionate to everyone. And when something goes bad, they think it's their fault. Cinnamon rolls.\n\nI'm an ISTJ and sometimes when I come across a Feeling type, most especially a crush, I tend to feel less-than. They're so.. human - so naturally and expressively kind to others. And here I am with all my logic. I don't see myself as unkind. I just tend to be very matter-of-fact. And I'm beginning to dislike this bit about myself because I wonder if Feeling people are turned off by Thinking-Judging folks. Sorry if this doesn't make sense.
10	>They're so.. human - so naturally and expressively kind to others. And here I am with all my logic. I don't see myself as unkind. I just tend to be very matter-of-fact. And I'm beginning to dislike this bit about myself because I wonder if Feeling people are turned off by Thinking-Judging folks.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm INFJ and my ISTJ girlfriend is one of the kindest human beings I have ever met. I've actually been thinking about this recently. Her matter-of-factness and logic meshes very well with her kindness. \n\nIn contrast, I have an INFP ex (now friend) who I recently have been realizing is pretty damn unkind. And the way I can see it is the contrast with my ISTJ's natural persistent kindness. \n
7	This is one area that I don't necessarily fit into. My childhood was rough at times. I was always the shortest guy in class and a loner. We didn't have much money but some people in the family did and we felt a lot of judgement there. We also moved a lot and my siblings and I became each other's anchor.\n\nThat combination of things gives me more emotional thought than most ISTJs I've known. And I can completely understand where you're coming from.\n\nHealthy Feeling types are extremely attractive. Their humanity is infectious. The whole "opposites attract" thought plays into this a lot. In a healthy relationship, each person learns from and teaches the other. It makes sense that you'd be attracted to someone who can teach you how to be more loving and expressive.\n\nAs an ISTJ with higher functioning Feeling, it can be difficult for me to have healthy conversations with Feelers because I can pair logic and emotion together. When they approach things overly emotional, I get annoyed. If they can't see the logic holes after I explain it, I give up. This occurs with total Thinkers with total Feelers. If you find a healthy Feeler, they may be emotional at exhausting levels but they'll recognize it. If you're a healthy Thinker, you'll recognize your inability to process emotion well and when you both present your sides, you'll see where they're coming from. Knowing what you lack is, in my opinion, the key between being receptive to differing mindsets.
5	Nope! I love the crap out of you guys! So organized, hard working, always willing to help, very accomplished! It's insanely attractive!
4	> Cinnamon rolls  \n\nLoved that!  
3	It's funny because the xSTJs I know have been more altruistic in a sense than many "F" types I've known because you don't seem to do ethical things for ulterior motives.\n\nThe commitment and focus on action to help loved ones is admirable. IME ISTJs will not fail to help a friend, family member or colleague if it's within their power to do so. As an xNFP I spend time deliberating on a moral course of action, maybe I won't end up doing it anyway in the end and so the time was wasted, but in that time an ISTJ will have done numerous tangible things for the people in their lives. Your lives express your values (thinking of my grandfather and some good friends here).\n\nEdit: (flair should say INFP but I'm on mobile and can't change it)
3	I stumbled across this because I am an INFP who's married to an ISTJ. I totally get what you're saying. \nAlthough it's funny because sometimes I feel less-than compared to my husband because he's so logical, unattached to feeling, and stoic. \nBut then there are times when the exact things I think make him seem superior are the things about him that drive me bonkers. Even though he may not say it, I know he gets frustrated with all of my emotions. Mostly because he doesn't know how to help but also because he doesn't understand them.\nSome days I wish he were different, but then that wouldn't be him - if that makes sense. I love my husband because he's funny, witty, and smart. His logic and his "c'est la vie" attitude has brought me out of a lot of dark places.  \nOur dynamic sometimes reminds me of The Awkward Yeti comics about the Heart and the Brain. \n\nI may have gotten away from the question at hand, but I'm not sure how to answer it. Although labels like ISTJ and INFP are important for getting at the core of someone's personality, there are wide discrepancies/nuances within them. For example, while I am all for peace, love, and inclusiveness - I love L4D2 because I like shooting zombies, I swear like a sailor, I have nonsensical pet peeves, and I can be super judgey. \n\nI hope this all made sense!
2	I have dated both an Fi dom and Fe dom respectively. They were pretty different. What you're describing sounds more like Fe than Fi if either.\n\nTo answer your question though, I hope to be able to date a Thinking type at some point, even though certain ones, like Te, don't always rub people the right way. At this point I'm not entirely sure who I prefer.
2	Can agree with that
2	Hi! I'm an INFP with an ISTJ boyfriend. One of my favorite things that I love about him is his logic. His logical, analytical way of looking at things can help me to step back and assess a situation when I know I'm putting my emotions into it way too much. As a Feeling person, definitely not turned off by the T-J type. In fact, I very much enjoy the balance that he brings to my F-P. :) 
1	I'm an ENFJ and my personality and looks are sort of a magnet for ISTJ it seems. I even dated an ISTJ for quite a long time but to be honest I would not date another person like him again (SJ). I dont want to date another introvert either. \n\nAt first, this type seems like a great match for a feeler (extraverted feeling is my dom function) but then you begin to realize that the ISTJ is the main beneficiary in that match up. For someone like myself who is very confident and direct with my thoughts and feelings, I need a partner who is able to be at least a little direct. I appear patient on the outside, but on the inside Im thinking to myself that a relationship with someone more like myself would be a lot easier. \n\nIt seems like ISTJ are never happy and that bums out happy feelers like myself. It feels like they want to suck the life out of me and the joy out of me. They love you at first but then become obsessively jealous and possessive. 
39	How to date as an ISTJ?	Hi Reddit!  My name is SecuritySix, and I’m an ISTJ.\n\nFirst of all, I’d like to apologize, because I know this is going to get long.\n\nI am looking for some advice on how to gain and/or improve a particular subset of social skills.\n\nSocial skills are one of my biggest weak points.  And yes, I refer to human interaction as skill, because for me, and I suspect for a great many other Introverts, social interaction is not an innate talent, but something that has to be practiced and worked at.\n\nMy general social skills are…let’s go with “fine.”  I can interact with other people just fine in everyday social situations.  Dealing with friends, coworkers, cashiers, family, and other people one encounters in a normal day, while draining, isn’t difficult from a technical standpoint.\n\nThe problem I run into presents when I am dealing with the opposite sex, and even then, only when I contemplate trying something beyond an everyday interaction.  If I’m speaking with a female relative or a friend’s wife, I’m fine.  Interacting with a waitress or a female cashier generally goes smoothly as well, since I can process it as a simple business transaction.\n\nThat said, when it comes to dating, I’m hopelessly helpless.  I can identify at least some of the problems standing in my way.  The trouble is, I don’t know what to do about them.  I have tried searching for ISTJ dating advice, but everything that comes up is how to date an ISTJ rather than how to date *AS* an ISTJ.  So, that’s where I’m hoping /r/ISTJ can help me out.  So, here’s a numbered list of problems of which I am aware.\n\n1) I am oblivious.  More specifically, I am intellectually aware of the signals a woman uses to indicate interest in a male, and I can even recognize those signals when I observe them being done to someone else; however, if/when they are done to me, I have no clue.  Unless a friend is there to witness it and say “Dude, she was totally flirting with you,” I won’t know it happened.  And when my friends wait until a week after the fact to tell me, it’s too late to do anything about it anyway.\n\n2) Generally speaking, I am not an initiator/instigator, even among my friends.  I don’t throw parties, I don’t have company at my house, I don’t say “Hey, let’s go out to eat.”  If someone asks, I’ll jump in with an answer, if someone sets me up for it, I’ll make a smartass comment.  To quote Deadpool, “I don’t take the shits, I just disturb them.” \n\n3) The thought of asking a woman out terrifies me.  I’ve figured out that this isn’t actually a fear of rejection, odd as that may sound.  I’ve been rejected enough times that it is familiar territory, so I know how to deal with it (I am sick of hearing “Aw, that’s sweet, but I have a boyfriend” in all its variations).  I think the fear stems from 2 things:\n\na. Analysis Paralysis.  How do I ask her out?  If she says “yes”, where do I take her?  What will we talk about?  Etc.\n\nb. Fear of change.  I don’t like change, straight up.  I know change is inevitable, but I’m not good with it.  I don’t have a storage unit full of everything I’ve ever owned or anything weird like that, but I’m slow to throw things away (I might find a use for that someday), I stay at jobs I hate for too long, schedule disruptions bug the crap out of me, stuff like that.  I’ve been single for a very long time (I’m 34 and can count the number of girlfriends I’ve had on one hand and have an embarrassing number of fingers left over).  Dating is change, and change is scary.\n\nc. Fear of acceptance.  This is sort of a combination of A and B, I think, but I acknowledge it as a specific thing.  If I ask a woman out and she says “Yes,” I figure the odds are pretty good that I will either stand there frozen like a deer in the headlights, or I’ll run away screaming.  If I’m very lucky and can find one of my wits, I might say something stupid like “Crap, I didn’t expect to get this far.  Now what?”\n\n4) Kind of in line with #3, it takes me months of exposure to a woman for me to ask her out.  Call it “working up the courage”, call it “strategizing the best approach”, call it “being a coward for several months”, whatever.  It’s extremely rare for me to have regular enough exposure to the same woman to find myself comfortable enough to ask her out.  And “comfortable enough” isn’t really the right phrase.  It’s more like “not so unbearably uncomfortable with the notion that I just refuse to do it.”\n\n5) I’m actually OK with the other party initiating the whole dating thing (assuming I even know that’s what’s happening at some point), but that requires that I be somewhere that the other party *can* initiate, if that’s even going to happen.  Problem is, I’m a bit of a hermit.  If it weren’t for bowling once a week (which a friend basically goaded me into, although now that it’s part of my routine, I enjoy it) and regularly scheduled hangouts with my friends (every Friday and Saturday), I wouldn’t go anywhere but work and home on a daily basis with trips to the bank and grocery store every 2 weeks and the occasional stop for gas.\n\n6) Online dating doesn’t work for me.  I’m not saying it *can’t*, but see #2 for starters.  I’ve had an OKCupid profile for more than 10 years, and while I’ve messaged a few people, I’ve put somewhere between zero and a negative number worth of effort into actually getting a date that way.\n\nSo, as you can see, I have plenty of the “what” I need to work on.  I have no idea on “how” or “where” to start.\n\nAny help/suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nTL;DR: I’m an ISTJ who may need an actual written instruction manual with step by step instructions on how to talk to women. \n\nIf you read all of that, thank you very much for your time.  If you skipped straight to the TL;DR, insert some sort of insult that is an affront to your sensibilities right <here>.\n\nEdit: for formatting, I hope.
30	Who are you and how are you so perfectly articulating my thoughts?
17	Ok, this is scary reading this. I feel like I could have posted this. As an istj who was in this position a couple years ago, I hopefully have some advice. I started small - started going to stores I don't normally visit and started with my thoughts before tackling big things like "get a significant other."  My main driver was to focus on discipline and habit, which I think istjs excel at. Take it one goal at a time. I started with losing weight, then did initiating socialization with coworkers, then did online dating. Also, maybe find a good therapist - I found a good one after a couple meh ones and she helped a lot. \n\nLastly, fear of change - I get it! I was laid off  last year and I panicked. But it lead me to a much better job (that now is going though budget cuts) but I'm searching again and the fear that is normally there is just gone. Change can be good. It's a risk but so is staying still. \n\nOh, one more thing - a thought that helps me when I'm asking someone on a date, "I'm showing them who I am so if they don't like it, they're the issue, not me." I think istjs internalize so much and it's helped me be more comfortable. 
8	I thought I'd give my two cents...\n\nFirst of all, let me just say, you're not alone on this. ISTJ's struggle with this sort of thing big time. Every type of person has their own areas of strength and areas on weakness: for us this is it. ISTJ's struggle with dating. It's a skill set that requires all the things that we're naturally bad at. But that doesn't mean we're helpless; dating, sociability, confidence, etc, these things are **skills.**\n And just like any skill, they can be learned. The good news is, as ISTJ's we're amoung the best there is at learning things that we put our minds to. So let's get to it...\n\n> 1) I am oblivious. More specifically, I am intellectually aware of the signals a woman uses to indicate interest in a male, and I can even recognize those signals when I observe them being done to someone else; however, if/when they are done to me, I have no clue.\n\nThis happens, especially to ISTJ's. Truth be told, there's not a lot you can do about it besides practicing trying to interpret people's "signals". The good news is, these skills will come more naturally once you start developing in other areas (see below).\n\n> 2) Generally speaking, I am not an initiator/instigator, even among my friends.\n\nHere's your first area for improvement. Why not be the initiator? In all probability, your friends want to spend time with you and they'll jump at the opportunity. ISTJ's are life's natural organizers, and that extends to social events. Next time you have a free night, invite your friends over. Some day after work, invite your friends out for drinks. Organize a happy hour at your job. Do something, anything -- no matter how small -- to take the initiative on organizing social events. Not only will this help you be more sociable, not only will this help you gain confidence, but **you'll find out later that the difference between asking a group of friends out for drinks and asking a woman out for drinks is almost nothing**. Again, you're trying to learn a skill, and this is how your practice. \n\n> 3) The thought of asking a woman out terrifies me.\n\nWe've all been there. You see a woman you want to ask out, you start going over the words in your head, you start thinking through what to do ... and then you freeze. Why? Because the act of asking a woman out is playing to all the ISTJ weaknesses. So let's play to our strenghts ....\n\n> 3a. Analysis Paralysis. How do I ask her out? If she says “yes”, where do I take her? ...\n\nIt sounds to me like one of the major things holding you back is fear of the unknown; Fear of what to do if she says "yes"; fear of "what's next." In Myers Briggs terms what's happening here is that your inferior function (Ne) is busy throwing up all sorts of possibilities about how things could go wrong. Luckily, there's an easy way to get around this. Step one is to organize everything before hand. "Where do I take her?" How about making a list of suitable date restaurants / activities in your area. I have one, you should too. "What will we talk about?" Maybe make a list of potential conversation topics if this would help set your mind at rest. **The point is, as an ISTJ you're probably very good at planning things out in advance and not so good at dealing with unknowns. So plan things out, she'll appreciate it and you will too.**\n\n> 3b I hate change ...\n\nI can totally relate to this. I too am afraid of change. At yet, I've gone through many changes in my life. I bet you have too. I bet if you think back on the changes in your life you see that, even if you were afraid going into the change, by the end of it you saw that things turned out fine -- even if things ended up going badly, you turned out fine in the end. Relationships bring change, and change is scary, but just like any other change in your life, **the fear of change is so much worse than the change itself ever will be.**\n\nSpecifically with regards to dates, remember this: the woman across from you is a human being. What do I mean by that? I mean, just like you want things to go smoothly on the date because you want this person to have a good time, so too does she. She's trying just as hard as you are to have things go well. In a phrase, **remember that dating involves two people, and that means you're not in it alone.**\n\n> c. Fear of acceptance. ... "Crap, I didn't think I'd get this far."\n\nAgain, if you have everything planned out in advance, things will go smoothly if she says yes. Have a time and a place picked out when you ask her. Have a few questions prepared if you want. Have it all worked out, and then the rest is just detail. It might be rocky the first few times. You'll make mistakes, everyone does. But then you'll learn, and then  you'll laugh at it later.  \n\n> 4) Kind of in line with #3, it takes me months of exposure to a woman for me to ask her out.\n\nCan totally relate. Usually, the only time I feel trully comfortable asking someone out is if i've interacted with them many times before, and by that point it's probably too late. This has happened to me numerous times and I can totally understand how frustrating it is. The solution is to bite the bullet and ask her out sooner rather than later. That sounds impossible right now, but you're going to work up to it. Here's how\n\n- Start by asking some friends / co-workers to some event. This is a nice low stress social commitment \n\n- Next, ask some friend out for drinks / a meal / some event. This is a low stress one on one event\n\n- Next, ask a (platonic) female friend  to dinner to catch up on life. \n\n- Finally, ask a woman you *think* you might be interested in on a date. Did she say "yes"? Great. Did she say "no" and laugh in your face? Doesn't matter. The point is you asked. \n\n**The point is, what's holding you back is social anxiety. One solution to social anxiety is simply to face your fear through practice.**  Start out small -- maybe its asking a friend out for drinks, maybe its just talking to a stranger in the line at the super market -- and then work your way up. Again, social skills are just that -- skills -- and like any other skill they can be learned with practice. \n\n> 5) I’m actually OK with the other party initiating the whole dating thing (assuming I even know that’s what’s happening at some point), but that requires that I be somewhere that the other party can initiate...\n\nWe're going to kill two birds with one stone here. You don't get out much? Start going out more. I don't mean to social events, I mean literally getting out of the house more than you currently do. A few ideas...\n\n- Go to the gym or join a group exercise class: not only will exercise improve your confidence and mood, but you might meet some new friend along the way\n\n- Do you like food: Join a cooking class. Can't cook for shit? definitely join a cooking class. You'll meet new people, learn a new skill. \n\n- What are your hobbies? Go join some group / event about your hobbies. Don't have any true hobbies? Now is a great time to pick one up. All your hobbies are done alone? Consider picking up another one that might get you out of the house some more. \n\n The takeaway here is: if you don't leave the house very often, than its no wonder your not meeting new people. As introverts, it's our nature to want to spend time alone. But it's also important to branch out and try new things. That's what you should do. If it turns out you hate the thing you try, that's fine. **The goal here isn't to find some lifelong passion, its just to expose yourself to new things and people.** This goes a surprisingly long way when it comes to building more social skills / gaining self confidence. \n\n>6) Online dating doesn’t work for me.\n\nYeah, online dating is pretty shitty. Especially for men. Take advice from someone with more experience / success in this department, but otherwise just avoid it. \n\nSummary\n--------------\n\nThe main things to take away from this post are that, while you might feel your deficient in social skills right now, it is perfectly possible to learn them -- social skills are just another skill. All it takes is practice, dedication, and time, and as ISTJ's we are very, very good and dedication and practice. \n\nHere's where you start...\n\n- Start initiating social outing with your friends, coworkers, and acquaintances. Get used to saying the words "hey, we should all go do X next Friday." \n\n- Start exercising if you haven't already. Not only will is improve your confidence, mood, looks, and self esteem, but it will get you out of the house and put you in contact with new people. Already exercisng? Great, start looking for a group to join about that activity. Meet new people, make new friends.\n\n- Pick up a hobby that puts you in contact with new people and gets you out of the house. \n\n- Start compiling a list of potential date locations / activities that you would want to take a girl to. \n\n- Remember that, just like a friendship, a romantic relationship is a tow way street: it involves a second person -- another human, just like you --  and that means your not in this alone. \n\nIt's perfectly normal to feel the way you do. All it means is that you're starting from behind the pack in this particular area. But if you work at it, you can catch up. Good luck. 
9	I am a woman so my experience doesn't probably compare to yours, but I can throw in my two cents and you can freely ignore them if you like.\n\nI am relatively young but me and my boyfriend started dating around 4 years ago. \n\nI find that the easiest way to connect with anyone ( specifically someone of the opposite sex) is to have shared interests. I actually met my SO in an RPG group. So my advice would be to join a group or club that is about one of your interests; that is for starters a great way to meet new people with whom you can connect about something you are passionate about. \n\nBe yourself without too much thought. People appreciate you when you are not forcing a behavior.\n\nMaybe try to talk to a therapist, it helps a lot with self doubt and anxiety!

5	I don't even leave my house for groceries.  Safeway delivers.
2	I am likely one of the least qualified people to give advice on this, but I'll try anyways. Just know, I've been with the same woman since I was 19(10 years) and we're entering into a trial separation.\n\n1.Being oblivious is something you likely won't fix at this point. I wouldn't worry or focus on this part too much. If you gain some more confidence I think this will improve but focusing on trying to fix it will probably be a waste of time.\n\n2.This is something to work on. If you get into a relationship there's a good chance you'll need to initiate conversation and activities to keep the relationship alive. Most women I've interacted with want to be surprised by their SO, which means the SO needs to plan things themselves. Start small. Plan a small gathering at your place. Do it a few times until it feels more natural. Then work up to bigger things, like a trip out of town with your buddies. I think this may also be linked to confidence. This is a piece of it that can be directly impacted with exposure. When you get comfortable initiating things with your core group, then reach out to people outside of it. Maybe start with inviting a guy from a different bowling group. It's typically easier for men to invite other guys, especially in a "athletic" scenario because we bond in that way. Once that becomes more natural, invite a woman. She doesn't have to be someone you're interested in, and you'll probably have an easier time with it if you're not. By the time you get to this point, it should be a lot easier to initiate something with a woman you do have an interest in.\n\n3.This will come with my previous point, to some degree. At least the comfort side of it.\n\nA.Have a list of 3 places you really enjoy eating. When you ask her out, have them ready. Then grab one at random or inquire about which types of food she likes. Tell your brain to shut up about the talking part. That's for later, don't let your mind make more decisions than it needs to in the here and now.\n\nB.This will come with time. Just be careful to stay true to yourself when it does. I've known several men who have wanted to be with a woman so badly that they completely tranform themselves to be compatible to her. If it helps, have a list of things in your life that you're not open to change on. These should mostly be bigger things. Where you live, the friends you hang out with, the interests you have. If you have these things secure, and articulate them to your SO when it gets to that point, you might be more open to smaller changes.\n\nC.I think this is a really good fear to have, if it's rooted in a healthy place. If your fear is because you're insecure about yourself, then it's a very bad fear to have. That would be rooted in confidence and I don't have any good advice for improving that.\nIf it's rooted in a strong sense of identity, then I think it can be very good. If you're secure with who you are, then the "if she doesn't like me" thought can easily be turned into "her loss". Also, that "Crap" line might be thought of as cute or funny depending on the woman. If you combine it with a list of a few restaurants she might find it extremely funny and therefore, attractive. If you're naturally a smart ass and witty, use it. Just don't go overboard.\n\n4.I'm the same way. The problem you'll have is getting that exposure. You'll need to either find her in some scheduled group thing, or you'll need to communicate with her about what she normally does. This is where group things can be a lot easier for getting to know someone. If you invite them to a group thing, they might have a clue you're interested in getting to know them more. This can create a great environment for growing a friend relationship. My ideal is that I'll be with my best friend. But it's difficult to find that and then turn it into romance. \n\nIf this strategy isn't working, then hopefully with the initiating piece above, you can be more comfortable being forward about asking her out. Dates don't need to be a big scary thing. Go to mini golf with another couple. Having a buffer helps with the awkward pauses. And if it's with a buddy and his gf/wife, and they know you well, they can bring out the natural parts of who you are and what they love about you.\n\n5.This may happen but I'm not familiar with how often it does. The initiating piece above will help with getting out more though. I'd look into meetup and see if there are any groups you're interested in joining. It's a much less stressful environment if you're doing something you really enjoy. And when you do things you enjoy, you're more likely to be natural.\n\n6.Then don't do it. Idk if I could.\n\nMy biggest piece of advice is 2-fold.\n\n1. Get as much exposure as you can. People are different. Get a feel for the special variety of different that you're looking for. If you find her, pursue her. Don't be too forceful but make sure she knows you're interested.\n\n2. Don't settle. You're who you are. Know your faults, know what you need to work on and work on them but DO NOT change who you are for someone else.\n\nYou can do this. Use your analytical mind to make steps that are easy to follow. Then follow the steps. ISTJs are creatures of habit, but that mostly stems out of how we process things. Once we do something new, we make an insane amount of notes about how it was done. We mostly remember how the steps played out and how they felt. Once a task becomes more familiar, the stress starts to melt away. Even if a few variations occur, we can feel out how the situation has occured before and make adjustments for it. When you get enough exposure to asking a woman out or talking to them in general, you'll become much more comfortable with it.\n\nFinally, ask if your friend's gf/wives know anyone you might click with. Women talk a lot, and they can help you with the initial conversations. It takes the guess work out of what you'll talk about. Practice talking about your job, your schooling, where you live, your family and what you want the next 5 years to look like. If you have these things readily accessible, taking about them will be much more natural. Those are some of the most common conversation topics, and they can often spread across multiple conversations.\n\nGood luck man!
2	Though I don't have any advice (kind of going through the same things) I came to say that this thread is golden!      \nReally helpful stuff here. Thanks all!
6	I'm an ENFP and this ISTJ that I work with doesn't seem to like me very much.	Any advice on how I can connect with her and earn her respect without annoying her? I'm a preschool teacher by the way. We're co workers.
22	Give her space. Only talk with her when it is relevant to your job. \n\nI personally hate ENFPs because they are too sensitive/emotional/and are just too emotionally needy. We aren't emotional creatures, so we feel exhausted/annoyed when interacting with those types of people. \n\nYour question is "How can i connect with her?" \n\nAnswer: You don't. She doesn't want to be connected with by you.\n\nDoes that answer your question?
10	What are you doing to try and connect with her? I find that I connect with people over a shared interest. If I don't share a common interest with someone, I just simply never connect to them.\n\nIf you're looking to connect solely as a business relationship, I would recommend only communicating for business as another poster suggested.\n\n
5	I like most ISTJs I've met, but if you meet an unhealthy one who's decided to hate you -- your life can easily turn to hell if you need their cooperation to get something done. They can be stubborn, irrational, unhelpful, withholding, and go on mini passive aggressive power trips where they treat you like you barely exist. If your coworker is one of those -- don't take it personally. They have likely treated many others the same way at some point. It's their issue. I would just keep interaction civil, minimal and professional. You can also try to "kill them with kindness" -- if you're lucky, they'll start to see you're not against them. 
5	Remember this very important aspect of your job. You are surrounded by ignorant, imbecilic, irrational savages. She is likely stretching very hard to accommodate this level of difficulty. Don't add to it. If you want to earn her respect and connect, talk about why you do your job. And ask her why she does it.
2	The only way I connect with people is if there is a common interest, or if they initiate conversation. I'm not one for small talk honestly, and people often mistake me for being rude when i'm like "yeah" and "okay". 
1	I like ENFP's.  I don't think it's a type thing.  I find ENFP's do like to talk about themselves alot though :)  I wonder if you're talking about yourself too much and not trying to get to know her.   She could also be mentally tired from dealing with all the kids.  How do you know she's an ISTJ?

4	Personality Type versus Favorite Colors	I posted this in /r/mbti and a couple of other subreddits already but only ISTJ has responded so I thought I'd post it here as well. I don't want to leave you all out of the results:\n https://www.esurveycreator.com/s/c49fbd7
4	Quit at looking up hex code for green.  This is dumb.
2	Do you mind explaining what you are doing with the results? It seems like there would be a lot of data ambiguity, not only with users entering a HEX color code, but also inputting their MBTI type rather than selecting it from a list.
1	I seriously doubt there would be any correlation at all. Maybe you can find something interesting.
10	How have you guys celebrated Valentine's Day in the past? What was the most memorable? What is your ideal way of spending it?	
13	When I have a SO, I usually go out to dinner or something. When I don't, it's just another normal day.
13	I treat it just like any other day. Because it is. 
10	I've never celebrated it, because I don't have anything to celebrate. My ideal Valentine's day is staying home by myself and playing skyrim in my pajamas all day
7	we are ISTJs. If we had an SO we wouldn't be on reddit today
3	I don't consider Valentine's Day to be special.  If you really care about someone, you should be letting them know throughout the year by word and deed.\n\nWaiting for a day specified for that obligation is ridiculous.\n\nAlso, I have and have had no one to spend Valentine's Day with, so my opinion may be jaded and invalid.
2	A day like any other. This time I didn't even notice much advertising or anything.
13	Conversational pet peeve	I'm not sure if I'm just being difficult here or this is really a peeve I share with others. \n\nIt really, really annoys me when I'm confiding to someone about my feelings (rare, I know but it happens) and people just go like "well yeah the same thing happened to me before blah blah blah" and it sways the whole direction of the conversation to themselves. \n\nI'm not being self-centered here; I just think it happens to many of the people around me and it can get pretty depressing at times. Explains why I keep these conversations in my head most of the time. I read up about it like any ISTJ, and it's just behaviour for people to bring up their own experiences to try and relate to others so I'm not really sure if my peeve is justified here. Perhaps they could be just trying really hard.\n\nWhat I wonder is, does it take a lot of effort to follow the emotions and try to analyse the causes and possible solutions for the one confiding without bringing up a relative experience you had? I have no problems doing it but it seems like people always lose that attention on their feelings faster than I do. 
4	Oddly (perhaps), I have been under the impression that this approach is very Si, and that when it is sourced in Si, it's a way of trying to connect, and not a way of trying to change the subject.\n\nI did have a learning curve about this, as I don't have Si in my stack (INFJ). Initially I read it the way you describe it\n\nBut I do see this type of thing in both Si-doms I know well, and it's completely innocent and thoughtful, in their way. Weird to see it as a pet peeve of an ISTJ.\n\nThat said, there's a palpable difference between innocently and caringly offering one's own experiences as a way of connecting (which is the Si thing), and being a self-involved energy suck who just wants attention.  Don't know which one you're dealing with. \n\nDo you ever share your experiences in response to someone else sharing similar ones?
5	Try talking to an INFJ or an ENFP.
2	This annoys me a lot, too. My ISFJ boyfriend and I have gotten into many, many mini-arguments over this, surprisingly. I understand that he is just trying to be sympathetic and empathize, but it comes across as self-absorbed to me. He has acknowledged that he has a habit of doing this, and is working to at least offer some advice based on experience instead of going further into details of what he's gone through.
2	How would you like people to respond? Like: "Oh man that sounds really frustrating." and leave it at that? How do you feel heard?
2	Most people only care about themselves.  Everyone is the center of their own universe.  If the universe is infinite, in some sense each one of us is truly at our own center.\n\nGenerally, people only are interested in you, your experiences, your feelings, to the extent they gain something from it.  They'll glean your knowledge so they can deal with something, learn about something.  Actually caring about you, because you care about you?  Yeah, rarely happens.\n\nWhat do you hope to gain by sharing a feeling?  Some kind of validation?  Others can only do that by reaching for some similar situation, really.  They may be trying to empathize, but how do you feel a positive interaction from that?  It does need to be refocused back to you, but not everyone is good at that.\n\nThis is why issue-specific support groups can be helpful.  Everyone there is generally on the same page, whatever the issue may be.  Everyone has been there, done that, or maybe is about to, and all are interested in both hearing and being heard.
1	Ha, I have the same peeve. \n\nI think it's an attempt at empathizing, as people have this moment of "ah yes, I too went through this thing." The problem is that some don't really bring it back around to tell you how they dealt with it or offer advice, or even say "yeah, I remember that sucking, sorry to hear it," but rather sort of indulge in this narcissistic nostalgia by musing over what happened to them at time X.  \n\nIn short, I hate it as well, sympathize with you, and understand some people are not really that adept in conversing or being a confidant, despite them liking to think otherwise. But that's just an observation. I personally don't have too much of a problem with it, but I think that everyone does it from time to time.
1	talk to an nt, we'll listen and analyze for solutions 
10	Weekly Thread: what would you like to go (back) to college to study?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what would you like to go to college for? Or if you already went, what would you like to go back for?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
5	I'm about to go get my doctorate in business.  I got accepted 2 weeks ago and start in May.  I plan to become a university professor.
4	Psychology for sure.
4	If I could start my studies again, I would study a trade. Hvac, mechanical and electrical engineering, plumbing or my personal little fantasy carpentry.
3	What I was going to attempt the first time: Technical Theatre (Lighting focus) or IT
3	Earned my degree is psychology a while back. Just recently applied to a nursing program with the hopes of eventually becoming a Nurse Practitioner in a few years. 
2	Well, at this point in my life I'm getting training to become a nuclear operator on a submarine. I plan on floating on that when I get out of the navy. But, if I don't like it I want to go to college (Free because of GI BILL) to become a medical laboratory scientist. If I am content at that level then that is what I'll do, if I'm not I'll go to medical school and become a pathologist.
2	Political science/public policy, journalism, communications, culinary school...graduated 15 years ago with a teaching degree
2	I work in IT at the moment.\nIf I could go back to study something else, It would probably be astronomy or something like that.\nAnother option would be a new language, probably a scandinavian one
2	I am going to study Civil Engineering, but if I could, I would study finances or economy aswell, it is going to be a frustrated dream to not study that but I prefer civil. Maybe a diploma course or something instead of a full carrer?
2	I'm studying Health Administration with a concentration in Health Informatics and a minor in Public Health. I'm graduating in the fall and am considering getting a Master's degree in Public Health or Health Informatics. There are a couple of things I would study, all of them sort of linking back to what I'm currently studying. Information Systems/Operations Management, Community Health. Tried Accounting but it wasn't for me, and I couldn't lock down programming enough for Information Technology.
2	Accounting for something practical, or forensic accounting for something I think I'd love.  I started at community college because I didn't know what I wanted to major in so I started taking all the basic classes and whatever electives looked cool at the time.  I've got enough credits for an associates degree but none of the credits can be configured in any way to make a degree in anything.  I'm 32 and currently an office manager. I'd like to get my accounting degree, but at the place I'm working, happily at, it won't make me any more money so I'm on the fence.  Don't want to waste the money for the sake of a piece of paper.
2	If I were going to go to college, I'd like to study something practical and interesting, like physics, chemistry, and/or material sciences, and then find a job where I could put that to work.\n\nThen again, when I went to Vo-Tech, I studied practical things like computer programming and Cisco Certified Networking, and all I learned (well, all I retained) from those classes was that I didn't want to do those things for a living...
2	Nothing. I hated school. The only purpose of a degree is to enhance employment prospects. The knowledge is free. 
23	How many ISTJ's want(ed) kids?	I'm still young (27M) but for as long as I can remember... I haven't wanted kids. Nothing against people that do want them, I just don't think it suits me. To me, having children seems like an unbearable amount of life restriction, extra work, financial decline and relationship decline. Not to mention that the last thing this planet needs is more Earth destroying humans.\n\nAny of you ISTJ's feel the same, or am I just a selfish prick?
16	Same with me, no desire for them. 
16	33F. Never really wanted them but always knew I'd probably have them out of obligation for my partner when I was mid thirties and my career was deep in motion. \n\nAnd that's about where I'm at now. It's time to decide if I will have them or not. And I'm still not sure I'm ready. \n\nIt's not like a pair of shoes you can just take back to Walmart if you change your mind. \n\nI still don't find babies "cute" the way I'm supposed to. I have no maternal drive. 
10	Early 30M.  Yes my whole life I wanted kids.
8	I don't think so. I do wonder who and when came to the conclusion that not wanting to have kids is selfish. I would really like to know the reasons behind it.\n\nI don't want them either. Partly due to some of the reasons you mentioned, but also because I think I'm unfit to be a parent anyway as I lack parental instinct. I don't know why, but I just can't interact and work with kids. Had this problem since very early age. I couldn't even connect with younger ones when I was still a kid myself.
8	21M. I'd like to have kids at some point.
8	Nope. I like doing what I want, when I want, and still have money in the bank.\n\n\nSelfish? So be it. I don't need to exponentially add to my personal stress levels everyday for the rest of my life.
8	Ive known I wanted kids since I was 19, but I didn't think I'd find someone who met my expectations to be a good husband/father because of my past boyfriends, so I never really told anyone it was something I wanted.\n\nFast forward to now, my daughter is 2 weeks old tomorrow and I have an amazing husband who is already an amazing father.\n\nSometimes shit works out. We decided together that we wanted to start a family and didn't tell anyone until I got pregnant. It was a nice to have the decision just be between us without family or friends really being aware.
6	Definitely don't feel the same. My nephews and nieces have only strengthened the wish to have kids of my own.
6	33M.  I have never wanted kids, and have always made that completely clear from the start of every relationship I've been in, yet I've had to end numerous relationships because she secretly thought I would change my mind, or she changed hers. 
4	33f, never wanted kids. As I'm getting older it's a choice I have to take seriously. Now or never in the next few years. \n\nI'm with you though. Just seems like a lot of work and not a ton of payoff. I really don't want the emotional stuff that comes with kids. They are not only lots of joy (for most people) but also lots of heartbreak. I have a heard enough time expressing and dealing with emotions with friends and family, not sure i'd have the patience to take care of a being that is 100% emotion for the first few years. 
3	36M, no kids, married for 13.5 years. I am a teacher and I have a goddaughter and am an honorary uncle to many little ones, but am fine without any of my own. I like my peace and quiet when I get home. I like being able to sleep through the night and sleep in on Saturdays. I don't have to deal with the daily drama of feeding, changing, playing, activities, homework, friends, college prep, etc.
3	24M, yeah I would like to have kids one day. It's mainly for my dad who wants me to have grandkids. He's not pressuring me though, but I do feel like this is one way to give back to him for all he's done for me.\n\nIt really depends on the person, some people want them and others don't. You're not selfish for making a choice.
2	31M.  Don't want any, don't have any, already had a vasectomy to keep it that way.\n\nWhile I don't really hate kids, and I'm functional around young cousins and friends' kids, I can only take that in small doses.
2	I'm 32 knew I never wanted kids since I was 10.
2	Wow.\n\nI didn't expect so many responses in such a short period of time. \n\nThank you to all who participated. It seems that most ISTJ's are about 50-50. However, in my limited and small sample size, it would appear that most other people NOT part of the ISTJ family are more likely to want/have children (about 90-10).
2	I definitely want kids at some point. Not anytime soon though.
2	29/M I've always thought I wanted kids. As my siblings all have children now (1.5 yrs to 3 months old), I question it. I enjoy my time with my nieces and nephew but I get overwhelmed with their emotion and antics. I do have the "parental instincts" though, so I feel I could handle the job if I were to take it on.\n\nAs a teen, I had a strong sense that I would end up marrying someone who had kids already. I feel like I could handle that situation better than having my own children and raising them.
2	20 F and I have always wanted kids. As many as financially viable
2	34M and would like to have kids, but lack the prerequisites (a willing female and the social skills to attract one).
2	18M. I want kids but not sure how many.
2	59M - always wanted kids.  Had two.  Love both of them, loved the whole experience from day one.  The two greatest moments of my life are when they were born.  They've thrilled, frustrated, excited, and infuriated me throughout their lives, and I wouldn't trade a minute of it.  I loved them at every age, in different ways as we all matured.\n\nThe things that aggravate you so much about other people's kids?  Yeah, when they're your own, it's a very different response.\n\nIf you have high control needs, they are not going to help you with that.  You have to adapt, because both you and they are constantly changing.  But, for what it's worth, I would recommend not ruling out the idea too quickly.
2	I didn't want any but ended up having 2 when I was very young.  They are adults now.  I find parents nowadays more annoying then their kids.  You are definitely not a selfish prick LOL!
1	25 M I would like an offspring or two.
1	21F. I kinda want kids, kinda don't want kids. It's not a big factor for me. If I did have kids, I would only want one, MAYBE two. But that's a huge maybe. I'm the least maternal person I know. My boyfriend definitely wants kids, and I'd be willing to discuss it further when we get to that point, but right now, it's just finishing school and starting a career for me, so that's my greatest priority.
1	I have this weird desire to not only raise children of my own, but to change society or rather help move society into a different direction using those children. \n\nSounds weird, but that's one of the few reasons why I would want kids.                                              
1	My wife and I are in our mid and late twenties, and don't have kids yet. We've been married for 4 years and are just now talking about having kids- we both want them of course, but wanted to actually wait some time so that we could enjoy being married. 
1	Nope
8	Any of you involved in software engineering (or similar)?	Hello to all! \nFellow ISTJ here, going to finish a degree in Software Engineering sooner than later. I sometimes have doubts whereas this major is a good fit or not for me, as I tend to be slower than my mates (mostly INTx types) at grasping new concepts I can't relate to my current knowledge, facing new challenges or modeling systems. I feel like I'm good at working within the system, but not at actually designing systems. For this reason I don't know if I could be able to succeed in a real job, since these skills seem fundamental but they are not my strengths, at all. Also, I don't know what to specialize in, exactly.\n\nSo, what are your thoughts? Do you relate to what I said?\nDo you work in the field or something related? If so, what is your experience and what do you do exactly?\nYour strengths and weakneses?\nWhat's the most effective learning approach for you? \n\nEverything you could share is welcome, not only for me but also for other ISTJs who would read this as well.\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n
4	I am a Junior (senior by credit hours)  graduating in 2018 with a B.S in Computer Science and a minor in Information Technology. I will tell you from my experience, it's not uncommon to see ISTJs excel in software engineering.\n\nAs for our strengths, we are a very determined MBTI type. You also mentioned our biggest weakness, we are slower to adapt and try to relate everything to that internal framework of past solutions. The good news is, in the software industry, this is a valuable skill. You'll find that some solutions naturally begin to align with past ones you've studied. One of the biggest examples of this in practice is the concept of Object Oriented Design patterns, which are essentially reusable designs for more general problems. \n\nIf the programming doesn't come to you right away - that's alright. At times it did for me and at times it didn't for me. And if you decide programming isn't for you, there are a lot of opportunities to use a CS degree that involve more concrete problems and solutions. But if you decide you want to stick with software engineering, keep at it. Once you start using your weaknesses to your advantage, you may find it comes easier. In the meantime, keep doing your best to grasp those new concepts. It doesn't matter if it takes you longer, it just matters if you fully understand them.
1	Hi there! I just wanted to say congratulations - I'm graduating in the Fall. I'm studying Health Administration with a concentration in Health Informatics and a minor in Public Health.\n\nI *almost* got a minor in Information Technology but kept on struggling with programming - to the point where the department wouldn't let me retake that class again, which was frustrating since I had all the other req's done.\n\nSo it's not the exact same case as you. At least you got this far and you've got a body of knowledge and experience. I get what you mean about grasping concepts, though. I don't deal with that much in my current major, but I did struggle with that as well. If you want to get more hands-on experience, an internship is always a good way to get your foot in the door, see what it's like, and maybe narrow down your interests? I'm doing a summer internship to try to figure out if I'm more of a data analytics person or a process improvement person...or something else entirely!\n\nGood luck :)
1	Currently a software engineer. My major in undergrad was computer engineering and I had impostor syndrome the entire time. I was never one to design anything. I just waited until someone else thought up something and then I helped implement it. My way of learning math was to look through the answers of how some of the problems were solved and then try to replicate that pattern on another problem. \n\nLike someone said before, recognizing patterns is key in SE. Unless you want to be an architect or a User experience designer, you don't need to be a big "new idea" thinker. \n\nAlso, academics are pretty different than the real world. Once I started my job, I was nervous but I quickly realized I learn better by doing than by being lectured at. \n\nDon't give up! 
1	I've worked in this field for 2.5 years now and got my degree last year. I work on backend software, data access and APIs.\n\nI actually prefer designing (and subsequently implementing) new systems to extending existing systems. Dunno why. But a) it's not required for everyone to design whole new systems – some people are fine doing other tasks and excel at those, b) it's an evolutionary process – you design, implement, test, redesign some part, and so on. However you should be familiar with the most common patterns, since you will meet them everywhere.\n\nGet your first job, get settled in, and see what you like. Learning SE in uni and actually working in the industry are always different. Try some things, see where your strengths and weaknesses lie (e.g. I don't like writing front-end code, but back-end software is right up my alley; I can't do graphics, but I can do networking; and so on).
1	My title was Software Engineer but I felt more comfortable with old title of Customization Engineer.  Our parent company created the base software and then I customized it to the specifications of our customers.\n
1	I have been a software engineer for about a year. We use Test Driven Development where I work, and I have found that it really helps me think through the requirements and make decisions about what the software should do one step at a time. I definitely prefer this method to just "feeling it out" like some of the intuitives do.\n\nI have also found it incredibly useful to get familiar with good programming practices and patterns and would recommend stocking up on books and maybe reading them with another person or two for discussion. [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1/167-2200453-6619844) and [Agile Principles, Patters, and Practices](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Principles-Patterns-Practices-C/dp/0131857258/ref=sr_1_1) have been very useful for me. Once you start to get the general patterns down, designing something from scratch isn't such a mind explosion, because you have a general idea of how things should be designed and what "good" software looks like.
1	I graduated from school for Android and iOS Development 3 years ago. Android and Java came much easier to me than Objective-C. We also learned front end web development, which came even easier.\n\nFast forward to today.\n\nI'm a QA Analyst who's moving into Web Development.\n\nI struggled a lot with programming in the beginning. I could build a web page but if I wanted to use JavaScript I'd have to depend on Google and StackOverflow for everything. When I started in QA, I found the structure and reliability ISTJs depend on. Then I began to dig into the code, and realized that once I understood what was happening at a high level, it was a lot easier to figure out the code behind it.\n\nMy advice. Try to find something that allows you to modify the existing code. I wouldn't plan on staying too long, but you'll want to establish some sort of base that you can refer back to. Programming is hard, but once you understand the basic concept, it's really just a matter of syntax.\n\nFor this reason, ISTJs can make amazing developers/programmers once they push through learning the concepts.  Good luck, and if it still doesn't stick, go into QA and try again in a year or two.
15	Anyone else not a fan of funerals/viewings?	My wife's Great Grandmother recently passed away. Though i'm sad for her Grandpa and family (she really wasn't close to her), I find it hard to show empathy or any emotional in general when it comes to the deceased. I find it hard and awkward to find things to say to the loved ones of the deceased. \n\nAnyone else?
18	Is anyone a fan of funerals?
6	I'd imagine most go to funerals out of duty, not because they're 'fans' of it... but when it comes to showing sympathy for people who have lost someone I am not very good at it, i tend to feel for them, but I really don't know how to express it
3	I go out of a sense of duty and support for the family. While I am always truly sad of the deceased person's passing, I personally rather would grieve in private. However, I know others who find a lot of solace in grieving together, so I guess it's what helps you personally
2	I've only been to one in my recent time and I'm not a fan. The only reason I didn't like it was because I didn't have much to share. I was sad because I did know her, but I didn't show any reaction while there. Emotions don't come easy for me.
1	Even if people I knew passed away I don't go to their funerals. I like to remember them being alive. Now, if it's close relatives I do show up and offer hugs to family members.
1	I feel the same way.  Just wanted you to know you're not alone :)
3	INTP here, what do you guys think about drug laws?	I'm curious. 
7	Marijuana needs to be legalized and regulated. We're spending too much money punishing non-violent offenders, we're losing a lot of money to the black market, it could help in a lot more medical cases, and proper regulation would break the taboo and help better education of its effects. \n\nI'm on the fence with harder drugs. On one hand I think the laws prevent people from getting the help they need and encourage crime, but on the other the risks associated with them might justify the laws being there to protect the public. 
3	I'm not a fan of drug use, but it's not my job to tell you what to do. If the state chooses to make something illegal, then so be it. I'm not gonna fight it but if someone wants to, then more power to them. 
3	Soft drugs and marijuana absolutely need to be legalized. Putting aside medical use, I don't think they do as much harm as some fear-mongering groups think. Heroin/methamphetamine/cocaine...that's a different story. But I mean, we legalized alcohol, which can be addictive, and tobacco isn't illegal either, so...it just doesn't make sense, tbh.\n\nI don't care if you do any soft drugs or smoke or drink. I personally can't live around smokers, since I have asthma. But other than that, you live your own life. You should know what you're getting into, and read up on risks and stuff, but I'm not going to control what someone else does.
4	Recreational drugs are for degenerates. It's also a waste of money. You can smoke marijuana if you want but you sure as hell won't catch me doing it.
1	Some drugs should obviously be illegal (things like heroin, because it spreads disease and kills people). In regards Marijuana, which I feel is what your question is really asking --\n\nIt should be legal and taxed to hell.\n\nI don't personally use it. But fuck it. There's a lot of people that do. And if I/society can make money off those people, why the fuck wouldn't I want it to be legal?
2	MY RESPONSE: \n\nhttp://highexistence.com/an-open-letter-to-president-obama-end-the-war-on-drugs/
2	Drug laws are outdated.\n\n- We need to view drug abuse as a medical issue instead of a criminal issue. \n\n\n - We need to create drug clinics where users are able to take their drugs without fear of prosecution. \n\n\n - We should look into administering free doses of hard drugs such as cocaine and heroine so that addicts have access to safe and free supplementation.\n\n\n - The DARE program in schools is inept and counter intuitive. It needs to be revitalized.\n\n\n - The FDA needs to regulate and remove dangerous prescription drugs such as Metoclopramide from the market. They are being lobbied from Big Pharma a lot.\n\n - Doctors need better guidelines when to or not to prescribe drugs. There is so much unnecessary prescriptions it's unfathomable. \n\n\n - Hospitals should inform patients of the dangerous addictive effects narcotics can have on them if they are prescribed them.\n\n\n - The "Good Samaritan" Law needs to be implemented nationwide (where you will not be prosecuted if you call 911 to help a person who has ODed on illicit drugs, even if you knew that they were in possession of said drugs)
2	I think weed should be legalized.  
15	Was anyone else here mistyped as INTJ? What lead you to believe you were mistyped?	Over time I've come to realize I'm not as INTJ as I was lead to believe. At least, I don't think I am. If you were in the same situation what lead yourself to this conclusion and to seek reassessment?\n\nIt seems the two are very similar yet very different so maybe it's easy to happen.
4	I get INTJ if I take the test when I'm really pissed.  Mostly it's ISTJ.
5	Yeah, was typed as INTJ the first time I took the test but it was nearly 50/50 intuitive/sensing. \n
3	I was mistyped for several years as an ISFJ. The likelihood of that isn't too surprising since both are Si dom. I was still in high school while I was typing as an ISFJ, so I was clearly still developing and hadn't achieved full awareness of my functional stack.\n\nI was recently getting back into MBTI and noticed quizzes were typing me as an ISTJ. I was skeptical at first, but knowing I am Si dom really helped because I was able to use my Fi preference to rule out that I was an ISFJ.
1	At first I get 2x INTJ. Then reading r/intj I made the test to know if I'm INTJ or INTP (I agreed with some characteristics). Then got INTP with low marge, like, 53% INTP and 47% INTJ. Took another test and got twice ISFP (the first time was some years ago, being the first of all INTJ). \n\nFinally, just now, tried this similarminds.com/classic_jung.html and got ISTJ. The result https://imgur.com/jka8Ma5\n\nStart to thinking I don't belong to any type. I think that can happen. Or also, maybe I'm INSTFJP. At least I know for sure I'm introvert. 
1	Function-wise, I'm not that close to INTJ. In fact, I'm closer to ESTJ, which would be fitting if I didn't have social anxiety and wasn't a total introvert.\n\nBut based on my behavior, my analytical thinking - it's easy for me to be mistyped as an INTJ instead. In fact, the first three times I asked to be typed on here, I got INTJ haha. :)
1	The two types seem similar yet different since both ISTJ and INTJ share auxiliary Te, which is the easiest to spot and observe since it manifests externally. \n\nHowever, Si and Ni works very differently and if you're not fully aware of how your subconscious thought processes work, it could result in mistyping yourself. This means how you transition from thought to thought in your head and the way in which those thoughts are linked.\n\nHonestly, I think that the online MBTI quizzes are trash and the best way to go about this is through learning the functional stacks and cognitive processes. \n\nI find the difference between Ni and Si to be quite jarring - I think a quick test would be to assess your own thinking (in terms of thinking about complicated issues like euthanasia, death penalty, etc.) - do you find it limited in the sense that you often reach a conclusion about certain aspects and don't go on from there? \n\nIf yes, then you're probably ISTJ and if no, then you're probably INTJ. 
14	Weekly Thread: What three words would you use to describe yourself?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: how would you describe yourself in 3 words?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
15	Loyal, honest, quiet.
10	Apathetic. 
9	Routine, systematic, reliable. 
5	Consistent, disciplined, curious 
6	Curious, Intellect, Committed
6	Resentful, quiet and loyal.
9	Quite, constant, meh. 
3	[deleted]
3	Loyal\nRitualistic\nDutiful
3	Reserved, organized, analytical.
2	Calculating is probably my favorite word. Love to hyper-analyze everything and know how everything works and can't decide if i'm reserved or just bored by most people because i enjoy figuring them out and what makes them tick.
2	Chill, silly (once you really get to know me), loyal
1	logical, reliable, realistic
7	Self-help books for ISTJ?	A close relative of mine, who is thirteen y.o. and tests out as an ISTJ, just discovered self-help books ("Managing Oneself" by Drucker). She now talks about skipping college and starting a business. Before she jumps to conclusions too fast, I'd like to recommend a few more books to read. What are some books that have been crucial to you as far as identity, college education, and job choices?\n\nThanks,
2	As far as starting a business goes I recommend that she develop at least somewhat of an understanding of accountancy before ever looking into it.\nI think that a sense of purpose is very important for young ISTJ's particularly in their long term goals but be aware that dropping out early and only taking business subjects can reduce future possibilities if she were to change her mind. It's also important that someone going into business has expertise in the field they wish to start a business in which she may lack.\n\nI would propose looking to give her work experience somewhere either in a management system or even as an entry level worker. \n\nPersonally my belief is that more often than not business degrees are a waste of money besides granting you connections in the business world. Plus the ISTJ stereotype does work against her in such an environment.\n\nBe cautious
2	The little "blank" books of "blank" series, by Jeffery Gittomer. Extremely instrumental in my development of sales and leadership skills. 
2	She's 13 - why are you worrying about it?  Let her read what she wants and just support her choices.  I guarantee her mind will change a thousand times as she gets older.
1	What kind of business is she trying to start?\n\nAlso, skipping college is a pretty excellent idea, depending on what it is you want to do with your life. As an ISTJ, by nature, she would make an excellent software engineer, and I can tell you that college is entirely unnecessary to get into that field. \n\nEdit: As far as your actual question, I can't really help. I knew what I wanted to do in life when I was around 5 years old.
4	X-post "What do you guys think about horror movies, haunted mazes and other spooky shit?" from[r/istp]	what do you think istjs ??
6	I generally enjoy haunted houses and other spooky situations for the people watching. Observing people's reactions to startling atmospheres and events can be hilarious and kind of endearing in an odd way. I enjoy scary films but tend to shy away from excessive gore. Give me cerebral horror or an interesting monster over torture porn any day. 
4	My ISTJ boyfriend works at the Haunted Hayride every year as a hay truck driver. He's amused by the scary "shenanigans", but is immune to it. He's far more scared of things like change.\n
3	It's a no go for me. I lose my crap in haunted houses. 
2	2 spooky
2	Not my thing, but I'm trying to expand my horizons, so I wouldn't refuse if invited.
2	I love horror movies, and am a huge serial killer/unexplained phenomena nerd. The gorier, the better. \n\nI'll go to a haunted house or the corny Halloween mazes and hayrides, but its mostly for support of friends and family members. I typically find them too hacky and often boring.  It is funny to watch other people in those environments though. 
1	I will pass lol
1	Nope, nope get it away from me. I am okayish if I'm watching a video of others going through it, but in general, I'm not really into it. I do enjoy horror if there is a more psychological element, or rather appreciate that over jump scares, but still. Not my favorite genre.
1	Your answers guys turned out to be the exact opposite of what I expected it to be, well that went well \nThanks to all of you 
1	It's fun to be in mazes with others who will react to them. I don't react to haunted mazes anymore. I just go through it and can tell where they come from, which kills the fun for me. I love reading creepypastas and other stories.\n\nHorror movies need to be more than a jump scares in order for me to enjoy it. I can't remember the last horror movie I truly enjoyed. 
1	I enjoy horror movies, particularly when they use atmosphere and situations to build fear. When it goes way too far (Dead/Alive, or the Evil Dead for instance) is another way I like them. Haunted mazes/houses/etc don't really do anything for me, because even if I have a physical reaction I don't get "scared," so to speak. 
1	I think horror movies in general are stupid.  The vast majority of them can be solved in the first 5 minutes with a 12 gauge, a machete, or a match (if a load of 00 buck to the face doesn't kill it, chop off its head and light it on fire, there's not many creatures in horror lore that will survive all 3).  I do enjoy zombie movies, though.\n\nThat said, I enjoy the lore behind the horror genre.  But I'm like that with a lot of things.  For example, I love the lore behind the Star Wars movies, but the actual movies themselves, not so much.
12	Help with ISTJ-INFP Relationship	Hi Everyone,\n\nINFP here, in a long-term, very committed relationship with an ISTJ (who is on the verge of ESTJ). Lately, we have been having a lot of fights over small things that blow up into days-long affairs. \n\nI love him for many reasons: his unwavering support of my at-times unstable career, the way he laughs at all my jokes, his social-minded activism and his utter devotion to me, which started day 1. \n\nHowever, there are things that feel insurmountable at times. We fight about stupid things, like how one should load a dishwasher. (I don't particularly care how people load a dishwasher, as long as it's done in a way that fits everything in, but he has a very specific way to do it. He interprets my lack of concern as disrespect, I think.) These small things turn into big things, and the way that we argue is not effective. I always feel he is trying to "win" and he feels I am unreasonable. He is very stubborn (as, perhaps, am I), and I think my emotions scare him. \n\nI have tried to explain to him that there are many different ways for people to live -- that there is never one right and perfect way to approach a task or idea, and that while he may believe that his way is the most efficient way to do something, not everyone values efficiency above all else. He cannot comprehend this. Am I crazy for trying to explain that/believing that? Does that sound crazy to other ISTJs out there?\n\nI feel very alone in our relationship sometimes. Perhaps worth noting is that we live very far away from my family, all of whom are ENxx, for his job. I have a few N friends here, but I really value being able to connect deeply with my partner. \n\nI think if we could better understand each other's approaches to life, he might understand that I'm not trying to ruin his life when I forget to close the cabinet drawers, and maybe I won't melt into a puddle of misunderstood emotion who feels like she's being controlled when he suggests I organize my closet. Can anyone point me to a book or resource that could help us understand each other? Any ISTJs have advice on how I can better understand him and vice versa? INFP/ISTJ success stories? \n\nPS -- this is my first Reddit post! I've also only recently gotten into MBTI. Apologies if I'm doing this all wrong. 
6	I can hopefully give you some insight as to what he's thinking because I feel like I was in a similar situation with my ex. We used to fight about a lot of stupid things as well, but not exactly dishwashers. The dumbest thing we argued about was archery safety after we visited a park.\n\n* I most definitely came off to her as stubborn since I was in fact trying to win the argument in this case. I was just trying to prove a point about her safety and the safety of others. When we argued, hopefully my point would convince her to do it my way.\n* If my gf and I argued over how to load a dishwasher, my way of thinking would be similar but different:\n\n**My explanation of myself**\n\nI probably would have came off to her as stubborn but I wasn’t trying to, I was just trying to prove a point. As long as she understood my point, she could still decide to do it her way and I wouldn’t be upset.\n\nI admit that even in the dishwasher scenario, I would still be trying to prove a point. But in that case I wouldn’t be trying to win. I most likely was just trying to explain to you how to be more efficient with the dishwasher.\n\n**My explanation of him**\n\nI’m very sure he likes to analyze and optimize things. He’s most likely just trying to share that optimization with you :) When you dismiss it (or whatever you do), he’s probably upset that you won’t listen to him fully explain himself so he can talk for an hour and a half on how to properly load a dishwasher with extreme precision. He’s probably got it down to a science yo. But seriously, if you actually listen you’ll probably have an interesting insight into how he thinks\n\nListen to him and fully understand his logic. Then you can either humor him by agreeing to do it like that for now on or tease him and say he’s overthinking it and continue to do it your way. He would be fine with that so long as your understood what he was trying to explain. I personally think it’s hilarious when  girl rolls her eyes at my over complication of simple things.\n\n**Improvements for him**\n\nHe shouldn’t get upset over how to load a dishwasher even if you won’t understand his point of view. In my opinion, that’s an extremely unimportant subject. He probably needs to learn how to relax and not take small things so seriously. Since he loves you he will analyze you and learn how to optimize his life around your small quirks. I’m not sure how else to explain it in a non-robotic fashion though… It just may take a while for him.\n\nFor more serious topics, if he’s trying to prove a point, he should be able to communicate it well. He needs to be fully open and patient with you, both emotionally and logically. In the end, he could also learn a lot about you by just letting you talk and explain YOUR point of view on the subject. Just make sure you come prepared with a good explanation of your side.\n\nIn the end, he will have fun figuring out the perfect middle ground for both of you if you let him.
4	I've never been in a relationship, so I'll leave out any advice on that front, but I might help you understand where he is coming from.\n\nWhen we grow up, we learn a certain way to do things, usually from our parents (though not always). We see this as the tried and true methods. We are aware of the issues and how to work around them. \n\nMost people get this idea. However, it is hard to understand the depth as to which this is a part of us. To get us to open our minds to a new concept is incredibly difficult and time-consuming, but it can be done. \n\nFor me, I need a vast (yuge) amount of experience and data to be able to fully accept something. For example, to understand another person's way of living, I need to know everything about it. I need to know their routine, their mindset, and especially their basic belief system. If I don't know these things, I can't wrap my head around their way of life.\n\nSide note: I spent my summer with 13 Feelers and only 1 other Thinker. It was really hard for us to connect at all, mostly because I thought they were irrational, and they thought I was unemotional. Probably the hardest group of people for me to wrap my head around.
2	Are you my wife? Seriously...\n\nI don't go on tangents about dishwasher loading and closing cabinets though. I do expect her to clean up after herself and do the "chores' she's agreed to. And if we discuss something, I'm typically trying to make her see my way and agree with it.\n\nWe're not doing well though. We want drastically different things in life. Living, traveling, nutrition... We don't agree on any of them and it's extremely draining being with someone who doesn't want to do all the things you want to do.\n\nMy advice, talk to him about the big stuff. Make sure this is something you've both thought out. Be honest and open about what you want and expect and make sure he is too.\n\nFor the issues, I'd suggest telling him, gently, that you understand he's probably put an intense amount of study into how he's doing something and that you appreciate that's he wants to help you be more efficient. But you might not always agree or might not care if it takes you 10 seconds longer to do something. Remind him that leaving a cupboard open isn't a big deal and that you're trying to improve.\n\nI'd second asking him how he processes information and why the cupboard thing is such a big deal.\n\nIf you have the patience to understand him, he'll likely learn a lot from you and vice versa.\n\nGood luck!

1	I think his showing you the most efficient way to load a dishwasher is actually beneficial to you. Sure, it takes a bit more care, but wouldn't it free up more leisure time for you in the end? \n\nThe shutting of doors is less logical to me unless one has little children or other problems I guess, and I think he could be a little more lenient with you on that one. \n\nYou're not crazy for your casual perspective, just like he's not crazy for valuing efficiency. Does it actually cause you stress and anxiety to organize your closet? If so, let him know. Let him help you organize it. Tell him that you're trying your best, but your personality has certain limitations (inferior Te). Show him a better way to help you than to be "controlling" (I'd hate someone trying to control me too).\n\nI'm a mid-30s INFP with a late 30s ISTJ (or he could be Si heavy ESTJ), and he has never criticized the way I run my place, because he doesn't live with me. I suppose we will clash on those things someday, but part of growing older and wiser as an INFP is getting a better handle on our inferior Te function and part of that INCLUDES having better control over your emotions. In other words, in order to become a mature, well-rounded INFP, you *should* be getting more organized, less emotional, and see and reap the benefits of that. So he's really kind of helping you along your way, but you have to be open to it. \n\nOn his part, his growth means developing his empathetic, positive solution-oriented side. He will need to see that there isn't just one way to do something if he wishes to be a well-rounded healthy ISTJ. You can help him see that but your most successful way of influencing him is to demonstrate your arguments from a logical perspective.\n\nAs for resources, you can check out Facebook MBTI groups like "INFP Relationship Support", "ISTJ", "ISTJ (moderated)" as well as the Personality Cafe and Typology Central forums. Do a google search for ISTJ and INFP relationships (or whatever search terms you like) and you'll find a wealth of information and anecdotes. If you eventually get deeper into studying cognitive functions, this is a very very helpful site: http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/masterposts\n\nI've been keeping a tally of INFP-ISTJ couples and have counted almost a 100 now, from various places, but about 60% from Facebook alone. Many seem very happy, not all but many. So, I have strong hopes that you guys will pull through this. \n\nIt's also **crucial** for you to have N friends and not rely on him for all your emotional and intuitive needs. Good luck!
1	To be fair, I recently learned that there IS a right and wrong way to load a dishwasher. I think if it concerns shared spaces and possessions, you should probably just load them his way - don't make that the hill you want to die on. Like... Just do the dishes right or shut the doors. For your possessions, do as you please. \n\nThe bigger issue is the escalation. I'm an ENTP dating an INTP and escalation took a lot of work to halt. Why does it escalate? Do either of you bring up the past/outside influences to your fights? ("You always do this, you're so stubborn!", "this is just like the last time you did it!"). Do you resort to name-calling? Why is it blowing up?
4	Go on a birthday party or not?	Hey guys,\n\nI went to college in September and made new 'friends' at least pals. I decided to invite them to my birthday party at a local pub. Only one of four appeared. The rest three had an absolutely great excuse such as 'I forgot' and 'Okay but I'm already with another company, I will go there soon.' etc etc etc.. Actually it was a bit bad for me that none of my new 'friends' came, but after all, who cares... I enjoyed myself and had fun with another real friends. But! That one guy who actually came, had a round on him several times. It was a cheap place and I didn't mind, but basically I pay back those rounds because I don't like have a bad feeling about it. A week or two ago he messaged me to have a drink somewhere again. Alright, I said the place and the time up to you. If you figure out when and where, send me a message. (I didn't want to go to be honest..) He said it's okay, but within two weeks I didn't get any message from him. Today he invited me to his birthday party that be held on Saturday. And the place, which he chose is a very very expensive place to me. Not for him, because he is older than me and he has a job besides college. That's one of my problem and I think I will be alone with his older unknown friends. I don't want to go, but I promised to him when I was drunk that if he have birthday in the future, I will definitely go.\n\n**TL;DR:** I have a pal, he went to my birthday party, treated me with some beer. He want me to go their birthday party but the place is expensive and I won't know any of his friends who will be there. I don't want to go and I don't want to be a jerk because I promised him when I was drunk some months ago.\n\nWhat to do? I force myself to go, stay for about 2 hours and go home? Or not home.. have an excuse to go with other friends I promised to have a drink with those people as well? Holy moly...
5	Two choices: \n\nshow up early. Have some alone time with your bud. Get to know other friends that show up early in smaller setting. If it goes well, hang for awhile. If not, say you have somewhere else to be (let friend know ahead you may have to skip out early)\n\nOr \n\nTell friend you will have to come late. Say hi. Have a drink. If he introduces you to others, make conversation and see how it goes. Otherwise say you are beat from whatever you were doing earlier and bounce\n
2	Dude (or dudette) GO TO THAT PARTY!\n\nThink about it, if you go you'll make new social networking connections with those older fellows. Yes you might end up paying more than you expected but the payoff would reward you even more in the future. I know I'd go.
1	Maybe just come up with an excuse? Like you are sick or really busy and you have to cancel.
1	Best option for me is to plan a one-on-one time and give him a small present, before or after the date, and be apologetic that you have another obligation to attend. \n\nOr use Dsxm's solution. I'm really good at slinking out of obligations... 
1	You can buy him like one drink; you don't have to get drunk yourself to have fun!

1	I'm not much of a video game player honestly, but I do really like the Pokemon games. 
1	I used to be a "First Person Shooters or nothing" kind of guy.  Cut my teeth on Doom (the original).  Got into Real Time Strategy games (Red Alert FTW!) shortly after.\n\nI used to also play stuff like Quake 2, Quake 3, and Tribes (1 and 2) online.  I've tried playing more modern games online since then (Tribes: Ascend, COD:MW3), and they just don't grab me the way they used to.  I did play World of Warcraft from Vanilla through Cataclysm (never finished Firelands in Cata, though).  I haven't had much interest in multiplayer since then.\n\nSomewhere along the line, I started losing interest in the twitch-based FPS games and started playing some RPGs, Turn-based strategy, and even the action games needed a good story to hold my interest.\n\nThese days, I'm playing Civ 5, Fallout 4, and the Shadowrun games (Returns, Dragonfall, Hong Kong).  I occasionally work on my Deus Ex: Mankind Divided game (I loved Human Revolution and the original, played Invisible War, but man did that suck).  \n\nI've played most of the Assassin's Creed games (haven't been able to bring myself to finish Unity).  I miss the meta plot that ran through AC3 and was only lightly hinted at in Black Flag, although Black Flag was great in its own right.

9	Weekly Thread: What's your worst date story?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: What is the worst date that you or your friend have been on? How did you/your friend deal with it?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
11	I have two, both a few years ago, both from an online dating site. \n\n1, took me for ice cream. Decent guy. Nice car, definitely used it to impress girls. After ice cream, he suggested we go for a walk in the park a few blocks away. Ok, cool. We get in the car and he drives to the edge of the woods near the river, hops out of the car, and starts walking down this narrow, overgrown, dark path. There was a paved, lit, popular walking path 100 feet away but he insisted we go off the path where it's more private. Freaked out and left him there. \n\n2, met up at Starbucks. Super attractive... but then he talked about his mother THE ENTIRE TIME. How much he loves his mother, how he went to his mother's side whenever she called, about how he moved out but then couldn't stand to be away from mom and moved back in, telling me stories about how awesome his mom was. I think I went for one more date with him to give him a second chance (after rescheduling twice because his mom needed him) and then I was like, nope, can't deal with extreme momma's boy. Looked back through my messages and realized he'd mentioned his mom in his very first message to me. Shoulda seen it coming. 
12	Dateless here. ISTJ mind keeps me from dating. I must know I have a guaranteed success rate and a fairly decent match of personality before I ask them out.
4	I'll start things off! Went on a date in college with someone from a club that we were both a part of. She proceeded to to complain about every other member of the club, many of whom were my friends. Needless to say, there was no second date.  
3	So I'm 13 or 14, super awkward and I'm on my first real date. The girl was previously one of my best friends. I asked her to be my girlfriend, a year later we're on our first "date." The date: go to a restaurant and eat, then cross the giant ass parking lot to go to the movie theater. I'm shy, terrified of talking to most people and so I chicken out on getting us a table. She doesn't get us a table either. So we stand in their waiting area for a few minutes and then I ask if she wants to hit the arcade at the theater first. We ended up being in the arcade for 2 hours. We had fun, but I could hear her stomach growling. I bought us some snacks for the movie, and then my mom picked us up.\n\nIt was awkward for me because I kept wondering if she knew why we were still in the arcade. If she knew what a pansy I was. I never asked her about it.
8	Do you use electronic media as a substitute for IRL social interaction?	Do any of you use the Internet and television as substitutes for IRL social interaction? I most certainly do. I prefer to keep my work life at work, and my home life at home. As such, I do not discuss personal issues at work, or let anybody know what I do on my off time. Forming friendships at work is out of the question. I am there to do a job in exchange for a paycheck, and nothing more.\n\nI also have basically no interests outside of the home, as I do not like participating in meaningless social conventions that only exist to make the extroverted people feel better, but I find draining, and 100% pointless to engage in. As such, I hardly have any IRL friends, and use the Internet and television as replacements for social interaction
2	I have friends in school and some from outside of school activities, but during down times, like holidays, I always tell my friend that i'll be "under my rock", so i ignore all their texts and messages, replying intermittently over a few days / a week. During that time, i'll most likely be chatting with anonymous people over the internet through different platforms. \n\nshort answer: yes, i do. but only at times since i still find it essential to have personal connections with people from school/work as it could come in handy at times. However, i will admit that crossing that line between personal and work doesn't come naturally for me and i have to do it consciously.
1	I mostly have a rule against adding coworkers on Facebook while I work with them. Just doesn't seem like a great idea to constantly be "around" them, even at home. It would suck if some drunken Facebook rant got back to my boss and cost me my job, or some other nonsense.\n\nAnyway, I view online interactions as a separate thing. You people all go away when I close the tab or the app. The same is not true IRL. I think it can work as a substitute, but not comprehensively. People IRL actually care. People on the Internet are dickwads.\n\nEdit: I don't think it's healthy to limit social interaction to the Internet. Use the Internet to make IRL friends. I suggest using meetup.com to find like-minded folk.
1	I wouldn't really call it a substitution. It just so happens that almost no person or activity in real life comes close to the fun and interactions I can get on the Internet (I don't watch TV). I have no friends, only acquaintances IRL and maybe one person I would actually call a friend online.\n\nI tend to talk about my personal life, experiences and thoughts in any place and conversation I deem necessary, so people understand where I'm coming from. I don't do this for bonding so it doesn't seem like I'd have to keep this information secret and away from other people. I also don't do it of my own accord and only when I think it would be beneficial to the conversation.
1	More or less, yes. I'm much better at making conversation through texts and social media than I am in real life. I think that's an Introvert thing honestly.
1	YES.
8	INFP and ISTJ relationship?	Infp here, I've been seeing an Istj guy and I'm wondering if anyone has any relationship experience with this combo. So far we really seem to balance each other out. Not really too worried about it or anything, I'm just curious to hear opinions about the dynamics in an Infp-Istj relationship.
5	Yes, I'm in a 1.5 year relationship with an ISTJ (he may be Si-ESTJ alternatively, but his Si is stronger than his Te I think). \n\nIt requires a lot of communication and patience. Our relationship is very rocky because of the particular ISTJ I chose and his financial and familial circumstances, but we're weathering it. He's still with me, and I am still with him. \n\n**PROS:** \n\n* Even though we're very different, we could talk to each other like old friends even from that first phone call/date. \n\n* I understand where he's coming from, and vice versa, but at the same time, we can identify each other's weak spots and call each other out with tough love. \n\n* Physical chemistry is great bc he's pretty masculine and I'm pretty feminine.\n\n* I respect his skills and knowledge. He respects my talents and drive.\n\n* We both want the same things ultimately, but he's very realist about getting there, whereas I want to work on it NOW.\n\n* I see the big picture better than him, and guide him toward making better long term decisions.\n\n* Personally, his being this "steady rock" has helped me get a lot more things done. His practicality has rubbed off on me, and I've made better career decisions due to him (he's like a catalyst for positive change in me). I think I am the same for him, and he's slowly fixing the hot mess that was his life thanks to me.\n\n* He's taught me to be more direct when I need to talk about my needs.\n\n**CONS**\n\n* The conversation can be lacking from an N-N perspective. I don't think he easily gets my N humor, and the bread and butter things he talks about doesn't allow for many opportunities for me to sparkle there with any wit or irony etc.\n\n* He works a lot, and love, romance, and play are not one of his top 3 priorities. Work, family, and personal time probably come before he feels relaxed enough to have a date with me (we haven't integrated our lives yet due to long distance).\n\n* He complains a lot about current circumstances, which is emotionally draining for me. I do wish he was less realist and more... positive about the future? I wish he was the type to dream of something he'd like to do and want to discuss with me how to make it happen. \n\n* He's very slow to make changes happen with regard to his social spheres, like he won't introduce me to his family until he's 100% sure it's ok to do so. Means a lot of waiting. 
3	I'm ISTJ (girl) and my boyfriend is INFP. We'll be together 4 years this June. \n\nI think our relationship now is in the best place it's been this past two years. We love each other a lot and we try to always communicate and state our emotions/feelings. The biggest problems we experienced were in fact fundamentally about faulty communication, since we tend to see and experience the world and other people a bit differently. \n\nWe like the same things because of different reasons, and we have a very similar sense of humor.\n\nDiscussing problems/ideas with him always gives me perspective about how other people may feel and opens me up to new possibilities. I tend to be too sterile and unimaginative at times and he helps me be more flexible.\n\nI am certain I have a positive effect on him as well, I always encourage him in whatever project he's pursuing at the moment and since I have an over abundance of structure I gladly give him some. I just try not to be too pushy.\n\nI think we balance each other's worst traits. 
2	I'm an Istj male with an Infp girlfriend. Its very strange. She appreciates my dependability and I enjoy her... Aloofness?\n\nWe do balance each other out. Our relationship is extremely platonic, but I'm not sure if that's because we're both introverted or what.
8	Genuinely boring or just hiding your fun side?	Which is the truth??\n\nEDIT: Welp, who knew ISTJ's get so triggered by the word 'boring'. Y'all disappointing as hell, I actual had high hopes and was expecting top quality banter. Tragic!
15	I'm boring to most people but a thrill to others, meh. I'm not here to impress anyone.\n\nBut yeah I'll take my night at home alone doing whatever I want over hanging with strangers...In any context.
8	Depends on who defines fun. There are a lot of people who want to do risky or immoral things because the mere act of coloring outside the lines is fun to them.\n\nI can have fun, but it needs to be in an appropriate environment and it needs to respect established boundaries.
6	I don't think I'm boring. You know what's boring? Facebook, parties where people talk about superficial bullshit, people complaining about first world problems, people who need attention to get by, people gossiping, people talking just because they can't bear silence, people getting on the latest bandwagon. \n\nI find your question boring. You have absolutely no idea the richness our lives bring. I bet most of us are content because we are living how we want and don't need external validation. You just assume it's boring because to you it's boring. \n\n
7	I've been told my explanations are way too long.
6	Depends on your perspective. Personally, I can be very silly/jokey/relaxed, but it takes a lot of work to get there. And I'm pretty okay with that fact. My "fun side" is not like how some others are -- where it is something they can be in almost all the time. It isn't something where I just need to access it and then I will realize it is cool and just be fun right away with people.\n\nI think of it like how some people have fun climbing tall structures, or riding roller coaster rides -- you sure as heck don't classify that as "fun" or engage in that behavior until the safeties are in place. Climbing a tall structure when you know one slip would be fatal -- not fun. Riding in a roller coaster ride when you are the only thing holding yourself inside the car -- not fun.\n\nFor me, social interactions are so variable -- different people have different needs, expectations, tolerances, and ways of being... And going into that loose and relaxed feels unsafe. Partly because when I am in that state, it is because I've decided I feel safe enough to stop carefully attending to everyone's body language, tone, expressions, etc. So I am legitimately more likely to wear on others' patience or to say something inappropriate without noticing right away.\n\nThink of it like letting out a carrier full of cats. If you have the room ready for them, it is nice and fine. If you let them go and then you discover the room is not ready at all -- it is kind of hard to just undo quickly. It isn't like I can snap back into controlled mode in a flash (not unless there's been a severe shock to the system, like someone yelling at me, or someone rushing off in an upset).\n\nThus, I am careful until I know what boundaries to set on an interaction with others. Those boundaries are like the safety bar on a rollercoater ride -- within them, I can now let go and enjoy myself, but first I need to make sure they are defined. 
3	I see this post as being quite pretentious. To a stranger, sure, I probably appear very serious and boring. But when I'm with my friends who appreciate my type of humor, it's not like that at all.
3	Both. Neither.  Context matters.\n\nWhen I'm at work, I'm boring (and bored).  I'm here to work (except right now, obviously).\n\nWhen I'm hanging out with friends, I can joke around just as much as anyone else.\n\nMost of the time, I'd rather be home playing with my dogs, watching TV, or playing games on my computer.  Fun to me?  Yes.  Boring to you?  Maybe, but entertaining some random dude on the Internet is not my problem.
3	Bad troll is bad.\n\nPerhaps you're someone that needs to have a string dangled in front of their face to stave off the ever-spreading infection of boredom but the reality is we are happy as we are and do not exist to entertain you. If you so insist that we are "boring" then maybe you shouldn't really be here in the first place. 
2	We're very fun when engaged about our interests. We often don't go to parties or things like that, and prefer to hang out in small groups and talk about our interests. I personally love to hang out with a friend or two who share my love for technology, engineering, hard science fiction/space, and programming, and we'll chill and smoke some pot and talk about flight simulators, physics, coding, or really any similar technical topic. That or I'll get together with my guitarist and play some music. It might sound boring to someone who wants to go to a club, but to people who are interested in STEM and detail oriented I guarantee it's a blast to put your mind and knowledge to work and just talk about how the universe works around us. We're all silly and goofy as long as everyone knows each other very closely and have a blast in our little single digit attendee party.
2	Boring with a fun side.
2	I feel like I'm entertaining and fun on the inside but the minute I try to be cool or funny with people I realize that I cannot explain what I have to say in an engaging way.
1	Boring and fun, for the most part, aren't things people learn; either they are, or they aren't, right? And of those two extremes, the obviously superior and preferable one is fun.\n\nAnd the very first thing you did when coming here was call us all boring. It's a diss, so it didn't really go over well. Would you expect any other reaction?\n\nWhat if someone showed up in some niche subreddit you were an active subscriber of and asked "So are you all genuinely stupid, or are you just hiding your intelligence? Which is the truth??" Even if it was from the perspective of a climate scientist trying to learn more about how climate deniers think, it'd still be rude.\n\nAnyway, to answer your question, if we're having fun, you don't have to ask. Just look at our faces. We we have fun, we look the same as everyone else. It might not come as easily for us as some other personality types, but when it does, it's pretty damn strong.
1	Nice b8 m8.\n\nSome would say I'm boring, at least until they get to know me. 
1	I see I missed the fun.\n\nI'm genuinely boring. I can be fun, at least in my mind, but I'm normally pretty boring. My "fun" is often repeating the same activity I've done previously. Most people find that boring.\n\nI think the problem for me is what people see as "fun", I see as risky or dangerous. We're very concerned about our safety and well being and the risk would need to be strongly outweighed by the reward. That doesn't happen often.
1	Maybe you're not sharp enough to comprehend our wit. 
1	I've found that 'pleasure' is the closest equivalence of others' perception of 'fun'. I find that being gripped by a great book immensely pleasurable, however I don't equate the prospect of staying out until 3am with a group of people in order to conform to a collective notion of 'fun' the least bit pleasurable. \n\nI derive pleasure from learning new things and thinking about how they fit into my own worldview, or discovering a word in another language which has no precise counterpart in English. I know that these small pleasures enhance my life in ways which I cannot fully articulate, but sense nonetheless that they are more satisfying to me than the aforementioned fun. 
5	Weekly Thread: What do you think gets more hype than it deserves?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: What product/person/topic do you think people hype up much more than they should?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
9	Since we are in January, one that sticks out is the new year. People hype up their New Year's resolutions for months leading up to it, when they could in fact start their "New Year's resolutions" at any time. I try to make the transition  to a new year as seamless and normal as possible, because I don't like change much as it is. 
3	Overwatch
5	Honestly, and I really hope this stays civil.\n\nDonald J. Trump. Sure he's a bit of a twat, but all sides hype him way more than he deserves.  \nHis supporters hype him as the god emperor, fixer of America, etc. I don't think he will do all he says, he will for sure attempt to, and I hope he does well. But I highly doubt he will do as his most rabid supporters proclaim.  \nPeople against him hype him up to be the worst thing since Hitler. I don't believe he's actually facist, or going to bring the KKK back into prominence.\n\nHe just seems like a smart businessman, who wanted to prove his negotiation principles, and wanted to try something completely new. A rich guy with no challenges left.
2	The movie, and I guess book, The Notebook.  I don't get it.  Also, Ryan Gosling for that matter.
1	Everything
1	Radiohead. I'm really sorry everyone.
8	What would help fulfill you or get the most out of life?	If it is anything like me, it's to develop your inferior function, so that you can utilize it for your dominant function's desires. It's pretty clear to me (as an INFP) that my dominant function Fi will only dream and drift if it doesn't utilize Te to make those dreams a reality. \n\nHow can ISTJ's inferior function Ne help its dominant function Si? Is it by helping Si get unstuck and widening its focus to the bigger picture? Is it by adding spontaneity and fun to an otherwise routine life? Anything else? Is there more to Ne's benefit to Si than that? 
2	> How can ISTJ's inferior function Ne help its dominant function Si?\n\nAt least for me, Ne doesn’t really help my other functions that much. I imagine this is mostly because I haven’t developed it too well yet – I’m only in my early 20’s. Ne typically manifests, for me, in the form of incessant worrying about how things might go wrong; all that Ne creativity and exploration is used to think up a thousand and one ways things could go wrong and blow up in my face. This has a chilling effect on my ability to try new things and get outside my comfort zone. To make things worse, since Ne is my inferior function, most of this happens unconsciously. I’m not sitting down trying to make a list of dooms day scenarios, but my brain just offers them up anyway. \n\nGiven this, in the last year, I’ve been trying to make a concerted effort to develop my inferior function. For me, this means using my other higher up functions (specifically Te) to help make changes in my life to develop Ne. Specifically, this means putting myself in new situations, exposing myself to new ideas and new types of people, and just generally trying to “explore”. \n\nI’d be curious to know if this expiriance is shared by other types. Does your Te function tend to have a negative effect on your life, particularly when your stressed? Are you able to develop it by using your more dominant functions?\n
2	I might be too blunt by saying this since I'm not talking about the functions and only answering the title question, but there are two ways that would make my life fulfilled:\n\n1. Almost everyone and everything around me changes since there are way too many things and people that annoy me, even though I don't show it.\nThis won't happen.\n\n2. I get left alone and only have to do with people I can tolerate, that don't distract me or get in the way of me concentrating on more important things than the issues they might as well resolve themselves. I also don't have to be forced into a system that makes me work for other people's wallets.\nWon't happen either.\n\nAs I see it I will never have a fulfilled life. The most I can get out of it is leaving people I can't stand out of my life as much as possible (been pretty successful doing so until now) and doing what seems most appropriate to my morals and standards, which mostly revolve around justice and emotional as well as physical comfort.

36	New Mod!	Hi ISTJ Team. Over the last 9 months the 2 other mods and I have been trying to help make the subreddit better for you guys. Since then, one mod deleted his account and the other has been inactive. To remedy this situation, I've invited /u/BlackDeath3101 to the mod team. BlackDeath has been a regular contributor to the subreddit and I believe will help make /r/ISTJ even better. \n\nIn terms of what this means for the subreddit, we will continue to try and add improvements like flairs and weekly threads, while ensuring that the sub remains free of spam while ensuring that free conversation can occur. \n\nIf you have any suggestions for the subreddit, please feel free to contact us, we'd love to hear them! 
11	Cool, nice to have a new mod. \n\nThanks for the effort.
8	Thanks 
4	Nice job
5	Welcome!
17	Your life advice for other ISTJs? Share your knowledge!	This is specially directed towards the eldest ISTJs. As a young 20 year old ISTJ, I would really appreciate it if other fellow ISTJs could share with us any free advice. Tips to improve, stories that teached you something, those things you've learnt with time and experience, those that you wish you knew before. Life, relationships, education, learning style, work, free time, time management... Anything!\n\nBy the way, other types sharing something worth mentioning are welcome too!\n\nI'll start with this: \nRead all you can. If you don't have the habit, start with something that genuinely interests you and not what other people want you to read. Our first function is introverted sensing; we are factual individuals who store tremendous amounts of data. If you read books written by masters and insightful people, you are basically absorbing their valuable knowledge. Think about it, the thoughts they developed and shaped through their whole lifetime, and you can learn ahead from them. And, even if you disagree with it, it still gives you insight and shows you different ways of looking at things, or it might make you think on something that could lead you somewhere. 
18	That's not the sky falling, it's rain, and It's why you brought an umbrella. This too shall pass; everything is going to be OK. 
12	I'm only 26 so take this with whatever size grain of salt you deem necessary but I'd advise learning to let things go. I know I can be organized to a fault and get upset when people insist on not doing things "correctly" or efficiently. Live and let live. Truly accept that people do things differently and that is okay.\n\nAlso, more an introversion thing than an ISTJ thing, but force yourself to go out and do things. I consistently score in the 95th percentile for introversion, and as much as I would love to live by myself and hermitize, I need to interact with people. I need to see people face-to-face on a daily basis or my socialization muscle starts to atrophy. It's not always pleasant but it's important to see people and hold conversations with people that last longer than the 30 seconds it takes to buy groceries.
6	We can do just about anything if we put our minds to it. But maybe for a career it's better to do something that doesn't sound exciting but is well suited to your personality. It's hard because not every possible job or career is on those lists you find in books or online. This is what I'm finding at 30 and a few years into my career. I can do it and people recognise that I'm competent, but I'm not happy. My work is interesting to read about but actually doing it requires too much abstract thinking and politics and other fluffy stuff I don't like. \n\nAnd what someone else said above about not being too rigid. That's very important for relationships!
5	ISTJs are super-responsible, at times way too much so. I've been told as much by different people and I've seen it in my own life. Taking responsibility so seriously can cause a lot more stress, so this is something to be aware of. \n
6	How does Fi manifest in ISTJs?	
4	Ok here goes....\n\nFi being pretty low on the ISTJ functional stack, it's worth noting that most of us aren't too cognizant of how we use Fi or how it manifests. What's more, when it does manifest it can do so in unhealthy ways -- as is the case with any tertiary function of any type. \n\nFor me, Fi tends to manifest in my caring very deeply about certain things: usually people, sometimes ideas, rarely possessions. This can be constructive in that it can let me be more emotionally open than I otherwise would be. It means I can be more trusting and caring towards other people, more emotionally intimate, and more willing to "follow my heart" as it were. Concretely, Fi looks something like "I know this doesn't make sense logically, I know it's risky, I know it might be dangerous, but I don't care. I'm going to do it anyway because it's important to me." As I said before, this sort of thinking can be very constructive.\n\nAs I also said before, that sort of mindset can be vary negative when employed improperly. An example might be: if I'm having an argument with someone and tempers get high, I might say something that I later regret. Normally, I chose my words vary carefully and think before I speak (I imagine this is the case for introverts generally and ISTJ's specifically). But when Fi takes over I'll disregard the more logical way of thinking (Te) and go with my gut instinct regarding how I feel.
3	From what I've observed, it manifests as strong opinions on certain things or people. Having definite favorites and dislikes. Loyalty. Very emotional language when upset (not so much when very happy, but they still make it clear in no uncertain terms).

6	Anyone here married or in a long-term relationship with an INTJ?	I have been married to an ISTJ for over 20 years.  We ran into some problems a few years ago and it's just like we are stuck.  Do you feel that ISTJs can change how they emote?  Do you find that you agree with your SO just to keep the peace?  I am an INTJ and when I started researching this combo I got very discouraged - mainly because so much resonated with my real life.  (PS - I only found out about the Myers-Briggs tests this summer).
10	I'm INTJ and my wife is ISTJ. We've been married 9 years now and everything has been great between us for the most part (nothing more than the rare but typical married couple arguments).\n\nI don't have to just agree to keep the peace, and I think she feels the same way. We both do compromise and we're both patient people though. I think we're lucky because for 99% of things we already agree. And when we don't it's kind of rare that we don't see the logic in each other's views.\n\nI don't hold a lot of stock in Meyer's Briggs personally. There's a lot more to people than 4 letters can represent. In terms of relationships they're even more complex. A 20 year marriage is worth investing the time to save. Personally I'd recommend marriage councilng. Being able to talk with a councilng type person would probably help each of you see the other's point of view.
1	Hi there. I am an INTP married to an ISTJ and am having similar problems / questions with our marriage. We have been married 10 years and ran into significant marital problems that festered. I over analyzed the problems and tried to correct them logically. He just pulled away and didn't share any feelings or want to discuss anything. As a result I feel like our issues were never fully resolved and have only festered. Communication is very surface level with him and there is no time or energy for him to talk on a deeper level about anything. \n\nI know you posted this sometime ago but I am interested to know if your concerns have been addressed and if things are better with your marriage. 
3	Could use more ISTJs in Typology Server	
2	I joined. It's a nice active server. 
1	Btw, I think some people have joined and then left. Either message me or a mod to get your type. I have the permissions set where a lot is hidden.
7	Chief Bogo is ISTJ... how would you type the other Zootopia characters?	Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde?
5	Loved that movie. I felt like it related to me on so many levels actually. 
2	Judy hopps Esfj\n\nNick Intj
1	Will have to watch the movie now.
6	Weekly Thread: BOLD Predictions! What are your predictions for the upcoming year?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: BOLD predictions! What do you think will create headlines in 2017? Who will die? Which companies will have scandals? What major scientific breakthroughs will we have? Here's your chance to put your predictions in writing so if it comes true you can forever say that you called it!\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
6	* Queen Elizabeth II will pass away, Australia and Canada will vote to remove the British monarchy as the country's Head of State\n* North Korea will have a failed missile launch\n* Trump will 'forget' about building the wall\n* Measles outbreak in USA\n* UK finds a way to reverse Brexit\n* Germany will stop accepting refugees
2	I hate bringing up politics on here, but I honestly think that Donald Trump will not do any of the crazy/radical things he said during his campaign. I didn't vote for the guy, but i'm willing to give him a chance and wait to actually judge his presidency (or parts of it) until he has actually taken office.\n\nMore people we like/love are going to die. I mean, celebrities/actors/musicians, etc. They are not getting older. The fact that Keith Richards is still alive (i'm still convinced he's actually dead) is astounding, and Queen Elizabeth will most likely pass away as well. \n\nHonestly, as far as scientific breakthroughs are concerned, I think there will be more advances made toward curing cancer in it's entirety, and that we will make more strides toward sending someone to Mars. Also, i'd like to see more breakthroughs in Cryonics (I just find it oddly fascinating and interesting) as well. 
2	I'm guessing populism will grow in popularity all around
7	Question from an ESFP	Hey guys Im an ESFP and i was just curious, what are ISTJ's like? I looked online and kind of got an idea, but what are more specific examples you guys do that make you tick? I'm a huge people person, but i don't think i could just spot out certain personalities.
12	I don't know about others, but one important personality trait I observed about myself is a very low level of enthusiasm for pretty much anything. Means nothing I do truly makes me tick. There are only levels of simple enjoyment. I get the most of it when I can do stuff on my own (hobbies and interests). When other people are included, it's best when there aren't too many, and are fully connected via those same interests.
7	This is a vague question lol. I am pretty sure you are my girlfriends type. Well I am quiet and we really only open up to close friends. I guess it's like an iceberg. We show a little bit but most people won't see the others sides of us. I am level headed and structured. Idk what else do you want to know lol
6	A lot of information on the internet is either blown out of proportion (e.g., suggesting that ISTJs are always rigidly punctual -- some of us are insanely punctual, others of us aren't (but might be "rigid" about something else we care about)). Other sources aren't inaccurate, but they are insanely two-dimensional and misleading. For instance, I think you can argue that we are rule-based people -- but some sources will go on to suggest that we therefore work best in large organizations that have lots of rules and structure.\n\nIn reality, the "rules" I have are usually a "best answer" that I came up with after doing a more or less systematic search for information on some area of interest.  For instance, I have a specific way I go about making pan-fried steak that is based on having looked over a few websites and consolidating the information into a method that makes a steak I like the taste of. \n\nI am actually *extremely* skeptical of and resistant to other people's rules when they impact me unless one or more of the following is true: (1) The full rationale is explained, including the rationale for excluding other options or behaviors, (2) I don't really care about the area in question enough to learn that much about it, or my goal is specifically to help someone else with their goals in the way they prefer, or (3) I have come to trust the person or source implicitly, which is extremely rare -- I only feel that way about one or two people at most right now, and even then, I am usually open to contrary evidence and still conscious of it being a "best answer" and not the only answer.\n\nOne thing I've observed about myself is that I actually really enjoy getting into a pedantic level of detail about things. I enjoy understanding things better, even when they're outside my area -- for instance, I recently was exposed to how complicated it is to estimate the number of deaths that can be attributed to a substance, and how much systematic study and specificity goes into the process. I love knowing that that is true, and love knowing that I could learn more about it. Everything is that way -- we can always get more pedantic, detailed, specific, and careful about how we write and communicate about things.\n\nWhile I don't think *all* ISTJs are quite as happy being pedantic about things that don't directly contribute to their own activities and goals (Enneagram type can play a role), I would guess that we all have an appreciation for how complicated everything is, and just how much of what we understand is actually a shortcut, or a convention -- something that works well enough for our purposes, but that is inaccurate on some level. (For instance, strawberries aren't actually berries, and bananas *are* -- it has to do with having seeds on the inside and developing from one ovary of a plant versus several ovaries -- i.e., botany details I am not familiar with.) \n\nPart of my caution in life is knowing that the entire world is full of those kinds of details -- and in those areas I care most about, I want to know ALL of the details so that I can build complete and defensible knowledge bases. I don't want to find myself, for example, making some grand hypothesis that relies on berries being small only to find out that bananas are berries too, and therefore having everything I was building on ruined. I want to know all those messy little details up front -- and I generally am of the opinion that those messy details can be quite fascinating, especially when they're in an area of particular interest to me.
3	As an ENFP, I really struggle with relating to ISTJs since they are everything that I am not. They are private people, that shine mostly through their focused work ethic and accomplishments. They are responsible, reliable, and very honest. They like to have a practical system in this world. I would think that it's a pretty difficult personality to spot since they are so private.
2	I answered in a separate comment -- but for my part, I don't know a lot about ESFPs either, and I feel like (just like with ISTJs), there is a good deal on the internet that is misleading or two-dimensional. Any chance you'd indulge my reflecting your question back, and asking "What are ESFPs like?"
2	Si - we base things off of personal experience and are very subjective in our worldviews, and try to understand other people's views by putting ourselves in their shoes. we are also very nostalgic and like things to remain constant (to a degree). people that do not adhere to our general standards and morals tick us off sometimes.\n\nTe - we want to be structured, like organization, cleanliness (to a degree, again). people that are unstructured and messy tick us off sometimes.\n\nFi and Ne are important too, but these first two functions lay out a good portrait imo.\n\nticks:\n\n* people wanting us to be people persons\n* removing us from our comfort zones unless we are willing (we need to be removed in order to build or Si, but only when we are ready)\n

1	I think I'm a pretty normal person. lol   I'm not really the weirdo shut in some people make ISTJ's out to be.  I like going out and meeting people.  I'm actually the most likely person to seek out new people and make them feel the most comfortable if they are new to our group.  It's just that when I need to recharge and need a break I want to be alone and I love being alone until I'm ready to go back out into the world.  I'm introverted in my thinking always in my head, not so much socially introverted.
12	ISTJ's and making friends on the graveyard shift.	Alright, this is kind of a hard question, with a lot of detail, so I'll include a TL;DR at the end.\n\nSo, I'm a 26 year old 37/40 ISTJ, and I have a LOT of trouble making new friends.  I have never really had many friends in particular, mostly work colleagues, but since I started my job on third shift (10pm-7am), I have struck out on all avenues of trying to make new friends.  I don't really have the option of making work colleagues friends anymore, because I work alone, in a sealed and locked office, without other human interaction.\n\nNow, I do have a girlfriend, and I love her very much, but she works a different shift from me, and we don't get a lot of together and conversation time (additionally, she is an ESFP, so she doesn't really seem to relate in any way to the "no friends" issue).  I have tried Craigslist ads, meetups, even dating sites, trying to find others within reasonable driving distance that I can have a basic conversation with during my awake time.  The few times that I have gotten bites for conversations, they always seem to peter out, because I cant seem to ever find common interests to talk about, and the basic question and answer conversation dies out.  My girlfriend always says "you don't like anything", and I cant really fault that, because when I run into a text box asking about my interests, I end up freezing up, because, other than working, sleeping, and occasional single player video games, I cant find anything that I'm interested in either.  I don't drink, I don't smoke narcotics, I don't really do anything to have a conversation about at night.\n\nI know, based on people's posts on here in the past, that a lot of you seem to be very much like me in personality.  So, what you all of you do to help find friends, especially those of you that don't get daily offline interaction via work or social activities?\n\nTL;DR: What do you do to find friends?
2	I mean, maybe to go about making friends you could try some hobbies and find one you might like and want to continue? That would be a good way to find out what you enjoy and create a sustainable friend base. 
2	What is wrong with not having friends? I envy your position. I can't bear my friends after an hour of being with them. As an intj I would recommend you just don't bother if you don't have any real interests you likely won't have any friends
1	These have all been really good replies.  Although I'm not really in a place where I can have a dog, I can definitely understand the need to try to substantiate a few special interests.  \n\nThanks everyone.
1	Your challenge is a difficult one.\n\nDo you have a religion you follow? Places of worship can be good places for meeting people. If you're not religious, there are Unitarian Universalist Churches that are more about being a good person than any specific religion.\n\nIf that's not a route you want to take, do you have any family near you? Sometimes hanging out with them and their friends produces connections.\n\nThe hard part is your shift. When I worked overnights it was as a game tester and I had 50 other people to interact with. Being solo makes it harder, and your shift is off from most people so weekends are probably prime time for those activities.\n\nNot sure where you are located but see if there's a Barcade near you. Arcade plus beer and food. There are enough people playing 4-6 player games that would be open to playing with a stranger. You build rapport working together and it's a laid back way of getting to know someone. If they have Killer Queen, that's a great game with a decent following.\n\nIf none of those are options, find 1 thing you could describe yourself as being passionate about. Then try the meetup thing again and see if there's a group for it.
7	Do you guys have vivid memories of your dreams?	I don't often dream or remember mine, but occasionally I do. Last night I had a strange and disturbing dream and couldn't get the images out of my head. I had to get out of bed and force myself to read until I couldn't stay awake. I can still see and feel the scenes from the dream even now. \n\nAnyone else have this issue? 
3	Once, I dreamed a real song.  It was probably one of the ten most fantastic experiences of my life.  I still remember it 40 years later.  \n\nIt was like being in the middle of a symphony while they played.  I heard every instrument, and every note.  There was no visual, I just heard this symphony in my head.  But with clarity I had never experienced.\n\nI didn't even particularly like the song, but they played it all the time on the radio at that time.  Holy shit, when I woke up and couldn't believe I had just experienced it.  I think I had just realized the complexity of it and for whatever reason, it was my dream.\n\nI still don't think it's the greatest song: [Boz Skaggs Lido Shuffle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQZBaJAngH8)\n\nI also had a running dream where I had this friend when I was 8.  I had a dream about this girl for weeks before she faded away.  No idea where she came from, but I remember looking forward to going to sleep so we could do stuff together.  And we did.
2	I recently had a dream about a girl that I thought I was over. The dream was completely innocent, but her appearance has surprised me. The images of her in my dream keep invading my thoughts, and I'm more distracted now than usual. I don't usually have issues waking up during the night, but I do resonate with the strange/vivid dream that remains in your thoughts. This may something that isn't personality based, though.
1	Similarly to /u/SlapaDaBass2731 I don't beleive this influenced by personality. I think everyone can be bothered by things they've drempt about. The content that we find bothersome might differ, but I would guess that you'd be hard pressed to find someone who hadn't been bothered by a dream, or elements of a dream. 
1	I tend to remember my dreams.  Some in detail even years later.  I also am apt to pull in real life.\n\nOne time I was dreaming in Spanish.  (I don't speak Spanish!)  My former classmates from high school Spanish class were there.  I woke up to a Spanish language show on the TV.\n\nLast night I was dreaming about getting these text messages from my sister, one after another.  Finally, woke up because the messages alarm on my phone was going off.  (My darn phone only rings for 4 seconds for a call, but rings over and over every minute for a text message.)
1	I tend to only have vivid dreams under stress. Whether that is due to NI or just a factor for every personality type, I'm not sure.
1	I rarely remember my dreams - that being said I remember bits and pieces of a handful of dreams. Some of those dreams I had years ago :p
1	I remember a lot of segments from my dreams. From post apocalyptic Los Angeles, to almost realistic nightmares, I can only remember vivid portions but not the whole thing. This may be more influenced by my lucid dreaming things.\n\nThe only recurring thing that appears in some dreams is my teeth falling out but apparently that's caused by stress. 
1	Occasionally I'll remember some of my dreams, but not often. Usually just parts of them..
1	Nope, I have almost no memory of them personally.
1	Depends, usually not.
1	Not really an issue to me, but I have had some particular recurring dreams for years now. Infrequently, they will happen (hasn't happened this year yet, so...)    \n    \nLong story short, there's this (elderly?) man bound to a silver, metallic wheelchair, with a metal pole in his body, the length of his spine to esophagus. He's always with a little boy, near a swing set (presumably a relative..?). In one instance of the dream (for lack of better word, since I don't see it as a nightmare) the boy is about to be hurt by a giant stationary saw, and the wheelchair-bound man saves him and puts his neck under the machine-- tearing his skin/muscle, but for some odd reason, not killing him, thanks to the metal pole.     \n    \nAlso, I would have another recurring dream, in the setting of a dark, gloomy prague-esque mood. War tanks rolling by, and apparently this was supposed to be the *imaginary* neighborhood where my Grandmother resided. Her so-called house was in that dream as well, very gloomy, I suppose.\n\nI find such dreams oddly interesting, from both a logical and an exploratory standpoint.
1	[deleted]
1	I don't even have vivid memories of my memories. But I have a case of Aphantasia, so that might be an unusual problem for an ISTJ.
14	Is hapiness harder to achieve for an ISJT?	This might be due to my age (17), but although my study is going well and I am part of a nice family, im never content with my performance with girls and my side-job, and this makes me feel quite miserable a lot of times.\n\nSo is this an personality, age or individual thing? And are there any ways to feel more satisfied?
9	I'm 38, and about 5-6 years ago I figured out that I had the ability to be happy if I wanted. It was my choice each and every morning. I could choose to be grumpy about life, or I could choose to be positive/happy. There's only one person who can help me be the best, happiest me--and it's me. I now wake up each morning determined to help make other people smile. Do I still get down? Yeah, from time to time. But when I recognize that it's up to me to decide how I want to act/react to everything going on in my life and in this world, I really do like choosing being happy. Age and experience have shown me all of this. [Here is an article with more information about choosing happiness.](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4384433)
7	I'm much the same. I'm 23 and I was most content at University. I feel the main root of the problem is having a clearly defined sense of purpose. Sadly finding this is much easier said than done.
4	That's something a lot of people feel as a teenager. Everything changes after high school though.
3	First off, to back what others have said, these feeling are normal for people your age. You have yet to figure out who you really are and how you fit into this world. Everything dies change after HS, for better or for worse. \n\nBut I want you to keep in mind one thing: you are the one who starts every day. You are the one that will determine your outlook. Things may happen that are hard, or frustrating, or make you feel defeated in your life; everyone gets those times. But you have the choice of how to start each morning. \n\nI start my day with what makes me happy (as happy as anyone may be at 4:45am). I turn on music as I get ready, make some coffee. I leave early enough so that I am not rushing to get to work, I am not fuming at the driver in front of me because they are going slow. When I get to work, I sort my email, grab more coffee or tea, and breakfast. By the time the rest of my coworkers are in, I am awake, happy, and ready to face the day. \n\nThe point I am trying to make is this: Don't let external things drive your happiness. A large part of what makes someone content and happy in life is their outlook and perspective.  Start each day like it's going to be the best day of the week/month/whatever. There are days or even weeks that I find so unbelievably frustrating and make me unhappy, it happens. Don't let that define you every day.\n\nHopefully this provides some insight, I am 24 and have been working in a professional sense for almost 3  years now. 
1	Give it time. I went through high school miserable-ish but it picked up afterwards. Once you get more freedom to do things, you might see the world differently.
1	It's still hard for me, but not as bad as when I was 17. I'm 30.
1	I'm actually happy. But always eager to improve upon my current life.
1	What is happiness?
2	Recognizing change	Hi all,\nI'm currently attempting to re type myself (just to double check) and I think I've narrowed myself down to either ISTP or ISTJ. Anyways, I was wondering if this might be a good way of distinguishing them: how good are you at recognizing movements in the environment, I.e. Not usually seeing an centipede in a sink and then suddenly seeing it when it moves; OR maybe something like: recognizing when someone walks in a room even if your head is down. (I'm trying to distinguish if this is Si or Se)
1	That sounds like hyper awareness of your immediate surroundings... so Se.
4	What is your morning routine?	As an ISTJ I live well under order and that means specific steps in getting my morning right. I'm that kind of guy that will be up earlier than usual just to set my morning routine right. That said, I've never understood people who get up and get out without any routine. Anyone with me?
10	I have a routine in the sense that I do things in a specific order, however the time I get up and how long it takes me to complete my tasks can vary. I'm frequently interrupted and distracted.
5	I live alone. No interruptions here.\n\n6:00 hit snooze\n\n6:08 get out of bed, go to bathroom\n\n6:10 weigh myself then brush my teeth \n\n6:15 shower \n\n6:35 Blow dry hair \n\n6:40 Get dressed \n\n6:42 Take meds, get lunch out of fridge, go through my pre-leave the house list (cell phone, wallet, keys, water bottle)\n\n6:45 in my car and off to work \n\nTime's can vary as much as 5 minutes but I have the same exact routine every morning. 
3	4:30 wake up and realize it's too early. Go back to sleep.\n\n5:30 can't sleep no more. Watch porn\n\n6:30 realize it's too late now, hurry up to get ready to leave the house.\n\n7:30 get late to work
3	To maintain sanity and organize my day I need to be up 2 hours before everyone else in the house.\n\n* 5:00 - Alarm.\n* 5:05 - 5:10 - Run diagnostic (energy level, mood, hangover status), drink water, turn espresso machine on to heat up.\n* 5:10 - 5:20 - Bathroom for teeth brushing, morning constitutional, shave, shower.\n* 5:00 - 7:00 - Espresso (x2), check favourite news sites, reading, sometimes meditation.\n* 7:00 - Wake the rest of the family.\n* 7:05 - 7:45 - Breakfasts, lunches prepped, out the door, game on.\n\nAlarm time might change by one hour if I have a late night hockey game (once a week) or hangover forecast is grim (once a month or so).
2	7 or 8am: wake up\n\nGo on phone or try to sleep until my alarm rings at 8:30am\n\n8:30am go to bathroom and prepare myself\n\n9 to 9:30am: get ready and head out to the gym\n\nThat's pretty much been the routine for the last couple of months. 
2	My times can vary by 30 mins to an hour depending on when I climbed into bed.\n\nNormally though,\n\n5:55 first alarm (phone)\n6:05 second alarm (phone)\n6:00 - 6:10 Get up, stretch, gather myself mentally\n6:10 third alarm (phone)\nGet up - 6:15 Go to bathroom, look at a couple sites/check reddit/facebook\n6:30 fallback alarm (alarm clock)\n6:15 - 6:30 Shower, brush teeth, get dressed\n6:30 grab backpack for work, lunchbox if needed, and do item check (phone, wallet, keys, ID badge)\n6:35 - 6:45 In car driving away (unless the car is snow/ice covered)\n\nI sometimes eat breakfast before I leave if I'm up after the first alarm. I'll rarely wait for the fallback alarm, and then I normally bypass checking sites, speed the shower up and leave by 7\n\nOn weekends the process is pushed out about an hour depending on how late I was up
1	What are your routines OP?
1	I don't really have a routine. I wake up sometime between 730 and 8 am and speed through showering, shaving, and getting dressed and then speed to work.
1	My routine has been all out of whack lately thanks to my sleep schedule being the same, but in theory I get up at 5:30 and am out the door by 7.
1	As a commuter student my routine us built around getting the most sleep possible every morning and getting out the door. So it's not all that thoughtful but i do things in a particular order every morning so my morning zombie brain doesnt accidentally forget anything:\n\nWake up at 5:55\nBathroom: pee, brush teeth, wash face, moisurize\nBedroom: get dressed (normally lay my clothes out the night before)\nBathroom: makeup, hair\nKitchen: Grab a coffee and a granola bar\nOut the door by 6:10
1	Get up, check Reddit, turn the heat up (during the winter), feed the cats, take out the dog. 
1	The fallback alarm, same!!

6	I do not make resolutions. Time is an arbitrary measurement of "new beginnings" and I am at the point in my life where I follow my daily routines and accomplish all of my goals. I will establish new goals throughout the year when I decide it is necessary.
6	Hit my goal weight, classify at least C class in limited division USPSA, 1 year booze free, and win 3 matches in my division for IDPA revolver.
2	Get more outgoing, social and get all my academic credits
2	Lose weight, get more physical, don't over think/stress about things, and focus on my career more 
2	I'm almost 30, working in the marketing field, but I would love to continue teaching myself math and science to be able to get into the nitty gritty of cosmology.
2	Pass the last test of the CPA exam, start getting to work on time, and find a better paying job after passing said exam.
2	I've tried to gradually come out of my comfort zone and be more social. Screw that! Towards the end of the year I found it wasn't working well for me.\n\nTry being truer to myself and if others can't handle the real me (once I discover who that is!), then too bad.
2	I know it's about as cliche as you get, but definitely to get in shape. I'm not overweight, but I could definitely afford to eat less junk food and drink less pop, and of course, exercise more.
2	To quit Fapping and get a scholarship in my university of choice. 
2	I don't make resolutions, but I have a long term goal to search for like minded people, and people who share my interests closer to home. I've been an online ghost for far too long and got almost completely out of touch with my country.\nI actually started at the end of the last year. Not much success yet.
1	Get back into stretching and meditating. I have gotten awfully tense over the last few months, and I fell like I've been putting of doing anything about it until now.
3	ISTJ Career Advice	Hi all -\n\nI've been working in advertising for the past 11 years, and after 6 years in media planning at an agency and another 5 years in client services on the sales / publisher side of the business, I no longer am interested in the industry and could honestly care less if a campaign has a strong results or not. It's all just blah for me at this point.\n\nI'm VERY ISTJ and prefer to work alone once I have an understanding of the role / work that I'm doing. Below are a list of my skills and curious what others think would be a good transition in or outside of advertising:\n\n*Very organized and efficient (i'm overseeing 3x the amount of sales accounts I should be but finish my work so early they've given me more to fill my days)\n\n*High attention to detail\n\n*Enjoy project management (cracking the whip on people to ensure everyone is doing their part to meet deadlines)\nReally great in excel with budgets (i also have a big interest on where a company is receiving there money and how they're spending it - accounting future??)\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated!
1	freelancing or consulting? might require you to make a lot of small talk though 
1	You don't just walk into accounting. If you're trying to go back to school, IMO that's an entirely different discussion. \n\nI'm afraid I don't have any real advice for you. Maybe doing the sort of work you're skilled at, but for a company you care about? If you're open to going to school or sticking it out with your current line of work, learn web development. It's free online, and classes are cheap if you need to. Start by googling CS50, because finding information using Google is a programmer's most effective skill.\n\nThat and don't repeat yourself or reinvent the wheel
1	Have you thought about going into strictly Project Management?\n\nI know there are certification programs out there.  Some jobs require it.  From the limited experience I've had with engineering firms, seems like it would be a good field to get into if you enjoy that sort of work.\n\nGood luck.  I recommend finding people that do what you like and talk to them.  Maybe even see if they know anyone to network with.  Look on LinkedIn at your connections' connections and see if there is a company that looks interesting.  Get an introduction and see what happens.
1	I'm a QA Analyst and it seems to fit well enough for ISTJ.\n\nI'd second Project Management. Maybe even a Business System Analyst or a Scrum Master. Scrum Master would likely take more effort and a certificate of some sort. The others might be a natural fit if you're already in a managerial position and have to track projects.
22	ISTJs and time to adapt	I realised that I typically take longer to adapt to new environments (learn the rules, sense the vibe of a place and so on) than most people. But once I'm settled, its not difficult to perform. Are my fellow ISTJs like this too?
9	I would say I'm like that. While I'm feeling out the new place or job etc I'm very observant and don't talk much until I'm more comfortable/used to the environment. 
5	Yes I am exactly like this. I hate transitions and new things, but once I'm established I feel very comfortable. 
5	Absolutely agree! New city, new job, new apartment, new people, new relationships. Always takes me a while to adjust, but once I do I'm usually pretty happy with things
2	Yes, that is a trait that Si dom users share.
2	Yep. Felt like this in all my jobs, schools, and living places. I usually take time in the initial first weeks to get to know the area and try to get a feel for it. After maybe three to four weeks, I'll feel comfortable to be myself.
2	That is totally me. It takes time for me to feel comfortable in a new environment. The quicker I adapt to the new rules the fewer the problems and the easier it is to get comfortable. I'm a very attentive observer, I take in all the details and learn how things and people work. Once I get accustomed to an environment and understand how everything works, I make it my "home" and I'm not too shy anymore about bending the rules a bit. 
1	Yeah, that's me all the time. Especially at work. 
4	Weekly Thread: How will you be ringing in 2017?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: What are your new years eve plans? Going to a club? House party? Celebrating at home?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
5	I'm on call (fingers crossed) but then sitting on the couch with cats, a pile of  king crab legs, Gilmore girls and Bones on the tv, and likely passing out before the clock strikes 12. 
5	I'm pregnant AF, so basically just sitting on my couch and falling asleep at 8 pm to the sounds of my husband playing Battlefield. \n\nMaybe I'll watch some shitty ball dropping entertainment. Probably not.
3	In the morning  im doing a local tradition of shooting explosive balls really hard away and drinking beer with friends. Then I spend time with family and Im going clubbing at night. So not my typical ISJT day.
2	My husband goes to his deer lease every nye so we're never together.  I don't like going out so I usually stay home out of everyone's way.  This year though, during the day, I'm going with my aunt to a casino to hang out until early evening.
2	I'm gonna have pizza and see Rogue One, and I haven't decided about the last hour yet. I want to see the fireworks display in my town, but getting home from that on public transport is always hell, so I might head home straight after the movie and see if I can scrounge up a nice upbeat album to ring it in with over a fancy beer.
2	Probably visiting friends, as my family went out of town, and either/both playing that Joking Hazard game, and my personal favorite of watching a cheesy 80s action flick.
1	I had to work on New Year's Eve.
15	Fellow ISTJ people with girlfriends/wives, how have you met your partner?	Just wondering, im 17 and I don't feel like clubbing, and dating isn't really something that people around my age do in my country (Netherlands) .
9	I'm an ISTJ and I met my ISFP husband when we used to work together.
5	Internet dating for sure. I am an istj girl and I know that women get more messages than guys but don't lose heart. Keep trying and send messages that show that you actually read the first page of the profile. 
3	[deleted]
3	ISTJ guy here. Knew about my girl's existence in elementary school, asked for her number during a gathering while we were both in different high schools, became best friends and the rest was history. 2 days more to 4 years being together :)
3	First girl was from a University ski trip.  At the rest stop on the way there, I saw that she had come alone too, so I sat with her.  I later saw her again at the hotel and we went back to the slopes together.  She ended up getting locked out of her room, so she stayed with me that night.  I think it was supposed to turn into a FWB scenario, but I was naive and inexperienced.\n\nThe second girl was from my University dorm.  I would see her in the hallways and the study room, so I would drop by to chat and work.  I ended up asking her out to coffee, and we hit it off.  Behind the scenes, I found out that she was jumping up and down with joy after I asked out, so I guess I made a good impression beforehand!\n\nI met the third and current girl after University, so my options had been severely limited.  She found me on Plenty of Fish and we started dating from there.  My advice for men on POF is to just ignore and forget about the girls that ignore you.  In this world, there is still the misogynist concept that men must pursue women.  So the women end up getting bombarded with messages of varying quality and sincerity.  It's very difficult for them to sort through everything, and then of course, there's the paradox of choice that ruins the rest.  If you keep messaging them, then you'll come off as desperate, which will only serve to upset yourself further.
2	Well I messaged my ISTJ boyfriend first on an online dating site. We then arranged a phone call and immediately hit it off.
2	Forced dancing lessons.
2	All the serious girlfriends I had, I met through theater. I allowed myself into situations where I would meet other people, and didn't really expect to get a girlfriend out of it. If you try too hard, it shows. 
1	Library; work 
1	I met my wife at a local Christian retreat for High School aged students. We were friends for the longest time, and actually did not start dating until we graduated High School. 
1	No longer together, but a book club.
1	Met wife through friends. Got to know through lots of online chat and email exchange before in person dating.
1	Went to middle school together 
1	Met at a convention for a MMO we both played.  We were both on the same server, but had never interacted with each other, did not even know of her character in game.  She was much more casual with the game and I was involved with the more hardcore end game groups.
8	Advice needed: ENFP with ISTJ boss	I'm an ENFP and my boss is an ISTJ.  Unfortunately, I'm not meeting his performance expectations and feel that nothing I do is never good enough for him, since he's critical of everything. The biggest problem we have is communication!  I can't get my message across to him without him taking it the wrong way and assuming the worst!  I've been trying to communicate my accomplishments with lots of detail, including names, numbers, etc...but then he says I need to think more on next steps and think more critically (not an ENFP strength!)  I love what I do (consumer product development), but am worried about losing my job, especially since my company announced layoffs.  How do I "fix" things with him?  How should I communicate with him?  Most importantly, how can I convince him to see my differences as strengths (I do with ISTJ differences), instead of weaknesses?
6	This might be hard to achieve, but the number 1 priority for an ISTJ in the workplace is the task and performance, and if you can't meet his requirements you should confront him with it. You should be clear, direct and factual about it. 
2	Could you give an example of what you actually say to him when you do this:\n\n>The biggest problem we have is communication! I can't get my message across to him without him taking it the wrong way and assuming the worst! I've been trying to communicate my accomplishments with lots of detail, including names, numbers, etc.
2	When he criticizes me about something and I try to explain why I did what I did or question what exactly I did wrong, he accuses me of making excuses or not listening to him. Sometimes there is more to a situation than what he knows, or I could use coaching on what to do better next time. He says: "You're a bad planner" instead of listening and pointing out what I could do differently next time!
68	I love all of you	Never looked up this subreddit but glad I did. I've spent the last hour reading through dozens of posts and I just had to say... I fucking love all of you. \n\nI understand the small friends pool, lonely nights, restlessness, over-analyzing, reserved actions, and social anxiety. The demand we put on ourselves to be better and do better. The irrational expectation that we have to do everything ourselves because it's not good enough otherwise. The need to make sure our friends and family has everything they need even at our own sacrifice. The general unhappiness of nothing ever meeting our expectations... believe me, I GET it. \n\nAnd I especially get the self-loathing. \n\nSo I wanted to say, on Christmas Eve of all days, that you're all fucking awesome and I love you. 
13	Merry Christmas, internet stranger! Don't drink too much!\n\nEdit: or drink far too much, who am I, the police?
12	If I had any doubts about my ISTJ designation,  your summary put them to rest. 
10	Thank you, you beautiful bastard! Having a crap day just lying in bed and browsing reddit, and you managed to make me feel better and more normal. The anxiety, the stress and the self-loathing can go to hell for today. I love you man 😘
4	I love you too.
5	<3 :)
4	Seem great! Where are all you all hiding!?
5	Hey, alright.
2	d'aww ಥ_ಥ    \n    \n*Sidenote:* [*title made me think of this*](https://youtu.be/0kT5w27YxyI?t=55s)
2	I love all of you as well. 
5	Do you often wish you were an ENFP?	Pretty simple question. So I know that deep down inside I'm hard wired as an ISTJ. But I'm often finding that I want to be more extroverted. However, when I try to get out more it's obvious how extremely introverted I am.\n\nSame thing for the rest of the categories. I'll read about descriptors of ENFP and other mixes and I really want their qualities to come naturally to me. But again, in the end I'm going to, for example, side with my facts and reasoning over empathy most of the time.\n\nWith a lot of effort on my part I can kinda pass as someone more outward and personable but it's so much work.\n\nDo you guys ever feel the same?\n\nAnd do you think an ENFP ever has the same thoughts? I can't really imagine someone wishing they were more introverted...
5	Maybe for a day. Anything past that would leave me exhausted.
4	It's a bit of a burden being introverted especially in American society. I am married to an ENFP and am sometimes jealous that she can be so easily outgoing with virtually anyone. But I take solace in the fact that I know how I work really well which not everyone in the world can claim. That being said, I hope my daughter is an extrovert solely because she'll fit into society easier.
3	No, I hate ENFPs. 
2	I was really surprised by this, since I would have never considered that an ISTJ would even want to be more like an ENFP!  I'm an ENFP, and sometimes wish I was more like my ISTJ co-workers and boss at work (more SJ would make me more detail-oriented and organized).  Outside of work, I am happy to be an ENFP, since I have lots of hobbies and passions!  I'm thinking of a career change, but would have to take a financial hit to do something more ENFP-friendly (any suggestions?).  \n\nRegarding wishing to be more introverted: as an "EF", I am an emotional "open-book", which makes me vulnerable, especially at work!  I sometimes wish I was more introverted, so I could hide my emotions better (be more poker-faced for instance), as well as be less lonely when I'm by myself.    
1	I've never really cared to be more introverted, but I've wanted to be more reliable like the ISTJ. It would certainly make life easier for me.\n\nI think as we grow we become more complete. Your feelings and intuition will grow just like my thinking and sensation have grown over time. On top of that you can learn to channel it when you need it.
2	Need help cheering up an ESFP or anyone for that matter	Not really sure how to ask this so I guess I'll start with a story. My girlfriend of almost 3 years (the esfp) has been depressed over the first few days of Christmas break. Primarily it's probably my fault. I suggested that she ween herself off of anti depressants and she didn't like that. And I wasn't able to see her on her birthday yesterday because I am with my family some of which I only see at Christmas. She also lives in another city. And now she has been mad at me/depressed for the pass 3 days. I have tried to get her to talk about it because I know that tends to help but she wont. And we primarily text and she isn't texting me much and it's kind of bringing me down too. So I don't know what to do. I don't think she realized that I only mentioned that about her medicine because I care about her. \n\nI think I covered enough back story. Now im trying to get her out of her slump which feels impossible. Am I doing it all wrong? \n\nI have never been good at emotional support so how do you guys handle it with others?
3	I don't know a thing about mental health, but telling someone how you think they should medicate sounds like a bad idea.\n\nI don't know your situation, maybe you're very involved with the specifics of her health and treatment. I just have a feeling that you don't, and she's upset that you don't understand.\n\nI would start by saying something like, I'm sorry if I hurt you by telling you how you should medicate.\n\nTell her that while you may not fully understand what she's going through that you're there to support her. Don't try to fix her, be there for her support.\n\nI've made a lot of assumptions about your situation but maybe I'm onto something?
1	Tell her your sorry you've hurt her and that it's the last thing you'd want to do. Tell her why you mentioned (weening off anti depressants) it too her. Tell her you love her very much and you're sorry for brining her down. Send her flowers? And tell her you can't wait to hold her. We respond to touch more than anything. But it sounds like you're not in a place where you can be in physical contact with her? Try calling instead of texting? \n\nIdk how she is or if all ESFPs are like this but I need physically contact. You can say sorry over a text and I might accept it. But it takes time for me to come around. But you need to explain your feelings or thought process to why you did or said what you said. But really emphasize why you said or did it (out of love or caring)
74	Cross-posted from /r/INFP, thought ISTJs might get it.	
10	Might as well just put it on /r/introvert. It'll probably apply to all of us.
2	Pretty sure everyone can relate to this to some degree
1	Snort
1	I couldn't agree with this more.
1	How many ISTJs here are 5w4?	
1	I am. I just started digging into the enneagram, so I don't really know enough yet, but I feel this really explains why so many ISTJ descriptions that are focused on rule following and traditions are super inaccurate for me. 
10	What Do You Do For A Living?	
7	Freelance cat behaviour consultant
6	Accountant
3	Student. Majoring in Computer Science.
3	Full time university student, pre-med. Used to do book keeping for a year and a half
2	Full time nanny and 2 year old teacher in a daycare. The kids are great, I have NO patience for the adults, parents or coworker
2	I work in technical support. I like it because I get to help people.
2	Full time Veterinary student, I've worked in and around Animal hospitals and farms my whole life.

1	Safecracker, currently. 
1	Software.
5	How many of ISTJs here are 5w6?	
3	1
3	My ISTJ bf is a 6w5 probably.
3	Where does one obtain such characters?
3	Just took the test. 6w5
2	5w6? mhm. so the test said anyway. Reading the table on wikipedia, 6w5 might be closer, not sure. But the more I look at everything, the more bs it seems.
1	*rises hand*
1	*nods*
1	Aye
1	I'm that but flipped around; I'm a 6w5.
1	I'm 6w5
1	I am, apparently.
2	Honestly how would you describe your normal posture? Standing and Sitting.	As well as neck posture, head pushed forward or vertical, in line with spine?
10	A bit like this...\n\n[Standing](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KWn2Coarf5o/U72RuTAH3oI/AAAAAAAAI18/Hu7-ODoPsbI/s1600/dueds.png)\n\n[Sitting](http://assets0.ordienetworks.com/images/user_photos/1149320/i_-2_fullsize.jpeg?f85d7543)
2	I'd describe my posture as poor... But I've been complimented on it before. Shrug emoticon. (I've just realised that the same is true for pretty much everything I've been complimented on, so maybe it should be taken with a grain of salt...).\n\nI have to consciously keep my back and neck straight, they're slouchy otherwise. Same with my shoulders which are forward and hunched unless I consciously unhunch them. Hopefully one day the self-correction will be automatic.
2	Closed and upright. I don't push my head forward unless I have a reason.
2	I'' in the Navy, so I was programed to have good posture... Unless I'm on my phone.
1	Normally, I slouch with the best of them when sitting but my head/neck are straight. When standing I'm pretty solid.\n\nThat being said, I'm currently 36 weeks pregnant. My posture is totally fucked no matter what I do.
1	I do slouch slightly when I walk but try to stand up straight. If I try to walk straight, it looks like I'm trying to puff out my chest.\n\nWhen sitting, I tend to lean forward, rest on my arm but try to keep my neck upright. I am always worried that I get the forward-neck thing. 
1	Standing-Parade Rest\nSitting-Legs crossed tucked under self or a leg atop other leg's knee
4	Please, share your opinion of INFPs. My ego depends on it, whether it's crushed or not	For a study being conducted by yours truly.
6	They have a lot of depth of personality that is not seen initially, but requires patience. Take time to know one and you'll hopefully see a different outlook to life that might inspire and intrigue you.
5	Recently found out that the INFP relies on the same set of cognitive functions as us ISTJs. Just in a different order. \n\nAlso, personally, I married an INFP so there's that. Definitely a different way of looking at things. 
5	i love you guys.  most of the girls I find myself becoming attracted to are INFPs.  just a way broader and deeper emotional range/spectrum than I can ever imagine to experience myself.  The ones that are with it have beautiful thoughts.  challenging to interact with since INFPs find my stoicness to imply a lack of depth, but it's there I promise.
4	Noticed that a lot of them are insecure.
1	I only know one personally, and interactions often feel like I'm trying to handle a fragile object. Can be overly emotional. At least we have quite a lot in common, so it's not that hard to coexist.
1	I have one as a friend and as stated before it's like handling a fragile object. And personally she drives me up a wall. She can also be very self negative.
2	What do you all think about INTP's?	ISTP here doing a study for the INTP community. \n\nEdit: I figured out that im actually an ISTP. 
3	Although they can sometimes annoy me in more serious discussions, in general they're pretty cool from my experience.
2	I dated one for almost five years. What do you want to know? I liked that he was intelligent- but I tend to go for nerdy boys anyway. He didn't shy away from my callous emotionless personality, unlike my Fe/Fi using friends. He had a lot of mental health issues that he wasn't exactly getting adequate support for and it was exhausting for me, so I ended the relationship. It's hard to tease apart which aspects of him were due to being an INTP or having untreated Bipolar II disorder. He was a cool dude though and we got along well.  
0	How long have you been an ISTJ?	I've personally been an ISTJ for about a month and before that I was an INTP. It was a 6 month gap between both tests and I was honestly surprised how much my percentages flipped and I believe it's more accurate as I now fit the ISTJ personality type much better than I did the INTP one despite the percentages I had for the INTP one suggesting otherwise.
7	I imagine you've been ISTJ most of your life not just for 6 months if you felt the initial results didn't describe you well. The test doesn't make you one thing or another and there's some overlap.
2	I imagine that I have been an ISTJ most of my life. I got into MBTI about 2 years ago and I'm confident of my type.
2	When I took the test it was in a college career test. We were told to answer as if we were our child/teenage selves to prevent any mood changes affecting the answers. \n\nI took the test about 6 years ago, so I have been a confirmed ISTJ for 6 years, but I have an ISTJ without a doubt my entire life. 
2	I've probably been one my whole life. 
2	I can imagine i've been one my entire life. 
1	I first took the test 10 years ago, and there has been no change since. Even considering growth and personal development.
22	ISTJ's and depression?	do any other ISTJ's here deal with depression? I feel like it would allow great conversation for different medications and their effects on you.
8	I've dealt with depression (and anxiety) for as long as I can remember.  \n\nHave been on Zoloft and Prozac.   I didn't like how they affected me, so I got off them.  I felt like I wasn't, well, me.  Zoloft made me very tired.  Prozac, especially, made me more social and at ease, but it also made me feel unnatural and very different.  I felt less aware and perceptive.  I just don't really like the idea of being on medication anyways.  
7	I have dealt with depression for at least 3 years now that I've recognized. It has better and worse times as I'm sure most experience. Thankfully it hasn't gotten out of my control. I've seen how people change after getting on anti-depressants and I really want to avoid them. Although, I am curious to see the experience of others with them. \n\nAround 2 years ago I decided to at least get in decent shape. Even though i hadn't gained much, if any, weight since being out of high school for years, it really helped my self image. I had never been like morbidly obese, but I was close to being clinically obese since I can remember. I feel like starting to lift around a year and a half ago also definitely helped, but I'm sure that neither of these come as surprises. I would highly advise it to anyone in general to be healthier, but it has really helped my depression and gives me another thing to look forward to. 
5	Depression has been a both a condition that comes and goes, as well as a choice, to a certain extent, for me. The less I give into my vices (alcohol and caffeine) and the more I focus on feeling happy and looking at the positives in my life, the better I feel. I've never been medicated or diagnosed for depression or anxiety, but both run in the family and I know I face them.\n\nMedication has never had an appeal to me, I fight because I know what I have faced and who I can be without it. I know there are people who have faced situations and been effected less by the same conditions and made it through without the adverse and possibly positive effects of meds.\n\nNever been suicidal, but contemplated death and all of its implications. I can't rationalize it by my own rule set, no matter how bad things seem, and trust me, I have faced the gauntlet of bullying and shitty life situations. And trust me, I have the access to many of the easy ways out.\n\nAll I can really say is, depression is what you make of it. I have it and know I may never get rid of it, but I know I can only control how I react to it or anything else in my life. So I choose life, I choose to make any happy memory I can, and choose to not let it take a toll on the other people around me. Hope it helps OP, I know everyone is at different stages in their own life and journey with their own challenges.
3	Let me love you all! 
3	Diagnosed with depression about 9 months ago, but I'd been dealing with it for anywhere between 3 and 5 years before it suddenly spiked last fall. I've since been on Prozac, which didn't seem to do anything for the two months I was on it (granted it was a really low dose), and Zoloft, which occasionally causes dizziness for me, and is doing a good job of treating the anxiety I hadn't quite realized I had, but not the depression. I'm looking to start counselling soon, and maybe switch back to Prozac in a higher dose if I really need to.
3	My husband has dealt with it off and on for years (/u/mudien)\n\nHe's a habitual lurker/no commenter but has definitely gotten the best of his depression in the last couple years and might have some helpful words. Or at least might enjoy the conversation with fellow sufferers. 
3	Depression is something that I've struggled with for my entire life. I feel like a completely different person when I'm in a depression, and they usually have taken up at least a quarter to a half of any given year. Apathy, anhedonia, and general dysfunction accompany it. I become unreliable, and I use avoidance to cope with my stressors.\n\nI hate who I become when I'm in a depression. When I'm high-functioning, I try to limit and prevent the stress overloads that tend to start the cycle. It's not always preventable or foreseeable, and life has a way of throwing things at you that you don't have contingencies for.\n\nEvery year better. More information, more tools to cope in a healthy way.
3	I have a very objective view on my life, so whenever I am feeling down I just judge what I have in my life worth being happy about vs. what I am feeling down about. I usually just go back to the fact that I am able to feed myself 3 times a day and have a climate-controlled home to sleep in every night. Whatever I'm feeling sad about can't really outweigh the fundamental things I have, things that I so often take for granted that so many people around the world don't have.\n\nMy brain chemicals aren't out of my control or anything, but I am always able to give myself optimism. I didn't always think I could do it, as there was a time when I would drone over everything wrong with me and my life and make no effort to pick myself up. I bet I would have been diagnosed with depression if I had continued that way of life, but I an very fortunate to have had people in my life who gave me insight and optimism on life.
2	Had depression most of my life.  (As did my mother and grandmother.)  \n\nFinally tried medication when I found myself at the gun store.  Makes a huge difference most of the time.  I know it's time for a med change when I get rages and just want to slam my fists through the window.\n\nDone talk therapy 4 times.  Helps for a while but then you just get tired of thinking about painful memories every minute of every day.\n
2	I do. I take Zoloft, 100mg for it. I also have hypothyroidism which was untreated up until August. The hypothyroidism gave me bi polar like mood swings, so they ended up putting me on both at the same time. Generally speaking I am depressed most days, even with medications. It does however even me out which I am very thankful for. 
1	thank you for all of your posts! this was very helpful and cool to see so many people opening up about this.\n\ni've been battling with depression for probably 2 years? but i've started medication about 9 months ago. recently i've switched to a new medication after zoloft didn't work out, and i'm feeling a lot better on wellbutrin.\n\nagain, thank you all c:
2	Weekly Thread: What's the best and worst things that happened to you in 2016?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what's the best and worst things that happened to you this year?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
6	Best: Finally got my degree.\n\nWorst: Got laid off.
3	Can't think of anything best no matter how hard I try. There could have been, but nothing really worked out.\n\nThe worst thing that happened? - 2016 isn't over just yet.
3	Best: Moved to Washington for a new position that is helping me boost my career. \n\nWorst: Ended a relationship that wasn't healthy, but lost myself. Having issues trying to be the person I once was. 
2	Best: I did some volunteering that helped me feel connected to people. \n\nWorst: Trump 
2	Best: Travelling to Arizona with my wife. To spent a week with people I never physically met. Yeah, that's what I said...haha. My wife met a girl online through ASOIAF fan fictions forums, and started talking to her regularly, and they instantly became friends and start emailing- which led to texting and talking on Skype once in a while. We went to visit her, her husband and daughter in Arizona and we stayed at their house. At first, I thought it was really weird, but it was honestly one of the most fun things I ever did. Not only did we do things around Tucson, we visited Sonoita (a cool little town around Tucson), Sedona, as well as Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon. \n\nWorst: Not really sure honestly. Probably would have to be watching my Grandma have to live with the fact that her son died of Cancer last year. It's really brought her down, and even though no one wants to admit it, had an effect on her health overall. 
7	Am I an INTJ or ISTJ?	Since high school, I've been taking the MBTI tests once in a while with a friend and the multiple test results would show up either ISTJ or INTJ. Help type me?\n\n-I often use past experiences to figure out what I should do\n\n-I prefer to use lists rather than improvisation, though the lists act as reference\n\n-I'm not a creative person. More often than not, I need outside inspiration\n\n-Many rules in my life are for reference. I only follow them when they are convenient for me.\n\n-I tend to draw connections with many entities\n\n-I tend to daydream. I'm often in my own world\n\n-I'm forgetful, though I remember some of the most crucial things about myself and other people\n\n-Playing devil's advocate is common for me. To me, most things are often in gray areas\n\n-It's easy for me to read subtle social cues and body language. It's easy for me to know how someone is feeling when I talk to them, though that ability stops at romantic stuff\n\n-I tend to look at things as a whole. I hate nitpicking things\n\n-Experience: After I ordered something at a McD's drive-thru, everybody in my car (coincidentally, they're sensors) noticed a woman crying while talking to her bf at the parking lot and I was only focusing on thought of the filet-o-fish burgers that I ordered for everyone.
8	I get similar results with different online testing sites.\nEither istj or intj (always a low percentile in n or s).\n\nI follow both subs, and relate a lot to both sides.\n\nI just leave it at that. In the end, you are defined as your own person. The tricks and tips from those similar to you help, but may not always apply, based on your morals/perception/etc.
1	Sounds like INTJ
1	past experiences is a big Si give.\n\ndo you feel like you can't do anything out of the box but because you have seen so many youtube tutorials you dont need to think out of the box?\n\nit's really down to Si vs Ni, and from what you say I would say Si.\n\n>-I tend to draw connections with many entities\n\nthis can be either one, I use my Si data bank to compare things in my past to new things.\n\n>-I tend to daydream. I'm often in my own world\n\nthis can also be either, but again I also use my Si to daydream and i can get very nostalgic and yearning for older times.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nyou say multiple times that you believe in gray areas, rules are for reference, etc.\n\nthat is not really an ISTJ trait. i'm torn dude
1	You can see inferior Ne and inferior Se to see which one you are.
1	I was in the same boat. Still kind of am. Then I took this.\n\nhttp://psychcentral.com/quizzes/personality/start.php\n\n63 questions. Halfway through most of them switch. For me, if I answered neutral to one question, I often answered in agreement/disagreement to the flipped question. I ended up being ISTJ, 59/41. It's what I've received on most tests I've taken but I feel fairly borderline between S and N. Since taking the test though, I'm more confident I'm S.\n\nAlso, the mbti *official* test is kind of a joke. But they had some good examples of what each letter represented and how people typically are with each. I wouldn't recommend paying $50 for it though.
13	As an ISTJ, how do you handle the need to feel needed without being needy	My current "relationship", if you will, started out very casual but things are starting to get less casual and more frequent (read: spending more time together, starting to catch some feelings) \n\nEarly this week we had plans, but he had to push back the time to go to a dinner for work and then never called or showed. Next day he showed up and apologized. Tonight, we had plans and he said he would be ready around 830ish. By 10 I hadn't heard anything and no response to my text or my one call. \n\nI don't get upset when people cancel on me, even if it's last minute. But I freak out when I feel ignored/forgotten about. Tonight I felt like he forgot about me and I broke out in tears. Turns out he was just running late and he called around 1030, but I had been crying so much that I had to cancel our plans. \n\nIdk if it's an ISTJ thing, or something I need to see a therapist about. But as soon as I feel like the other person doesn't need me, i feel horrible about myself and i second guess everything. 
11	I would've been pissed of, there is no excuse for running 2h late and not letting you know, unless there was something wrong with your phone. To me that just shows not caring enough to write a little text!\n\nHowever, you shouldn't be taking it so personally, if he's not contacting you when something comes up, that just shows how he is as a person. Idk If it's an ISTJ thing but I see a person who forgets or runs ridiculously late for plans without notice as someone who doesn't priorities me. I wouldn't say your emotional reaction is out of place, especially if you really like the guy. He is clearly neglecting you!\n\nPerhaps you should talk to him about it not being ok to not let you know if he needs to bail/is running late! And if he keeps doing it then see it as a sign of him not caring enough\n\nEdit: I realised I didn't really answer your main question, now I'm not an expert in personality types, but I (as an ISTJ) get pretty annoyed if people I care for neglect me in the form of not EVEN notifying me if they can't make it. If a friend turn out to be that way I do not hesitate to not bother making plans with them. But I wouldn't say its a being 'needed' thing as much as I value consistency, honesty and respect. If a person is not reliable and honest (e.g. When not being able to show up) I don't se why I should have them as a friend! 
5	This is pretty much exactly what I'm going through right now as well. When I get attached to someone I tend to over analyze every little thing that person does because I'm aware of how emotionally attached I am and how much I don't want to get hurt. I start picking up on little things they do differently, even though 99% of the time it's definitely just me being weird, but it still freaks me out and I always assume the worst is happening. I haven't yet quite figured out how to deal with that anxiety, but I know that talking myself down and through the situation logically tends to help. If I present myself the facts and compare to previous scenarios (eg. "Ok he's only texted you once today, but he also did that last week and it's because of <legit excuse>") that tends to ground me and I can relax a little.
3	Two hours is a long freaking time... I think you're feelings are justified. If I know I'm gonna be late. Even if I'm at work, I'll tell my boss or whatever. I need to contact so and so real quick and tell them I'll be late. It's about consideration. Everyone's time is valuable. And a normal person would understand. \n\nUnless they've fallen asleep. I've gone for a nap and fallen asleep for longer than I thought But I usually call them as soon as I wake up and apologize like crazy. 
1	>Idk if it's an ISTJ thing, or something I need to see a therapist about.\n\nFWIW or not, I think you're completely justified in wanting better communication from him about plans and I don't think your only options here are that part either being an ISTJ thing or needing to see a therapist for it. I'm not ISTJ (am INFJ, read this sub because my sweetie is ISTJ) and his style around plans and communication really wouldn't work for me either. I would say that if something doesn't work for you, then it might be necessary to talk about it so the other person knows (in case he just has a different perspective than you and me and others here do about communication and plan timing).\n\nSo for what it is or isn't worth to hear from an INFJ on this one - I also think it's completely okay to want far better communication that you got when plans change. \n\nNow, what I don't understand is the connection in you between plans/communication on one hand (the example in the post), and "being needed" on the other (the ending sentence).  
8	What are unhealthy ISTJs like in relationships?	
15	Needy, but cannot be helped by their significant other. 
10	As others have mentioned, neediness, to the point that the ISTJ's partner is exhausted, drained and miserable. I would also add this: being too overbearing in their obsessive desire to win every argument. 
5	All of our positive traits could be turned bad and our negative traits worse. I guess I could go into more detail.
6	So many ISTJs are saying "needy". I don't think my ISTJ boyfriend is at his healthiest right now, but needy would be the last thing I'd say described him. He's the opposite -- sometimes doesn't seem to need intimacy, sex, deep relationships at all, and keeps things closed off. 
3	ESFP in a long term relationship with a female ISTJ: I literally have to tell her when she is being too needy or pushing too much (that happens to be at least twice every week). However, I love her: I find her loyalty and caring really sincere. But yeah, is overwhelming sometimes.
3	Controlling, overbearing, incredibly needy, argumentative. \nAll traits that I work very hard on trying to tone down as they will get you nowhere good in life, but it's hard because they are very prominent characteristics for our personality.
1	Have you considered the possibility that looking at this through the lens of him (possibly) being ISTJ maybe isn't the most useful lens for whatever you're trying to work through in this relationship/with this person? (Am thinking about this and the other posts you've submitted about this situation here).
8	INTP and ISTJ relationship	hello! intp female lurker here!\nso my boyfriend is an istj and we've been together for about 3-4 years and plan on getting married. \n\nfrom my perspective he keeps me structured and is fun to share ideas with and helps keeps me sane while i keep him happy and enteriain his ideas.\n\ni just wanted to know on what you think about the relationship dynamic from the istj side of things. \nsorry for bugging you on your territory but the intp sub reddit isin't very helpful ^^;;\n\nif you want to know anything about our relationship just ask
6	My husband is an INTP- but we also have cultural differences being from different countries. Anyway, if you're interested... he can be a little insensitive sometimes and often has the attitude "that's their problem not mine" and can be really quite cynical. This could be more a man/woman and cultural thing though as istj's are supposedly insensitive too. He will debate with you even if he agrees with you. It gets frustrating when he will never, ever stop countering my perfectly argued, logical point. I just want to resolve the damn discussion!! He doesn't get my need to have things just so - like the sponge needs to go back to a certain spot on the sink, coats need to go in the cupboard and not on the chair.. I am not the tidiest person ever but I have "rules" that drive him nuts but to me they are just simple things that make me happy. He's more relaxed and easy going than me which is really good for me who takes istj perfectionism tendencies to the point of anxiety. He is a scientist and can handle abstract concepts that hurt my brain so sometimes I feel stupid but then sometimes he has wacko ideas and I'm like no. Anyway for the most part we get along great - the main difference is planning and organisation vs flying by the seat of your pants :)
1	What faults of his have you had to adjust to? Which of them has he had to work on? How did you guys work through that, and inversely, what faults of yours have you guys worked through? 
1	What sort of things do you bond with?
14	How do you deal with a lot of stress?	I've been feeling stressed for a while and I can't seem to get leveled out. My mind wanders a lot and I can't seem to accomplish much at work. \n\nOne article said 'To regain their sense of normalcy the ISTJ needs to focus on structure and order. They need to trust their ability to solve the problems at hand, and return to a sense of schedule and reliability.' \n\nHow do you guys approach this? 
8	That's about it for me. If I shut down, nothing will get done for a while. Have to keep focused by force of will. I shut down this semester and everything seemed too hard to pick up again. Now that the semester is over I am focusing on getting back to my regular structure instead of watching Netflix all day and all night
7	Do a task that has a clear beginning and end. Don't think too much about it.\nExercise. Alone.\nRead a chapter in my current book, in a closed room. Alone.\nGo for a walk/hike. Alone.\nPlay a level in a (non-team based) video game. Alone\nClean a part of my house. Alone.\n😬
5	I start. It sounds simple. Start with something, finish that then do the next thing. I often feel overwhelmed at work when I see a pile of work and want to shut down but it has to get done so I start, one at a time, once I build momentum I feel driven to finish because I've officially started and I hate leaving things unfinished.
3	Music.
3	I usually shutdown and play online games for the rest of the day locked on my room.  At work if something is stressing me out I usually stop what I'm doing put everything in a pile and just start slowly going through the pile.  It gets done when it gets done if I have to stay late I stay late.
2	I study my life and reorganize/get rid of whatever is out of whack. I read young adult books to get a simpler structure to loop in my head. Also, my stress is often because of boredom, or too much interaction with people. If your job requires too much human interaction, you may need to get lunches alone, put on over the ear noise cancelling headphones, get an isolated cubicle, get a different job... 
2	sex weights and protein shakes\n\n(aka...the gym)
2	If I have a lot of different tasks I need to do, I list them all out, figure out which need to be done first and/or are the easiest/quickest and work my way down the list. \nI get a lot of chores done when I'm procrastinating the last thing on that list... \nWhen there's just the one big thing I need to do, I usually shut down and watch netflix/play games until the last possible moment and let the time limit motivate me to work. For some reason I just can't do the biggest things when there is no time pressure to get it done. Even though I know that being under pressure causes me stress, I also know that's how I get a lot done and will eventually relieve the stress. Won't say its the healthiest thing, but it works for me right now. 
1	I take my dog for a walk, or go for a drive. I just need to get away for a little bit and reset. 
1	I can relate to the structure part. Finals week is harder for me because I am not in a routine of working out, going to the gym etc. In your case it may be different, but I try to replicate normalcy as much as possible and trust my confidence that I can solve any problem. Otherwise, I will find every excuse to stop moving forward. 
1	For me I either make a list focusing on why I am stressed and actual steps that I can take in order to solve it. For example, I am stressed about final exams and studying all the things makes me want to die. I make a list of the finals I am studying for and break them down into modules. I need to study for Econ. That is still too big. What will be on the Econ test, I make a list. Now I can focus one aspect of Econ, namely game theory rather than stress about the whole thing. \n\nIf my stress is out of my control, for example I am stressed because I have no money until my student loan come in in January, then I clean and organize. While I actually hate cleaning, I also find it cathartic. Taking a walk or run is also good. \n\nI don't tend to get stress relief from talking to others much and I find procrastination more stressful 
1	Music, beer, and spending alone time.\n\nOr I do a complete 180 and do something I've never done before, like travel to a new city or country.
1	With [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYYr9q9F1-E) full volume. When there's chaos in my head, I need something as equal to calm down.
1	I always deal with it by listening to music- and playing guitar (obviously). Especially when I come home from work- I just plug my headphones in and go.
5	Weekly Thread: What is the next big ticket item you're looking to buy?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what's the next big ticket item you want to buy or are hoping to get as a present?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
4	The next expensive thing I'm looking to buy is a return trip to the States, but I hear that the tickets are normal-sized.
4	A new coffee grinder. I want the Baratza Sette, but it hasn't been out long enough to know if it will be as good or better than the Baratza Preciso for brewed coffee. Just waiting on that, and of course $$$$
3	I dont know what a ticket item is, but the next item I am hoping to buy is a new iphone with double the memory of my current one.
3	Probably a car. Don't own one yet, so I've been looking at getting something to move myself between points A and B.
3	I'm looking at new guitar amps. I've been saving up for a while and want to upgrade from my line6 that I've had since I started playing to a tube amp. I'm still looking around, but I'm leaning towards some type of Fender reverb at the moment.
3	After Christmas I'm looking at getting some kind of smart home system with an Amazon Echo Dot.  I wanna be Tony Stark.
2	I ordered a Fujifilm X-Pro2 yesterday.  It will be similar to my Leica M9, and I'm planning on getting the adapter to use my M lenses.
2	A car at some point. I don't plan on buying one within the next few years, but I just bought a new computer, and I will be upgrading my iphone on Friday. 
2	Looking to upgrade to a new car. Really want a pickup truck. Hopefully the taxes are good and I get a good amount beck
2	I'm buying winter tires for my car. I work in a tire shop so luckily I can get them quick and easy. $650
2	I'm looking to buying a Nintendo Switch when it comes out this March (but I will have to work during summer to afford it). If I had even more money, a new laptop.
2	A cellphone. At 20 years old, I think it's about time I got my first phone aha
1	Been a long time since I wanted some sort of present, I have nothing in mind at the moment.
4	What are the most ideal career matches for an 5w6 ISTJ?	
1	I think this really depends on your personal interests and abilities. Personality type is only a small factor. \n\nDo you like learning about people? History? Science or technology? Do you like fixing things? Categorizing things? Do you want to help people? Improve systems? Etc.\n\nI would suggest you figure out what you have an aptitude for, find out if you'd enjoy doing it for a living, and narrow your search down that way.
3	S's: Have You Ever Cheated?	I'm [ENTP] part of the Intuitive Integration [INTJ, INFJ, ENTP, ENFP] page on Facebook. Recently, someone posted, asking if anyone has ever cheated. I was wondering whether the answers would changed, based on someone's N or S function. She here are the questions that were asked:\nDid you ever cheat on your partner? If yes, how does it feel the moment you actually let someone start to undress you? Update: Guilt / no guilt? Can you actually really completely enjoy it?
8	Emotionally. And flirted, never did the deed. I wasn't happy in that relationship. 
7	Nope, cheaters never win and winners never cheat.
4	Nope, I consider cheating one of the worst acts a person can commit.
4	No, I could never cheat, it goes against my moral code. Other than being an ultimate trust destroyer and damaging ones integrity, in most cases where I've know others who have cheated on their partner, all it does is create chaos. ISTJs are known to hate chaos, and love integrity, trustworthiness, and honor. Cheating to me would seem to totally destroy those things in my mind. 
3	Nope. Never!
3	I am happy in my relationship. I would never cheat. 
1	Never.
1	Nope I have never cheated. In fact it took me a month to finally go out with someone after my divorce. We had sex and I felt horrible about myself. I didn't touch another man for a month. \n\nMy most recent ex and I broke up about 4 months ago. We continued to have sex (although he was also having sex with others) so I kind of considered that enough to not be with anyone else. He finally moved out over a month ago. I did have one person over a few weeks ago.. Again a horrible experience.  
1	No. I haven't even been able to move past my ex, and we broke up years ago
29	Does anyone else practice what they are about to say?	I'm not talking about like when about to give a speech or presentation, but for other everyday things that involve speaking to others. I usually find myself preparing what to say when it comes to ordering food, buying groceries, talking on the phone, etc. I'll be in the car driving where I need to be and play the conversation in my head and practice what I need to say.\n\nI'm not sure if other ISTJs do this too. I may just be crazy
15	I practice what I *should* have said.\n\nOnce I did that and the very next day, had nearly the same conversation with someone else.  Worked like a charm!
6	I definitely prepare what im going to say when it comes to ordering food. I'll even write it down to make sure its perfect. I cant stand when my order is messed up, my food must be perfect. 
3	It's not unusual for me to prepare what I'll say before calling someone on the phone.\nI don't worry about what I say to grocery store clerks or waiters, however. 
3	I do this with almost everyone! It takes me a while to feel comfortable with someone and if I don't feel comfortable, not much comes out of my mouth unrehearsed. For this reason, I am usually very quiet at parties and around new people. Not my favorite of my traits, but it's part of who I am
3	I've left people on hold for over a minute while preparing to only say "she's away from her desk."\n\nI'm pathetic. 
2	I do this a lot with family, friends, coworkers, and boyfriend. Not typically strangers 
2	Always. If it's someone I'm comfortable and familiar with, I do it in my head. In intense situations, I write it down first. 
2	Wow. I never realized that I do this fairly often. 
2	I do this a lot, or else I risk losing my train of thought or saying things that don't always relate or make sense.
2	I do that all the time honestly. I especially did that when I was in High School and had to do presentations.
2	I do this all the time you're not alone! Although restricted to when I'm talking to people that are not my close family/friends.\n\nMaybe this is due to social anxiety.
2	Yeah, I totally do this all the time. If I don't I feel unprepared and anxious. I like to have everything thought out ahead of time
2	Yes, a lot! I think this is an aspect of both my ISTJ traits and my social anxiety. \nI usually write down a script when I have to make phone calls to the dentist, doctor, ask any stranger a question really. I had to call the dentist the other day (and unfortunately still have to call back) and regretted not typing a script. \nFor ordering I repeat it a lot in my head what I need to day, and make sure I got the number/name correct, as well as have all my options chosen. I hate dragging out the interaction and having people wait on me to order. \nI even do this in texts and emails to people I'm not close to, I have to stare at it for so long before it seems acceptable to send and conveys what I need for it to. \nAnd as well as some other comments, I definitely think about what I should have said in situations after the fact. \nOtherwise, I don't talk very much if it is not someone I'm comfortable with or I know the subject matter well enough to not doubt what I am saying or how to say it. 
7	An ISTJ is going through a hard time, how can I help them?	ISTJ (23m) just lost his uncle. He will be spending Christmas eve, Christmas and New Years alone. He hasn't had the best year. How can I make him feel loved/appreciated/thought of- happy? I don't have a lot of money but I was thinking of sending a condolence card but then thought maybe a gift (we are physically apart) would be better. I've told him he's being thought of along with his family, I'm here if he needs anything and that I am sorry.\n\n\nBackground: We dated once, we have had a fling for two years, he matters a lot to me and even though it looks like this romantic fling has come to an end (it will be ages until we next see one another), I want him to still have an amazing holiday and to feel happy. We were suppose to see one another one New Years but he had to spend most his money on the flight to the funeral. Know time heals all wounds but what can be done to help him?\n\n\nHow and what can I do to send him? 
4	Well, there's no reason for you to listen to my advice, but sometimes a complicated issue is best solved with a simple solution. Just write him a card with a gift attached or something just to let him know he's cared about. 
2	Being an ISTJ, I can say a card, with a heartfelt note stating that you're you're thinking of him in his time of sorrow, and that it's ok to mourn, but to gently remind him that it will get better, and that he still has many people who care deeply for him, be it friends, family, coworkers, etc.  Something from the heart would be something that would make me feel tremendously better.  I commend you for trying so hard to make him feel better, most people wouldn't go to such an extent, and the world would be a much better place if more people were like you.  
2	From what you say I think the passion is still paid.\n\nPointing out that from the description I imagine that you have some deep confidence ... In addition to a simple postcard you could call once or twice on the phone to know how he is and how he is spending the holidays.\nIn a very formal way, but felt, and correct. Without being too pushy unless he allows it. This to me would be pleased.
9	ISTJs and politics	Just curious if I'm one of the many or one of the few? I consider myself a Conservative Republican and was curious how other ISTJs feel about politics? Like which party do you see yourself agreeing with more often?
14	Not American, but took a fairly long test and apparently my views and philosophy aligned the most closely with Bernie Sanders. 
8	Slightly right fiscally, hard left socially.
7	I am American -- supported Bernie Sanders. I generally believe the two party system is broken, and have been reading up on neoliberalism (not "new liberalism" -- but instead, the philosophy that we should privatize public services and deregulate the market) as a reason for it.\n\nIt was when I was looking at the rate of income inequality that I noticed that things started a steep climb with Bill Clinton's presidency and have generally kept an upward trend through all the presidents since. Money is in politics, and the concentration of money means politics is no longer for most of us here.\n\nSo in short -- suspicious of information I haven't sought out on my own, and not very optimistic about where things are going. Though I am sure there will be at least a generation or two of prosperity for the children of whoever survives whatever is coming.
7	Libertarian
5	I used to avoid politics altogether, but these days I care more about things. I would say that I lean pretty heavily left (at least for an American), with some Libertarian tendencies. Took a test on isidewith.com earlier this year and got 89% Bernie Sanders
4	Socialist.
5	Conservative/Republican. You can expect most people on reddit to lean left, so your numbers will be skewed. But, I feel that most SJs that I know are fairly conservative.
2	I am mostly down the middle with a right-lean on certain economic issues. I don't think you'll find there to be a correlation, but it's interesting to see.
2	In US terms, I'd have supported Sanders and then strategically voted for Hillary while grumbling about the two-party system. If I was in Cali I might've supported La Riva (or might not have - I'd have learnt more about her policies, I don't know whether that would put me off), but your system is weird and I don't know whether I'd have even been able to vote for her at any point.\n\nI am quite left, both socially and fiscally. I'm towards the bottom-left in that political compass thing. In NZ's terms I vote Green (except where it makes sense to strategically vote Labour with my electorate vote). Gareth Morgan has some interesting ideas. On one hand he strikes me as being contrary just for the sake of being contrary, but on the other hand the present Opposition really needs someone who isn't going to pussyfoot around out of fear of losing votes for being "too negative".
2	Conservative/Republican
2	right, socially and fiscally. 
1	I do not follow politics and I am not interested in then so I am nothing
1	Not American, but anyway: I generally mostly agree with the social democrats, but on some matters I have a conservative view.
1	A mix of progressive and libertarian.  Very socially progressive which I prioritize, but break with dems on some key elements (such as affirmative actionn).  I'm a staunch defender of civil liberties and individualism.  Mostly moderate/pragmatist on economic matters.\n\nIm a huge Bernie Sanders supporter and I beleive both Clinton and Trump were truly nightmarish options so I absolutely despise both parties.  Much more resentful towards dems right now though due to how things have played out.
1	No party affiliation but right down the middle
1	Pretty strongly liberal on social issues, but more center on fiscal issues.  I'd like to see a balanced budget and a plan to steadily eliminate the national debt.  Generally non-interventionist on foreign policy.  Not a gun guy personally, but I support gun rights.  The biggest political issue for me is changing to ranked choice voting.
1	I'm no longer naive enough to have libertarian ideals. Ignorance and evil are rampant, just as a part of human nature. Generally, I feel that the left side of politics tries to address these problems instead of putting their focus in the wrong places, such as protecting the rights of people to "freely" do evil.\n\nAll this considered, I find most politicians untrustworthy.
1	Libertarian. Though my thoughts on what policies should be implemented vary greatly depending on what the situation of our country is. This, ofcourse, meaning that i applaud high government intervention in times of depression or crisis, but prefer the government stay out of our lives when times arent dire and the country can manage without all of the government surveillance
1	I'd say i'm more heavily left but I do have some Libertarian tendencies. I voted for Bernie originally and then for Hilary. 
1	Not American but European. I'm a complete leftist with authoritarian tendencies.
1	The ISTJ I know is extremely liberal.
1	Progressive
1	I tend to lean left politically and economically, and right socially (due to religious reasons).
1	Libertarian
2	ISTJ & ENFP relationships	Is it common for complete opposite personality types to get together in relationships? I don't have a problem with it, my girlfriend is an ENFP. Like do those of y'all with this type of significant other constant clash heads over little things liked rules and how things are supposed to go(I.e. procedures), and then instantly kiss and make up like nothing ever happened? Haha I'm just curious to see if this matching is common.
4	I'm close to that. My girlfriend is ESFP. I think we get along really well. We compliment each other. I'm slightly straight faced and some would say plain or boring and she is energetic and more spontaneous. She brings the "fun" out in me with random walks and outings or activities. I need these things to live a balanced life I think just like she needs structure from me lol.
5	I had friend, that I considered to be a pretty good friend, and she was ENFP. We are complete opposites in many ways. Initially it was a good friendship that seemed relatively drama free, but as we got closer we started clashing a lot more and it just became a rollercoaster of emotions. It would be really good, and then really bad. Ultimately there was a blowout and things were never the same between us again, and now we don't talk. I think she's too free-spirited for me, especially with where I'm at with life where I am super focused and ambitious with my career. I find it hard to agree with her and her life choices and her lack of direction. And she views me as intimidating because of how intense and focused I am. And I think I've only recently come to realize that I should let go of this friendship for now.\n\nI think it might be common for ISTJs and ENFPs to be attracted to each other initially, because we see what we lack in ourselves in each other and there's admiration for that.
3	Istj and Enfp are a dual relationship, they are not opposite at all. Enfj are actually opposite.
2	I've been in a loving relationship with my ENFP fiance for nearly 7 years. We were friends first so I got to know him and his traits before we took things further. \n\nHe's more outgoing and talks more to people than I do, but he's not one for bringing people into 'our' space when he knows I'm not comfortable with it. \n\nI sometimes admonish him for talking too much and quip 'can I get a word in?' with a raised eyebrow, but that's about as far as it goes when we disagree.
1	My fiancé is ENFP. We drive each other insane. 
1	Close. Boyfriend is an ISTJ. I'm an INFP. It's surprising how well we get along once two types get close.
2	Do you think eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was worth it?	
2	Loaded question.
1	No. We were free of pain and trouble and misery, and led happy lives; by doing so we only condemned ourselves.
6	Weekly Thread: What would you like to be remembered for?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what would you like to be remembered for? What impact are you hoping to make on your friends, family, or your community?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
4	I wish to not be remembered for actions but rather as a just and useful member of the family.\n\nThat said, people's qualities are often shown greatest through action.
3	Well first and foremost I'd agree with what /u/Blackdeath3101 said. Then, I'd want to be remembered as someone that can bring enjoyment to others. 
3	Nothing. Absolutely nothing. \n\nTo be remembered for the good things you do can easily translate to being remembered for the bad things as well. \n\nThe goal is to at least a semi decent member of society in my life 
2	Someone worthy of respect.
10	ISTJs, are you religious?	And if so, what are your beliefs? \n\n(I'll start. No religious followings here; I'm an atheist, who also loves supernatural horror)
11	Atheist as well. 
6	No.
5	Technically I'm Christian, but in reality my belief is not very strong (read: almost nonexistent) and I haven't been to church in years.
6	I'm Christian. Nondenominational, sort of a reformed charismatic type. I grew up in the church and am still actively involved in it.\n\nLike OP, I also enjoy some dark supernatural horror.
5	I'd consider myself an agnostic atheist. 
3	I grew up in a catholic Christian environment. I still have faith in what I could call a Christian God, but I despise the Catholic Church and the establishment. I hate that it's so rooted into the minds of the citizens of my country. 
4	No. To me, it all sounds made up. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/8r-e2NDSTuE    If you want a good laugh.
4	Nope.
3	LDS/Mormon
3	I am Catholic! I don't go to church all the time but I probably go more than most people lol.
3	Atheist, reporting in.
3	No, not really.
3	On paper, I'm a Christian (Catholic), but in practice, an atheist.
3	No.
3	Christian, still member of the reformed church where I was raised - and I've been there this morning - but looking for a church in the place where I currently live. I am religious in a place where few other people are: studying physics at university.\n\nThis post makes me wonder if there is any relation between religion and MBTI type. Would ISTJ's who grow up in church be more likely to stay there because they tend to be loyal?
3	I'm a United Methodist Clergyperson. There are very few ISTJ clergy.
2	Half of my family is religious, the other is not. I was given a choice and found out that religion does not work for me.\n\nThough I do keep a door slightly open for spirituality because of sentience and *self*. The whole concept of being alive and self aware is a very strange one. I think about it every now and then, and it always feels like trying to punch a hole through a wall with my head. Just impossible to understand.
2	Christian, nondenominational. 
2	I'm Catholic
2	Christian Non-denominational leaning towards Church of Christ (mainly a southern US church). Grew up CofC, but converted to Non-denominational over the issue of music. 
2	Another atheist here.  Golden Rule guides me.  Treat others as you wish to be treated and the rest will fall into place.
2	I was agnostic, but after a lot of research I now consider myself Jewish and will eventually convert. 
2	I dabbled in Buddhism for a little while, but "Meh" pretty much sums up my attitude towards religion.
2	I don't consider myself Religious by any means, but I do consider myself a Christian. Meaning that, yes, I believe in God, and try my best to live as an example of him, but I don't necessarily agree with all the views and beliefs that the Church believes.\n\nMy wife and I currently attend a non-denominational Church in our town, but in my opinion, you don't have to, or shouldn't just attend Church to be a Christian. I've met many people that aren't churchgoers, who carry out the example of Jesus better than those that don't miss a service every Sunday.\n\nI get the feeling like the Church tries to say that everyone who is an Atheist, gay, lesbian, or trans is wrong, and is going to hell, and that kind of thing just disturbs me.\n\nI also feel like a lot of your average churchgoers have this "i'm holier than thou" persona about them that makes them nice and friendly while they are at Church, but the second they step out into the world outside of those doors, they start putting everyone else in the world down because they automatically think they are going to Heaven and that they are better than everyone else. I think this why a lot of people resent Christians and aren't interested in going to Church.
2	No, I'd probably consider myself agnostic/atheist. I went to a Methodist church only occasionally when I was younger, but always knew earlier on that it was not something that made sense to me. I think a lot of the morals are applicable and I can see how it helps people, but you don't need to be religious to be a decent person, contrary to what many people think. I know too many people that use it as a guise. I can't believe in something that people call so benevolent and gracious that also created all the terrible things in the world. If there does turn out to be some sort of god, they sure aren't benevolent. 
2	Nope. Though I see the value religion brings to some, I do not find value in it myself. 
1	I was raised Christian. I found out when I went to public school for the first time (2nd grade) that other religions were a thing when I asked a Sikh about his turban. Also sat next to a Muslim on the bus. And went to school with plenty of Jews and Hindus. \n\nAnd the dissonance inherent in the fact that there were multiple religions that each believed in god(s), but had entirely different belief systems, was never adequately addressed until I stumbled upon the Bible episode of Penn & Teller: Bullshit at around age 12/13.\n\nBut even before then, I had a problem with the answers I'd get to questions about "what created God," "am I really expected to believe the story of Noah's Ark was true," or "why doesn't any of this crazy stuff happen anymore?"\n\nEdit: To the religious ISTJs, I know it's "faith," but the truth is, no matter what your beliefs, there are myriad religions (past and present) that you reject for a bunch of reasons. Apply that same standard to your chosen religion, and it probably fails the test, as well.
1	Extremely, and I am a Catholic convert (I was raised athiest-agnostic).
1	Religious no, spiritual yes.
1	Nah.
1	Slow relationship milestones with an ISTJ	Hi everyone, it's me again. \n\nBackground: I am a 35 year old INFP in a semi-long distance relationship of 1.5 years to a 38 year old always busy, always working ISTJ. We are 2.5 hrs away from each other.\n\nI ostensibly have a good and stable relationship with my ISTJ boyfriend, but December is going to be a bit tough for me. \n\n--\n1) He's moving from his current living situation to a new place alone so he's busy packing and won't have time to see me at all this month. I suggested coming down for a few hours and he was hesitant about that. \n\n--\n2) I would help him pack/move as a good gf should, but he doesn't seem to think that's a possibility since he's not introduced me to his family or friends yet. We've talked about this before, and his reasons then were that his 90 year old grandmother who currently lives with him is bigoted/mean/suffering from the beginnings of dementia/OCD and would hate me (I'm not from his background). I'm sure I would get along with his hippie dad, but my ISTJ has not made any effort to have us meet yet either. Which kinda hurts since he's met my family over this past Thanksgiving. My 90 year old grandfather also has the beginnings of Alzheimer's/dementia but treated my bf with utter happiness (that I might get married finally).\n\n--\n3) We're not "Facebook official" but we are FB friends. Not sure if this means anything.\n\n--\n4) He calls me his girlfriend (but it took him awhile) and he says "Love you" "Miss you" sincerely I think. When we're together, he's very affectionate and loving. He's not sociopathic, I think he genuinely has a heart.\n\n--\n5) I was looking into a new job nearby to him so this distance wouldn't be such a pain, and he seemed fine with the idea of me moving closer to him. I forwarded him one ok-sounding job listing, and he said randomly: "That new job is 50 minutes from my new place. 50 minutes is how long it takes for you to commute to your current job, isn't it? [from my current apt]" so I think that means he was calculating that I could go to the possible new job from his place, maybe even living with him, or at least staying over on weeknights. So perhaps he's not actively trying to avoid integrating me into his life or hiding a double life.\n\n--\n6) With his living in his own place finally, he's said things will be different in 2017, meaning I'll finally be able to visit him at HIS place, and staying over, which I couldn't before, due to his grandma.\n\n--\nI just don't get why it's taking so long to introduce me to his family to the point where it's our 2nd Christmas, and we might not even spend it together because he's afraid of drama.  \n\n
1	You guys live 2.5 hours apart. How often do you spend time together in person?\n\nAlso, your complaints seem super odd since it seems as though this move is solving a good number of problems.\n\n1. He's busy packing, so it makes sense he doesn't have time to hang out with you since he barely has time to pack.\n\n2. It's been a year and a half, and you effectively don't exist in his life outside of the time you spend together? I can understand not meeting the grandmother because she probably really sucks to be around in general, but that doesn't explain him not introducing you to the rest of his friends and family at least once. Or talking about them, or something.\n\n3. Not being Facebook official is as much of a problem as you think it should be. My ex and I never really broached that issue. We were both fine not setting relationship statuses and such.\n\n4. How long is a while? And why do you only think he's sincere? This is almost a second red flag.\n\n5. That seems promising, but how hard is he trying to actually get that job?\n\n6. I've been saying something similar about having people over for years. I have still yet to invite someone into my apartment, no matter how many times I move into a nicer one or how tidy I make it.\n\nI think you should make it clear that this stuff is important to you. The simplest answer is, he doesn't know how you feel about this stuff. As far as he knows, you asked about it once, he explained himself, and that's it.
1	Do you mind if I ask what's different about your background? It's one thing to not meet family, I can understand that. But if his friends don't know about you, that's a big problem. Are his friends bigots too? After 1.5 years...that's not reasonable. At the very minimal his friends should know about you and you should know about his friends. 
10	What is the most important thing in your life?	Don't mind me, just doing a casual survey ;). The most important thing in my life is my spirituality.
13	The most important thing in my life is purpose. If I am in pursuit of a goal (doesn't matter what) I will be set. If I am in between goals, the most important thing is to find an appropriate goal, or at least work towards one while I figure it out. 
4	Tranquility. Every ounce of my motivation is towards a more peaceful, functional self. The more power I have, the more I can improve my communities as well.
1	Right now? Trying to not lose my mind. haha\n\n\nAlmost everything and everyone I cared about so far, seemed to leave me (with or without reason) or disappoint me, so I don't really have nothing important in my life and I try to keep it that way as much as I can.  
1	Memories.\n\nThat's what keeps the ball rolling with life isn't it?\nEvery decision, opinion, and knowledge stems from this.
1	My wife for sure.
1	Predictability and/or knowledge. I hate this part of my life right now where I am about to graduate college and need to be getting a job, yet I still do not have a goal of any kind. It is a rough place to be for an ISTJ with anxiety...\nI want my life to be to the point where I am in a steady job well past being a new employee, where I know how to be an adult, and where very few things are new and complicated anymore.
3	ISTJ vanished after our first date	A
6	He might be nervous, did you try texting him first or are you waiting for him to initiate contact. \n\nUs ISTJ's are a bit weird, try and contact him first because we are so oblivious that he may well have thought the date was a failure. \n\nWhen talking about ISTJ's there is a golden rule: if you want them to do/know something, tell them!
4	I usually expect the woman to text me after a date I set up.  If there's no text, I assume, there's little interest.\n\n"Thanks, I had a lot of fun last night" means game on.
6	Based on all the info provided, and by not reading any comments (so that they don't influence my gut reaction), it sounds to me like he got anxious and isn't in a stable mind to start a relationship.\n\nEdit: My second thought is he thought you didn't enjoy the meeting. You should tell him you did so he can feel more secure. An update in the future would be fun to read. :)
4	If I try to put myself in his shoes, I'd be worried that I talked your ears off by mistake. I'd be going over any compliments you made about the date trying to figure out if they were sincere or just a way of letting me down gently. I'd be constantly questioning the goodbye and if I did it wrong or what.\n\nI'd know that I could (probably should) text and ask how you thought it went, but I'd be nervous about pestering you if you didn't have a good time.\n\nAs more time goes on I'd be thinking about how if you actually liked the date, you probably would have texted me about it already and that this was a sign that you didn't want to hear from me again.\n\nIt's dumb mind games, and something I'd really like to be able to work on avoiding in the future, but us istjs are naturally stubborn like that.\n\nIf you were to text him anything positive about the date, that should be enough of a go-ahead for him to pick the texting habits back up to how it was pre-date.\n\n(That's all considering he's not actually super busy with work or something... but there's always time to text a bit, right?)
7	Istj married to extroverted	Any istj females married with extroverted types? How does that works for you two? I would love to read your stories, thanks for the insights.
1	As far as I'm aware ISTJ's tend to work very well with extraverts in relationships. 
1	I enjoy extraverted people because I'm more of a listener type and rather not talk if I can help it 
1	My boyfriend is inbetween an introvert and extrovert and sometime it is difficult but usually it is great. He helps me to get the motivation to go out more and gives me someone to talk to but he has also learned that sometimes I just want to be alone. It took a while for us to develop language to express what we need but now I will say that I am "peopled" and he will respect it and leave me alone. He has also learned that I will never say yes to a social thing that is sprung in me with less than 24 hours notice. He knows now to tell me earlier and I will say yes and make sure my social batteries are charged. It is also important for us to have our own space. Either a two bedroom apartment where we can be alone or just making a curtained off nook. 
3	Istj married to another introverted	Any istjs (females in preference, but males are welcome) married to another introverted? How does that works for you two? I would love to read your stories. Thanks.
4	[deleted]
2	My wife and I are both introverts. It works out really well. 
16	Extremely lonely :(	Anybody here who has no friends or struggles with making friends? I personally find that people either dont like me or just want me around only to help them with their math homework. What should one do, in order to avoid a lifetime of isolation?
14	Ha, yeah, most of the times people wanted to work with me in school was because they knew I'd make sure my group had a good project.\n\nNever feel like I'm a apart of things; more like I am just an observer if that makes sense.
6	I feel this way sometimes. What helped me: I got into online gaming. I have made a lot of life long friends from it, and I don't feel so anti-social anymore, but I am still completely comfortable in my own home. \n\n
3	I second u/Calmia22. I made several friends from MMOs and we still chat and follow each other from game to game. 
2	The only way I've found and felt comfortable is when I gain an expertise in something to the point where I feel confident enough to share it. Confidence and feelings unthreatened in social situations is a big reason why I'm not able to make friends (I don't reveal much and I don't care much about the other person because I'm too concerned with keeping a safe distance). This might be more of an enneagram type 6 thing though, but Si-Ne can probably explain these feelings too.\n\nGetting involved politically or focusing on your favorite tasks and becoming proficient in your career can help you learn to reach out more. Or, if all else fails, you feel your life is meaningful having gotten skilled in something. I spend most of my time alone thinking and writing about things I eventually want to publish. When I feel those pangs of loneliness and feeling unwanted, I try to refocus on my work. It could help people.
1	Hmm me personally I get along with most I think. Although I could probably count my close friends on one hand.\n\nMaybe try to find the root of your problem. Like is it you or are you just around crappy people? Are you an enjoyable person to be around? Maybe find and make friends with similar interests!
1	Yeah that's me, definitely. I'm terrible at making friends unless there is a common interest, or something to talk about that interests both of us. To be honest, I find i'm able to make friends easier on Reddit than I can in real life. 
2	Any of you done LSD or psychadelics?	I am also an ISTJ. \n\nHow have your guys's experiences with psychadelics been? Please give details. I plan on taking lsd for the first time this weekend.\n\nThanks
17	What!?  And give up control?!  I don't even drink.  LOL
4	Just make sure you consider set and setting prior to taking it as this can drastically affect the type of trip you have. Set as in mindset, if you have had a shit day/week etc. this will manifest as a not enjoyable, but still beneficial trip. Setting as in surroundings, ensure you're surrounded by good people who you trust if you're taking it with friends ensuring that you feel safe. Enjoy, happy travels bro!
2	yes, loved it at first. But here lately I've been doing it at home with friends & going deeper & deeper inside my head, in silence. Which isn't nearly as fun as I used to have with it. So I think my time is coming to and end with it.
1	Fuuuuuck no. 
3	What on earth does this have to do with MBTI. I've seen multiple people ask this. If you spent more than 2 seconds scrolling down you would see answers
2	Quite a lot. I've done LSD, mescaline, mushrooms, DMT, salvia, and various other things. I used them for spiritual purposes. I feel like the experiences were very helpful. I researched a lot before taking anything new, and always tried to use only things that I had made myself, or that I acquired from trusted friends. 
1	Helll no. Not for me.
1	I've done LSD and 25i-NBOMe. It was always good, but you need to know how to handle your shit otherwise it can go horribly wrong.\nTo be honest, I wouldn't suggest looking in this sub for opinions regarding drugs, because really it is different for everyone regardless of MBTI type.
4	What is for you the greatest invention of the 20th century?	"Various opinion polls have shown that the greatest invention of the twentieth century the invention of the pill, because people can love when they pleased, because women no longer fear that they will become pregnant. Wonder tablet have brought sexual and indirectly, economic independence, so they can compete for better jobs and no longer fainted when they saw a mouse - were no longer dependent on male stereotypes about women. Thanks to contraception have entered into a contractual relationship. The emancipation of women is actually a paradox of imparting a freedom because women requires more and more responsibilities and duties. What they once represented as a great social achievement and privilege today they are experiencing as a form of oppression." (Europeana: A Brief History of the Twentieth Century by Patrik Ouredník)\n\n\nA price of freedom? "Glorious" capitalism; crazy feminism!\n(What do you think?)
16	The Internet.  
3	Mass production/assembly line.
2	The microchip
2	The internet without a doubt.
1	Nuclear reactor... Shame nobody uses them anymore :(
4	Weekly Thread: What's the best food dish you can make?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: if you were trying to impress someone with your culinary skills, what would you make? \n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
7	Baking complicated sounding cakes/desserts where I can follow exact instructions.\n\nI also make a pretty bomb bacon (+ random protein I have in the fridge) carbonara pasta, something I cook often to meal prep for the week!
6	Store-bought mac n cheese
3	I do a lot with Crockpots, and I would say my best dish would be Chicken Cacciatore. either 3.5 hours on high, or 7 Hrs on low. So simple to make, and to me, very relaxing to make. No needing to worry about watching a pan or pot, perfect when I'm feeling stressed or anxious.
3	I'm Indian. I make really good Indian food. I make a fantastic chicken curry. Yesterday, I made a cauliflower (gobi) dish, and I'm planning to cook up a mutton dish this weekend.\n\nEdit: oops, this is /r/ISTJ. I'm INTJ.
3	Frozen lasagna and pizza I buy in a store.
2	I like to make soup, casseroles, and bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers. \n\nSoups are generally cream based with chicken, bacon, broccoli, and leaks (other ingredients vary with lots of spices) \n\nCasseroles normally involve spaghetti squash. \n\n
2	I like to grill out, but the thing I like to do best is hot dogs. My best was probably an all beef dog on top of a slice of cheese in a bun, crisp bacon slice on one side, two half slices of tomato on the other, and topped with spicy brown mustard. 
2	Probably pasta puttanesca, but maybe my pasta salad with salsa cruda, or vegetable pizza with puff pastry instead of dough (and toppings according to the taste of the person I'm impressing). They're all very simple and even relaxing to make, but somehow come across as flash.
2	The best thing I can cook is take out.  I'm a terrible cook and baker. :(
2	I love cooking and baking. And I always try new recipes. But of all the ones I've tried so far, if say either Piri Piri grilled chicken or bluemoon and orange brined turkey. Oh, also chicken pot pie from scratch. \nIf I was to bake something it would be Macarons. 
45	Do you ever get annoyed by loudness?	I always get annoyed by loudness. For example when music is too loud, when someone is shouting while talking or when someone is yelling while they are on the phone. Idk if this is an istj thing or am I just being a special snowflake.
15	Same. I hate when people play loud music either from their car, house or phone. I hate when people are loud when they don't need to be, even kids at stores get on my nerves. 
7	YES. I'm sorry, am I shouting?
8	YES! I work at a call center so naturally there's a lot of chatter, but there's nothing worse than the person to my right tries to have a conversation with the person to my left, all while I'm trying to listen to the customer. I find noise to be quite distracting, as much as I try to ignore it.
5	My two biggest pet peeves are the volume of commercials and hearing people chew. Ugh!
4	All the time. Any consistent noise that's not really necessary infuriates me if I am around it for too long. Commercial radio, people talking at me endlessly, teenagers playing music from their phones... no thanks.
3	I'm very noise sensitive and become overwhelmed when faced with different simultaneous noise - conversation with TV on in the background, etc. I can't filter well. I'm a bit on the misophonic side too.
3	I have issues at work sometimes with focus. My brain tries to focus on literally everything. It can get very overwhelming very quickly. I actually almost had a panic attack the other day before I got my headphones on and called down. 
3	Loud music usually doesn't bother me. Many times, like in a spin class, I really enjoy it. \n\nRandom voices though, do really bother me. I can not stand cartoons or the sound of children playing in an enclosed area (indoors as opposed to a park). My so likes to watch rick & morty and adventure time and I can't stand it. I have to leave the room. The voices are so grating. 
2	I always have headphones on me. 
2	Nope.  I have always played my music loud, have a loud voice and come from a loud family.  And if I get pissed off, I tend to get even louder and lose my swearing filter.
2	Mhm. \n\nUnless it's my music (using headphones) and I'm in a 'turn to 10' mood. 
2	Wow, I can't believe no one has mentioned screaming babies or toddlers. \n\nThey're the absolute worst, hands down.\nLike the other day, I was riding on the bus, minding my business, then suddenly this shrieking little shit just starts screaming at the top of its lungs.\n\nIt wouldn't stop.\nI couldn't escape either.\nSo I had to endure the pain until my stop arrived, which was 50 minutes away... :'(
1	I can relate to this 100%. \nI say this as my family is yelling at football players as if they'll hear them through the TV.
1	Same
1	Check out r/hsp! I resonate with you on the loudness thing and was amazed at how well I thought highly sensing person described me!
1	Sometimes. I like to have a fan all the time because I need background noise.
1	Very much so. Earplugs are this INFP's best friend.
1	I'm an ISTJ / ISTP (borderline J&P as I have been both in the last two tests).  I work as desk-folk in a manufacturing environment.  Not always, but sometimes I lose my shit when someone spools up a grinder or the rivet gun when I am 'in the zone' at work.  I have literally thrown stuff across the room because the sudden spike of annoying-ass noise drove me up the wall.  Not sure why sometimes putting the earmuffs on is fine but other times rage is invoked.  The free coffee probably isn't helping any.
1	I have somehow learnt to ignore a lot of my surroundings rather than getting annoyed, but that also means I may at times completely miss any important things in busy environments. But if I want to sleep this doesn't really work and I get annoyed by loud neighbours after all. Used to live in an old flat one floor above a guy who liked to have parties with quite some alcohol and drugs. He knew I didn't like it so he didn't do this very often, but one day he happened to have his birthday the day before I had an exam.
6	Any ISTJs with extroverted jobs?	I'm thinking of studying to become a high school Japanese teacher in Australia. I've been an assistant English teacher in Japan for the last five years and I like working with teenagers (most of the time), but it's time to go home and get a "real" job. \n\nMy question is, is there anyone here who works an unconventionally non-introverted job, and loves it? What kind of work do you have? What strategies do you have in place to not end up feeling overwhelmed and hating the job, apart from coming home and just shutting out the world?
4	Well I'm a retail worker for now, always around customers. I survive because 90% of the job can go by a script.\n\nWe don't carry ___.\n\nSure, let me have a look in the back.\n\nWe worked that stock yesterday, everything we have is here.\n\nHave a nice day.\n\nIt's when customers decide to make small talk or push me off my script that I get flustered. Like, "I know that we don't have this item, and I'm pretty sure we won't be getting it... but maybe we will, but probably not. We have other toys from that brand, but not that one. Maybe before Christmas... But maybe not, I don't know lady. No it wouldn't be in the back we don't have it."\n\nSo, if I were teaching, I would need to know my material 100% so that any qestion would have a by-the-book answer.
2	I work in sales and love it!  Part of being introverted is being a good listener.  Listening is one of the best skills to have in sales.\n\nAlso, no introvert is 100% introverted all of the time.
2	Yes -- my ISTJ boyfriend is a construction foreman/superintendent. He's always checking up on people, taking calls, and interacting with crew. 
2	I'm studying to be a teacher as well, and before that I was a tutor. It was mostly one-on-one, and right now I'm working as a cashier, but I do sincerely like people and I don't mind working with them. It really keys into my desire to be responsible and respectable. It takes a bit of work for me to be warm, but once you key into your Fi and learn to be empathetic in all situations (I am now the person I am talking to. What do I need to hear?) any job with the public becomes easier. And because we care most about getting the job done, we are effective and people recognize it.\n\nThat said, I can be surprised and caught off guard, and I don't function well multi-tasking, something that is the hallmark of the teaching profession. You won't really be able to control those elements, as I'm sure you are aware from teaching already, but you can mitigate them and learn to take control once they happen.\n\nWe are never the huggy feely type of people, and we won't be those types of teachers. Don't even pretend to be - but be open and honest with your students about who you are, and they'll likely see you in the same positive respect as their other favorite teachers.\n\nWhat students really want is a teacher who respects them and their time. What they need is their education. Those three things are what you need to provide, and nothing about our type prevents us from doing that.
2	I pursued a career in education.\n\nInteraction with people, especially in large groups, was profoundly uncomfortable to me.\n\nPeople sometimes say that this job, that job, this employer, that employer, this person or that person have a pro-extrovert bias.\n\nHere's what must be addressed:\n\n*Reality* has a pro-extrovert bias.\n\nYou don't get out and meet people unless you get out and..  meet people.\n\nWhile it is draining to interact with large groups of folks for extended periods of time, nearly any type of work is draining.\n\nFurther, just like one can train to run a marathon, one can train to do something mentally or emotionally tiring for long periods of time as well.  One can even come to find it rewarding and enjoyable.\n\nSo I practiced (by actually being a public high school teacher) for eight hours every day.  I learned habits, social skills, and behaviors that probably come a little easier to other folks (so I had to work harder to get myself there).  I learned to deal with situations that made me feel awkward and want to retreat, and I forced myself to face them rather than back into some hole.\n\nI find teaching tremendously rewarding, and I think that I'm far more well rounded than I was before I went down this road.  More importantly, teaching prevented me from using excuses (and I probably would have) to justify a failure to develop as a person and a professional.
2	Definitely. That's me for sure.\n\nI work as a Support Manager at Walmart. It's not that I love it, it's just that i'm fairly used to it because i've worked for Walmart for 9 years. I find it different to talk to people when i'm actually getting paid to do it. 
1	I was a teacher for five years but not in public school. Working ESL overseas was great and working at a university was amazing. However my extroverted friend works with kids in public school and she needs to be "on" for 9+ hours a day with no break and I'd stab my eyes out. Now I am in business school to be a project manager or corporate trainer because I need more respect and money. 
0	Clearly you don't like getting paid much... The Aussie school system sucks
1	How to save an ISTJ's life?	Hello fellow ISTJs,  \n\nI am writing you with growing worries about one of yours. She is a long time friend, I met her 7 years ago.  \nBy the time, she was incredibly pretty, had all the cool guys at her feet, witty, smart, brilliant, ambitious, fun, full of life. Meeting her changed my life, she met a shy and insecure guy and gave him her trust. I eventually started to grow as a person, and she was the trigger.\n\nBut things changed. For 6 years now, I saw her fade away. The ambitions vanished, she stopped studying speech therapy, her dream job, after failing twice at the entry exam (said to be among the most difficult, but she was close to succeed and was hard-working toward her goal). Eventually, her father drove her to study something she didn't like so she'll have a job and won't just end as a cashier. Her dreams totally disappeared in the meantime.\n\nHer very possible wish to live by the coast also disappeared and she settled in the middle of nowhere. She found a dull boyfriend who criticizes her job while being a builder worker.\n\nThe sporty and gorgeous petite redhead turned into a fat and lazy depressive woman. I don't recognize her. She is self destructing. And I don't know what to do to give her a hand and help her be happy. I try hard not to hurt her feelings, to show I care, to tell I want her to be happy. Our relationship has been chaotic these few years because while she was letting herself drown, I was going the opposite, and being a young ENTJ makes for arrogance and hurtful behaviors. I apologized countless times.  \nBut whatever, she becomes hysterical, says I am ridiculous, not honest, whatnot. I deeply feel she is very unhappy and frustrated, but way too proud to admit it to me, way too proud to open up, and then becomes almost agressive or ignores me.\n\nWhat can I do? If she stays on the same line, she'll be buried before 40 (she's 25). I want to help her be happy again. Please, advise me.
11	It's not your job to save her. \n\n"True change only comes from inspiration, or desperation"\n\nIf she isn't desperate enough, she won't change. \n\nIf she isn't inspired by another's change, she won't. \n\n\n\nYou feel like you owe her or/and just KNOW what she can accomplish. But it's her journey. Not yours. 
4	As others have advised, leave her be. You can't save her and it sounds like she doesn't want you as part of her life. Also being so critical of her appearance is kinda rude. Bodies change as people get older, get over it. I'd block someone too if he made comments about me being fat, not to imply you said it to her face... but you said it here. You're judging her really, really harshly for a lot of stuff, she might have gotten sick of it. I personally wouldn't keep someone in my life who was that critical of me and my weight/body. You think you're helping her by pointing out her weight or lack of a good career... believe me, she knows. Just leave her be to work out her own life. \n\nEDIT: It sounds like she's suffering from mental illness of some kind, in which case the only thing that can help her is when she decides to pursue professional help like therapy.
6	> she stopped studying speech therapy, her dream job, after failing twice at the entry exam (said to be among the most difficult, but she was close to succeed and was hard-working toward her goal\n\nISTJ don't like to waste time. If after the second time we failled, time to change career. \n\n> she settled in the middle of nowhere\n\nlook like she found the ultimate charging station. \n\nJust so you know, we, introvert, recharge by being alone.\n\n> The sporty and gorgeous petite redhead turned into a fat and lazy depressive woman\n\nThis is low blow and judgemental, but as we share the same "J" I am too. So you sound like a exited dog that won't let go of the barking. Just chill.\n\n> But whatever, she becomes hysterical, says I am ridiculous, not honest, whatnot.\n\nDo you force your liking of lifestyle on her? If so I'll be irritated as well.\n\n>If she stays on the same line, she'll be buried before 40 (she's 25) \n\nOh, I see you have studies to predict death based on lifestyle! Go you~
2	Just a thought -- in my experience, nothing is more exhausting than feeling like I need to reassure someone else that I'm okay. There is no sane way of replacing your own judgement with someone else's -- if she makes it your job to drag her out of this hole (whether by asking or by allowing you to appoint yourself), you'll have to drag her behind you forever. \n\nSome people and types are helped by having someone else tell them they're being ridiculous, etc, it gives them a clear sense of things. I don't think ISTJs are that kind -- we benefit more from clear logic and practical guidance with a kind/caring Fi behind it, than what (to me) can feel like invasive demands to "show better" before one actually is better. I'd look into setting boundaries if necessary to compassionately discourage any complaining and communicate she is still capable if necessary. 
1	Imagining myself in her position, I'm not really sure there's much you can do at this point 
-1	What if I send you a picture to show her?  Me, a 53 yo ISTJ weighing over 500+ pounds.  Shock therapy?\n\nEdit--Sorry, reading that back it sounds dismissive and snarky.  Don't really mean it that way.  She's lucky to have you as a caring friend but depression is hard to deal with.  Perhaps calling her doctor to see if they will discuss your concerns with her.
9	Dealing with the Holidays?	Do any other ISTJs hate the holiday season?  Once I was past the point of Santa Claus Christmas and Thanksgiving have become such a beating.  I've got 4 sides of the family to squeeze in due to divorced and remarried parents and now I have my husband's two sides of the family to fit in also.  Luckily we have no kids but it's just a lot.  If I wasn't such a duty fulfiller I'd just say screw it all and go on vacation every year, but I feel trapped by my ISTJ-ness to follow tradition and what's expected of me.  Anyone else go into overwhelmed and high stress mode this time of year?
4	My ISTJ wife gets stressed out over the holidays, but we've found ways to make it easier for her.\n\nAs an ENFP I love the events and get togethers, and this was a source of stress in our relationship.\n\nShe also grew up in a family where the expectation was that the women (mostly her) would cook a large feast on every holiday and she carried this expectation into our marriage too.\n\nBut, I don't care about the the feast so much as the togetherness and so we found a happy medium:\n\nThanksgiving is a big cooking day. She likes cooking and is quite good at it too with several specialities that work well for Thanksgiving.\n\nChristmas is not a big cooking day. We may make a few special things, but no big feast. More appetizers-all-day than anything else.\n\nAnd New Years is essentially the same.\n\nWe'll still do some family things, but we'll pick and choose. We'll do Christmas or New Years with family but not both.\n\nAnd sometimes I just run interference and take the kids to a family get together myself so she can have some quality time with a good book.
3	A few years ago I decided to turn my back on tradition for my mental sanity, now I have my own tradition. Holidays are too exhausting, always have been for me but when my grandma died a few years ago I decided to finally reclaim the holiday. It's harder with an SO, and sometimes it's just something people suck up for obligation but I did that for too long.
3	I enjoy prepping for the holidays as far as gifts and planning get-togethers. The gifts are my favorite, thinking about what someone likes/is interested in/might like to try, and seeing them hopefully light up with happiness when they get it. It's also nice to see people continue using the gifts day to day when it applies. I also enjoy planning parties, decorating a theme, letting everyone know there is happiness ahead when I invite them and hope they look forward to it. \n\nAnd that's about it. I really like when I reicieve gifts, but I always feel unworthy of good ones, so gift-getting stresses me out beyond belief when it comes to family. \n\nAnd then there is social gatherings. I'll plan a party come hell or high water, but I'll resent all the actual interaction and social effort I have to put in when it comes time to be present at the party. I despise family gathers for all the social pressure to like everyone, and in my family the women are supposed to serve the men, eat after they're done and in a separate room and just talk women stuff (pronounced: gossip and fashion). Fuck all of that. So, past gift shopping and planning a party I don't want to actually attend, I hold severe disdain for these end of year holidays.
2	What exactly is stressing you about it? Is it time obligations/visits? Presents? 
2	I LOVE holidays. Meeting with family, giving gifts (come on Halloween, get with it!), decorating, holiday music, the food (I don't like Thanksgiving food though!), shopping. ALL OF IT. I'm surprisingly easygoing.\n\nThe holidays remind me of what happened in the past and these memories are positive. The worst holidays and birthdays are usually still better than my best non-holiday days.\n\nEdit: I should state I love the planning parts of holidays. I already have every present I'm giving picked out to be bought and wrapped in the next week.
2	This is the first year I'm not stressed about turkey day or the rest of it. \n\nI have a toxic family and have chosen to be very low (none currently) contact with them. This is the first year they haven't tried to force me into interacting with them. It's glorious feeling. No feeling of obligation to torment myself. 
2	I love the holidays imo.
2	How to deal with type-based jealousy/insecurity in my relationship with an ISTJ?	Hi guys, I recently realized my boyfriend is most likely ISTJ even though he has his outgoing moments and can talk for longer than I can. He is, for the vast majority of the time, as loyal as can be -- he never gives me reason to distrust him. I know he loves me; he recently flew to meet my parents, and did his best to leave a good impression with them. He tells me I'm beautiful all the time; we adore each other.\n\nHowever, he is an ISTJ, and I am an INFP, and we sometimes have moments where there is just silence -- him in his head, and me in mine. I don't think we mind it that much, but I get a little scared that he might find it understimulating (like what if he'd be happier with an Exxx?). Those fears come to a peak when we encounter an attractive person who is extroverted and naturally attention-drawing, and funny/witty like the waitress who was serving us the other day (she was an ESFP I think). Though he was wearing sunglasses and said nothing, I could tell he was riveted by her, and pretty much was slowly melting under her charms. I have no such charms and was struggling with jealousy but I never let him know how uneasy I felt. \n\nThough my ISTJ and I have chemistry and passion and mutually shared values, sometimes I notice he has a "spark" with other ES-types that I can't provide. How do I teach myself to be ok with that? As a perfectionist, I definitely struggle with not being "the best" for my partner.  
5	Every single ISTJ is super talkative when they get close to someone. Take that as a good sign.\n\nI personally yes think I would be slightly happier with an extrovert BUT only by a tiny margin. \n\nWhat you have is good and he definitely loves you. You don't always have to be talking but if he is speaking to you just be  polite and respond. Us ISTJ's are like ,pendulums when it comes to talking, a lot and then nothing so it isn't you alone that is creating those quiet moments\n\nThe easiest way to know what an ISTJ feels is to ask them... It's that simple.\n\nFor those quiet times any form of physical contact will make him feel special and loved. Hugs, hand holding.\n\nBecause we dot know how you think it's hard for us to help you feel adequate (perhaps r/INFP can help) but we can say that your inadequacy is unfounded
5	> we sometimes have moments where there is just silence -- him in his head, and me in mine. I don't think we mind it that much, but I get a little scared that he might find it understimulating \n\nYou could ask him directly if he does. If he's ISTJ, he'll tell you. \n\nI'm INFJ. When we were first getting to know each other, my ISTJ girlfriend initially told me that she appreciates silence, that it bugs her when people feel like silence is by definition a cause to have to fill it up with chatter. \n\nI tend to feel overly responsible for making people comfortable in interaction, so it turns out that knowing that was very freeing for me. That if there is silence between us, it doesn't mean anything is wrong. That we can take walks or read our books or eat together and I can be in my own head and there can be silence and we're still *together* and okay. (For us, physical contact is a good way to retain connection in those times - holding hands, legs touching, stuff like that).\n\nBut really, my experience is that if you want to know something from an ISTJ, just ask directly for the information. They'll be straight up in answering. No need to read in when you can get the information directly, IMO. Though I don't know how information-sharing will differ for an INFP as opposed to me as an INFJ (Pi-dom INFJ versus Ji-dom INFP).\n\n----------------\n\nedit: and I wrote this before reading the other comments, and see that I'm echoing what they said:\n\n>[The easiest way to know what an ISTJ feels is to ask them... It's that simple.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/5e4n2m/how_to_deal_with_typebased_jealousyinsecurity_in/da9z8mc/)\n\nand \n\n>[Reveal and speaks to him of your fears](https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/5e4n2m/how_to_deal_with_typebased_jealousyinsecurity_in/da9t2m6/)\n\nplus, from the same comment:\n\n>[Try to be closer to him from a physical point of view: with the physical acts as cuddling, massages, kisses but always with gentleness. ....  try to combine the two tips together. Speak-acting in that way, you'll see..](https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/5e4n2m/how_to_deal_with_typebased_jealousyinsecurity_in/da9t2m6/).\n\nI really think you've gotten the keys in these replies.
3	> Though he was wearing sunglasses and said nothing, I could tell he was riveted by her, and pretty much was slowly melting under her charms.\n\nI'd be careful about assuming other people's feelings. It's definitely possible that your insecurity is skewing your perception of what he's thinking or feeling.\n\nThat being said, it's pretty normal to still have some attraction to other people while you're in a relationship. You don't suddenly stop having eyeballs because you're dating someone. But your ISTJ chooses to be with *you*, because you have a variety of qualities he likes that are unique to you. \n
2	I know it will seem strange but whatever your thinking I will give you a very dry and brief advice:\n- Reveal and speaks to him of your fears without getting problems (and you'll see that if you do it in intimate or personal moments he'll be very happy)\n- Try to be closer to him from a physical point of view: with the physical acts as cuddling, massages, kisses but always with gentleness. \n\nIf instead it's something difficult, even this may seem strange, try to combine the two tips together. Speak-acting in that way, you'll see..
2	Somehow I understand where you are coming from, OP. I feel a certain spark which you speak of when interacting with fellow Sensors. The guy I am seeing is also an IN type and we too spend a lot of time in our own minds, and sometimes I feel that it is difficult to "reach" into his mind and connect with him.\n\nAnyway, I digress. I wouldn't worry too much if I were you. As you pointed out, you and your ISTJ have chemistry, passion and mutually shared values, all of which would provide a firm foundation for your relationship. Continue to communicate well, develop common interests and have more shared experiences together --- I believe these would make for a lasting relationship, especially given (a) the dedication, stability and loyalty that an ISTJ, and (b) the nurturing nature, warmth and patience an INFP can bring to the relationship\n\nAlso, please have more confidence in yourself! The INFPs in my life are all charming in their own special ways, and I am sure your boyfriend can attest to that (not to mention INFPs are super loving and cuddly people that make them difficult not to like!). If you had no such charms, he would not have been attracted to you in the first place. Chin up, and all the best! :) 
2	A bit late to the game, but a thought as I was reading this -- and I am not sure whether it will comfort you or not, but it is at least true for me. I can be more riveted by one person, but still prefer, overall, the company of another person.\n\nYou might think of it as being similar to the difference between a hike up a hill just as the sun is rising and casting bright colors across the clouds, versus the feeling of sinking into a hot tub when you've been cold and your muscles are sore from work. Both are great feelings. However, one has elements of being uplifted, charged, and sustained, and one is a more basic experience of physical comfort and pleasure.\n\nLikewise, there are people I would throw down with in a second -- that I imagine being captivated by. At the same time, those are usually also people I don't feel entirely safe with. Not that I feel in physical danger, but more that the feeling of being intimidated is interesting on its own accord. However, many of the people who fall into that camp (not all -- and someone can evoke these feelings without falling exclusively into this camp as well) are generally people I would find it hard to open up and be actually vulnerable and myself with.\n\nSo while one person may captivate me like the promise of a hot bath or delicious morsel of food, another person may sustain and enrich my life in a much more complete and valued way, like the endless pleasure to be had from stretching, plus the feeling of having had a good night of sleep, plus the soothing comfort of touch and cuddling -- and if I had to swear off eating and baths entirely and become an acetic to have the comfort of the latter things, I would do so in a heart beat. Doesn't mean I wouldn't still stare down a garlic-seasoned chunk of steak like it was the elixir of life -- but I can want that and still be entirely happy and content with my ongoing choice to be with who I am with. :) \n\nIt may be worth asking if you haven't yet -- have you? Particularly if asked in a gentle and concerned enough way, if someone I loved asked me something along these lines I would most enthusiastically attempt to make it clear to them why they need not be concerned, if indeed they need not be concerned. If there was a reason for concern -- I think there would still be a good deal of value to having the issue pulled out of my head where I can sometimes get stuck with ideas, and what would be a private struggle could become an open conversation, and as long as my partner was resilient enough to discuss it with me, the simple fact of that being an option might be enough for me to be all the more attached and attracted to them. \n\nIt is very rare that I feel okay having conversations with others about unresolved feelings -- and very rare that I feel that doing so does not rob me of autonomy and clarity. But if someone could support and contribute without trying to take the wheel from me, that would be most appreciated. That includes contributing via tactful candor -- that is, negative feelings being expressed as readily as positive ones, in the context of constructive and thoughtful communication in both directions. Of course, my measure of what contributing looked like would vary based on the situation -- I would understand that it is hard to not have some self-interest in whether or not your partner feels securely attached to you, and would not expect selflessness from a partner in that situation. On the contrary, their setting of good boundaries while still sharing what they can of their feelings, experience, and their willingness to answer questions about what they've noticed and what they feel about me... etc... the more it was a true conversation, the more I think it would be another way of falling closer with them in a good way. \n\nA final closing thought -- and one I think you already know, given the quotes you put around it -- thankfully there is no "the best" when it comes to other people. I've tended to be a dark optimist -- I believe both in the ability of fate and nature to be almost hilariously cruel, and yet I also believe in the power of a person to make the best they can of their situation. I think there are many ways something can be good, and all ways of being good will come with drawbacks. When it comes to other people, the ability to safely communicate with good boundaries and respect for mutual autonomy is a topmost priority, however, as this allows even the inevitable drawbacks to be discussed and often addressed in ways that can make them non issues. The ability to negotiate solutions together is powerful -- and is almost mandatory for me, in the long run. If I cannot communicate with someone, I am bound to eventually sink into my own shame cycle for not being adequate, or for being disappointing in the ways I am most prone to being disappointing -- or I will get caught in my own head about some issue and lose all perspective on it whilst acting in a way that will likely make my partner feel disconnected from me, which will only feed into my distorted thinking, and it just isn't a very helpful or adaptive thing.\n\nHope this helps -- and don't underestimate the power of gentle charm by the way! And it is possible that if he does find them more stimulating, that you could work ways in your own lives of getting doses of that worked in... so that he can have everything he likes of being with you, along with the occasional little role play or whatever else where you turn on whatever extroverted or "on" traits in a way that you can enjoy together.\n\nWould you ever consider being happier with an ESTJ? He is loyal, can talk for longer... do you ever wish he was more take-charge Te, more assertive, etc? Is there any chance that some of this also reflects your own concern about not being stimulated enough in the relationship, not feeling enough between you? If the relationship is otherwise good, and you both want to work it out, there's a chance that you could work some play into your relationship that would satisfy any needs one or both of you might have in terms of receiving something from each other.
1	Thank you; these are reassuring replies. I guess the "Why Men Love Bitches" credo of being the ultimate "cool girl" who doesn't sweat and never shows insecurity doesn't apply to relationships with ISTJs? 
1	Weekly Thread: What are you thankful for?	Welcome to our weekly thread! With many of you about to head for Thanksgiving dinners next week, this week's question is: what are you thankful for? \n\nFor those of you who don't know what you'll say at Thanksgiving next week, hopefully this thread gives you some inspiration! Please remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
3	My life. I'm 18 and I was diagnosed with liver cancer 1.5 years ago.
3	I don't have any family. They are all either deceased or I am disconnected from them. I am thankful for the memories of my past, and how I grew up. Without my past I would either be an incredibly screwed up adult with no values. 
2	What I have. Might not seem much but I make the best out of it.
2	Thankful I have family, friends, and a great husband.  I've got a great job, nice home, and a running car.  I'm thankful I have clothes to spare, plenty of food in my pantry, and good enough health to make it day to day.  I'm truly blessed and have a hopeful and positive outlook for the future. 
2	I'm thankful that we don't celebrate thanksgiving here
7	Background noise?	I read this [post on showerthoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/5dx0kq/why_do_i_spend_20_mins_searching_for_something_to/) and thought how I can't relate to any of it. I reflected on it a bit and realized that I can't stand "background noise".\n\nIf a tv show or movie is on, I feel a need to follow it closely, not fleetingly between Facebook and Reddit sessions on my phone.\n\nIf the radio is on, I have to follow with whatever the announcers are talking about or listen to the words of the songs that are playing.\n\nI get really annoyed when my sister has Netflix going and is staring at her phone, laptop, or isn't even in the same room as the tv anymore.\n\nIs this an istj thing or just me?
5	I'm the opposite. I can't stand silence when I'm awake, only when sleeping. I'll do something but need something in the background as well, whether it's music or the tv.
2	[deleted]
2	For me, it varies. Sometimes, I like to put something on to listen to, and then I can read, or work, even though I am not processing any of the words of what I put on. Other times, I need silence.\n\nI usually don't know which it will be beforehand. Just that when I need silence, listening to something will be very distracting, like I am trying to remember the tune of a song while listening to the radio. But when I need noise, trying to do something without it is like feeling a thousand ants crawling up my body, making me feel restless and tense and immobilized.\n\nHave you ever heard of the Yerkes Dodson curve? It is a curve that describes the relationship between how stimulated someone is, and their performance on a task. Everyone has a happy middle somewhere -- if they are under-stimulated, they're falling asleep or checking out; if they are over-stimulated, they're vibrating out of their chair; in either case, they're not doing too well. But just right, and they are able to do well on the task.\n\nThe idea is that we all have individual differences in this respect -- and that some people, who already tend to be sensitive to stimulation, need the rest of the world to be quiet so that they aren't pushed over the top end of the curve into vibrating out of their chair with anxiety and stress. Meanwhile, others, who tend to be undersensitive to stimulation, need a lot of noise and stuff going on just to wake them up enough to do a good job.\n\nIt also varies a bit based on the difficulty of the task (harder tasks need less stimulation, easier tasks need more stimulation), and I would not be surprised if for myself, it also differed based on time of day -- in the morning, I am usually more awake and alert than in the middle of the day. Sometimes I also get very energized at night, though usually I have some accompaniment (like a radio program or podcast) to listen to while I am buzzing about my apartment.
2	Not so quite for me, I can't stand not having any sort of sound on the background (except when I am looking for quite), I turn on the TV or put music to distract myself,\n
2	It's background noise for me. Even if it's something lame like Family Guy or Once Upon a Time, we usually like to have it on in the background. Music is always an option for us too. 
2	I almost always enjoy background noise, with the exception of TV, due to its visual distraction. Also, I suppose I don't care for podcasts or audiobooks if I'm doing schoolwork, but music is a huge part of myself and whenever I can I like to put my head down and zen out, at work, in the car, or during anything that might not require a ton of focus. \n\nWhen I sleep I almost always have some sort of noise or ambient music. Brian Eno is nice, and some soundtracks (I particularly like ones by Trent Reznor). Sometimes in the summer I'll just put a fan on and not have any music. 
1	I like to have music on in the background, and I tend to listen to German news in the background while I'm practising my German. I put more effort into deciding what music to listen to if I'm actually going to listen to it properly, though, and I never use shows or movies as background noise.
1	If I can hear people talking elsewhere when I'm doing whatever, it is very annoying.
1	I can't stand background noise either.  The only time my TV gets turned on is when my husband is home.  If he's not here I'm in silence.  When I sleep it has to be silent and pitch black. 
1	Just you mate... Not an ISTJ thing as far as I'm aware
1	As Sensing doms it might have something to do with that. We're more keen to pay attention to whats going on in our environment than others. As introverts as well, we live very much in our heads and need to be able to hear our inner thoughts compared to outside noise.\n\nIt reminds me of how my father is always repeating information already known and stated, constantly nagging for chores and contributions to the household to be made. My brothers always flat out ignored him, tuning him out and going about their day. I can't tune out people's voices and so his constant repetitions aggravate me. I also think this is what led to my perfectionism, because theres alway something to be done and something out of place that he'd comment on.
1	I can't stand background noise either. I always thought it was just a weird thing only I didn't like. Because everyone else around me is the opposite and has to have some kind of noise happening. Like anytime our friends come over they want music playing while we're all discussing whatever. It just feels like a huge distraction for me and sensory overload. But I also have fibromyalgia so that could also be a contributing factor
1	Cannot STAND silence,  Never have.  I even sleep with the TV/VCR/DVD/computer video playing and not quietly.  I can never just sit and watch TV.  I have to be doing something else as well.  As I peruse reddit right now, I've got DVD on my computer playing in another window.  \n\nQuickest way to wake me is to shut off the power to my bedroom.  No fan, TV and BiPAP?  Sure to wake me.\n\nOh, but no music if trying to sleep.  I'll keep trying to jam and never sleep.  I've got my sleep standbys.
13	How many of you suffer(ed) from depression? What do you do about it?	Well, me being depressed was curious about if other ISTJs are depressed, seeing how our thinking lends to it. 
5	As far as I can tell ISTJ's have a very high depression rate perhaps due to the stress and duties we feel obligated to do. \n\nI personally just went quietly through depression and was lucky enough to come out the other side. In hindsight not such a smart thing
5	Therapy. Read "The Happiness Trap" by Russ Harris. Balanced diet and good sleep routine. Very low dose anti-depressants and high dose vitamin D supplement. Start with therapy and reading the book and practicing those coping skills before you try medication, though.
3	Yep. Did some talk therapy and currently take an anti-depressant.
2	Therapy works wonders. Medication doesn't hurt either. 
2	I did for a time and took therapy like many others in the comments here. It worked fine but after I graduated, I never followed up on it. I don't get as depressed as I did often, but then I'll have a moment that'll trigger it. It lasts a while until my brother snaps me out if it or I do other things (going out to lunch, working out, etc)
2	I have been depressed for most of my life, but I also have hypothyroidism as well which was untreated for many years. The combination of these two cause me to have bipolar type behavior. \n\nI take medications for both now, and they seem to help quite a bit. I believe that those with the ISTJ personality are more inclined to fight with depression. 
1	I took Effexor XR for 2 months slowly got off of it another month and haven't had to take it since then. 
1	Yo. Quite the struggle but finally going to do something about it this coming week.
1	yeah i've been diagnosed with depression for about half a year now. i started out on SSRIs (sertaline), which worked for a while, but then made it much, much worse.\n\ni'm now on wellbutrinXL and it feels better so far. i think our Si makes us TOO introspective, always comparing our state of minds to past times, and it's important to force yourself out of that.
1	I'm on meds for depression, anxiety and bipolar. I am also seeing a psychiatrist and therapist.
6	How do you feel about sex (in the social and emotional sense)?	I recently had a bit of an argument with my friends about how we think people should behave regarding sex (whether it should be behind closed doors or open to anyone regardless of emotional involvement), and I was wondering what people with a (generally) similar way of thinking as mine have to say about this.\n\nThank you!
13	For me sex is something to be cherished inside a marriage (or an union, oh well, society) with an special other. \n\nSocially, it should be something private, not to be boasted.\nEmotionally, the act itself is insignificant but it helps to indulge even further in your partner's feelings. 
8	I romanticize sex, imagining poly bisexual love pits but also am extremely wary of the opposite sex (males). This all coming from a 25 yr old virgin.\n\nI do have strong feelings that people should talk about sex more because it is mired in the fetishization of power dynamics and we should all confront this. Even if people are having fun and consenting, I do believe that certain sex acts have implications about the person and society as a whole. That being said, while I am busy psychoanalyzing others, I don't mind if people have their problematic fun. Discussing sex however shouldn't be a taboo.
3	Wouldn't mind if people were more open about it, it's strange there is always so much trouble around something that should come off as natural.\n\nFor me, I strongly feel that physical touch is my kind of language, thus sex would be the ultimate form of affection. I would prefer to have it with someone I really like and trust. But I don't think I would do that great as a partner. Friends with benefits, perhaps, but exlusive ones.
2	Personally I think that sex is a personal thing, so that I always call "love", and not "sex".\nAlthough it is difficult to live in this society that bombards us about sex, performance, and other similar bullshit.\nIn any case I had periods in which I let myself go and conduct a little 'more libertine, and obviously I'm ashamed, but I was single.\nRelationship "sex" instead becomes something romantic, unique, personal, profound.\n\n\nI, personally, and I want to clarify that this is my personal opinion: those who admit explicit sex and disgraced at all, as one who is too libertine, who condemns a couple, who admits an "open marriage" (with the consent both) has undergone something serious in his life, it was a past relationship, a sexual act "not go well", a violence, repression of what really represents sex.\n\nIn truth, no matter how romantic and passionate in sex, I believe that sex should only be used to reproduce, and I do not mean the Christian meaning of this, just the reality of the facts. I remain still a very romantic that uses the sexual act as very deep exploration of consciousness, myself and my partner.
2	I think I have a different outlook then most ISTJ's. I've been in love, I have been married, and I have been divorced. Going along with these feelings, I have also lost every family member I have ever been close too. At this point I consider myself a little heartless. \n\nAs a single woman who no longer has an interest in relationships, I do have an interest in sex. With my last boyfriend I was really able to open up sexually which gave me a new perspective on it. Don't get me wrong, I am incredibly picky about who gets to be in my bed now, and I feel that there has to be some sort of mental/emotional connection with the person or I just wont do it. I am much more likely to hop on an adult site and look for someone who meets my needs then to go without at this point though. \n\nI would consider myself to be fairly shy when it comes to talking about sexual acts. I tend to freeze up. 
1	Sex is a part of life whether or not you have it. 
3	ESTJ and ISTJ - romance	Hello!!!\nSo, I'm a female istj, and although I am not really romantic staying i love you all the time, and showing affection through actions than words, I think I would like some romance. What types do you think it would fit me best? \nAnother question, how are estj males romantically? Do they show love by actions or words, are they any romantic or how are they in general relationships? Soeey about so many questions. All comments are welcome.
3	All types can work together as long as they are both mature.
10	Feeling detached in social situations	Are some of you detached in social situations? I'm having so much trouble socializing with people in terms of I accidentally end a conversation abruptly just because I make a comment about something or have an opinion. It's just really annoying that I can't voice without people feeling turned off. Anyone successfully fixed this about themselves?
2	The truth to the matter is that there is no easy fix. You can:\n\nA. Find different friends\nB. Be really careful and think every sentence through in advance
2	I'm in the same boat, up to the point where I don't chime in on anything because I don't know what someone may think. I just end up filtering what I say without trying to go over, it seemed to help at my last workplace. It sucks and I didn't like it, but I didn't want to cause problems or create more awkwardness than I already did (I was the super quiet guy that never talked to anyone unless spoken to).
1	I feel your pain...The biggest change for me is phrasing. Try and ask open ended questions and follow up with maybe asking their opinion on the subject. 
1	oh 100%. people have described being friends with me as a high skill ceiling. once all of the inside jokes are finally established, we are best friends, but if i am just meeting a random person i cannot connect with them unless they put out effort back. i completely give up and withdraw.
1	Yeah, pretty much. I'm more of a listener than someone who chimes in to conversations. 
1	Conversations for me are either Te dominated or Ne dominated. If I'm sharing information, discussing impersonal details, I am A-ok and can keep talking about a subject for a while. If it eventually leads to personal info and we both agree on whatever it is, then perfect, keep going. Talking about the mechanics of how something works (Te), perfect!\n\nIn most personal conversations though, my brain is so focused on all the possible unpleasant conversation threads (Ne) that I'm just waiting for a way out of the conversation. So like you said, voicing an opinion that I have no evidence that the other person will agree with, I don't bother because then I have to find words to explain it to them (Fi) and the words that I use to understand it (Si) often have much more different meanings than the other person and I just know they'll misunderstand, misconstrue, or misjudge. It reminds me of a time an offline friend asked me what polyamory meant and I just... never answered it. Why go through with that possibility when they can just stop talking and leave me alone?\n\nI just stick to conversing online because if someone doesn't like your opinion, you don't really ever have to see them again. Theres no fear of constant ridicule, possible physical threat, or anything like that. I mean there is, but with proper anonymity and multiple accounts and personas, you can have a bit more security in being able to speak your mind. Plus a higher likelihood of finding like-minded individuals.
5	How Do You Feel About ISTP's?	I am writing a book series and I want to gain some insight into my characters and how to show realistic relationships between them.\n\nMy leading female character is an ISTP and my leading male is an ISTJ. In the series they start out as 13 year olds, and they age several years as the series goes on. They have been best friends since they were 9, and since they are both quite isolated people they only hang out with each other (and they spend a large amount of their time together) unless they have a specific reason to be around others. These two are very close, and I want them to form a romantic relationship as the years go on.\n\nSo I have a few questions for you ISTJ's. Is this feasible? Do ISTP and ISTJ relationships, in general, work well? What are some unique interactions you have between the two personality types, some things that you specifically like or that bother you about ISTP's?\n\nI'm also posting this in the ISTP subreddit to get another perspective.\n\nAny information is appreciated and will help me out a lot. Thank you!
6	I think there will be a natural and unremitting level of conflict in their relationship, but it can work if the pair feels a true sense of loyalty to, or involvement with, each other -- and could probably be a very entertaining and realistic kind of situation for a book if written well! I will try to answer your question (and will go on a bit because I like to, but I also hope it is of use). Starting with how I see a compare/contrast of the two, my own experiences with an ISTP friend, and then a couple of links you might find interesting (and that I will then go peek at to see if they agree with anything I've written :P).\n\n**ISTJs**\n\nThere are some major conflicts between the two -- that ISTJ leads with an introverted sensation, which provides a sense of conceptualizing and integrating the environment into diagrams and ideal forms, but that does not necessarily do well with the immediacy and change in a brand new environment that is all happening at once. The ISTJ may act very well and expertly in an environment that it has conceptualized into sensory (or parasensory -- in the way that a sense of cohesion in an idea can have a sort of sensory impact) variables... but the ISTJ may be reluctant to take a lot of quick or sudden action, especially if the outcomes are less predictable.\n\nHowever, in logic, which supplements Si, the ISTJ will be much more immediate, experimental, and will be far less reliant on having expertise, cohesion, or well-defined variables for the logical systems, and logical relationships that they employ in order to bring about whatever ends they wish to see in the world. In my case, I will read about GTD one day, then mind mapping the next, and apply each incompletely and haphazardly as they suit me. I don't come across as incomplete or haphazard because the environment around me (including an enviornment of ideas) is carefully sculpted and streamlined. But my actions within it are based on the logical connections between what I do and the outcome I want, and they are whatever seems to suit that moment, whatever does the job well enough, and to the extent that my other functions are working well I think this is fine, even if it wouldn't suit a Ti user.\n\n**ISTPs**\n\nYou'll have the inverse in the ISTP -- they will be interested in mastering and streamlining the logical and causal relationships between one thing and another, one idea and its implications. I am not quite sure what this would feel like, not being an ISTP, of course. But I imagine that the actions of the ISTJ, if observed carefully enough and over time, might strike the ISTP as ill-planned and illogical. Likewise, the ISTP supplements Ti with Se -- as long as the ISTP has a sense of the principles of their behavior, and what sensibly follows from one to the next, and how things should be chained together to make sense and order, they may feel quite competent in dealing with any situation that they find themselves in because those principles and judgments can be applied to whatever variables are in the immediate environment. They will be much more inclined to immediate and skillful action, even in areas that are relatively less familiar to them. (Especially as compared to the ISTJ, I would guess.)\n\n**Conflicts**\n\nImplied in this, but also directly based on one leading with Si and one leading with Ti, there will be a tendency in both to conceptualize before engaging, but one will conceptualize the environment (to the point of absurdity and gross inefficiency to the mind of the ISTP, I would suspect) and the other will conceptualize the judgments made (to the point of fussiness and delay in the mind of the ISTJ, I think). And one will apply systems and rules as they need to, to serve whatever purpose they want, whether it is keeping extremely detailed accounts of their finances, or creating only rough flowcharts of another process (in a manner that may strike the ISTP as ill-planned and careless and stupid), whereas the other will take action as they need to, to serve whatever sense they want, whether it is skydiving or a deep devotion to some sort of sport (in a manner that may strike the ISTJ as terrifying and insane).\n\nIn other words, one judges quickly and in an adaptable manner, but acts and shapes in an intentional, hesitant, slow to act way -- but well-formed, sturdy, skillful, and adept once the action/shaping is completed; the other acts quickly and in an adaptable manner, but judges and reasons in an intentional, hesitant, slow to conclude way -- but well-formed, adept, and strongly held once the logic is completed. If both are at the height of skill, and have overcome the greatest weaknesses or shortcomings in their personality, I argue they'd look very similar -- the ISTJ would have models of the world that allow them to act quickly, and would understand the world so well their logic (even applied without as much care) would be appropriate, and the ISTP would have principles of logic that would allow them to judge actions and opportunities quickly, and they would so well formed that their actions (even if quick and not in relation to the principles of the object) would be chosen well and effective.\n\n**Getting Along & My Experiences**\n\nI think that both -- especially with some distance from each other -- will be able to appreciate the pragmatic success and logic-over-feelings approach of the other, but may find interaction rather uncomfortable if they're both aiming at the same goals and purposes. I think as long as they both have their own separate spheres, they may be very impressed with the success of the other in the respective sphere... but they probably won't tolerate each other's weaknesses as well.\n\nFor my part, as an ISTJ who was very social anxious for a long time, I had an ISTP friend in high school who was, in some ways, my closest friend. We got along well most of the time, had good conversation, enjoyed each other's company. She did want to hang out far more often that I did, and was just a nexus of never-ending energy. And still is -- she is the sort of person who wants to do a thing, dives in even though she isn't great at it to begin with, then gets good at it because she is doing it, and then moves on to another thing and does that too, and just repeats ad nauseum and I just stare at her (metaphorically), feeling vaguely alarmed and overwhelmed just thinking about it. But very impressed too! In some ways, I can see that her actions and her approaches have a sense to them that I can immediately admire and recognize as valuable, but that I am entirely unable to replicate. It just simply is not in my nature to perceive and act in the world in quite that way.\n\nAt the same times, there were some pointed areas of conflict. So, for instance, as a judging type (in the sense that her lead approach to the world involves coming to judgments about it), there were many times when she struck me as uncharitable and self-important, or uncomfortable and judgmental, or even terrifyingly hostile and emotionally violent. A *lot* of this is from how I feel about emotional logic, and it being applied at and to people against their will (I find Socionics descriptions of Fe as a vulnerable and painful function for ISTJs to be accurate to my own feelings). So for instance, I once heard someone tell some kind of ridiculous joke (along the lines of "oh, why is there braille on drive through ATMs?" that I took to be a "ha ha, isn't that silly?" and she just was not amused in the least and was like, "duh, they make one standard ATM and put it everywhere, they don't make drive-through specific ATMs you idiot." Not in those words, but that was the tone, and I don't remember the words as being any more tactful). That struck me as uncalled for. \n\nOther times, I have talked to her about how overwhelmed I have felt about a situation I am in, and I can get this sense of kind of cold, frustrated, edgy, tense irritation from her, as if she wants to shout, "Just *do* something, *do a thing,* it isn't that hard, holy shit, like *do something* or shut the fuck up!" (Exaggerated to capture the tone -- it was much more this color, but in a subtler shade, but it was unmistakable and quite understandable too. Not that that made me any more capable of just taking action -- I literally cannot wrap my head around how to do so -- but I can see why she would be frustrated hearing me talk about a situation that to her, seems obvious and easy to handle.)\n\nAnd a final example, I once made a casual joke along the lines of poking fun at why she would do something (which was meant entirely as a tongue in cheek, bantering kind of joke) and holy crap that backfired. Maybe I accidentally poked her vulnerable Ne (which is an area where she would theoretically feel more vulnerable, ill-at-ease, and easily upset by), but she reacted with such an angry and hostile response that I was shocked. I had no idea why she reacted that way, but her response was so sarcastic, caustic, and punishing that I remember raging at her, which is something I generally don't allow myself to do. It felt scandalizing and brutal. (Though in reality, I think to someone who doesn't have such a vulnerable relationship to that kind of immediate interpersonal/sentimental judgment that Fe represents, it would have been a reasonably benign and expected kind of conflict.)\n\n*(continued...)*
1	They work well by experience, I get annoyed by the Istp I know because he takes too long to explain something that could be said in a few sentences. We also don't talk a lot.
2	Examples of Introverted Extroverted relationships	Hi, everyone!!\nSo, although I always read about mbti talking about the matches for istj being a extroverted, I Was wondering what others think of that. Do you have/had a relationship with an extrovert? What are your opinions about this? Thank you for the answers.
1	I have... but they were short lived. My longest/happiest relationships were with fellow introverts.
1	My wife is an E(S/N)FP. It has worked out well so far. I feel like the differences between us provide a great balance. She brings me out of my introverted shell, and I help with getting her head out of the clouds when needed.
1	My husband is an ENTJ. \n\nAlthough, he does have some social anxiety, so it's not like he's always itching to be out and around people. Also because he's goal oriented or focused on accomplishments, socializing can tend to fall by the wayside for the sake of reaching a personal or professional milestone. \n\nI think it works out well. He does tend to take control of social situations and command the attention, and that's usually fine for me. I can rely on him for conversation starters and keeping things moving and I contribute when I see a need or an opening. \n\nI really don't think I would want an introvert as a partner. I'm afraid that would lead us to rotting away by our lonesome in our house. Although it takes a lot of energy, it's really good to have someone in my life to push me into social situations. 
1	I'm married to an ENTJ. It was a huge challenge until we both started to understand what it means to be introvert/extravert. \n\nIt's still difficult, but at least we now have a common understanding that we can work from. \n\nIn my marriage vows, I told him that I love how he pushes me off life's little ledges (because I'm too apt to stay in my own bubble), and I still think that's what I love best about him. \n\nI'm a big proponent of being with a partner that makes up for my own shortcomings (ie opposites attract).
1	My wife is an ESTJ. It works out well. We enjoy the same kind of structure but she can deal more with people than I can and I don't have to feel like I am in charge of everything.\n\nI dated an introvert in high school and it got tiring making all of the decisions and coming up with ideas of what to do on dates. Plus she would hold stuff inside for months before telling me if there was an issue and I'd have to guess when she was upset or uncomfortable. No bueno.
1	My fiance is ENFP. He's more gregarious than I am. He's the sort of person who'll happily chat to anyone, but when we're out for the evening he knows not to invite random people over to sit with us (e.g. at a bar) as he knows I'm all about space and boundaries. I'll smile, nod and make a bit of small talk but that's where it ends. I'm not shy, I'm just not much of a people person. :-D
3	Opinions of INFPs?	Hi everyone! \n\nI was wondering what ISTJs think of INFPs? \n\n\nPlease share any experiences - both good and bad! \n\n\nI have an ISTJ father and cousin and you guys are fascinating! \n\n\nThanks in advance! 
6	Tendency to be insecure, seeks acknowledgement  from others constantly. Becomes annoying.
2	I had an infp coworker. We got along really well. She and I were able to converse at a deeper level rather than superficial. She was really nice too. I probably pissed her off with my sarcasm at times though. 
2	Several of my close friends are XNFP types and I adore them. Your type is so kind and genuine and contrasts my sort of cold mechanical self, but in a really great way. 
2	I have an INFP friend, I consider her to be a beautiful person and a great friend. I really like her apparent randomness, curiosity and imagination just as much as being able to discuss a serious topic. 
2	Isfp or Isfj	Which one would be better for a female istj and why. Another question, are isfp and isfj  guys really as emotional as people say? Or they're just nurturer and people talk too muchm
2	My husband is an ISFP and I'm a female ISTJ and he's not emotional at all.  Where I see black and white and have little compassion, he see's the grey and can explain to me sometimes that I need to have some empathy.  He's very even headed though, he never raises his voice, gets upset, or sad really.  I don't really know a lot about ISFJ or any of the other types.
1	I dated an isfj and he was super nice. We got along really well because he understood and helped me discover what was best for me. He was there when I needed him and knew how to talk to me 
14	Weekly Thread: What is your happiest memory?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: What is one of your happiest or most favourite memories that you like to look back fondly upon?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
4	My happiest memory that I can remember is the day when it dawned on me that I hadn't considered suicide in over 6 months. I clearly don't have a very good memory but still something none the less.
4	I always forget my happy memories.
3	When I met the love of my life! He's int/fj. Sweestest and most understanding person I've ever met. 
2	Happiest memory would have to be when I took my brother to a live event. We're both wrestling fans, got back into it a few years ago and try to go to shows whenever possible. I remember getting tickets for a show that came to our town, got them and he was ecstatic. He was super happy, which made me happy. 
2	My happiest memory is when I took my ex on a trip, and we spent a week at a bed and breakfast just enjoying each others company, and I asked her to marry me afterwards when we got back. It was lovely.
2	It freaking sucks tbh
2	I have trouble finding happy memories... they just don't stand out enough or are surrounded by not so good memories. But I guess that one of the best memories I have, is receiving a gift from a very good friend of mine for my birthday... it was totally unexpected and very meaningful. 
2	ISTJ females, little Help please	Hi, everyone! \nI'm really curious about how would it be a relationship between a istj female and a male: isfp, isfj, and a intp. I know this are different types, but I would like to know how the two of them would work - mainly in the emotional side.Thanks for the answers

2	ISTJ with an ESFJ; sometimes I think that I am doing him wrong emotionally.  I just don't connect that way, and I worry that he suffers for it. He insists that he is fine, but I realize that my super-logical non-emotional way of being can be hard for "F" people to deal with. I try (it's awkward) to be more emotionally connected through greeting cards and odd moments. My connection with him is strong to me... I just don't know if he gets how much I care.
2	Dated an isfj and INTP. Enjoyed my time with isfj because he was supportive and enjoyed spending time with him. Wanted to share this with me and helped me open my mind. As for the INTP, terrible person, didn't care for my emotions or needs. When I got upset he would just tell me I'm too emotional and leave the room while I sat in a corner crying. He wouldn't be supportive of any of my choices and always wanted to convince me that I was wrong in my life choices or any conversations we're having. He was selfish 
0	Thoughts about this pairing	Male Infj and Female Istj, how this relationship would work? 
7	In my view, MBTI is best used to understand and work well with differences in information processing - not to predict how a relationship would work in any broad overall way.\n\nThat said, I was tagged in /u/Doctorfeelbetter 's comment. I am an INFJ in a relationship with an ISTJ. (For accuracy, though, we're not the specific gender combination you're looking at - we're both women.)\n\nIf you have any specific examples or questions from your experience that you can share and that you think I might be able to help with, I'm up for trying.
1	According to socionics, the functions resist one another- sharing hardly anything in common. This results mystery (one another enigmas), miscommunication, confusion, and conflict. Socionics suggested there is a push pull effect almost impossible to harmonize.\n\nThe Mbti pairing has little to contribute but afaik they tend to clash again with similar issues. Theoretically a poor pair.\n\nIn practical application it has been shown through a lot of istjs and infjs on different forums to be a common pair for the two despite being so different. This appears to be more of a longterm, lifelong bond if they can ever get past the initial stages of attraction. I have a few istj friends, though they're female. We clearly don't get one another but they're easily some of my tightest and longest friendships. It's really weird. I was involved with an ISTJ, same thing- just a really strong bond.\n\n/u/TK4442 knows more
9	Gay ISTJs	Gay ISTJ male here. Is it common for us to not really feel the need to "come out" even though it's like an elephant in the room and everyone knows? Any insight would be appreciated.
17	Not gay, but I'm very private and don't really discuss my sex/love life with others much.  \n\nSome people (I.e. Extroverts) might say you should be 'out and proud', but I think people like us would rather keep that side of their lives private and it's nothing to do with being ashamed or scared.
2	I'm not really sure but it seems like you would have to come out eventually right? You wouldn't be able to live your whole life as a secret gay. How would you find a partner?
2	I usually come out out of necessity, like I'll want to tell a story about my girlfriend or something so it just comes up naturally sooner or later. I don't really make a big deal of it since almost everyone I work with and nearly all of my friends are liberals or at least socially liberal. Can't say they're ever really surprised anyway, since I'm pretty butchy looking
2	I'm bisexual myself and I fully feel like this. The only person I told about this is a chick on college I really like. Too bad she already has a boyfriend. :|
2	I'm a gay ISTJ who is out.\n\nHi! 
1	Gay and still in the closet but only with my family. They're super open but I don't feel the need to talk about my romantic life with them. 
5	Best Introverted Matches	Hi,  everyone,  this is my first post and I would like your opinions about something. I know the MBTI personality type suggests that extroverted are the best match for an istj, but, I personally prefer introverts. What matches do you think would be better for a female istj and why. I'm sarcastic, always late, and although I not good with feelings and the whole " I love you " thing, I think I would really apreciate a caring and loving guy ( but not too emotional of course =) ) Thanks for the answers. 
6	I'm a female INTJ and my husband is a male ISTJ. I can't imagine him being with an extrovert because as social and amiable as he is, he needs his downtime and wouldn't want me to always be dragging him out to events and such. \n\nI *am* his downtime.\n\nGranted I realize extroversion isn't really about needing to spend time with people, but the communication style and so on... I really don't think he'd be as happy with an extrovert. \n\nWe've been happy together for 15ish years because we make a great team and we are best friends. As a team we really can get a lot done because he's good at sticking to longer term plans and keeping my plans realistic. And he appreciates the effort I put into planning as well. I'm a lot better at the huge one-time effort to get things started so together we're pretty much unstoppable. 
1	A single, male intj ;)\n\nHaha, but on a serious note, everything all depends. Can the two introverts communicate healthily? If so, things would work out smoothly.\n\nI found that relationships with blunt and forward extroverts work better for me. We get down to brass tax, and move on. But everyone's different.
1	I'm istj and my boyfriend is intj. Works great!
4	How does everyone feel about ESTJs in their work place?	Ive been having some issues at work that keep bugging me. The woman is an ESTJ and shes so obnoxious. I generally only have to deal with this person via email but talking to her is a nightmare. Ill be directly telling her something and she'll go off in a tangent about something else that she assumes im talking about, even when i correct her, she doesnt listen.\n\n We had an incident were i was taught to enter data a certain way, the same way it has been done by many of our other stores for years, but at the meeting yesterday she got the protocol changed just because 'her store doesnt do it that way' and she made me look like a complete idiot in front of the other managers.\n\nShe makes me so angry.\n\nI thought maybe other could share stories of their ESTJ coworkers\n\nEdit: actually i think shes more of an ESTP tbh
4	I work with an ESTJ. She and I tend to think quite similarly about things, particularly in relation to the "best" or "correct" way to do things, although between the two of us I am usually better at letting things go. She rarely bothers me, but I hear all the time from others about how annoying she is and "bitchy". \n\nIf it helps to imagine it, picture our (ISTJ) sense of self righteous morals, but with an extroverted need to interact with people. IMO our introversion helps us to avoid being accused of this. We are instead accused of being cold and distant. 
3	Like you edited, stereotypes so present in the mbti community can make us mistype people simply by their position in the work place.
3	I'd agree with the comments below.\n\nStuff that supports STJ -- I relate to tangents, and do that because I know that if you don't understand a topic, you might not know what you don't know (so you sure as heck won't know to ask). So I mention it just in case. Some get overwhelmed, some like it -- hopefully they all at least have an appreciation for, "These are conventions, but each thing I tell you could be more complicated if we wanted to get into it more." I also don't want to assume they know X if that is required to understand my explanation, so I will err on the side of caution to make sure we're on the same page from the start.\n\nBut at the same time, if I can convince a student to give me feedback and redirect me, I really appreciate that. I know I am not what every student needs. (No teacher is.) I really appreciate when the student both trusts me enough, and is assertive enough, to say, "Actually no -- this is more my question before you go into that 10 minute thing." And I'll almost always change directions. \n\nSo not to say she is or isn't an ESTJ (the tangent thing could be, depending on what it sounded like, the refusing to respond to feedback could be non-ESTJ because it is not really consistent with Te's practicality... or could be unhealthy ESTJ who is so insecure or things are going so unwell that they've locked down and become rigid in their major functions).\n\nBut it is so hard to answer this question because people misunderstand STJs so much, and then write limited things about them, and then other people re-write the same dumb things in new words, and pretty soon "everyone knows" STJs are unimaginative, pedantic, small-minded NTJs. (In other words -- this is a pet issue of mine -- not anything you did wrong, but something that makes it hard to know how to answer this because unless you're an STJ, into Socionics (vs. MBTI), or just really really complete in your studies, you are really unlikely to mean what *I* mean when I say ESTJ, because how and why would you? It's a "information out there is not as good" thing so now I am triggered to talk about it," not a "I know your username and I think you personally don't know this" issue. So apologies if this is all unnecessary. :o I see you are an ISTJ too -- so you might know all this -- though it is also possible to internalize some of the bad stuff too, in a tiny, less impactful microcosm of any less-well-treated subgroup of a system.)\n\nI can see how we might be seen as stereotypes from the outside -- and the only problem is that it doesn't say what we feel on the inside or why we don't feel that we are pedantic, and why our view is defensible. So without that, people aren't able to tell when they're looking at a healthy ESTJ, or an unhealthy version of another type. So I am sure I come off as rambly and pedantic to some people, at some times -- but to me, the world is so complicated, and if you don't realize X is complicated, you won't know you don't know so I will tell you even if you don't ask. Because you can't ask about something you don't know you need to ask about. (That is my rationale for tangents.)\n\nAnd others seem careless sometimes -- and even if it doesn't matter *the most ever*, each pedantic detail adds up. You (in the general sense, not specific you) assuming that your friend is straight may be okay most of the time. But sometimes it isn't. And pointing out that it isn't isn't a shaming campaign, or an attempt to be nitpicky -- it is an attempt to point out something that actually matters for reasons that I can go into... And it's just really an FYI. It's meant to be friendly/informative, but I think people misread that stuff because in an attempt to make sure we're on the same page, I start by rehashing what I am confident you'll mostly know (so it seems condescending or scolding or moralizing). \n\nI need to learn to adjust better to what is most relevant -- but descriptions that don't take into account my reasoning will often mistake me when I'm healthy for being an INTP, and can mistake an unhealthy INTP for an ISTJ. Because both are pedantic (one about the environment and variables, one about the logical principles and conclusions -- but the difference can be really subtle if both are smart and experienced and flexible enough). But mistyping goes up when you have an ISTJ description that is unrelatable (i.e., "From the outside, they're like... well, your super-reliable but really boring uncle that you don't want to ask questions or you'll never get away") and an INTP description that is relatable (i.e., "INTPs worry about understanding the essence of things -- and this means they can sometimes get lost in details, but they do so for good reasons, and when they do a good job, they can be really wise and tell you all the really good important stuff!"). Neither is wrong, but they're unbalanced and incomplete.\n\n---\n\nThis is literally almost all I can think whenever anyone opines about STJs -- especially ESTJs because being extroverts, they get labelled as obnoxious more. One of the people I work with is a female ExTJ (I think ESTJ -- not positive though. Definite Te-dom though) -- and she gets so much negative attention because she is less with the stereotypical feminine social role stuff (i.e., Fe or Fi -- which is more valued partly depends on social class, region, and the subcultures you hang with). \n\nShe (like I, except MORE because of that Te-dom lead, vs Te that comes out when I feel safe or bold), is blunt, matter of fact, and when she teases or jokes, she does it more deadpan than with all the nonverbals or subtlety that helps Fx advertise "This is a joke in the context of our relationship which is going well!" I like it. It is like finding someone who speaks my exact dialect, or who has the exact same favorite obscure TV show, etc. To some others, she seems rude and arrogant which honestly is partly because women are held to higher social standards in some of those ways. She's actually gotten feedback from supervisors to be more submissive, essentially, which is a load of BS. At the most superficial level, some ESTJs will fit the worst stereotypes -- but so will unhealthy examples of other types if the behaviors are too broad. \n\nAnd the ESTJ coworker -- when she is in a terrible mood, sometimes she is very matter-of-fact cranky -- but she is also so open and blunt and not putting on pretenses that it didn't take me long to see the pattern. "When cranky, she acts cranky, and there are zero hard feelings between us. She isn't pretending to be okay so that I don't feel like she isn't okay *with me* -- and (phrased in a judgy slightly unfair way) as an adult I can figure out that if she is frowning at her computer and then she answers my quick question in a flat tone of voice, it is a reflection of her general mood at the computer. And if I am ever not sure, I can say, "Sorry, you look busy" and immediately get accurate, no-bullshit feedback. "Yeah, I am just in a hurry" => "You did interrupt, no worries, please don't more right now." Or, "No, I am just mad at this" => "You are totally cool, you did not interrupt, I am just not in a cheerful mood at this precise moment." So much simpler for me. I LOVE the absence of bs. A lot of female socialization is *not* bs... but it *is* "confusing shit I have NO IDEA how to interpret, communicate, etc., and have no desire to... and so it feels like BS because I am expected to know it because of stuff that is not perfectly related to it. (Summary: "Life isn't fair and sometimes I am less than happy about it!" :)) \n\nLike girls would love me if I was a guy (with all that I know now) cause I could do what communicates caring in the less-than-perfect way they expect from men. As a woman, I'm that weird chick that is kind of awkward and painful to interact with and who never seems to compliment and engage on social stuff in the way that all women everywhere know is the standard rules for politeness and signalling friendliness, etc. (Sulking officially over.) Summary -- being an STJ woman in some cultures and places is a pain in the ass. I like STJ women, and I would be 0% surprised if a lot of people didn't appreciate them as much. Not meant as a comment at all on your person and whether they are or aren't though -- I could see either way!
1	I think they're very  bossy and obnoxious but if you get to know them then they will probably change around you.
1	I had similar struggles with an ESTJ woman at my work. I tolerated her for a long time just to be nice and avoid a confrontation.   She eventually forced my hand - I had to call her out on something she did and she looked absolutely foolish- and since then she's left me alone and only talks to me when absolutely necessary.  I think when they are put in their place they back off.  
7	what's your height and weight?	Can you please answer that question in [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/PQQOrIHHCAQoyBM63)\n\nWill share the result afterwards.\n\nThanks you
18	The fun thing about stats is you can pull correlations out of thin air.
2	👍
1	Remind Me 2days 
1	Aww, it's closed :( anyway, 114 lbs (52 kilograms) and 5'6" (168 cm). I'm an 18 year old guy by the way.
5	What's your favorite and/or most memorable gift you've ever gotten?	I'm asking because it's my ISTJ grandma's birthday and she's hard to get gifts for. \n\n\nPotentially relevant factors:\n\n\n* She's very wealthy so she already has "everything"\n\n\n* Her husband died 4 years ago and she's still not over it and probably never will be. She cries at every family gathering whereas previously no one had ever seen her cry.\n\n\n\n* She thinks about her legacy a lot and does not recognize how appreciated she is, and this makes her sad.
6	I think some small detail you remember about her that she may think you may not have caught...Doesn't have to be expensive and make it personal. Also if you make her somethi ng with genuine care and touch she would think it's awesome.
3	A couple of years ago, one of my friends emailed a bunch of people I'm close to and asked them to list three things they appreciate about me. She then wrote each comment out on a slip of nice paper and placed them all in a small glass jar. She gave the jar to me on my birthday. I really treasured the gift because my friends' words meant a lot to me and I could go back and read though them if I was ever feeling discouraged. Probably my favorite gift I've ever received 
3	Get her whole family together, kids, grandkids, and great grandkids, and get family pictures made.  Either go to a studio or hire a photographer.  She'll love having the memories of having everyone around her for a day and then she'll have a picture of her family too.  And it will be good for everyone in the family to have a nice picture with grandma after she's passed on.  My grandma loves pictures and picture frames.  It's what I try and get her once a year on her birthday or Christmas.
1	According to economists, the most effective gift is money. If you want to give something more personalized, you could give her a gift card that promotes an experience that she wouldn't normally do herself but would like, such as a dinner out with family at a great restaurant.
4	For the ISTJs who are parents: What do you think about your children?	Ello!  Curious INFJ here.  The title says it all.\n\nIf you're a parent, what do you think about your child/children, *honestly*?  Do you get along with them?  Do you get along with only one child and struggle with the others, or get along with almost all of them except one?  Have you typed them MBTI-wise, and if you have, do you think different/similar functions play a part in your parent-child dynamic?\n\nand if you're not a parent (*edit: dammit the title seems to imply I only want to hear from parents, whoops), I'd love to hear speculation on what kind of personality you'd like in your theoretical child, and what traits you'd feel uneasy with.  Thank you!
5	New dad here. I think she's great! It sort of feels like I'm a Star Fleet captain and this new weird little alien has appeared on my ship. Now she's part of the years long mission with us. I do my best to understand her and keep her alive and see what secrets she'll reveal to us. 
3	No kids yet,  but I've always wanted them.  It'd be great if they were a little introverted like me,  but it'd also be great if they weren't like me so they could experience things I never felt a need to. Both of my parents and just about everyone else in my family are extroverts. I never really had anyone to share my interests with. Either way it changes nothing.  I'd still do anything for them whether I "got them" or not. 
2	I'm not a parent, but I'd like to have kids in the future. I wouldn't really care about their personality type I think; my parents are extroverted and introverted, respectively, and my sister is extroverted, but I get along very well with all of them.  \nAn introvert would be cool because we'd be similar, an extrovert would also be cool because they'd bring a change of pace.  \nI can't think of any traits I would or would not want them to have.
2	Not a parent, but want children. Always have. However, I'm waiting until I am in a steady relationship and financially stable. I'm pretty much okay with any personality type. However, I'd probably not know what to do with Ti, Fe, or Ni-doms. If I could choose, I think I'd want a Si, Se, or Te-dom. I'd also probably be okay with Fi-doms.\n\nFor those who wonder why ISTJ parents seem aloof or cold, consider this: we frequently show love in action or deed. While I am not a cuddly person, I am practicing so that when I do have children I will be cuddly. It's difficult, and sometimes my cat is reluctant.
2	My oldest is an extreme extrovert.  Our little skipping, singing ray of sunshine born to two introverted parents.\n\nI have to remember that she does things different that I do.  I try to compliment her on her enthusiasm as I tend to try to get her to quiet down more often than I should.  She is artistic and loves to be with her friends.  I keep her most recent masterpieces on the fridge or on the wall.\n\nI love teaching her things.  She's got an aptitude for mathematics so I definitely encourage that.  She's at the beginning of elementary school and I've already taught her about graphing, negative numbers, and functions, ie: f(x).  She already gasped the concept of variables as well.
4	Weekly Thread: How would you fix the American election process?	Welcome to our weekly thread! With the American election coming up on Tuesday, this week's topic is: What changes do you think need to be made to the American election process, if any?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like! This is the first time we're trying something political, so fingers crossed this goes well!
5	If the laws that are already in place would just be enforced and followed nothing would be wrong with the election process.  Only in a perfect ISTJ world would everyone follow the rules.  Pipe dream.
3	Presidential votes should be fully direct - every vote should count as A VOTE, no districts or electoral college or anything. Ballot should be preferential (candidates ranked). State governors should have the same setup.\n\nAs for congressional and state races with districts - first off, partisan gerrymandering must be eliminated. An independent panel should draw up discricts along the simplest lines possible, to keep municipalities and neighbourhoods coherent.\n\nA different form of selection, other than first-past-the-post, should also be implemented. There are many options to choose from and I would not want to impose one - an open process should be followed (probably at the state level) to select the best option.
3	Every electorate votes and that vote goes directly to a leader... None of this electoral college nonsense 
3	Have you considered preferential voting? It would allow you to increase the influence of third parties without immediately forcing the "establishment" to let go of the electoral college. \n\nAdditionally it might increase voter turnout since a third party vote isn't a waste anymore even in swing states.\n\nIt satisfies the desire of some people to vote for their perfect candidate but also the lesser of two evils as many see the major parties.
3	I'd prefer electoral votes to be tied to congressional district, and that districts are determined by computers on the basis of similarity to assist in representation. In my state,  the most liberal cities wash away from of the conservative countryside in big numbers. I am a liberal, so it's to my benefit... but it's not good representation, is it?
2	I don't think any single swift change could fix the election process for good, but some adaptations should definitely be made to better represent our current society and elect representatives that truly act as correspondents of the will of the people. The electoral party could definitely be replaced/augmented, and campaign rules should become far more strict. I don't know much more than that about the election process, but that's just my opinion.
2	Ranked Voting is the best option, that way it maximizes happiness by allowing you to vote for whoever you want in your order of preference, without worrying about who is voting for who because a certain candidate is unpopular and won't make the popular vote. That way if say your second best option, happened to be the popular vote, you don't feel guilty of choosing over your values and at the same time ensure that at least most of your ideals will be upheld by the candidate. This would eliminate the controversial electoral college and people can choose or not choose as many candidates they feel would align with their values. People would be more open to compromising instead of this stand-off of choosing the sole "righteous, and good" candidate versus the living embodiment of the anti-Christ or Hades or whatever god/no god you believe in. This can apply for simple votes for resturants choices to District elections to National conventions. Some would argue it would take more time, but happiness and satisfaction with your vote should come first.    \n TL;DR watch CGP Grey vid:https://youtu.be/3Y3jE3B8HsE
1	No more electoral college to start. 
24	Update: Feeling loved by my ISTJ	Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/5a0e6o/feeling_unloved_by_my_istj/\n\nFirst off, I just wanted to thank everyone who commented, I expected lots of negative but I never got any at all and I appreciate that, thank you for sharing advice and experiences, it helped a lot!\n\nSo, he found the post. Not a bad thing, I think. Maybe I just wasn't communicating properly because since this things have become much better, even if he doesn't feel like giving me attention he will now kindly say why instead of just brushing it off, which makes it easier to understand with no feeling of neglect. \n\nI was really worried for a while, reddit. I thought we had lost all feeling, but now I know that we haven't. I've started feeling this thing that's never really happened before; my default for receiving things is to share with him. I'm an ENFP, I love gifts, I usually take them all to myself. But now, every time someone gives me something minor, like chocolate or a game, I immediately give some to him as well (not in front of who gave it to me, that seems sort of rude) and let him experience it too. I think it's nice, I've never felt it before. \n\nHe's much more attentive now, I think he's starting to understand that sometimes I don't have a reason for being upset, so instead of getting frustrated and ignoring me he just asks if it's "one of those days?" to which I'll agree and then we have comfortable silence as I calm myself down. \n\nI miss him, reddit, we haven't had time to be alone together since August and that sometimes puts a strain on me, but now I feel like we can sit down and make plans together, instead of me asking over and over when I can see him. \n\nHe initiates small contact much more now, which I adore, and he's more receptive to me reaching out to him as well. I know now that instead of waiting for him to take my hand, I should just reach over and ask to take his instead. \n\nWe haven't had time to text when we aren't with each other, but it's easier to understand now, I barely even notice. It's not that we are ignoring each other, it's just so busy now.\n\nLong story short, I love him more than I'll ever know, and he loves me too.
1	I'm glad to hear things are working out for you :D
1	I don't know what to say... I'm glad it worked out for you two :)
1	Yay! Good for you two! And three cheers for clear open communication!
1	Had much the same struggles with my ISTJ, and we're in the same place as you guys now. It takes understanding, patience, and communication to make it work, but ISTJs are worth it. 
2	ISTJs: Whaddya think about Trump?	
49	I try not to.
10	I think he represents radical reform to a lot of people. Without touching on his policies, I think people want to see him tear things down from the inside out. Whether he'll actually be able to do that is another matter. He's not an idiot but I think he drank his own Kool Aid a long time ago, and we won't see him demonstrate any of the habits that made him successful previously. \n\nTL;DR: He's a wild charactature who people are looking to because he represents something new and different. 
8	He reminds me of the bully that stole my lunch money and then tries to come off as my best friend when he needs help for the final tests.\n\nHe might be less corrupt than Clinton but that's only because he's had fewer chances to accept bribes.
17	He's an idiot without values.\n
5	He's a douchebag. His views by themselves aren't worrisome, but the amount of people that think the way he does is shit disturbing.
3	Nope. Just nope.
10	I voted enthusiastically for him for reasons that I could probably only explain with a comment that would be waaaay too long, and those reasons are generally hated by reddit.
3	I voted for him in the primary, I voted for him in the general election, and I would vote for him again. When he first announced his campaign in June of last year, I was going through an extremely difficult time in my life; I was in the hospital for six weeks after a failed liver resection (I have liver cancer). I remember I was laying in my hospital bed, and I knew that this was the man I wanted to be my president.\n\nEdit: spelling
4	I think he's a great break from the political system we're used to. As an actual President? I don't think he'll be the best president, but I'd rather have him than Clinton. 
2	How much time do you have?
2	I can honestly say I did not vote for him, and the fact that he has zero political experience kinda scares me. But quite honestly, i'm not as scared/worried as the rest of the country. We literally have no idea what he's going to do- and all I can do is hope that the plans and ideas that he does have, are carried through to the best of his ability. I truly believe that even though his skills are lacking, that the man truly loves America. The only thing that really worries me is that people will become more hateful towards immigrants and people from different cultures because our Presidents thinks it's perfectly fine.....that alone worries me- I know **a lot** of people from different backgrounds. \n\n My wife had an anxiety attack when she found he was elected, and threw up. She's still not over it, and won't be over it for 4 (maybe 8) years. \n
2	I don't care about the election. 
1	I think that there's something to be said about the sheer number of people who voted for him despite all of the (what should be considered) dealbreakers that have to be explicitly accepted in order to do so.\n\nIt's RSX. There's racism ("Mexicans are rapists"), sexism ("Grab em by the pussy"), and xenophobia ("Ban all Muslims from entering the country"). \n\nThen there's his beliefs regarding climate change that will effectively doom humanity. The Trump administration will go past mere apathy, which was already unacceptable, and essentially race towards the doomsday scenario when the Earth's temperature increases so much that humanity can't survive the extreme climate. \n\nWalking back stop and frisk. The upcoming supreme court justice appointment, and all the (1-3?) others there will be as justices are so likely to die of old age during Trump's term ("reign," as he calls it).
1	He has no real political background, and his changes of stance on different issues makes me think that we have no real idea how he'll conduct himself in office. I don't like his attitude, his lack of respect, or his lack of consistency. I am especially concerned with the fact that every bigoted ass I know feels more comfortable expressing that part of themselves. 
1	i am really excited, from a political science standpoint, to see what can happen with a truly unified congress, president, and supreme court. \n\ni am extremely leftist and want universal income, healthcare, equality, etc. but i can't wait to see what the political system will look like extremely aligned and with no bureaucracy. 
1	As a woman of color I am more apprehensive of the support he gets from racists and sexists than him. But as an east coaster in a majority minority-populated urban county on the east coast, I do believe this election was won by rural whites. I feel like the democrats failed them by pandering to identity politics and the republicans failed them by pandering to the same corporations that disenfranchise these people. \n\nI always had a feeling that as a Sanders supporter, a lot of the anti-establishment rhetoric was shared in Trump. I'm hoping I can use these shared sentiments to create a bridge between us. I'm now trying to learn about their viewpoints and not see things as black and white. I'm just hoping I'm not trying to make friends with wolves.
1	Any of you guys into Nootropics or brain supplements?	For the sake of being/trying to be less of an ISTJ?\n\nIf so, which have worked for you? What have you guys tried? 
5	Why would you want to be less yourself? 
2	No, but I've thought about it. Not sure I ever will.
1	no
1	Yep - modafinil for over a year now. Love the mental boost it brings, it's perfect for long days of code. It's also a bit of an upper which is nice when you don't see a lot of sun (basement/winter).
1	No. I really don't understand any of that. 
24	Cold exterior?	Have you ever been told you have a cold exterior? Or look Mad/Serious all the time?
27	Yes.
13	People often say I look depressed or sad all the time.\n\nThe reality is that I'm only sad *most* of the time.
3	Story of my life
3	Absolutely true. It's also not often that people ever see I don't have a cold interior though...
2	That's probably why people don't come to me.
2	Yeah, I'm told occasionally that I look mad or serious when I'm really just neutral. Less often these days though. And people who actually get to know me properly never mention it (at least partly because I'm guaranteed to be more expressive around them), just strangers who think I care what they think and people who don't know me well.
2	All the time I've been told I have a very neutral expression, but I have also been told I have RBF. I'm okay with this. 
2	Yes, I keep my arms crossed in front of my chest while standing at parade rest.
2	I've been told that I have a "resting sad face" 
2	My boyfriend is an ISTJ. He is very socially awkward yet serious on the outside but once you get to know him enough he makes sure you're okay and really cares.
3	Yes\n\nAnd now years later as a dating coach. Learning how to smile more, or not have resting bitch/angry face = game changer. \n\nIf you hear something a few times. It means 1000s of people have thought it. But didn't have the balls to say anything about it. \n\n
1	I guess I'll be the outlier and say my iSTJ bf comes off like a big teddy bear or dog, not cold at all. I've seen many ISTJs with that cold/mad/serious exterior though. 
1	Quite a bit. Doesn't help that i'm quiet all the time and wear black. 
1	Not cold, but I am told I am very serious or somber looking most of the time. Not inaccurate.
5	Weekly Thread: What item would you use to create your horcrux so that no one would be able to destroy it?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: What item would you hide the piece of your soul in to create a horcrux in so that no one would ever find it?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
8	A grain of sand I throw into the lake.
6	a neutron star
5	Pardon me if I'm asking a stupid question, but what is a horcrux?
6	A Nokia phone from the 90's.
4	Hmmm.... how about a quark? That way, when the last piece of my soul is destroyed, at least it will be because humanity's technology had advanced, and by then, I'd probably be sick of being alive anyways. Either that or they are already splitting quarks and I'm out of the loop (again, on everything, always).
1	Don't horcruxes just weaken you because you're splitting your soul? Or does hitting 7 provide a boost again?
1	1. My personal hamster ball\n2. That's not how horcruxes work.
7	ISTJ's who use psychedelics, do you find you do it more for the knowledge rather than the fun?	I'm a ISTJ who has/does take psychedelics such as weed, lsd, magic mushrooms, 4-aco-dmt and ketamine (occasionally). I've only got this academic year to experiment with these substances due to my career, but so far I have enjoyed learning more about myself and the world around me. \n\nI am mostly doing it to learn more about myself and the world, not mainly for the fun of doing it. Anyone have any techniques of learning more about themselves they would like to share?
3	I was just talking about this with my roommate today. I would take most of the things you mentioned, but only in the right environment. I would be prepared for the experience and I would be sketched out by even a close friend offering nonchalantly. I would make sure that someone was available who was sober and had taken the drug before. Standard ISTJ over-planning. 
2	LSD is one of substances that bring out your inner demons and thoughts. My tactic: I fiercely researched harm reduction, including speaking to a number of people who are regular users. And thanks to all the exhaustive preparation, I feel I was able to get the most out of my experience. \n\nUnlike social hard drugs like ecstasy or mdma, LSD isn't really a social drug in my opinion, but rather it draws you mentally inward, allowing you to really reflect on your own memories, like your deepest thoughts and emotions. As an ISTJ, I deeply appreciated the experience. It allowed me to retreat even deeper into my psyche to see explore, question, even relive certain memories, almost as if I'm seeing my perspective in different light. (Of course, that may not make too much sense if you'd never done it lol)\n\nI also love the visuals, which is a big part of it. Call me crazy, but I feel these experiences have actually helped me in my line of work (I create a lot of powerpoint presentations for my job) and ever since I've tried LSD, I've been able to push the creativeness in my presentations (animations, transitions, new visual ways to describe electromagnetic induction). One time I swear I thought I saw the fourth dimensional structure of spacetime itself, and then wondered if figures like Einstein or Hawking dabbled in psychedelics.\n\nFinally, "set and setting" is crucial to a good/safe experince!! Sometime I'm really glad I researched before doing anything. It could mean the difference between a good trip and a bad trip. So far, I haven't had any bad trips. Preparation (including plenty of alone time set aside, if not using a trip sitting) is everything. I trip once a year, more than enough for me.\n\nHope that was helpful.
1	I typically will do most things once, if I don't think I did it justice I'll do it again. \n\nI don't seek out drugs at all but if something is going and I haven't done it before, I'll try it.\n\nSo, yeah, I just do it for curiosity's sake.
1	Just putting it out there; ISTJ's aren't going to be the type with any large amount of people breaking the law and taking illicit drugs. 
5	MBTI and video game preferences	I've been trying to map the MBTI to various video game preferences, particularly with the Jungian functions. Any thoughts on this?
8	I really like strategy games where you manage something, though I play them on the easiest mode... sort of like a sandbox. It's very relaxing. I also like design games, or anything where I can make decisions at my own time.\n\nBut The Sims is my favorite game ever. I like making their lives as perfect and happy as possible, but I struggle making it to the end of their lives when they die, so I usually play on epic mode and just restart before they pass.
3	I generally prefer nintendo games. Series like Mario, Zelda, Metroid, Animal Crossing, Xenoblade, Pokémon, etc. Anything else I play is usually recommended by friends, like Portal, Sonic, Ori and the Blind Forest, LoL, and Assassin's Creed.\n\nThe only game genre I've played and outright disliked was shooters, especially competitive shooters. I'm terrible at them, even if they're very different like Splatoon was. I'm up for trying just about anything else, though.
2	I like playing turn based strat, fps, tps and some games with good story
2	I lost many months of my life to Civ II, III, and IV.
1	I play almost exclusively simulators. This usually means DCS or BMS for flight simming, and Arma since it's a more realistic FPS. I love the knowledge and learning required to master such complex machines and procedures.
1	I like strategy games, currently playing CIV VI and Starcraft 2; I also really enjoy Hearthstone for the move - countermove aspect. In terms of other games, I like playing world of warships, something about driving a battleship is just *awesome.*
1	I enjoy point-and-click games (Monkey Island series, Grim Fandango, Ace Attorney), mostly because of the humour involved, and also the amount of thinking you need to do to solve things. I tend to stay away from RPGs (Persona 3 is an exception), FPS, and games that boast realistic graphics -- they're usually too serious for me to appreciate.
1	ISTJ. \n\nThe game I have played the most: World of Warcraft. I also really love puzzles, car racing games, and design games. 
1	I've always preferred games where you develop/level up characters (or cars or teams) over the long haul of the game. I like to see a character at level 50 with specific skills and know that I accomplished that. Some of my past favorites were: Final Fantasy XI, Midnight Club: DUB Edition, and NCAA Football playing it in Dynasty Mode.
1	Mostly RPG for me. I am usually not interested in any other genre of games.
1	I love games with morality choices. Especially if they are  very hard to pin which choice the right one is. I enjoy Skyrim a lot. I also like Smash Bros. I don't really like first person shooters. Although, I do enjoy GTA because I can just go ham on the cops. Open worlds are very high on my list.
1	Something about me really dislikes simulated violence. I feel like it's a waste of time to devote such energy just killing fake living things.
1	Nearly everything I play is Nintendo, both old and new. I also play Destiny and the Dark Souls series.
1	i love team/goal oriented online games. also games that are so unique in a way that there are people that analyze gameplay. also the world and the designs have to be perfect.\n\nmain games right now: overwatch and battlefield 1\n\nunique game of the decade: planetside 2
13	Do you guys also loath Halloween?	The dressing up/costume part. Never appealed to me. I think I'm too...myself? Idk. I feel ridiculous trying to dress up as any thing or one else.
7	I don't mind it. 
7	Honestly I really enjoy it, but mostly because it's a holiday that isn't "family oriented." Christmas, thanksgiving, birthdays; for me they all involve being with my family, which stresses me out to no end. I like Halloween cause it's a celebration to spend with friends. 
5	The parties/dressing up and insane amount of drinking, yes. The chilling at home and passing out candy with my wife, I don't mind. 
5	I never got into it. Not that is stupid but it's just not my thing. 
4	I dont really care about it, but I do hate the idea of dressing up, it is very annoying for me, haven't done it in years.
9	Yep, it seems stupid to me.
3	Halloween isn't a big thing outside the US. Here in Aus I live > 20km from the nearest town and unsurprisingly have never had people knock on my door for candy. I'm not bothered by any of it with the costumes and candy and parties but I can see how it could be draining.
3	Born into religious Southern Baptist family, I was never allowed to celebrate Halloween, and my friends came from the same type of families. Once I get more confident and take more control in my life I probably would dress up. The idea of giving out treats to neighborhood kids sounds adorable to me too. Always wanted to participate.
6	Yes, it is for children only and I hate that adults get so in to it. 
2	I really don't like being in costumes, like ever. I don't even really like being in anything that I didn't completely choose to wear myself.\n\nMakes me feel this pressure of having to explain why I am wearing what I am wearing as well.
2	I'm indifferent. All I do anyways is hand out candy and watch horror movies. However I kind of get pissed if teenagers come to the door with no costume or a really shitty costume.
2	Not an ISTJ but I hate Halloween.
2	OMG I feel like I'm the only one sometimes!\n\nI don't actually mind dressing up, but I LOATH playing a part. I think role playing is so cringy. I just cannot get on board. Even for a second. I HATE it. \n\nI think a theme and making decorations and costumes can be fun, but I don't want to act. I want to be ME in the costume. \n\nAlso, I hate handing out candy to trick or treaters. My husband loves it, so I make it his responsibility. I'm not sure why, but I just don't like the anticipation of people coming to my door and then having to pretend I like their wal-mart costumes. 
2	I personally don't much care for dressing up or going out, I just sit home and watch horror movies. I'll also hand out candy to kids, because children who are having fun doing that stuff should be allowed to enjoy their childhood to the greatest extent possible. I have on occasion taken my niece and nephews out because there was no one else. I'm happy to see kids happy, but I don't have anything I like for myself than just relaxing if possible.
1	I like the decorations and scary movies, but costumes and social activities are not really my thing. It's kind of like asking athletes for their signature, something that you should probably stop doing around the age of 13. 
1	I love Halloween. I have extremely fond memories (and some disappointing ones). I like the congenial atmosphere among family and friends. Giving out candy, dressing up, and decorating the house is fun. I've never had a party Halloween though.
1	I love the decorations, and will go to stores just to see what I can find but other then that, no. I don't like putting on costume makeup, masks, or wigs. I don't generally like the feeling of costume fabric. I will always pass on dressing up. \n\nMy boss said we could dress up for work today. I wore a scarf with spiders on it. 
10	Feeling unloved by my ISTJ?	We've been together for around 8 months, it will be our eighth month on Tuesday. I do love him, he's such a beautiful person and the first six months were beautiful and passionate but now we barely even have time for each other and it's showing.\n\nHe used to call me beautiful, gorgeous, ect. nearly every time he saw me. I haven't heard any terms of endearment in months.\n\nI'm the only one to touch him. I decided to experiment and not initiated contact for a day, we never made contact once. \n\nI am going through a depressive episode and he is always on his phone when I am trying to talk to him, he says it's a stress thing.\n\nHe is extremely stressed by school, he hasn't slept in days and his English teacher keeps piling essays on him, he is a perfectionist so they take twice as long for him, and I am trying to support him but it's hard to do when I don't get appreciated.\n\nDo any of you withdraw when you're stressed, maybe without realizing? I ask him if he's still attracted to me, loves me, ect. and he seems genuinely surprised that I'm asking, making me think he's unaware of how one-sided this has become.
7	ISTJ here (also used to date an ISTJ and faced similar problems)! I think what you are describing isn't atypical of our type. We tend to be very single-minded people and this can translate into being workaholics when something is occupying our minds. You mentioned that he is extremely stressed by school and hasn't been getting proper sleep, so that could very likely explain why he's been acting the way he has.\n\nI would recommend not taking your partner's lack of affection personally, however hurtful it may be, though I would advise you communicate your unhappiness to him in a way he would understand. ISTJs tend to struggle with emotional expression, and their need to focus on and excel at whatever work they have at hand may further frustrate their partners, who might feel neglected. Also, very importantly, ISTJs are very literal people; if you don't let him know how you feel, chances are he'd not pick that up himself. Finally, show tons of patience with him, initiate chats -- let him know you're there for him. All the best! xx 
3	What activities does he enjoy? Perhaps you could suggest doing something together that doesn't require too much planning, and have a little fun? I used to have the same problems, being way too stressed out to even care about others. Encourage him and in return he should be more grateful of your commitment. I understand that you too need to be shown appreciation but for an ISTJ such thing doesn't come out os easily even with our significant other. 
3	Most of my previous partners have become frustrated with my lack of affection, lack of displays of emotion, and overall affect of my analytical mindset on my ability to relate to others. I do understand that they start to feel distant from me. When I get stressed, I spend most of my energy managing the stress and I don't really feel like I have enough emotional energy to indulge others, but I do need to be taken care of, so if my SO does something practical for me, like makes dinner or does a chore I've been needing to do, the ice will start to melt and maybe I can become more comfortable opening up verbally and be able to get some things off my chest.\n\nWe are hard-won, but if you are patient, you know you will have won us.
2	I'm pretty sure it's an ISTJ thing, but I have a hard time showing emotions- affection, sympathy, etc. I love my wife, but i'm not always about holding hands in public, or making out in public (it's also just not classy in general)\n\nAnd when it comes to things like death/funerals, I have a really tough time showing emotion and/or sympathizing with the family of the deceased. It's not that i'm *not* sad, it's just that I typically keep the emotions I have inside, rather than showing them. I think that's a major ISTJ trait.
1	Just hug him. No warning, even if he is working, Just hug him. His reaction will tell you more than we ever could. Tell us his reaction.
9	So, how many of you ain't at a party today (or tomorrow)?	Just curious.
26	"YEA DUDE ME AND MY FRIENDS ARE TOTALLY WASTED RIGHT NOW AND BANGING HOT SLUTS AT CHAD'S HOUSE!"\n\nSaid^no^ISTJ^ever
3	I don't go to parties. I don't go out for Halloween.
5	No social interaction for me! Lol, just gonna stay in my room playing GTA all day.
1	Me xD
1	This guy ^^
1	Me :(
1	This one.
1	I'm not doing anything tonight. I just took an 8 hour long engineering licensing test today and I'm wiped. \n\nTomorrow I'm studying for another one of my licensing tests, and then going to a small Halloween party my friends are throwing. My other friends are bringing a costume for me to wear! Best part is, they're all introverts, and we throw the best parties ;)
1	Me :) I'm looking forward to spending the weekend in and catching up on some reading, maybe some horror films (I don't really do the Halloween thing but I feel like 'em right now).
1	Just gonna play video games and Skype my girlfriend. :) 
1	Working. But it's halfway an excuse not to do anything. 
1	Midterm on Monday.\n\n...but I still probably would stay home even if I had nothing to study for.
1	My friends called me yesterday with plans to party and I said ok but I don't really want to. Yesterday I took a day off everything,  even the gym. 
1	[deleted]
1	Schoolwork and focusing on my career are the most important things.\n \nI feel I don't have time to figure out a costume that I don't even want to be wearing to go to a party that I will only partially enjoy.
1	I had to work yesterday. Today is my wife's birthday, and we're just chilling watching Netflix- we out to eat earlier today, and to the mall. Tomorrow we're going to just hang out at home and pass out candy to kids.
1	My weekend was spent doing puzzles on the computer and binge watching Shameless. A perfect weekend :)
9	Weekly Thread: What's your ISTJ Superpower?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what part of your ISTJ personality are you grateful for? What's useful for you at work/school or something that your friends and family appreciate you for?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
16	Supreme Attention To Insignificant Minutiae!
10	Attention to detail. Not so much with people, but with troubleshooting electronics, cleaning, folding, presentations, etc.  
7	I usually remember everything, especially birthdays, and I'm very good at bar trivia.
5	If there is a problem in the numbers I will find it. 
7	That I stay calm and collected under pressure and logically think through problems. This helps a ton at work and in my dealings with friends and family. 
8	Sarcasm
2	Separating myself from the emotional aspect of a situation at work. Understanding emotion in practice, while balancing the situation logically. It really helps when managing people. Even better, it's a major asset when shit gets dramatic and you have to calm down your superior and diffuse a situation. 
1	[deleted]
6	To-do list or daily schedule?	Do you prefer a to-do list or a schedule of your daily tasks? I've been trying out both, and while a to-do list gives me more free time I get less things done because then I think "Oh, I can do that later." I guess I need clear parameters.
11	To-do list, because I can never stick to the schedule. Something always turns up. 
4	To-do lists are definitely much more efficient for me. The question I would have is why is the thing that you are saying "You can do that later" not on your list? Also, I think its good to have a dynamic list in case you come across things you didnt think about. So you would have something new to add, scan your list to see where it fits and do it then. I think most of the time it would either fit on my list in that exact point in time or I would need to table that item until a later list so I could think over the process required to get the task done.
1	To-do list because it's so much more efficient than keeping a schedule.
1	I use a mixture of both, but mainly a to-do-list. 
1	I use both in harmony. Omnifocus manages my list, and it allows me to "flag" tasks. I use flags during my evening ritual to see what I  want to accomplish the next day. 
1	I follow a continuous to-do list. I'll add things that are coming more recently, and then add things in the future (deadlines, events, etc.) then when I finished the more recent events, the new ones come up that I planned much in the future, then I add more, etc.
1	I use a minimal bullet journal, helps me with both 
1	I have a "loose" daily task list, and a to do list. \n\nI have certain tasks that I do everyday at certain times: Aka shower, breakfast, dinner. \n\nThe other available time generally ties into my to-do list. For instance: From 10am-11am, house chores. At this point I go off of my to-do list and prioritize what should be done first. \n\n2pm-4pm, computer time: This might involve things I need to do like log into work, research something, decide on a specific thing I have been wanting to buy, gaming, etc. \n
1	To-do list sounds like a good idea.
1	Schedule. My days are mostly one like the other.
1	Everyone! Try the [Bullet Journal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM)! (also, /r/bulletjournal)\n\nI love the idea to death. The guy who developed the system has made it perfectly bare-bones and no-frills for us, but it is also flexible and can be as fancy or as non-fancy as you would like. As I'm sure most of you can relate, I love planners and to-do lists and schedules and organization, and I feel like this little idea enriched my life.
1	I have a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly schedule. I use this for tasks which are repeated on a regular basis, and to make certain I clear up time for relaxation (which I can tend to neglect).\nIn addition, I have a weekly to-do list, which I augment by giving times/dates for each task. I find that giving deadlines to to-do lists helps make sure they get completed.
7	Gamers, what do you play?	With kids and a job, it's hard to dedicate just a ton of time to gaming. I used to play a fair amount of EVE Online, but stopped when I was just logging in to sit there and wait for something to happen. \n\nI've been playing Neverwinter for the past few weeks, but I'm getting a bit tired of the grind as no one I know plays. I do fire up Cities: Skylines here and there. \n\nJust curious as to what you all play.
5	FPS! Since I tend to keep my emotions to myself all the time, while I'm mowing down virtual enemies and getting score streaks I feel so relieved. It keeps rewarding you for playing and winning which is a good thing.\n\nIs that, or open world games like GTA. Where your character becomes an avatar of yourself.
4	Hearthstone, Minecraft, Civ 5, Heroes of the Storm, Dota 2, GTA V, Stardew Valley.
3	Recently, I've been playing (on PS4):\n\nGrand Theft Auto V (specifically online)\n\nFallout 4\n\nThe Crew\n\nI also fire up Just Cause 3 and Rocket League from time to time.\n\nI've also been playing Terraria on Vita, Pokemon Omega Ruby, Pokemon Go, and once it comes out, Pokemon Moon!
3	I play lots and lots of smite, along with factorio
3	World of Warcraft\n\nBanished\n\nCities: Skyline\n\nMinecraft\n\nSims 3
3	Right now I've mainly been playing overwatch. I also play some 3ds Pokemon games. Can't wait till sun and Moon!
3	RPGs are kinda my thing, that and strategy or simulation. love to get involve in the game and creating stories and characters of my own. Loved pillars of eternity, oblivion, lately getting into indie rpgs like stardust, the banner saga or armello.\nAs for online games, mobas and card games. not a fan of the online tbh
2	I've played World of Warcraft for 9 years. \n\nI also play Solitaire Blitz on Facebook, \nArk\nTown of Salem \nJust bought Fallout 4 since it's on sale.. Going to start that tonight! 
2	The Witcher, The Witcher 2, The Witcher 3, uhh... The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine...\n\nSeriously, though, I mostly play story-oriented games that make me feel like I'm living someone else's life. Games like Fallout and Elder Scrolls where you kind of make up your own story have their own little place in my heart, but I'll always love getting that personal, hand-crafted experience that true RPGs come with.\n\nI also like games that involve some kind of building or contraption-making, like Scrap Mechanic and Besiege. Typical competitive shooters don't interest me much, unless they have a unique element like Tribes Ascend does.
2	Currently: Hearthstone when I want something quick, Factorio, Stardew Valley, World of Warships, and in about 2.5 hours, Civilization 6
1	Final Fantasy XIV might be a good game for you to try.  It's a MMO, but you can jump in with a free month trial.  I have been playing this game exclusively for a couple years now.  You do not have to depend on others too much to feel like you are accomplishing stuff in game and when you do have to group up, it has a que system which will automatically find you a group.
1	Haven't played much recently but the Dark Souls series is one I can always come back to. The new DLC releasing soon may draw me back :3
1	CMANO, Hitman and R6 Seige.
1	Runescape, Sims 3, and sometimes my husband and I play 'Lego' games on the PS3 we have Lego HP Years 1-4, Avengers, and The Hobbit.  He bought Skyrim because he though I'd like it because of Runescape but it's like WOW I can't really do character POV games I have to see my character.
1	World of Warcraft and the sims 3
1	LOL.  Old timer here.  Never heard of most of the games you folks play.\n\nI mostly do word games and hidden objects.
1	For competitive multi-player: Overwatch, league of Legends \n\nFor solo chill: Banished, prison architect, stronghold crusaider 2, Sims, city: skylines\n\nFor story: this war of mine \n\n
1	Osu!, its a rythme game.
1	I like RPGs (including action RPGs), but I don't like anything grindy. I like the odd FPS too. I'm very attracted to story-driven games... But I always find myself wanting to fire up a lighthearted bloodbath rather than, say, Witcher 2.
1	Mainly racers (Forza 6, NASCAR), shooters (Division, Call of Duty) and RPGs (Fallout 4, Bioshock, Mass Effect)
1	Rocket League! Super fun to play and on all platforms. 5-7 minute matches means low commitment if you need to go do something.
1	Wildstar is a cool MMORPG; I really enjoy the graphics.
1	Right now? Mostly Overwatch, and any JRPGS by ATLUS really.
2	ESTP interested in an ISTJ girl	Hey y'all I'll try to keep this quick with enough information to give a fair and balanced overview of the situation\n\nSo the title explains itself. I'm a junior in college and I'm interested in this freshman girl whose in my professional fraternity. We had some interesting back and forth, where we both kind said "savage" things to each other and faux insults, but all in good fun. I thought she was cute and in to me because she texted me all the time! So I went on two lunch dates with her and we talked at one of our fraternity parties for some time. But then things got complicated at our latest party last weekend. I was playing it cool, we had a good time, she started grinding on me pretty hard. Then I got hella drunk and I don't remember much of the rest of the evening save for these snippets. \n\nOne, I asked her to come with me to Cookout the burger chain, I dont remember but I think she said no. I asked her to hang out with me the following day, she definitely said no. Then something something was said and then I remember "We're friend. We're buddies" or "We're just buddies" I don't recall but i'm not sure. I remember feeling rejected that evening and complaining about it so it may have been that. I don't really recall though. \n\nI was really embarassed the next day. But she texted me twice! Said I told her stuff. I asked her what. She just wrote "hahaha". \n\nThen I saw her at a chapter for our fraternity. It was awkward at first because I felt weird about the whole thing. But she wanted to play pool, eating dinner with me etc. Then after chapter she left and then came back and was waiting around. So I"m all like "I thought you left" and then she left with me. Followed me back to my place, past her place, like I mean she went out of her way to follow me. Then she gets weird, says "bye" awkwardly" and shoves me and then runs away. \n\nI invited her to lunch two days later and she agreed and that was today. We talked nicely and laughed and had a good time. But she left after like 30 minutes because she had "work to do" and had to go to the "chiropractor". \n\nSo I mean, the situation is pretty confusing and I hate to overthink. Of-course, I've received some of those "vibes" and also she always taking snapchats of me! Like literally during our lunch date she took three pictures of me! But I've been questioning the whole "Friends" comment at the party. Also, she said stuff like "That's how I treat my friends" and called me buddy twice during our lunch date. \n\nI don't know what this all means, but I'm wondering. Should I give up? I've heard ISTJ's are pretty direct with what they want and how they feel. So if she says we're just friends, should I take it at face value? Or is there something else going on? \n\nShould I pursue her? I definitely want to and I think taking my time would best suit my purposes. Playing this for the long haul. But if I've already been friend-zoned then what can you do? 
4	I think you should just ask her what happened since you don't recall much of anything.  If she doesn't want to tell you, then don't waste anymore time on her.  It sounds to me like you are in the friend zone and don't really have a hope in hell of getting out.  She should tell you as a friend though, what you said/did.  How do you know she's an ISTJ though when you barely know her?
2	My ISTJ SO in the beginning would say we were just "friends" even though we both knew we wanted a more meaningful relationship. It went on for a few months until he finally had the balls to initiate it. He would always deny wanting more but it was obvious.
2	Simple way to get an ISTJ... Just be upfront about it. Any questions, problems, just ask
1	All I have to say is that ISTJs are factual to a fault, so don't overthink the "friends" comment. \n\nIf she said you're friends, then she likely meant that in the exact moment she was asked, you are friends. And it was true! But it also doesn't says anything about her desires or intents. \n\nIt's just the facts, ma'am.

7	Hobbies/past times for ISTJ's	What are some hobbies/pastimes that you do or think would be suited to ISTJ's? Personally, I really enjoy weightlifting due to the straightforward process and I'm about to take up kick boxing; also suited to IDTJ personality I feel as you either aim to improve your technique, which is something that should be done a certain way that is clearly defined by your instructor, or you learn a series of movements to demonstrate your ability and achieve belts. Even during sparring, where you have to improvise and is less linear, there's an obvious and unambiguous way to win. I also intend on learning a language, I think Mandarin, as soon as I find a method of self teaching that I find sufficiently stricter :'D.
6	My go to hobbies include\n\n**Distance Running:** as far as I can tell, this is a pretty common one among ISTJ's. I think, for me, I like the simplicity of running and the fact that I can pretty much set my mind to autopilot. Also, if you get serious with it, there's loads of self-impovement / goal baased building that can happen.\n\n**Cooking:** Not sure that this has anything to do with personality. I like food; cooking let's me have good food on the chap; I like cooking. Usually, I'll listen to a podcast / music while cooking and I find it let's my mind rest a little.\n\n**Data Analysis:** This one is probably purely based on my interest in data science / data analysis. I'll grab a data set from some website and do some exploratory analysis on it with python or R. If I'm proud of the result, I'll post it to /r/dataisbeautiful.  \n\n**Other common hobbies for ISTJ's**: solitary physical exercise (weight lifting, individual sports, etc), computer games, wikipedia deep-dives, movie watching, \n\nRemember, MBTI, at it's best, can explain *tendency*, nothing more. If you're looking to pick up a new hobby, the best way is to think about what you want out of it / what your goals are. If you already have a hobby you enjoy, great, keep doing you. 
5	I enjoy working out, DIY projects, playing music, and cooking. All things where I can set goals, see improvements, and feel like my efforts have positive benefits for myself and others. 
3	I enjoy writing, playing videogames and reading. I like running but don't do it very often (or exercising at that, I should fix that) 
2	Lifting weights is a good one, strength training. Fighting is as well, if you are the nationalist type i recommend joining a political group so you can feel a sense of purpose which I found important.
1	Much of the same that's been posted: reading,  writing,  crafts,  cooking,  listening to music, gaming. Occasionally going outside.  Oh and this past summer I became obsessed with succulents,  so now I tend to some plants that I hopefully won't murder. 
1	Gardening, calligraphy, tea. And watching a lot of series and youtube.
1	I do a lot of crafts; paint, crochet, scrapbook.
1	My main hobbies:\n\nCooking, Maintaining aquariums (particularly planted aquariums), crocheting, scrapcbooking, sewing, reading, pc gaming, weight lifting, learning various computer languages 
1	I love fly fishing. 
1	Things I do most for hobbies are: Video games, collecting pokemon cards, youtubing (watching and uploading).\n\n\nVideo games: I have grown to like online games which are competitive like overwatch and League of Legends, I like competing and seeing self improvement. This don't always see improvement which depresses me lol\n\n
1	Hobbies: fishing, cooking/baking, trying new restaurants with friends, reading, binge watching certain shows, going to the zoo.
1	My hobbies: Playing guitar, doing anything outdoors, going to see movies, watching TV shows.
7	Weekly Thread: What fictional character do you most relate to?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: is there a fictional character from literature, movies, TV etc. that you relate to?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
6	I've always been fascinated by Data from Star Trek TNG. 
5	Mr. Darcy\n\nI'm female but... yeah. I have a tendency towards doing grandiose things to help people behind their backs. I tend to clam up when I'm upset but am worried I might be in the wrong. I like following societal rules of conduct, except where they interfere with my personal boundaries. \n\nI identify with that man completely. Too bad I'm not a man. I could just show up at some kind of Jane Austen convention and have all the ladies fawning over me. \n\nI'd be a really handsome man, too, if I do say so myself. 
5	Hank Hill.
5	To a certain extent, Mandy from 'The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy', and also Squidward.
4	Hermione Granger.
5	For the longest time, I wanted to be like Jay Pritchett from Modern Family: grumpy, principled, a tough shell but a soft interior. Over time I've come to accept that I'm actually more like Phil Dunfey. Goofy and caring and totally incompatible with what I idolized Jay for, but I wouldn't have it any other way 
4	Really a combination of eeyore, rabbit, and piglet.
3	Double D from Ed Edd n Eddy.
3	Mark Corrigan
3	Plankton, but without the evil and shortness
3	I really relate to Elend Venture from the first *Mistborn* trilogy (mostly pre his leadership course with Tindwyl), and Illya Kuryakin from Richie's take on *The Man From U.N.C.L.E.* (but with better coping strategies).

9	ISTJs and Guilt	Not an ISTJ, but all the ISTJs I have noticed feel guilt so easily. Less with people they aren't familiar with, but those who are very close. Is this Fi kicking in?
7	My ISTJ spouse is guilty of feeling guilty too much. In fact I'm pretty sure I've made him feel guilty for feeling guilty too much. \n\nIf I ask him if he can do something for me and he doesn't feel like it, he has a hard time saying no, no matter how casually I ask or how much I express that it's fine if he doesn't want to. Then if he does manage to say no, he often feels incredibly guilty about it and ends up doing the thing anyway. It's been at the point before where I've had to make it clear I've made other plans and he's not needed... but then he feels guilty that I made other plans. \n\nGetting rid of our car helped a lot because I don't ask for rides much. Actually I don't even go places much now that I'm staying home with the kid. So for that and probably some other reasons, I haven't run into this guilt issue for nearly a year now. But it was a big deal! \n\nI don't know if it's Fi kicking in. I'm an INTJ and should have the same issue if that's the case, and my guilt works in a very different way. \n\n"Guilt tripping" doesn't work on me *at all* and in fact I feel less guilty when someone pulls that on me, yet my husband is severely affected by it. Meanwhile I feel guilty and horrible about weird small incidents in the past where I compromised my values in some way. \n\nIf someone asked me for a ride and I said no, I'd usually not be bothered at all by it. The exception would be if I knew it was really important and they needed my assistance and would be compromising their wellbeing in some way by handling it themselves. In that case I would feel very sorry for not helping, and might in fact cancel my other plans so I could say yes instead of no after all. \n\nBut my husband really has an issue, and I think it stems from his "should" mindset, which most Guardian types (SJ) exhibit. Since I am his family, he "should" support me and drive me places and do things for me even if I can do them myself, therefore he "should" feel guilty if he refuses me. \n\nMeanwhile here I am shrugging my shoulders and taking the bus. No big deal. 
5	I'm ISTJ and I'd say I do feel guilt rather easily, but only when I'm doing something to a lesser standard than I believe I should be or not doing something I believe is right or my responsibility.\n\nThat being said, I have personal issues from having an addict parent and a codependent parent growing up that also causes me to take on responsibility and blame that doesn't belong to me. Deciphering between whether my guilt is healthy, or even mine to own, is a challenge I deal with daily.\n\nGuilt from past events can drive me mad, especially if I feel i handled something poorly. I have apologized to everyone I've wronged due to this, but still constantly give myself shit for doing whatever it was I did. This old guilt kind of sets the guidelines for how I live now and what is right/moral.\n\n
2	For myself, at least, it is all about the reasons for refusal. If you ask me to give you a ride and I just got into a bath, I won't feel *too* much guilt saying no, especially if you have perfectly viable alternatives. After all, the inconvenience to me of getting out, getting dressed, you waiting for me, and finally going to give you a ride would be pretty large, compared to you just going and getting a ride elsewhere. However, if I am not doing anything else really, and so just to avoid a tiny inconvenience to me of driving you, I am asking you to inconvenience yourself a lot more... that doesn't seem like sound reasoning, unless I place my desires and feelings above yours. \n\nI think in my case, some of that guilt stuff came from parenting. I had a mother who always made it clear how disappointed she was when we children didn't help her -- even if we had a good reason, there was this undertone of being resigned to having to do it alone... as always. No matter how much you helped, she had this huge martyr complex, so even if you helped several times in the past, you started from scratch next time. At best, you could be adjacent to her, and get to be the example of what meager help she gets (i.e., used to guilt your siblings), but the focus was still on her suffering rather than on anyone actually being helpful.\n\nWith her, it was easy enough, after a while, to say, "Screw you Mom, you are so absorbed in your feelings of disappointment and burden that I am not inclined to help anymore, because it doesn't actually change your feelings. There is no winning, so I accept this as a feature of my environment." However, not so easy when faced with someone I care about, and who I want to make happy, and who *isn't* as prone to constant asking for help, or constant shaming. Because then, it feels like I ought to be grateful -- it feels like "cheating" to have gotten away with just doing whatever I want to do constantly, and they've been wonderful not to guilt me for my blatant self-interest, but then on some subconscious (i.e., irrational) level I am assuming that they've just been suffering the same feelings in silence. And so it is kind of them to not try to hurt me with those feelings, but when they do finally ask for something, it seems like I really ought to step up and help since they've been so understanding.\n\nThat is part of why I don't socialize a lot with others -- because it is so hard to identify how to balance their needs against my own, and how to identify healthy boundaries. When is it okay to say, "No, you need a good amount of help, but I just don't wanna"? (Clearly not if they need a ride to the hospital, but what if it is something smaller, and you genuinely need "me time" in order to not start to resent your life, other people, etc?) There are times when setting those boundaries are necessary, but I don't really have a good model for how to do so, so I just avoid people and avoid caring about them so that I am never the person they depend on. Then I don't have to feel guilty because there's no reason I would have to be the person to help. \n\nHowever, if they start to depend on you and care about you, you might become a support pillar in their life, and then you stepping out for a coffee, a bath, or just to watch some movie you had been looking forward to watching all day means leaving them to topple over. (Again, not a rational argument.) It feels like people depending on you emotionally means that you are responsible for their needs, so you shouldn't take that on unless you are ready to accept that responsibility. I avoid sharing my emotions with others because generally, they tell me to stop having them, and I already know how to rationalize my emotions. But when others share their emotions with me, I don't want to hurt them in that way, and they don't seem as capable of rationalizing them -- so it feels like I'm capable of hurting them in ways that I don't understand and they can't control, and with that power comes responsibility to avoid hurting them to the extent that it can be avoided.
2	As an ISTJ I feel guilt about everything. I feel guilt if I bring something up that is bothering me, no matter how small it is.. Guilt about my guilt, guilt about possibly leaving my job (just had an interview that went really good, waiting to hear back) Guilt about some slight over exaggeration, like something took 52 minutes, so I will say it took an hour. I feel guilty that I didn't tell the truth about it actually taking 52 minutes. I feel a lot of guilt about my past, and even guilt about all the different ways my future could play out. It's a bit much, but I have never been any other way.  \n\n
2	I feel guilt about everything. If I make a mistake at work, I always feel bad, and it always bothers me.
1	As mentioned by anther ISTJ, I also feel guilty. If it's something that I messed up in, I would feel guilty for a while. I believe the main reason for this is because I believe I didn't take proper responsibility or I don't like when I let others down.\n\nSmall things trigger guilt for me. Recently, I accidentally spoiled the NBA finals and I felt guilty because my sister and brother-in-law were gonna watch it later. I couldn't even look at them for the rest of the day. Losing money I was given also makes me feel guilty because I let myself down and I feel like I let the person who gave it to me down as well, like it was wasted.
3	Help depressed ISTJ go through his divorce	Hi, my ISTJ older brother has been in a rocky marriage (and before that rocky relationship) for a few years now. I'll tell you their problems in brief - \n\n-they're very different people with low compatibility \n- she's clearly a narcissist and he's clearly a host in their dynamic (and he knows this) \n-every few months they keep trying to live together and make up, but inevitably they have a series of fights and she leaves \n- recently she got her father to threaten him "or else" (her dad's an ex cop) \n-he's aware of all the ways she's wrong for him (and generally not a very nice person) but he just can't seem to let go \n\nContext- We're Indians, and family and marriages are particularly sacred here. People do get divorced fairly commonly, but it's still slightly looked down upon. Him being an ISTJ is obviously all about the tradition. Though my parents don't care about traditions in this aspect and badly want them to get divorced and him to be happy. His wife's already got one divorce under her belt. And he feels very responsible and guilty towards her because of that and a few other things. He's in his mid 30s and she's in her late 30s. They don't have kids. \n\nMy real question is this: he's finally about to serve her with divorce papers but keeps flip flopping on the whole thing all.the.time. This is very unlike him. And in the last 2-3 years I've seen him get increasingly more pathetic, needy, gullible, emotional, paranoid and stressed. \n\nThis is NOT the super practical, seemingly detached, adventurous go getter I knew all my life. I really want to help him but don't know how. \n\nI'm an ENFP, so for me, getting out of a run means sorting through my feelings, going out with friends a lot, applying logic to a previously emotional situation and just moving the fuck on. \n\nMy brother has a few good friends but doesn't meet them regularly. He only opens up to my parents. (Who just get further stressed. They have their own stuff to deal with so it makes me sad to see them all sucked in) \n\nWhat do I do? I'm planning to surprise him with a scuba diving open water course in Thailand, as a gift. He'd love the peace down there. Any and all suggestions welcome. Why are ISTJs so emotionally fragile? T people should never have feelings, it's like they short circuit or something. :/
4	We have a hard time quitting on anything. I've never quit a job. I had a seasonal job that I worked at for 9 years and only stopped working there because I moved and then found my full-time job I am in now for the last 15 years.\n\nI have only had two long term relationships. The second one resulted in my current marriage of 13+ years.\n\nThere is just a lot of shame I associate with quitting. I always think I can push through problems and outlast them (this too shall pass...). It doesn't mean we're emotionless. I'm pretty emotional. We just make decisions with facts instead of feelings. You may need to approach your brother with facts of how his marriage is bad and how it would be pragmatically beneficial to get out of it sooner than later.
1	My mom is an ISTJ going through a rough divorce at the moment. I've had a lot of trouble helping her get through it. She can't stand the loss of structure and seems to be most focused on how the family was "destroyed". The thing she seems most upset about is that she now has "no family". My dad (ENTP? and also a narcissist) emotionally cheated on her and initiated the divorce.\n\nI helped her get a therapist to talk to. And I tried hard to show her that it's okay to be alone and not depend on another person. And that she does not have to wait for another person all day to do things for them. The only crappy part is that every time I think she's getting better she reverts when she's reminded of the 35 year marriage.\n\nNot a real solution I can offer unfortunately. She seems happiest when I baby her and do things for her, but that's torturous for me for more than a few days. She has a tendency to become super dependent on others, but at the same time has a certain way things need to be done. It's good in your situation they don't have kids, at least.
1	Yes, us T people do kind of "short circuit" with emotional stuff sometimes. Especially us tertiary Fi people because internal values are so important to us (I'm an INTJ, spouse is ISTJ)\n\nThat's a tough situation you're in with your brother but I wonder whether being pushy with him might cause more problems. I think going out with him and helping him relax and find enjoyment in life is smart and more likely to keep your relationship with him strong. \n\nPeople usually need to find their own way when it comes to relationships, and hearing negatives from an outside source can actually compromise their ability to see things clearly. If you tell your brother his wife is wrong for him, the natural response would be for him to think of all the ways you're wrong and that she's right for him. The ISTJ is inherently logical and willing to look at both sides of the equation. And his family life and stability is likely important to him, so any emotional clouding will likely be in her favour. Yes, you're his brother... but she's his *wife*. Tradition favours him taking care of her. \n\nI hope all goes well for both of you. Best wishes.
8	Do any of you ever feel really stressed and what do you do to when you are stressed out?	
10	I just keep doing what I'm doing until I'm done. At most, I'll go watch a funny video for a few minutes. Stressing out solves nothing, like crying... this may be why other types call us robots.
8	Be Stoic and ignore it until the stress causes my body to break down and I get really sick and/or depressed and spend 90% of my free time sleeping. \n\nBut really...mindlessly stress eat, grumble about whatever is stressing me out under my breath...then make a list of what needs to be done to end the stress and tackle that shit. 
3	Close my eyes and breathe for 20 minutes, take a 20 minute nap, eat (don't do this), or masturbate.
3	I plan everything I need to do
2	Ocean. It something about being near or in the ocean that immediately gets me out of my head
2	I don't really stress. If you plan ahead and cover all your bases this leaves you stress free!
1	I get out for a walk if I can, (repeatedly) consciously turn my attention to anything other than what's stressing me out, and hope I run into a friendly cat. Music helps once I'm back, if it's an option.\n\nIf I'm in the middle of a stressful event and can't leave it's either "oh well, hi anxiety ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ " or I go tharn (which from an outside perspective apparently makes me look unshakeable and uninterested, to my great amusement).
1	I'll workout. If I can't, I'll pick the easiest task I need to get done (like fix the bed, grab a glass of water) and focus on a small task which takes the stress away. 
1	Working out can help. Also I find organizing and cleaning my environment helps tremendously. I find when my environment (usually my home) is clean and organized, my stress level is much less and I can move forward tackling the actual problems that are causing me strife. 
1	Well I'm pretty stressed currently. I regress even more and try to entertain myself in any way possible to not think about the stress factors.
1	I am constantly stressed out. I am beginning to think that will never change. \n\nWhat I do: \nCreate lists for things I need to do, goals, etc. \nSleep \nWatch a movie/tv show \nGame \nMasturbate\nClean everything 
1	Go outside.
1	Sleep. 
1	I clean
1	I used to keep everything inside. Now I relax a little, meditate, control my respiration. I'll go out and work out as hard as I can and that really helps.
1	I either take a short nap which tends to make me feel a lot better or go running for 30 min or so while listening to music and just focusing on the music. You can also punch a wall really hard and the shock/pain/numbness really calms you down.

21	Interesting data I found online	
2	I am intrigued by this infograph!\n\nI'd be interested to see if there would be much difference from results taken closer to now - especially from a post 9/11 perspective. 
1	I'd be curious to know how they identified individuals' types. Testing, or something more validated/rigorous?
6	Weekly Thread: What's the last thing you failed at?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: when was the last time you failed at doing something, and what was it? \n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
4	I failed at not commenting here.
3	Weight loss, only thing I can't seem to get control of.
3	I got up to get a coffee and promised myself that I'd continue writing my Masters thesis when I got back. Instead I'm writing this comment.\n\nThe last *major* thing I failed at (other than minor stuff like "I got up 10 minutes later than I told myself I would") was a job application - I did well but didn't get it.
2	That calculus quiz was pretty hard...
2	Attempting to self-teach C++. Didn't even begin to learn.
2	I told a guy that I was excited to go out with him, but when the day came that we were going to go out I got cold feet and didn't answer my phone or text him back. \n\nYa.. I feel like a really shitty person. 
2	I failed to establish a meaningful relationship with someone who obviously cared after she came back from a year of an exchange program. \n\nI still hate myself for that, it was at the start of the semester. 
2	This submission has been randomly featured in /r/serendipity, a bot-driven subreddit discovery engine. More here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Serendipity/comments/577dfy/weekly_thread_whats_the_last_thing_you_failed_at/
2	The last major fail might have been at work. I'm a graphic designer for a T-shirt place. I misspelled a word that got printed and the company had to redo the shirt order 😥
2	I miss quoted someone's order and had the immediate guilt/anxiety pit in my stomach when i realized what happened. Not only because I had to let the customer know what happened. But also because I really hate missing details, I usually don't. 
13	What MBTI type would make the best love interest for an ISTJ person?	Title says it all.I heard somewhere that an INTJ and ENTJ person are suitable for each others but what about us,ISTJs?
10	Love INFPs.  They tend to struggle with my ISTJ-ness though.
6	I am a little biased as my fiance is INFJ, but having someone that understands my needs as an I and understands my actions as a J, creates a really interesting dynamic. We share base values but can look at situations differently. 
6	My girlfriend is an INFJ and we get along really well. 
3	My wife is an ESTJ. Basically she has an easier time socializing than I do but we are otherwise pretty similar in terms of liking structure, routine, and tradition.\n\nI'm a little weaker on the T and can cross into the F side sometimes, so sometimes a more sympathetic type would be good for me, but I do believe thoughts and right and wrong should take precedence over feelings, perception, etc.
3	My gf of 2+ years is an ESFP. I'd say we get along very well most of the time.
2	Anyone who is patient, considerate, and on-point when it comes to rules/policies. Especially if they can respect the sanctity of a well-laid plan.
2	Every type 
4	Any mature human being of any type will do. That being said, there can be trends, both in general and in your own life, of being attracted to certain types. \n\nGiven your type, you might be attracted to ENFPs because them being your natural opposite can be quite alluring. Might I also say that an ESTP would be an interesting dynamic? While ENFPs are opposites in the sense that you share the same cognitive functions in a reverse order, an ESTP shares opposite functions in the same order (e.g. your first function is Introverted Sensing while theirs is Extraverted Sensing, and so on.)\n\nBut being complimentary/compatible on a cognitive level is only a part of the big picture in your life and relationships. There was an interesting podcast on the personality hacker page about a bigger question of: "Should I date only certain personality types based on mine?" http://www.personalityhacker.com/podcast-episode-0140-should-you-only-date-certain-myers-briggs-types/
7	Weekly Thread: What advice would you give your 10 year old self?	Welcome to our weekly thread!

8	It's okay to have feelings, even uncomfortable ones. All feelings will eventually pass.
5	I wouldn't. Ten year old me has got this, I'm not worried about her.
5	I'd tell me to take better care of my eating habits
4	My 10 year old self mistook introversion for shyness, and therefore I avoided being outspoken and never stepped out of my comfort zone socially. I ended up missing out on years of social development that still affects me, almost 10 years later. 
3	Nothing. My life turned out good. No regrets.
3	Learn music theory starting now.
3	Lighten up and don't take yourself so seriously. Think of others and how your actions affect them. And most importantly: it will be ok.
3	Don't stop collecting pokemon cards xD
3	You're right. \n\nDon't question the things you want in life, and don't try to be such a people pleaser. Focus on yourself
2	Start figuring out what subjects interest you. Pay attention to what makes you happy instead of being oblivious to your feelings. Go to college.\n\nTry to start understanding emotions and how to sympathize with people. You don't care about friendship right now, but try socializing with people so you have friends later and you don't become socially awkward later.
2	Any modification to the currently standing timeline would potentially change my outcome as an adult. I'm fairly happy with myself and think that while I may not be perfect that every imperfection is a learning opportunity
2	It's okay to work hard, even if nobody around you thinks it's okay.
1	Quit being such a pussy fag and go out more, start lifting weights
1	Tell about sexual assault.
16	16 Tiny Moments That Every Introvert Secretly Finds Exciting	
3	They're all accurate situations, but mostly related to solitude. I thought it would feature a more diverse range of moments.
2	All these things! \n\nI think I just love to be alone, without any sound more then anything. 
5	Small talk	What do you guys think of it? Do you think it's a nice way to get to know people? Or is it as useless as the commercials before YouTube videos, and you wish we could just skip to deeper conversations?\n\nI've asked this in all the mbti sub-reddits (is that what it's called?) Someone posted an article about it in the INTP group, if you want to read it, but you don't have to, just want to know what you think. -curious intp\n\nAlso I don't know how to define small talk, but I think it's safe to include social graces, work/school, and weather (I apologize if you are a weather nerd or something and actually find it very intriguing to talk about)
5	It really depends. If it's about the other person, the weather, school or stuff like that I don't mind it. I just HATE when people ask stuff about me when they probably don't even care and will forget within a few hours.
4	I don't really care about getting to know a lot of people, so it's not a big deal to me. Still, small or big talking is fine, provided it isn't interfering with work.\n\nThus, it often seems that I have a problem with small talk, but really my problem is with inappropriate talk. To everything there is a season.
3	I usually only start conversations if I think they have some kind of point. I don't usually just go up to someone and start chatting. So as far small talk, I only use it when it's about the other person or about myself, as opposed to things like the weather and the typical "did you catch the game last night?"\n\nIt's just that I find it really hard to get the first few words in. I'm afraid of initiating a conversation that is unwanted, so I stay quiet until someone talks to _me_ or unless I have a useful question or answer to say. But after that, it goes smoothly when I ask them about themselves, what they like doing, etc.
1	As someone who is trying to date, I hate small talk. If you decide to send me a message online it should be more then how are you? I put all of my hobbies/interests into my profile among other things. In return I expect at least a paragraph response. If I don't get that then the conversation just becomes incredibly boring and pointless. \n\nI would rather repeat the same long, but intellectual conversations with my roommate over and over then have small talk conversations with various people. 
1	I've definitely had to practice small talk, but don't generally enjoy it. I.e. I wouldn't hang out at a bar.  However, I do a lot of networking, both for my job and general career advancement, and will "turn it on" when I think the person will benefit me.  It sounds manipulative when I explain it to other people, but it's led to 2 job offers in the last 10 months.  (I should mention that I work in tech and being both female and having the slightest social skills are great advantages...)
1	OMG, I was just about to post about small talk. It's so damn hard for me sometimes. I have a couple of side jobs where there can be a lot of small talk involved. I think I haven't advanced in my roles in those jobs because I'm not good with the small talk part. When it comes to communicating important points or having a discussion on a specific item, I do much better, but I think people like those who can schmooze better.
1	I spent 10 years in retail.  Got to handle the small talk.  Even so, I like it.\n\nAlso, I traveled to England for a different job and was talking to everyone I met.  I didn't know that was a British no-no.  My first day, I went to town for shopping.  As I headed back to the police school, I had my arms full of shopping, an umbrella, (It was POURING!), and a happy song in my heart.  I talked to every person I saw.  I even shared Hershey chocolates on the train to Edinburgh.\n\nI've always talked too much.  Always got me in trouble at school.  LOL
1	I don't really care for it, I do see the value in it, but only if its geared towards getting to know someone you actually want to get to know, if not, i really dislike it.

1	Not really a fan. Especially with people I don't know.
4	Weekly thread: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: where do you see yourself in 5 years?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
7	Hahahahhah in exactly the same place I am now. Which is perfect. 
4	Leaving university with a civil engineering degree, a years work in the field, a little cash and hopefully a girl to keep me company
7	Dead.  Never expected to live this long.
3	Ideally? \n\nMarried, kids either on the way, or in the works. Working as a Sharepoint Developer, or Server Administrator. \n\nHopefully I have lived in the same home for a few years, or at the very least in the process of buying my forever home. \n\nI have moved too many times in the last 3 years to feel comfortable in any position. Even now, I know for sure where I will be until March. I know it's a semi-stable environment, but I think about what I need to sell or get rid of everyday. I feel like I can never relax. 
2	God willing, exactly where I am now because change really drives me nuts for a while until I get used to it.  Even picking a place to eat, if I find out it's closed.
2	Probably in a small apartment in Boston, sipping Dr Pepper, wrapped up in a blanket, watching the snow fall, creating a floor plan on AutoCAD on my laptop for my stay-at-home-and-occasionally-go-to-the-office job.
2	Probably finishing or about to finish studying civil engineering, new friends, lot of experience as a practicant and maybe (hopefully) with a partner.
2	Probably dead head sitting on the internet. So basically like today. 
2	Hopefully not where i'm currently living. The GE plant in my town is slowly going under, and I feel like when it inevitably happens, it'll turn the town we live into a really bad area, filled with more crime, heroin, etc than there already is. I don't want to be a part of that. 
6	How do you organize your to-do list?	My list of things to do at work is getting too unruly to manage without some kind of organization/classification system, so I thought I'd turn to some like-minded organizers to see what works for you. \n\nHow do you organize the tasks on your to-do list?
4	I use a shredder to organise it.
4	I make goals as headers and tasks as subset objectives. I might clarify those tasks with another subset of tasks or instructions. I break it down to the point where each task is very clear and attainable. 
2	What to do list? Lol....I write things down in the order I think of them, and then I go from what has to be done first according to deadlines to what is furthest away. If there is no deadline or the deadlines are the same, I go from least overwhelming to most overwhelming.
1	[deleted]
1	I keep all my work in date order. I work a a T-shirt printing place and I complete what is on schedule to print soonest. Sometimes I will knock some easy ones though.
1	Do you have any repeat sets of tasks? I was planning on creating a few notecards with a check-list for single events (e.g., an intake) that generated several tasks (e.g., checking out a room, scoring measures, writing up a report, filling out records). That way, you aren't cluttering the list with those items, but you still get the benefit of having the task broken down on the card. You can use something like a paperclip to track where you are on that checklist.\n\nAnother approach that was promising for a while was the [One Minute To-Do List](http://www.michaellinenberger.com/TheOneMinuteTo-DoList-Ebook.pdf) -- you only need to read the first 39 pages for the basic system. It basically manages your To-Do items by urgency, because he argues that that is what most To-Do lists devolve into anyways.\n\n* (*More details / brief summary how that to do list works*): The key is that you essentially have three lists -- a very very short list of today tasks, a somewhat longer list of "stuff that is coming up soonish," and the last list of "someday" tasks. You review them at different rates (so that you're not doing an hour long review every day to prioritize your 219 tasks), and the "today" list is kept *extremely* short. That way, you can have the satisfaction of knowing you're up to date, and you can find the next item to work on. Finally, it is very easy to create even if you've been neglecting it forever -- very low upkeep/neglect penalty.\n\nIf you have a lot of new and varied tasks that have their own subtasks.... I am thinking of a notebook I just got. [Caimbridge Planning Notebook](http://scene7.targetimg1.com/is/image/Target/15291137?wid=1024&hei=1024&qlt=70&fmt=pjpeg) -- it has a list area, with a spot to the left for notes. I might try to estimate how long the task would take in that blank column, track time/Pomodoros towards it. Write the deadline for the last subtask (i.e., for project completion)... And maaaaaybe rough out a timeline in pencil, but I'd be careful (if you fall off track, it would likely be discouraging...). I know you can do that all with regular paper too, of course. I'm a bit of a notebook/office supply fetishist though, so it does help me that it looks cool.\n\nThen, schedule everything! I had the idea before that I would create a Google Calendar and put in all the tasks for their estimated time (not scheduling them yet, just laying them out) -- then move the tasks around to schedule them! You'll probably want to leave a bit of buffer unless your time estimates are spot on. That way, you can see that if you do not do X now (and it has 30 minutes of work left), you now have to find a spot in the future where you have 30 minutes free. But you can always swap it with a task you are more willing to do, or rearrange tasks later in the week -- the point would be to see the visual time commitment against the time you have in a day. (Hopefully that also helps incentivize efficiency -- I know I can get perfectionistic, given the time. If I saw all my time was booked though, I might feel enough pressure to decide to cut back on some of the less essential tasks.)\n\nI hope these ideas are helpful to you! I guess my last suggestion would be not to stay late too often to catch up -- at least for me, that always slowed me down *badly* even in the relatively short-term.
1	I put the easiest stuff at the very top. Once I cross off a few things I write a nice, new, clean list. 
1	At work, [redmine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmine). I'll assign myself tickets for stuff I need to remember and get done. My coworkers and boss use it too so it's also good for answering the "what are you working on" question.
1	My ISTJ spouse pawns this off on me (INTJ). I don't mind.\n\nAs an aside: try out CARROT to-do list app if you have an iPhone. Enter all the little daily tasks as well as the bigger ones. It's entertaining and fun.
1	I use Trello, the website/app.  The layout is super flexible depending on your needs and there's a lot of good examples online.  Here's mine, although it's different than most I've seen:  \nI have a few big topic boards (work, personal, job search).  Each board has a couple categories (Conference, Recruiting, Internal Server, Done) with tasks below.  Tasks are roughly in order of priority or get titles like "EOD - email Steve."  All completed tasks are moved to the Done list, which I archive every week or so.  
1	I use the free little note app on my phone.
5	(X-Post ISFJ) Do you peeps relate to this?	
9	What's considered the opposite of this? I have that. 
7	I don't have it, but I can remember really specific details which have happened a long time ago.
2	Nah man it's all a blur because I'm always stuck in my head 
2	[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0-mv26szJk) a video of people with this condition, talking about their experiences. 
2	I probably have this to some degree but I sometimes put hot dogs away in the foil drawer and bananas in the tool drawer.
1	I think this carry vary by person rather then personality type. I  know I do not have Hyperthymesia, but I would say I have an exceptional memory. 
1	Nope
1	I always have, but to a lesser degree now, due to chemo brain.
1	INFP here. Not enough to call it a condition, but I remember vivid memories that nobody else can remember. Thing is I can't with schoolwork dammit.
33	Hello to the 4 other people online on this sub	I know half of you are probably afk but hi anyway

2	Hello fellow istj!
2	Hello:)
2	Suh du
2	Late, but hello
2	I'll be your friend, ISTJs :D 
13	ISTJ's and Self-Love	Hello you ISTJ's here, \nan ENFP here worried about my ISTJ Friend who is having some self-esteem issues. This Friend is really precious to me, since shes always there to listen to my crazy blabla and emotional up and downs. I am really glad that she opens up to me aswell and lets me know when shes having a bad time. \n\nThing right now is, that she feels stuck in her life and that she feels like not beeing enough. Things like men rejecting her or just not answering really hurt her deeply, questioning her all beeing. Dont get me wrong, she gets alot of attention from men. She is really beautiful and has style thats also where she gets her energy from. She has a clear idea of what feminity means and how a lady should behave. But yeah while its easy for her to get the attention of men, its hard to keep them interested, whereas she now worries about beeing an uninteresting person.\n\nShe also has a huuuuge problem with opening up to others (except me and her mom) especially when it comes to romantic matters. Like, she broke up with her ex 2 years ago, but still regrets that one love letter she sent him while they were in a relationship. She still thinks about it and feels reaaally embarassed by doing so. And me ENFP just dont get it. I have no idea how she can be so embarassed about real feelings she felt at a time. How she can be so deeply upset when cute strangers dont text her back and how it really ruins her day. Like, when i get rejected, i just think that its probably not meant to be and that i rock either way and that its his loss not mine. But everytime i tell my istj friend my viewpoint, she admires me, but cannot really apply this thinking for herself.\n\n So yeah we came to the conclusion that she doesnt really love herself enough to feel that way. I bombarded her with lots of self-love quotes after that and she thankfully takes in everything i tell her, but i dont know if the methods i use to feel that way also work on her.\n\nSo yeah, thats why i was wondering how other ISTJ's feel concerning that self-esteem issue. How did you overcome the lack of self-love and what could i tell her to make her realize that shes worth so much more than she thinks.

4	For ISTJs the past is where you live 80% of the time, that's why that letter is so bugging for her. for example I still randomly remember a mistake i made in fourth grade when me and my mom met a teacher i hated in a local supermarket and i gave him a handshake that was far too short and weak to not look unappropriated and it is like my "This is how NOT to handshake" thing that comes to me in every bus ride at 6:00am because of... reasons... \n\nNow I am about to make a rant here so...You were warned.\n\nI'd like to elaborate in how being attached to the past relate to how to solve most of your problem as an ISTJ by stating that I have always found fascinating how separated the "real" world is from my inner world. What i mean with that is the fact that when something needs to be done, like some really hard work everyone is afraid to start even thinking about, I am probably the most driven and diligent person there is in the room; entering robotic mode as i call it. Yet internally i am screaming and crapping my pants, sobbing in a corner while repeating to myself i am going to screw big time, I summon some memory of failure and i tell myself that i cant do it and that i should be ashamed for not being up to a task i am already doing. The funny thing in this is that when i start listening to that part of me another part start summarizing how everything is objectively under control.\nNot breaking any ground in here, anyone who had ever being depressed knows what i am talking about; that second self pulling you down. What i want to point is: When you are an ISTJ seeing things for what they are is one of your strong points, and to do such thing one must learn to disattach from weak evidence and subjective matters and focus only on solid knowledge and experience. For me that is what do the trick most of the time.\nThe voice is always going to be there and one should listen to it EVERY time, because it is presenting you with a solid reason to be angry, fearful or ashamed; yet one should do ones job and present the refuting evidence. One should rationalice everything. Plain and simple, being biased towards one perspective of yourself againts another equally valid isn't being objective and not being objective is the alpha-omega sin of ISTJs
3	One time I said 'daylight savings time' instead of 'daylight saving time' to a coworker in 2013. I have thought about this at least once every month (if not more) since it happened.\n\nI'm 30 years old, and in the past year I've really embraced and feel good at my job, got a substantial raise, got married to my dude I've been with for nearly 8 years now, bought a house, and am pregnant on purpose. Despite EVERYTHING telling me otherwise, I have extremely low self-esteem, and have for as long as I can remember. I'm so acutely aware of all of the things I could have done/said/thought differently that no matter how well I do, there's always a better way.\n\nI'm definitely more comfortable with myself now at 30 than I was at 24, but I don't know that my self-esteem levels have actually changed. I think my own perception of myself just doesn't matter to me as much as it used to. \n\nTo me, nothing is worse than feeling vulnerable. Letting other people in on your deepest feelings makes you vulnerable, so when you let go of a person, but they still hold on to that power of knowing your vulnerabilities exist, it's incredibly uncomfortable. She doesn't regret the letter itself, she just hates knowing that someone else is aware that she is capable of being hurt. We prefer to exude a more robotically indestructible facade, but little tokens of affection don't allow for that facade to hold up.\n\nI don't know if any of this helps. Probably not. Oh well.
2	You could encourage her to get therapy - that usually helps.  It seems unusual to me that she would be upset by cute strangers not texting her back.  We don't usually form connections with others that quickly.  She's lucky to have a friend like you that cares so much. As an aside, I still feel regret for giving a valentines card 20 yrs ago filled with all the reasons I loved him.  God I wish I could go back in time and take that back! LOL!  
2	Self worth without a doubt comes from inside when it comes to ISTJ personalities. It's actually ironic because my ex boyfriend always said I was fishing for compliments, but in all reality if someone calls me beautiful I look at that as someone who wants to use me in some way, so they are trying to get on my good side. \n\nSelf love takes a lot of work for ISTJ's. I have finally started loving myself, but I have a long ways to go. I think it's safe to say that full confidence will never be there. \n\nInternal struggles will always be there for ISTJ's and there is nothing you can do to change that. 
1	I think it really is important for us to get an age range so that we can accurately make an assessment. I think that as ISTJ's we all go through different stages of life and it's quite different to be depressed as a moody teen or as a fully developed adult. While both are serious there are different methods of dealing with each.\n\nAlternative 2: tell her to embrace the boringness, once I did that everything became easier to deal with
1	I have had issues with self-esteem and self-love quite a bit, and have only in recent years figured it into my grand scheme of making things work better.\n\nI frame it for myself in this way:\n\n1) It is my duty to give appropriate love and affection to those close to me\n\n2) In order to do so, I MUST love myself fully, otherwise I am giving less than 100% to others\n\n3) To take responsibility for my failures in this regard, I am required to forgive myself and find an appropriate way of overcoming the issues getting in the way.\n\nLearning to acknowledge my own successes, and making a clear distinction in my mind that "I understand this" and "I accept this" are massively fundamentally different has helped me to work past the unrealistic and negative ways of thinking I am prone to.
1	What you just stated does not sound like an ISTJ. It's cool that you're trying to help her out, but I'm going to assume it's to make up for a void that you have in your life too.\n\n(INFP)
1	I initially thought this was a discussion about "self love". My bad.
7	Weekly thread: How did you meet your current SO?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: how did you meet your current SO?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
15	I met my current SO only moments after I was born. I came into the world, looked to my right and saw it attached to the end of my right arm. 
7	I was known to have a massive thing for ginger girls at the store i worked at, leading to me being assigned to train her when she started. We developed an incredible friendship fairly quickly over a mutual love for a nearby burrito place, and around a year later developed into an incredible relationship :)
7	I met my ISTJ spouse (I am an INTJ) in an online chat room, back when chat rooms were still a thing. That was over 15 years ago... he drove 3000 miles across the continent to be closer to me, then got his residency in Canada and now we have a 1-year old and a pretty awesome life.
5	Plenty of Fish, an online dating site.  We've been together for a year.  She actually messaged me first.  POF is much more difficult to sort and prioritize who you want to contact, so I usually take a more active role on other sites.\n\nAs an ISTJ, I'd recommend avoiding the bullet points that we all love, and instead try to make your profile more fun and interesting.  Girls seem to love cats in your main photo, if you have one.  And instead of putting a boring list in the interests section, put something fun.  Instead of "Game of Thrones", put "Waiting for Danaerys to cross the narrow sea", and instead of "programming", put "typing gibberish into a black and green screen".  For myself, putting "assembling IKEA furniture" prompted her to start the conversation by challenging me to an assembly race.
3	I met mine through a mutual friend at college. We hung out a couple times and had a couple courses together, but only started dating a couple years after that after we had gotten to know each other 
3	Tinder. Way out of my comfort zone, but being an engineer, I don't meet a lot of females. So I kinda had to.
3	We met at work.  We were both introverts, and since both of us had escaped from really bad relationships, neither of us was looking for a significant other at the time.  But, we started talking, and found out that we had so much in common, plus there was chemistry.  We decided to give it a shot, and almost five years later, we're both still really happy together!
2	[deleted]
2	She started talking online to a friend of mine. They went out a couple of times but I didn't work. We kept talking, she started going to the same school I was already at and the rest was history.
2	I actually met my wife at a Christian retreat for High School-aged students. We were friends for the longest time, and didn't actually start dating until we both graduated, and had been through a couple of relationships. 
2	This thread makes me sad... 18 years of life and no SO ever 😞
2	Not current, but last SO was met through Plenty of Fish. I made a account in the new city I was moving too. We both clicked "meet me" on each other, and he messaged me. We exchanged emails for about a week, then a few days before I moved I gave him my number and we started texting a lot. The day I moved we texted non-stop. He ended up coming over to my house to help me move in. We got to third base on our first night together, then 2 days later he took me on our first official date. \n\nWe actually moved in together after 3 months and it was going great up until I realized that he can't give me what I am looking for, so I gave him a ultimatum. As much as I love him I cannot be with someone who doesn't share the same goals. We still live together, and he is without a doubt one of my best friends. I still have a small amount of hope that one day he will decide what he wants out of life, but until then it's like a unfinished love story. 
2	My SOs sister actually introduced her to me over Facebook. About 2 weeks later we meet in person and hit it off!
10	I need ISTJs to participate in a survey to get better statistics.	I need more ISTJs to participate in MBTI relationship statistics, because as of now, there are 4 ISTJs, whereas other types are crossing 100 limit right now. \n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19k9UrDFdQtci5-kRNeykkR3J4iw7c1A2y0zqirHQtoI) is the form.\n\nI really appreciate your help. And if you are really interested in statistics, [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFpUbw92VH_BGrVf-FMngyCdtERYVvvGOEL_T58kw9Q/edit#gid=641219863) is the sheet, (Check out other Tabs. It's also always updated.) It's currently unfinished, so pardon any bugs. And it's better to copy it to your google drive and edit INFP Tab from "INFP" in cell A3, to "ISTJ" if you want to see your statistics. ISTJ Tab is somewhat less finished due to Google Sheets bugs.
15	Tfw no gf so survey was short.
6	I wish all of my tests were that easy.
3	Do people usually know what MBTI type their partners are? I've got an inkling, but I'm not certain of any of them. Nothing we've ever talked about either.
3	I don't care enough about my wife's MBTI type to have her take a test again, just so I can finish this survey.
2	Surprised there was no question about how many relationships you've been in, only whether you had another one that you also wanted to include in statistics. \n\nAs for relationship making you happier or not, that is a kind of tough question. Happier during the relationship? Long-term? Even those are rough. \n\nThe one relationship I was in was half the happiest I have ever been or will ever be (I was happy in that stupid "golden retriever chasing frisbees" way -- I am certainly more content, satisfied, and stable now), and it was half the most miserable I've ever felt in relation to another human being.
1	Done
1	ISTJ female with ENTP male. Our relationship is still continuing, but that answer somehow didn't take. Can you fix that?
1	Is it possible to split the orientation, relationship type, and been in relationship by gender?
1	The data is more interesting than the survey itself. It's pretty cool.\n\nAnd I've been on the internet for too long. Seeing majority straight startled me for some reason haha.

9	Songs that make you think of ISTJs?	[This song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVAowEaQoak) and [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPoNbHveE0I) . They both feel very Si-Fi to me and have the perfect amount of associated angst.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any other songs that make you think of ISTJs?
10	[Here by Alessia Cara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKp2CrfmVfw)\n\nThe genre doesn't remind me of ISTJ's, and honestly I don't even like this genre that much. However, I love this song because I relate to it *so* much as an ISTJ college student. It's basically about how she's at a party and every one is all chatty and fake and showing off, and she feels out of place and would rather be home. I just like it because I feel like a misfit in college because I don't like crazy college party scenes, which I feel is attributed to my ISTJ personality type.\n\nSample lyrics:\n\n"I would rather be at home all by myself, not in this room\nwith people who don't even care about my well-being"\n\n"Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this;\nan anti-social pessimist but usually I don't mess with this"\n

3	Enegram & Big 5 Are Not Popular Because There's Nothing Much To Read About Them In Comparison To MBTI?	Why are "Enegram" & "Big 5" test not as popular as MBTI?\n\nI think it may be because there is a lot to read about your personality type online after taking a MBTI test but nothing much after taking the "Enegram" or "Big 5" test.\n\nWhat do you think?
3	That may actually be right. There is quite a bit of literature on the Big 5 but it's quite scholarly which reduces the accessibility to the general populous, whereas you can figure out which Harry Potter character you are based on your MBTI type. \n\nThe ironic part is that the Big 5 has more scientific backing than MBTI but if people can't access new research about their Big 5 profile easily they're obviously going to lean towards MBTI
2	I think there is a decent bit out there on the Enneagram -- but it is less used in work settings to my knowledge, and I think it shows its history too much. That is, the symbol and types are pretty clearly drawn from a history of archetypes and other mystical roots (from back when mysticism was synonymous with the edge of human philosophy and psychology).\n\nMeanwhile, the MBTI -- while its theory is probably not *that* much better -- has a symmetry in its construction that looks appealingly scientific and official. Hence why you don't have to venture far to find an MBTI hobbyist who nonetheless turns their nose up at the Enneagram... At least, I've definitely seen it a few times in the year or so I've been hanging around the MBTI subreddits.
2	You can read about enneagrams,theres tons of article/videos,etc about them.
1	Enneagram and Big 5 are less popular than MBTI for totally different reasons\n\n[this](https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/52cp9f/enegram_big_5_are_not_popular_because_theres/d7jo32c) post is exactly right, when it makes explicit the difference between MBTI and Big 5.  MBTI is causal, which means it is almost metaphysical in its claims, yet that is exactly why people are drawn to it--because it has meaning in a way the Big 5 (by virtue of being entirely scientific) cannot.  Enneagram is like MBTI in that it likewise has that allure, but its simply not as insightful, far-reaching, or elegant as MBTI.  There is no figure equal in stature to Jung underpinning Enneagram and its scope is much narrower.\n\nSo Big 5 is categorically different than MBTI, whereas Enneagram is alike, but does what it does in an inferior fashion
6	Weekly Thread: When did you first realize that you were an introvert?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: when or how did you first realize that you were introverted?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
8	When I was 13, my parents kept complaining that I never visited my friends during the holidays to which I argued that simply talking over teamspeak was enough social interaction for me
6	Since I was born.
5	My 3rd grade teacher was the first person to realize I was a quiet kid, but instead of "introverted" he used the word "shy". The truth is I wasn't exactly shy, it was just that I didn't know how to manage my energy levels back then. The first hour of the day was nearly constant social interaction with my family as I got ready for school, then I would talk with my friends, who were all extraverted, until school started. By the time school started and I was supposed to do things like "turn and talk" and "share out", I was mentally exhausted and didn't want to talk, so it looked like I was a shy kid. Talking and running around at recess/lunch didn't help either, I would have been better off taking naps. \n\nIt wasn't until 9th grade that I learned what introverts were, and all of a sudden everything made sense. The reason why I was socially awkward and uncomfortable with my peers was because I wasn't managing my energy at all. As soon as I realized this, my quality of life went way up. I felt refreshed and good about myself more often than not, my social skills started getting better and better, and even my grades went up. I'm really glad I figured everything out then, because I would have had serious struggles later in life had I figured out now.
3	My mom jokingly called me an introvert when I was maybe 21 or 22. I googled it, and it was like someone wrote all the descriptions about me. It all made sense—why I liked to stay in and not go to bars and clubs, why I didn't like parties but was cool with having a few friends over, why I hated small talk and didn't like to approach people first, etc. Really opened my eyes to who I am. 
2	I realized I was I introverted when I never wanted to speak up in class. I also knew that I was an introvert because I didn't mind sitting in my room all day and playing a video game.
2	About a year and a half ago, maybe two. I dont really remember how, but one day I found up something MBTI relate, investigated, did a quiz and then everything became clear for me.
2	When I was about 13 and I realized I had 1 friend and a huge circle of acquaintances thru that one friend, which I avoided studiously. It was brutal during my college years where my roommates would be partying non-stop.
1	To be honest I'm still not sure, maybe I'm an ESTJ
8	Survery! MBTI & Music 13 questions	Hi! This is for a research abut MBTI & Music, some of you have answered the simple test (only two questions) and I have received a lot of feedback telling me to do another less simple with more genres I listened to you guys and here it is!\nThank you for your time I really appreciated also shout out to "ThePixelHunter" for helping me in this!\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6AQZ7D2pA604k1OsTpQl_gd1d8ZvLeS4hcmasZjBzaMWWog/viewform
5	Good job with adding more depth, I remember your original survey. I still wish I could select multiple genres... I enjoy a pretty wide range of music. My favorite was selected completely arbitrarily because I enjoy several genres equally. 
3	I appreciate the write in response about songs. It gave me an opportunity to further clarify, which is nice. Good update!
2	ISTJ Friend/Colleague and ESFP Love Interest	I have seen quite a few 'help my ISTJ!' things on here, because I thought I'd have a read of some of your responses to existing posts. I like the way you guys write; it has a crispness to it that I'm not used to.\n\nGetting to the point, I have an ISTJ friend at work who was in a relationship with another colleague who is definitely on the loud end of ESFP. I've been on both sides of the relationship before, during and after they were together. I was wing-man to both of them before it started and then counselled them during and after. Bizarre. \n\nAnyway, they are deliberating over whether they should get back together or not. I can see that both of them are thinking about it in a more than speculative way. Common gripes seem to be about communication; I believe both of them are bad at verbalising their feelings - evidently, because they are telling me how they feel instead of each other.\n\nI was wondering if any of you experienced ISTJ/ESFP relationships before. On the surface, the match-up is bloody awful, but they were together for quite a long time and clearly care for each other deeply. I believe that they could learn a lot from one another, but perhaps they are too strong-headed. I'm fairly certain the ISTJ wanted to marry the ESFP. We talk about MBTI a lot at work and frequently the ISTJ takes the theories home to read. I think I'm seen as a reliable source of information because I've predicted and correctly analysed the ESFP's behaviour patterns.\n\nI've deliberately left the genders out!
5	Appeal to ego, but props for advocating "crispness" in tone - it is often mistaken for being a jerk.\n\nThe only relationships I have lasted at length through (few but long, typical) are those in which both partners can communicate clearly on all levels. If people are incapable of discussing their own faults, the relationships they hold are turbulent.\n\nIt's somewhat ironic that I find myself observing a close friend endure a very similar situation. He is on the far end of the timeline however - the pair has spent the better part of a decade as a married couple, and the bride has put him through intense emotional strain to the point of separation. Though I am undoubtedly biased, my predictions have been proven true several times over: they cannot communicate their needs effectively and as such are unable to maintain equilibrium. It is only until recently that they have found the courage to discuss their true characters (and flaws) and it has been an ugly rearing. They have been pursuing separation for the last 13 months, they have relapsed and sought counselling on several occasions, and they are now seeking permanent independence.\n\nI put a partner through years of hell myself, and since have realized that it was an incredibly selfish act. IxTJ's tend to develop very long-lasting relationships, and as such have a very difficult time breaking those bonds. Yet an incompatibility acknowledged cannot be ignored, lest it fester and become a plague.\n\nLong story short: if they broke up once, it'll probably happen again. Relationships for IxTJ's can be an addiction - learn to identify those tendencies.\n\n(All based on personal experience and observation, I'm only 30yr, this may not apply, etc)
2	>I've deliberately left the genders out!\n\nI appreciate this! I try to avoid bias in my thinking but it is inescapable in some ways, and I like not having to worry quite so much about guarding against it.\n\nI firmly believe that people can change and make things work. All of my experience and my training suggests that their ability to change the deeply ingrained patterns that led them to this place will depend largely on their ability to tolerate and even seek out discomfort.\n\nFor instance, you mention the ISTJ takes theories home to read. Sounds like a propensity for intellectualizing -- I dig it. I do the same kind of thing. I also have a tendency to be somewhat perfectionistic and, for brevity's sake, "emotionally constipated." I don't process emotions with other people. I hate the idea of it. I can't stress that enough.\n\nAnd yet... I also know that emotional spontaneity can be important to a relationship. If I process all of my emotions into logical little nuggets on my own... I am not respecting or factoring in the other person's feelings, their possible willingness and desire to change or accommodate even my irrational reactions, and ultimately, their right to have some amount of choice and input into how I work through feelings and actions that relate to, or that might impact, the relationship. Even if they don't get to dictate how I respond, they should at least be given a chance to speak and be heard -- and to hear me speak. I would guess that if I tried this with someone I loved and trusted, I would probably find it went better than expected and was more productive than expected.\n\nOf course, talk to anyone with an anxiety disorder, depression, or any kind of mental illness, and they'll tell you that logic does not change emotions. I still have a fundamental repulsion towards the idea of being emotionally vulnerable with others.\n\nThe reason I share this is because as much as that repulsion exists, I believe that my success in a relationship will be at least partly determined by (1) being able to challenge myself, approach discomfort, and be emotionally vulnerable until it becomes less appalling -- at least I should try it to determine if I am capable; and/or (2) being with a partner who inherently challenges me to do these things by their very nature (i.e., they are not trying to be my therapist, they just inherently expose me to those situations and demands), whilst inherently providing enough support or other value for me to be capable and willing to rise to those challenges versus getting the hell out of that relationship.\n\nProjecting wildly onto your friend, I might guess the same is true for them. Projecting less, I would strongly guess that there are versions of the above that applies to each friend -- one for the ISTJ, one for the ESFP. We all have feelings or experiences we are more or less comfortable with. We all have areas where we excel and areas where we feel challenged and insecure. It makes sense to seek what we excel at -- but there is a point where avoidance becomes destructive, limiting, or dysfunctional. There is almost guaranteed to be something that each partner could (and perhaps *must*) work on in order to move towards greater compatibility with each other, and it is almost guaranteed that it will be kind of uncomfortable for each of them in its own way. I don't know as much about ESFPs, but you describe your friend as loud -- perhaps your ESFP friend will have to work on the skin-itchy, ants-climbing-down-your-back sensation of wanting to say something and not saying it, so that they can learn to listen, and finally -- with practice -- learn to *hear* what someone else is saying. That is just an illustrative example, of course; I have no idea what they struggle more or less with. But the idea would be that probably both of them have to be willing to tolerate substantial discomfort, and likewise, it will require significant motivation -- but it will probably reap rewards if they are both capable and willing. \n\nAt the same time, they could probably also find relationships that would be less inherently challenging... though possibly less inherently rewarding? It really depends on their willingness, ability, and desire to change. For example, if they are unable to change deeply ingrained patterns and habits because they do not have the social or financial support to engage in that kind of emotionally challenging and draining work (which can be a possibility even when their desire and willingness are high), then it might be better at this time to find a partner that is more immediately compatible with their ways -- that can be an equally delightful and valid way of finding a partner you work well with, provided your weaknesses/avoidance are within relatively normal ranges (i.e., are not dysfunctional or pathological).
4	Survery : MBTI & Music	Hello! I'm doing a research work about the relationship between MBTI and music preferences. Please click the link below\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXr3BAVjpMLzh1DEQqTlAyVQZLGBTDN3lOun8MGJFSNH7wWw/viewform\n\n#Thanks  #Music  #Share  #MBTI
5	Short and simple, done.
4	FYI 'heavy metal' does not include what you would call modern 'metal', and 'rock/heavy metal' is honestly way too much of a generalization for several of the largest genres in music. It would be better to at least separate rock and metal since they are extremely different these days to be quite honest. Here I go being an ISTJ :P. Short though, I like it. Are you going to post the results?
3	It's too bad the "Others" radio button doesn't give the option to specify. I suppose that may be information in excess though.
2	Just saw this thread and wanted to fill out the form but it closed. Sad.
1	Done
1	Well, that was easy.\n\nI'd really like to see the results of this.
9	Hobbies	I'm looking to get into a new hobby and was just wondering if I could copy any of my fellow ISTJ's. What hobbies do you have that you enjoy? 
4	Beyond doing things like watching movies and playing video games, productive/constructive hobbies I enjoy include:\n\nPlaying and writing music\n\nWriting poetry\n\nHiking\n\nBaking
3	Competition shooting and reloading. I also dabble in gunsmithing. After the buzzer goes it's just me and the gun, working through the challenge each stage presents. While reloading the repetition and necessary attention to detail keeps me focused. Finally, there is nothing more satisfying than solving problems with a mechanical device that had months or years of engineering go into it.
3	[deleted]
2	I personally like to write poetry.
2	I hike with my dog and partake in cooking and mycology/mushroom classification. It's pretty relaxing and I enjoy being able to see a mushroom and know he species/if it's poisonous or edible. It's small but rewarding. The cooking is enjoyable because I can taste the results of different spice combinations. It's my way of building on Si.
2	Homebrewing my own beer. Good mix of science and alcohol
2	Video games, Youtube, and recently rock climbing.
2	Watch TV, reddit, FB, play games on my iPhone when I'm on the toilet, customize my HTPC, get better performance out of my home network, learn more about linux, and build antennas to get a better wifi signal. :)\n\nOther than that, not much.
2	I enjoy video games and I have just started collection Pokemon cards if you consider that a hobby lol.
2	Reading, Netflix/Amazon Prime Video, running, biking, hiking, learning about investing/personal finance, gaming (city builders and strategy), reddit and reading internet articles
2	Write, play video games, learn, play instruments, read, listen to music, archery, build models, design machines and cities using autoCAD, and my favourite; research 2nd world war history and armoured vehicles.
2	Playing guitar, doing Karate, reading, doing anything outdoors, and watching Game of Thrones....if you consider that a hobby.
4	Favourite TV shows	What are your favourite TV shows and have you identified any ISTJ's in any of them?
2	Game of Thrones: Ned Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Brienne of Tarth.\n\nBreaking Bad: I'm not sure. Mike?
2	Never thought about the characters before but I'll try\n\nGame of thrones: Ned Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Brienne of Tarth (stolen from /u/Finite_Lix but I can't see it any other way)\n\nStargate SG1: Teal'c, maybe Daniel?\n\nStar Trek DS9:  Dr Bashir, O'Brian\n\nFrasier:  Niles, Frasier\n\nBig Bang Theory:  Loenard\n\nCommunity:  Maybe Annie?\n\nSouth Park: not seeing it
2	Game of Thrones. I think Stannis is an ISTJ if i'm not mistaken. \n\nChuck \n\nNCIS/Law and Order/CSI/Hawaii Five-O\n\n\n
1	Shows:\nLaw & Order franchise, Doctor Who, Britcoms (As Time Goes By, Thin Blue Line, Are You Being Served?, My Hero, AbFab), Torchwood, Primeval, Sherlock, Buffy, Big Bang Theory.\n\n\n
1	Family guy\n\nJoe?\n\n
1	Game of Thrones \n\nScrubs 
1	Game of Thrones, Dawson's Creek, Saved by the Bell, Air Crash Investigations
1	Breaking Bad, True Detective, Stranger Things, Mr Robot. Not sure if there are any ISTJs in them. I also like Peaky Blinders and I'd be curious to know if anybody else thinks the protagonist is ISTJ.
1	King of the hill, hank is the textbook istj
1	Game of Thrones: Little Finger for sure (Petyr Baelish)\n\nDevious as he may be he is definitely logical and introverted. 
1	Game of thrones: Brianne of Tarth. \nArcher: Lana King\nOutlander: Jenny Fraser\nBrooklyn 99: Captain Holt
3	Weekly Thread: Who's your favourite artist that you've seen live?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: Who's the best singer or band that you've seen live?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
5	Franz Ferdinand, in a medium-sized venue (more intimacy which is great?)\nAlso the only ever band I've seen live
3	I actually really really dislike concerts. I have no idea what to do there. Like, just stand around and listen to the music? It's a lot of hassle to get there and it's expensive for good seats and food and beverage. I don't do drugs, so that's out of the experience. I guess there are some good artists that would put on a good show which is the only reason I would want to see them since listening at home would be much more enjoyable to me. \n
3	Switchfoot. Seen them a few times and they never fail to put on a show. 
3	I haven't actually seen that many musicians live, but I did see Andrew Bird, and he is fantastic. Small place, he was excellent at using looping machines, using his feet to hit the buttons. Only bad thing about it was it was standing only and my feet killed by the time he was on stage.
3	Die Antwoord had the best show I've ever been to.  So much energy.  Everyone was dancing and really into it,  it was just amazing.  That said,  I am certain the only reason I enjoyed myself was because I was outside,  back on the grass away from the crowd. 
3	Roger Waters performing The Wall in 2010. That being said, that will probably get dwarfed by everyone at the Desert Trip festival (Waters included) this October.
3	I saw Watain and Mayhem live which was pretty great, pretty standard black metal show. Pig blood sprayed on crowd, severed animal heads on stage, the works.
2	Five Finger Death Punch
2	I guess it would have to be Styx
2	The Wood Brothers! One of my favorite groups and I've been lucky to see them several times in some very intimate venues.
2	Goo Goo Dolls, at my state's fair
2	Wildhoney, at a tiny place in Baltimore.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2y28uvZxW4
2	I hate concerts. If I wanted to listen to music I would listen to it for free at home. 
2	Coming from a drunk entp, what would you do?	They gave me a car for graduation. \nOkay? Cool. \n\nI had to buy a new tire and whatever,  but the car is good. \n\nThen one day,  my mom said "It'll cost us $1,000 to get our tags on our new car renewed. We're going to borrow your plates til then. Just get a new bill of sale each month and you'll be fine."\n\nMe being a naive, my parents would do me no wrong, 18 year old,  I was okay with it. \n\nI got pulled over last night and now I have a ticket. \n\nMy parents are acting like it's my fault just because I didn't get a new bill of sale. But I should have never been in that situation to begin with. \n\nBut the bill of sale situation is fucked anyways. \n\nThey want me to get one, say that I bought the car on the first of this month and forge my mom's signature. \n\nThat's a federal document if I'm not mistaken and that's 5 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. \n\nWhat would you do?
5	I would suggest dealing with the situation legally; show up to court (if you have a court date), maybe appeal to the judge, but be entirely ready to pay the full amount. \n\nThe appeal would be something like this: "Against my better judgment, I allowed someone to convince me that it would be okay to [insert crime on the ticket]; I am now seeing that they were not correct." If the fine is prohibitively large, perhaps something like, "Right now, I am financially strapped, so if the court has any mercy, I would appeal for it -- that said, I am the one who committed this crime and if necessary, I am ready to work out some kind of arrangement as to be able to pay the full amount." Either that, or I'd skip the appeal and just pay it.\n\nThe reason being that, whether your parents talked you into it or not, you still did the crime (yes?). Lying to not get into trouble for that crime only gets you further into trouble and makes you less sympathetic if you get caught. Taking full responsibility not only makes you more sympathetic, but it also has the benefit of likely grinding out any goodwill you have towards people who would ask you to do something shitty, risky, and potentially expensive just so that they can avoid something expensive and inconvenient.\n\nNext time your parents ask you to do something like this, if the fine was expensive, you can say something like "After paying an $[x] ticket to allow you to avoid renewing your car tags, I have decided it is less expensive for me, financially and in terms of my record, to simply provide you a month's worth of bus fare. Here you go, and here are the schedules. I'll have my plates now."*\n\n*Depending on how snarky and irate you are with them, of course. This is the "I am not a fucking cushion, so fuck you for asking me to be your cushion against the realities of the world -- which now I'm dealing with on your behalf. I have enough realities of my own, thanks" snark in me coming out... Usually I would try to be more diplomatic...\n\nOr, if it was less expensive, perhaps just call them out on their willingness to ask you to commit a crime (which depending on the severity, assuming you're convicted, makes it very difficult to get a job in many cases), just so they don't have to renew their tags.\n\n>But I should have never been in that situation to begin with.\n\nYou're 100% right on this count. Your parents should not be leaning on you to be the responsible adult support in the situation. They should not be blaming you for getting into trouble while helping them out. They should not be asking you to commit crimes just so they can avoid taking a bus, renewing their tags, walking, or whatever less convenient form of travel they have available to them. It's not that "woe, do not break the law! omgz so terrible!!" It is that doing something illegal involves risk, so if you're going to do it, you should at least be getting something good out of it, like a buzz. This is asking you to take all the risk, and they take all the reward. That is what really irritates me about it.\n\nThat they are acting like this is your own fault is kind of ironic, to be honest -- because it kind of is, but  not in the way they're describing. (And I don't mean "your fault" in a contemptuous, blaming, negative way -- I mean it in a objective, sympathetic sense, in that you did something and then got caught doing it.) It was "your fault" for trusting them. It is a completely understandable mistake! You shouldn't have to defend yourself against the selfishness of your parents, so no wonder it isn't something you expected to learn in this scenario. That is terribly shitty. At the same time, you can assure them with a smile that you learned your lesson when they ask you to do something else along these lines and you tell them, "No thanks, I like my money, the relative safety of complying with reasonable laws, and my freedom."
28	Is there a guide somewhere called "How to Comfort Others As An ISTJ"?	Because all I know how to do is to listen well. I feel completely useless otherwise.
16	Offer to do something for them or just surprise them with their favorite food, drink, etc.\n\nOr, as Sheldon Cooper would do, offer them a hot beverage.
13	Biggest challenge I've had as an ISTJ in this area is knowing when someone wants solutions and when they just want emotional comfort. I am a problem solver by default. When my ISFJ wife comes to me with problems, my default used to be to try find solutions. Over time, I've realized that it can frustrate her as it makes her feel like I think she isn't smart enough to find the solutions herself. By just listening and empathizing sometimes, it's helped a lot. I still struggle with understand when one is appropriate vs the other but I'm getting better. 
7	My girlfriend is ISTJ. Historically, I'm not easily comforted by anyone when I'm most in need of comforting. I (INFJ) usually need to be alone in those times.\n\nShe actually manages to comfort me with physical touch. It really helps that she doesn't talk or ask me to talk in those times.  \n\nI don't think anyone else I've known has actually been able to comfort me in a way that works for me. She does.\n\nThere's a whole realm of non-verbal interaction that ISTJs often excel at. If the person responds to that realm, that could be a real asset IMO.
6	As someone who has looked up various comfort scenarios as they come up, active listening and patience are pretty much always the advice. The way I've internalized it is that when you're suffering because of something significant (e.g., loss of a loved one), there is nothing small or quick that can be done to fix it. The only thing that can help is suffering with company -- and for that to be possible, the company has to be willing to suffer alongside you. \n\nBasically, I feel like I'm probably doing a better job when I feel uncomfortable and inadequate to what they're going through. Sitting with them as they suffer isn't going to feel successful and useful, it is probably going to feel at least slightly lost and helpless... but in that way, you're not dragging them out of their misery to make yourself feel more comfortable (which most guides speak out against -- e.g., "cheer up!" advice), you're climbing into the misery and sitting next to them as they live through it.\n\nMore active listening helps too -- gently ask questions, help them tell you how they feel. Reflect what you are hearing back to them, or ask clarifying questions. Use their responses to guide you -- if they respond readily, with energy, in detail, I take that to usually mean that they are at least not opposed to talking about it. I still give ample pauses after their replies usually, because that usually feels most respectful, though it is really more of a felt vibe. And if they respond minimally, unenthusiastically, or seem dispirited and listless in their response, I usually am silent with them and let them decide when or if we start talking again.\n\nYou might ask if [x] would help them -- but don't overdo this, because you don't want to communicate, "I need you to feel better now." 
4	I try to give useful advices.
2	Being a good listener is not useless. It's actually really nice when someone just listens and encourages you to say everything you need to say. An ISTJ does this for me and I appreciate it immensely. (Though I feel bad because I know feeing doesn't their realm.)\n\nWhat's also really nice is when they help me sort through it group my feelings? It's like they listen and clarify and put everything in little boxes and for some reason that's comforting. 
3	"IT'S GOING TO BE ALRIGHT!!!" usually works for me.
3	Someone who listens is often all someone needs (my SO is ISTJ and  when I feel down, the fact that he listens is the most important thing).\n\nso don't feel useless :) 
3	I know how you feel!  I listen, but then it seems like all I can do is relate a similar experience I had, and what I did to get through it.\n\nI'm afraid that comes off as me always turning the focus on me, but that's not true.  I'm just trying to relate and offer advice.  I only mention how I handled something so they know where the advice is coming from and know it's personal.\n\nTypical conversation would go:\n\nThem:  "My boss tells me to do something *now* and I am already doing something for another boss, it's really frustrating!"\n\nMe: "I once had two bosses that did that to me, and so I ended up meeting with them together to discuss how to prioritize my time."\n\nThem:  "Why do you make everything about you?"\n\nMe:  "I'm not... it's not..." \n\nArgh!
2	I need this guide too but my go to is giving presents.  I speak love through gifts not words, I find it better to just not say things. haha
0	ISTJ 25m broke it off with an INFJ 27f (me)	Hi, I'd like some advice on what to do in my situation...\n\nIt is a very VERY complicated situation...I'll try to summarize it as best I can and answer comments/questions with anything I might've left out.\n\nWe'll call him Tom. Tom is 25, Taurus, ISTJ. Tom has had one hell of a year thus far. He was with his ex for 1.5 years, engaged as well. They were trying to have a baby towards the end of their relationship, she ended up breaking up with him mid-April. Beginning of May, she informed him she was pregnant. He was so happy. She never gave him a single bit of proof that the baby ever existed. She wouldn't let him go to the ultrasounds, wouldn't give him pics of the ultrasounds, wouldn't meet him for coffee or nothing. Beginning of June, she had the 8 week ultrasound (June 8th) and said the baby had no heartbeat. Miscarriage supposedly. Still no proof it ever existed either. I met Tom mid-May, we met on Tinder. Tom has always been honest with me from the beginning. He was not looking for a relationship, he honestly just got on Tinder to match with as many chicks as he could to have lots of sex...he was hurting. He told me, "I never expected to find someone as awesome as you on Tinder." He cancelled his Tinder subscription as well. (The one for 100 likes a day or something?) He'd always tell me things like I deserve a guy like him and he's a "cookie cutter" example of what I need, etc. Anyways, Tom had recently moved to my area with his friend/boss (never a good idea to live with your boss.) He ended up quitting/getting fire from his job mid-June (he gave his boss an ultimatum, give him the money he owes him or fire him. He fired him.) Due to his roommate being his boss...he moved back to his old apartment he was still paying rent on and had a another month left in the lease. Before moving, he asked me my thoughts on him moving back to the old apartment since it is an hour away and he was not sure if I'd be okay with it. I told him we'd manage and for him to do what he needed to do. So we moved him back there. His vehicle also broke down around this time and I lent him my spare car for the month it took him to fix his.\n\nTom and I hung out solid for 2.5 months. We practically lived with each other. In the 73 days we were seeing each other, we only spent 14 days apart mostly due to my dad flying into town every couple weeks and a 4 day gap during our initial meeting. He introduced me to his grandparents and I introduced him to my dad and friends. Every night we were together we would cook hour long meals from scratch together, watch tv together, play video games together, go to sleep and cuddle together (we rarely had sex, maybe once every two weeks if that), I'd wake up and make him coffee in the morning and we'd figure out what we wanted to do for breakfast and chill and watch tv together before I headed to work. We watched a lot of Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, it was great! Not going to lie though, we did have our issues. June 6th was a big one when we talked about his future baby and that we needed to stop having sex and kissing but we'd still be friends. At that time, he really fought to keep me in his life because I wasn't sure I could handle it. I knew my emotions were already strong for him. June 8th, things changed when the baby had no heartbeat. We were a team that complimented each other. We would talk and work things out whenever we could. He did tell me though that he wasn't and isn't ready for an official relationship. We were however, exclusive with each other. He's the one that brought that up. At the end of July, we moved him into his grandparents house because he still had no job and didn't want to re-new his lease at his old apartment. Before deciding...he once again asked me my thoughts on him moving into his grandparents. I told him same thing again, do what you need to do and we'll manage.\n\nGetting to when the current issues arised. When he found out about the baby, he was also dealing with an issue in the military. He'd been in the military for 4 years and had been out since January '16. He had to go in front of a board June 5th and ended up getting back into the military for another year. He wanted to do this to get insurance and benefits and such for the baby. July 30th, he left for the military Annual Training. He kept in contact well for a couple days, messaging me every night. Then missions started and his texting became less and less. Which was fine, I knew he'd be busy. I told him to text me whenever, night or day, didn't matter. Not to worry about waking me up or bothering me at all. I'm pretty flexible. He got back August 20th, didn't message me so I finally messaged him at 7pm\n\nMe: How are you was doing\nHim: Good to be home\nMe: Glad to hear it\n\nI was a bit hurt and mad that he didn't immediately let me know he was home. But I let it go.\n\nMe: Any plans tonight?\nHim: Yep dinner with my brother at his house.\nMe: Sounds nice, better than MREs ;) Hit me up later if you like. It'd be nice to talk with you, but I don't want to be a bother when you've just come back and are being with family. \n\nNext day, I sent him a text on my way to work, \nMe: I hope you are doing well. Have a great day. \nHim: Doing well, what are you doing\nMe: Driving to work.\n\nWe did some basic chit/chat that didn't feel too natural. He just seemed terse/aggressive moreso than normal. I tried to let it go but also wanted him to meet my mom while she was in town for the week. \n\nMe "Idk where we're at currently or how you're feeling on things...kinda wanted you to meet my mom while she's in town...but Idk either." My mom has been away for 7 months doing chemotherapy, she was only able to come home for 2 weeks before having to go back for surgery. He was only home during her final week. It was kinda a big deal to me.\n\nHim: "Yeah I feel what you're saying and we can talk about all of that. I mean in my mind nothing should have changed. I'd rather be simple than make things complicated. I want to figure out my living situation and career. And that is what takes up most of my mind. These last three weeks I worked really hard and reaped some rewards. I know you've been working hard too. But let's chill on the upgraded thoughts about bf gf stuff."\n\nMe: Could we meet up over the next few days and talk/walk?\nHim: sure. \n\nThat was always our way of 'serious' type of communication. Walking and talking. Walking is a very positive, forward moving experience and helps to get things out easier. We would always walk and talk. I left it at that...for 4 days...no contact...Then contacted him asking how the hunt for work was going. He said hunting atm. \n\nThis is getting a lot longer than I thought it would but trying to be thorough.\n\nAnyways, it was at this point I decided to try to figure things out a bit more. It felt like he was hiding something. INFJs follow their feelings a lot. \nMe: I get the feeling that I should just mail you your stuff back. (I had his ps4 while he was at Annual Training to play Doom and Fallout 4) \nHim: I would like my ps4 back at some point.\nMe: I know you'd like your ps4 back, wouldn't keep it from you, that's why I suggested mailing it instead. I feel bad still having it. (Given he's been back for 6 days.)\nHim: It's not a huge deal I'm just under motivated to get it atm. I've been working other things. You could mail it if that's easier. Idc\nMe: Well, my parents fly out tomorrow and I got Saturday off still. I don't know what your plans look like...\nMe: Ultimately, I don't know if you want to see me again.\nMe: I'll wait until you're ready to talk. Have a goodnight.\n\nThe next day, he contacted me, asking if I wanted to come over after work. I said sure. I went over there and things were a bit awkward...caught up on our 3 weeks apart, talked about the pinworm story all over the news in Atterbury, Fort Knox, and MUTC, he played Doom on his ps4 I returned and I watched. We went to bed, he didn't move to cuddle at all. Hour or so later, I woke up to him jerking it in a half sleep state, took over for him, finished him ;) I know he likely hadn't gotten any good release in awhile. After a bit, he was still a rock, so I mounted up hoping that might get /something/ out of him, nope...dead fish...no fun so I just rolled over and tried to sleep. Next morning, I stayed in bed. He got up, played video games for a few hours, went outside and smoked with his grandad and I showered up. Then he came in, showered up, changed clothes, gave his grandma a hug and me a hug saying he was heading into town to get his phone fixed (data issues) and get some contacts. I walked out to his car with him\n\n(this convo is based off memory, so don't quote these exactly unless it has quotes)\n\nMe: Want to come over to my place tonight?\nHim: No, I really need to get things taken care of here. I don't know what I'm doing.\n*he paused and played with his keys, not looking at me*\nHim: I don't want a relationship right now. I have nothing to offer you, I literally have nothing going in my life. I have nothing to my name. I can't promise anything down the road. I don't even see a road.\nMe: It's not about what you have to offer...*sighs* \nHim: "We should end this before we fuck each other up..."\nMe: "Can you clarify that?"\nHim: "I've already fucked up my life...I have nothing...I have no idea what I'm doing..." (I took this as, he's ruined his life and doesn't want to ruin mine)\nAfter a bit of similar things being said, he continued asking me what I want from him, I told him I don't want anything from him. I even brought up last night and he said I was trying to sleep...at least you got yours...I told him, dude, you were jacking off next to me...he said he was probably scratching his balls...I'm like, you were moaning!! -_-\nAlso told him,\nMe: I don't think I can just be friends at this point\nHim: I don't want to be friends. I don't want any friends right now. I want to be alone. I went out drinking with my cousin the other night, saw a bunch of friends at the bar and I just didn't want to be there. I didn't want to be around anyone.\nHim: I don't know what you want...\nAnd that's when I shut the door on him and walked into his grandparents house, got my things and came back out, he was gone. I left.\nI sent him texts on my way home. 3 texts over the course of my hour drive in an upset state.\nMe: I'd been trying to help you, always have been. Wasn't trying to fix you. The condo is 2 bedrooms, even thought about offering the 2nd to you by splitting rent. It'd get you around Indy for jobs and get you out of your grandparents and no lease to sign so you could always leave whenever you wanted to. But I know how it'd sound if I even tired to bring it up. I've merely wanted to support you in whatever you're doing.\nMe: I figured if we did stop, after the 3 weeks would be a good time to do so. Be happy you don't have feelings...so many times you did lead me on, stupid of me to love someone so quickly...coworkers and friends were right, in the end I'd get hurt...Idk why I bother hoping\nMe: Made it home. I really hope your life gets better Tom. I'm sorry for everything you've been through thus far. If ever you do need a friend. i would gladly be there to help you. Keep in touch. Hit me up in a few months or whatever if you like.\n\nThis was on Saturday, August 27th...Tuesday the 30th, I mailed him his fav Dark Chocolate Brownies with a note saying Hope you are doing well!\n\nI want to fix things with him...but I know he needs time...but I'm not even sure what to do. Anyone on here that knows INFJs know that we want to do anything in our power to help...but you can't help an ISTJ lol they typically just don't want it! I've never told him what to do and what not to do. I've always been there to give him support and reassurance. He's always valued me greatly and has told me such. I worry he is depressed, that being at the annual training gave him too much time to think. He doesn't know if he wants to get a job, he doesn't know if he wants to go back to school to finish his /last/ semester up for his degree, he doesn't know what he wants to do. He knows he wants to move out of his grandparents asap. I'm buying a condo...2 bedrooms...wouldn't mind if he became a roomie, but he'd read a LOT into that if I asked lol\n\n\nTL;DR: Read it lol I seriously cut this down from 12 pages in Microsoft word to 5 pages. I can't think what else to cut! Everything seems relevant since everything happened in 3 months time rather quickly.\n\nTo me (INFJ) what he needs to do, is trust in me a bit. Work on planning what he wants to do, work on shopping around for jobs in the Indy area, save his money from military duty and wait until I get the condo in October, move in with me (no deposit, no lease, no paying 2 months in advance, etc), get a job in the area, and go from there. Give it a /try/ and see how it goes. If he's still not happy with where he is in a few months, move out. No lease, nothing to tie him down. BUT his trust has been broken...badly...he's been hurt. Rejected by the person he's loved the most and rejected by his unborn child that may or may not have existed. He's told me before that he doesn't want to get hurt again. Nor do I. Yet here we are.\n\nI'm planning on calling him tomorrow...see if he'll come over to my place Saturday and we can cook dinner, watch more DBZ Super, and walk/talk. INFJ and ISTJ...talking about emotional shit...never goes very well.\n\nPeople tell me to move on, people tell me to wait a few weeks or a month or two, my therapist says to follow what I feel I should do, I worry about him in this state, what do you guys feel I should do? I've talked to one other ISTJ so far, he said message him a few times a week, let him know you are still there and around, don't try to talk about you or us or we, etc. So I haven't.\n\nI know I haven't covered /everything/ but I feel I've covered most of it lol
8	What?? He's not into you, even if he was into you, he's an ass! Move on! Why did you jerk him off if he treated you like that? Why are you pursuing him so hard? He sounds miserable. This isn't about personality types. This is about him being childish and avoiding everything and you being way too eager over nothing.
6	> Anyone on here that knows INFJs know that we want to do anything in our power to help...but you can't help an ISTJ lol they typically just don't want it!\n\nVery true. \n\nThe situation is complicated. ISTJs are very about having a plan. When your original plan and even your b and c dont work out it can cause a lot of stess. So, the only solution is to get another plan. The only way to do this is to do some "soul searching" and have some alone time to work it out.
2	I can only really speak for myself here, but from what I've seen, I think most of us ISTJs are fairly independent and want to be free to take the actions we need to take in a given moment without worrying about others depending on us. We don't take commitment lightly -- it is a *lot* of responsibility to enter a relationship where your actions have huge impacts on the other person.\n\nYou say this:\n\n>I told him I don't want anything from him.\n\nBut then you also text this:\n\n>Be happy you don't have feelings...so many times you did lead me on, stupid of me to love someone so quickly...coworkers and friends were right, in the end I'd get hurt...Idk why I bother hoping\n\nClearly, you do want something from him. And yes, it "isn't that much!" in your mind, just a bit of attention, and love, and gratitude, or whatever else have you. But you have to remember, he is not the same kind of person as you. For him, those things can be huge and draining.\n\nWhen I am upset, I want to be alone. I isolate. It brings me peace, clarity, comfort. (Note: This isolation is isolation from intimacy, not from people themselves -- I can be at a cafe, or hang out with a casual friend who has their own life and who would be just fine if I moved to another country and never saw them again -- that is still me, alone, around someone, not me *with* someone.) When I read the texts you said you sent him, they're screaming for affection, for him to signal how he feels, to reassure you you matter to him, etc. If he already feels depleted, I can see why he did not respond to reassure you -- and this is not to say that it isn't okay that you felt hurt or like you wanted more. It is just to say that I can see where you would be incompatible with each other based on your need for affection and his need for space.\n\nAnd consider his point of view -- you were already deeply hurt by how he responded when you had no committed relationship (even if you had an intense 2.5 months), and he is probably regretting leading you on. Just like you said. He got wrapped up, he was wounded, and he temporarily reached out for connection. Now he is feeling a backlash that I can empathize with -- when you connect with others, you cannot just use them to satisfy your own needs. To a degree, if they satisfy yours, you are obliged to satisfy and attend to their needs as well. And realizing he was not capable or willing to do that, he is probably regretting those intense 2.5 months because they led you to feel strongly enough about him that when he needed to withdraw and simply was not able to be around others, it wounded you. He may not realistically be capable of more right now, and so it makes sense to me that he would cut it off now -- you'd only be more upset if you had been together for 7-8 months, right? Or if you moved in together? Or if you were officially dating?\n\nIt seems like you get some satisfaction and self-worth from helping and assisting others -- I have a best friend who is an INFJ who is very much the same. However, you may want to [read this article on boundaries](https://markmanson.net/boundaries). If you give, needing him to give back, that is not good boundaries. I will admit that some of us ISTJs (certainly I fall into this) can be too aggressive about setting boundaries. But what I see in my INFJ friend, and in your story, is that there were unspoken expectations that were not unreasonable from your worldview -- that you would both nurture each other and give to each other and be a partnership to some degree -- but that neither of you were relating well as independent individuals who are fine without each other, but who work together well as allies. For me, I probably go too far in independence, but it makes me all the more resistant to someone depending on me too strongly. \n\n>Anyone on here that knows INFJs know that we want to do anything in our power to help...\n\nThis is sweet, but part of helping can sometimes be being ready to let go. It is the friends of mine who I know could live without me that I feel safest letting into my life. It means that I can be myself, that I can satisfy my basic needs for solitude and isolation when they arise, or that I can make the decisions I need to make to have a fulfilling life, without it destroying or significantly harming their own well being. \n\nI want them to be able to be fine without me, because then I know that they can be fine with me -- because I am not always going to be emotionally available, engaged, giving, etc. I can be, when I know those things are given freely, but the second I know they are expected or demanded, I (unfairly!) resent it. I know that the other person has needs, and it isn't fair to resent them for having those needs. But if they lean on me so hard that I know I can't move without letting them fall, all I become consumed with is the fact that I need to stand in that one space... and I *need* to escape. Need on the same basic, in-your-bones level that you need connection, community, friendship, intimacy, etc.\n\n>To me (INFJ) what he needs to do, is trust in me a bit. \n\nHe does -- he trusts that you can be hurt by his pursuit of his needs. What do you think he needs to trust you for?\n\n>Work on planning what he wants to do\n\nHe wants to be alone. Maybe to find clarity, to find himself, to find peace. Maybe he is depressed. Who knows? However, he did state what he wants to do, and right now, it is to be alone.\n\n>Give it a /try/ and see how it goes. If he's still not happy with where he is in a few months, move out. No lease, nothing to tie him down. \n\nExcept your feelings. And I don't mean that how it probably sounds -- I don't mean that to say your feelings are unreasonable. I mean that to say that your feelings are not irrelevant or meaningless to him. Hurting you is a real cost to this, as much as money or legal inconvenience. In fact, if he is anything like myself, probably more. Money and inconvenience are... whatever. Heavy boxes you just put your legs into when you lift and haul them. The feelings and vulnerabilities of others... they're like handing glass sculptures when your hands are numb from the cold.\n\nDo you really think him moving in with you, you taking care of him if he lets you, you guys even perhaps getting closer and having some intimacy again, and then him slowly deciding he isn't happy and becoming more and more distant, and then becoming even aggressive about rejecting you when you seek him out more strongly because you feel hurt, and then he finally decides he is not happy with it and he moves out suddenly because "no lease, nothing to tie him down" -- do you really think that you would be okay with that? *Seriously?* \n\nI hope your answer is no, because if it is, "Yeah, I would totally be fine with that! Really! I swear!" then why aren't you okay with things as they are now? Why weren't you okay with him needing some space, not wanting a relationship, not wanting connection, not replying to your texts? You are you -- I am not you. You know yourself far better than I do. At the same time, based on what you've described, if things went down like above (where he starts to freeze you out and then moves out after a few months because he is unhappy), you would be crushed. You'd wonder *why* he wasn't happy -- you were helping him, you were cooking for him, you did your best to give him space when he asked for it, you had offered him your place to stay with no strings attached, so why wasn't he happy? Why is he leaving? You'd want to know why. You'd want to know if you could fix it and you'd want him to let you try. \n\nBut you see... That's it -- that is the part that I imagine not making me happy in that situation. It is that you are invested. And if other people are invested, other people can get hurt. It isn't that I don't care if they get hurt or not... it is that I know that for a certain level or type of attachment (e.g., one that needs me to be on, affectionate, etc., even only half the time) it is *inevitable* that I hurt them. It is that I *do* care -- and *that* is why I try not to get people invested, or if they've become invested, I will end it as soon as I notice because investments only grow with time. That is why I need someone that can stand on their own, that can shrug their shoulders and say, "Okay, fine, be alone for a while. Hit me up if you want, or don't, whatever." Then I know that in a week, if I hit them up, I am not committing to them, committing to attending to their needs. I am just reinitiating a contact that I can honestly feel ready to stop at any time. And if they can tolerate those long spells away, I can slowly, slowly build trust and commitment for them, because it will reassure me that my patterns of existence aren't hurtful or toxic to them. However, if they're already getting wounded by me, then I know that it will not be a good idea for things to continue. \n\n>He's told me before that he doesn't want to get hurt again. Nor do I. Yet here we are.\n\nYes, there you are. And if I were him (though I'm not :)), reading this, my thought would be that I am listening to you -- I don't want to hurt you again either, and whether you believe it or not, this is the least hurt I can cause you. Because if we connect again, I will need this space in large swaths, and I may need to leave you forever because it just isn't working even though you did nothing wrong, and I may freeze you out without explaining... If I'm hurting you by being away from you now and that is your argument for connecting again, then you're misunderstanding, because I am telling you I *will* be away from you a lot of the time. And that I may leave *without* the reassurance of reconnecting -- so if you're okay with it, just as long as I come back... I am saying that you need to be okay with me leaving and never coming back. You need to be okay with that to be okay with me... and if that hurts, I am doing you a favor by not getting you deeper into this.
2	I think you should get a new therapist and focus on getting yourself healthy.  
1	(ISTP here) you sound like you're pushing a relationship that he doesn't seem all too comfortable to be in at the moment. I would give him time, and not push anything,  because I know if I was in that state and then someone kept trying to initiate talk/comfort/etc. almost everyday, I wouldn't feel too comfortable. I don't know you, but the way you word it and how you keep pushing things in a way of "talk to me!", makes me think you're kind of emotionally manipulative.
1	I don't normally post on Reddit but this post made me sign up and respond. As an ISTJ myself I can see that you are trying to work through your feelings and understanding of this ISTJ that you have found; one thing I can say is that, as logical thinkers that we ISTJ's are, understanding our feelings and emotions can be very hard especially when we literally say what we feel. I agree with a lot of the other posts on here that you need to give him some time and let him work through his problems first, you can't help him find a solution to his problems if he does not want it or if he does not see that he needs help. As an ISTJ myself I tend to fall into the trap where I will go down a wrong path and I don't see it till I get a smack to my head and I feel that he is in the same position having started down a path and now he is starting to see that it's not the right path and it's beating the life out of him but he can't seem to find the right way to correct this and that is probably the hardest part. ISTJ's tend to want to find out the answers for themselves which makes it hard for others to help us as we feel that we don't need help and that we can find a way to fix the situation but one thing that I have learned is that asking for help can be very hard but it is needed at times and this took me a long time to figure out since I can be a bit stubborn (I guess this has something to do with me being an ISTJ). In your situation I would give him some time and space to find out where he is in life as it seems that he is a bit lost and is trying to find himself and this can be difficult but once he finds himself again he may want to let you back into his life and try to fix the situation but that's my opinion here so it may or may not work out; for your sake I hope it does though!  :) \n\nOn another note though; don't try to push him to get help (even if that help is from you) unless he feels that he needs it as this may just cause him to put up a wall and pretend to be getting better while actually not going anywhere; I have done this in the past and it took me some time to realize that it was the wrong way to go about things.

9	College Life	I'm a super introverted person. I spent all of middle and high school hating everyone around me. I was clinically depressed in my Sophomore and Junior years of high school. I had a couple friends, but I've known them since I was a little kid, and now I don't know anyone.\n\nI'm trying to undo the damage I did to myself by being so negative and uninterested in life. Basically, I need to learn how to interact with people again, so my college experience is not the same as my high school one. One benefit here is that I don't hate everyone, so there's that.\n\nI'd also like to point out that I graduated high school early, and have had extremely limited interaction with other human beings in the last 9 months.\n\nAny advice?
4	College will be better than high school for a few reasons. First off, everyone is older and a bit more socially mature and will be more receptive to someone who is quieter. \n\nSecond, people in college tend to have a much better idea of what they are interested in and want to do career-wise. This is important because I'm guessing that you, like myself and many other ISTJs, hate and/or cannot make small talk. \nYour classmates are at college because they're seeking direction for their life, or are already on a career path, so you've automatically got a big topic for casual conversation: their major. Your major is something you pick because it interests you, so naturally it's easy for both parties to talk about which will help the conversation flow. This is also great because it gives you some significant insight into the other person's interests, helping to find like-minded people to potentially be friends with.\n\nLastly, just because of the sheer numbers, your likelihood of meeting people who are more like you and share your interests is much greater, which makes it much less isolated than high school.

2	How to make progress	I hope one of you can point out how you made progress when it comes to the whole unreasonably blaming ourselves for everything. Tips and pointers type thing from personal experience. One of my weaknesses I hear I share with ISTJ's.
3	If it actually was your fault, learn and practice to prevent it next time.\n\nIf it was not your fault, learn and practice to avoid that situation next time.\n\nIf you fear it, do it every day.
3	No one can motivate you enough to start changing. It has to come from within or in a short time you might go back to being your old self.\n\nSelf loathing, deprecation and hate are very strong and negative emotions and will keep dragging you down in your everyday life. In my case, just after waking up I would always wanted to go back to bed and lay there for hours because I would lack the will power to get things done.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm very self driven if I propose myself to it and stick to my rules and methods. That way I've helped myself to get rid of vices and undesirable needs. I still blame me on things but after a long process that involves a lot of thought, analyzing and self discovery.\n\nIn the end it's not about pointing fingers (mostly at yourself) and taking the blame. You have to come to terms with your shortcomings and accept their existence, process them and improve yourself.
2	I'm an INTJ with an ISTJ spouse, and this is the MOST FRUSTRATING THING sometimes.\n\nHe often turns a situation around so he blames himself and feels guilty, when he has nothing at all to feel guilty about. Often it's related to having to say "no" to something. I have to very carefully and casually ask if he feels like, rare example, driving us somewhere (I don't drive). And if he doesn't feel like it, he has trouble saying no so I tell him genuinely that it's no problem, and he *feels terrible and sometimes ends up insisting on doing it anyway.* Even if it really doesn't matter. (This particular problem we have resolved as a side effect of getting rid of our car, but there are other examples.)\n\nIt's related to blame, because later if he doesn't drive me, he'll assume any problems I run into are because of him. Ayayay. \n\nAnyway. This is a discussion I'm interested in following. I'd love to know how to get my spouse to say no without later beating himself up about it.
2	I'm not sure if I'm capable of getting crushes at my age (M, 21). Is this an ISTJ thing?	I'm at the point where I'm not even sure how it's supposed to manifest at this stage of my life, if it's even possible anymore. The last crush I had was when I was 10-12.
12	Hm, I still get crushes, but didn't get a lot of dating experience in my life. (Exactly two people, one of them turned into a long term relationship, neither involved a dating or courting period, neither were crushes to begin with.)\n\nFor me, a crush is a lot like a favorite song, or a well-liked celebrity. They vary in intensity. There are the crushes that are like a song you enjoy whenever it comes on, that you maybe learn on the guitar, that you can sing along with. These are the people who have an attractive face and decent personality. They're appealing like the basic but reliable flavors of the type of food or meal you enjoy, though the kind of meal you can have again later. Likewise, if they get into a relationship, they are pretty easy to get over. They're kind of a matter of convenience, and once they're off the market, they're just... you know, food you recognize as good but aren't in the mood for anymore.\n\nThen there are some rarer crushes who are like a song that takes you up entirely, or like a meal that you've never had before that is magnificent enough that you aren't really hungry for other food for a while after. These are people who.... unpredictably just strike a place in my brain and just stick there. Usually there are things about them I find attractive -- for instance, tall with long limbs, a face that I find attractive but that usually is not classically or universally attractive, and something about their personality or demeanor that is very unique.\n\nFor instance, they might be thoughtful, quiet, friendly and prone to smiling in a kind of small, smirky, to-themselves way (not a kind of judgmental smirk, but more like the little quirky/crooked smile that seems to be about more or different than what is going on without being entirely tuned out). They seem composed, and quietly eccentric in ways that I like, and present in a way that is enjoyable, permissive, and self-possessed, like a cat... Socially, I usually feel some need to perform, like playing a sport -- I can get something out of it and even seek it sometimes, but it is not restive and I need to relax after. But for this person, just like when a cat is gently grooming itself nearby, you don't feel ignored but you don't feel rejected... clearly the cat is trusting you and aware of you, but it is present with you without demanding anything. For me, that allows space to feel very comfortable in myself, and -- if the person is attractive in other ways -- I can be more or less fascinated with and drawn to them like a magnet. I think the person I have in mind for this is a male INFP, at least that is the archetype I was told I was describing.\n\nAnother person I have in mind also has a kind of quiet, self-possessed reservation, but is more outgoing and clearly social. Gene Wilder in Willy Wonka was a little like what I mean -- I can't think of many good examples. But making jokes, engaging, talking, encouraging, interacting... and yet smiling private smiles, watching, keeping part of himself in reserve. The kind of person I might find is also watching others, and might meet eyes with and feel seen by in a way that is interesting and not typical. Someone who, even though they're social, you can get the sense that they still understand the perspective of the observer, and don't overlook the observer.\n\nNow, some of this is my clear romanticizing -- but something about them usually makes me feel differently around them and about them than others. They feel like they are farther outside society, and instead of going in and performing I want to go out and join them outside because it is where I want to be anyways -- I socialize because it is healthy and I have fun with it, but if I can find connection outside in my own element, it is an entirely different and wonderful thing. Or perhaps they seem like they have one foot outside society with me, and one foot inside... then that is also curious because it is like all of a sudden having a friend there or something.\n\nI am more or less satisfied with not interacting with them though. In practice, the first type of crush is someone I have a negative reaction to imagining an actual relationship. It is like my mind skeptically says, "Oh yeah...? I'm sure that would turn out well..." and I just get a sense of all the ways we'd clash and things would go sour. The second kind... I can't picture it, but I don't have a negative reaction to it, it just seems unreal. I usually find that I pine after them, and then when they end up with someone else, I cut off feeling anything, but I'm never entirely successful. If they took an interest in me, I would be terrified of screwing it up if it was in person, and if it was over some other medium, I'd be delighted and *then* afraid of screwing it up... but would really want to engage. Then it would be more like, "What if though? Would it really work out?" \n\nAt this stage in my life, I think I'd need them to make the first move... and I am not sure that is going to be something that ever really changes. I have the vaguest impressions of having early childhood experiences of negative responses when I told people who I was interested in, though it might have been normal childhood teasing that I overinterpreted. But I am not sure I could bring myself to tell someone I liked them unless I wasn't afraid of them... and if I am not a little afraid of them, I probably don't like them enough to approach them.\n\nI hope that isn't too much detail -- you had asked someone else here what it was like for them to get crushes... though truth be told, I maybe/probably would have rambled on a bit anyways.
4	I think this is definitely an ISTJ thing. I don't get them either and find the idea of "love at first sight" laughable. My partner has to grow on me. That's just relationships though, the need for intimacy. I take sex itself as a very casual thing. I don't set nearly as strict standards as I do for somebody I want to be around a lot.
2	It really only follows, doesn't it?\n\nAt least for me, romance implies commitment more than anything. It isn't about excitement or sensational things, it is about trust and understanding and sacrifice. This is not the sort of thing that easily comes in fleeting moments. Furthermore, it's highly relational - I can find someone beautiful or admirable and still feel nothing. What I need is a sense of mutual devotion in some respect.\n\nSo what opens the door to crushes for me is when I get a sliver of that personal intimacy that whets my appetite for more. It isn't common for me. Less often than once a year I'd say, that a new person even gets the "what ifs" working.
2	Some questions: Do you mean to say you don't feel romantic attraction to others? Is there no sexual attraction? Do you feel odd and out of place in social interaction? Do you feel that something is wrong with not having a crush?\n\nTo me, crushes are a special attraction to a particular person, and they don't have to be romantic in nature. \n\nA crush is just thinking that a particular person is really, really neat. Is there no one you feel this way about?
2	The nature of my crushes changed.  I don't get that fluttery giddy feeling anymore, but I still have crushes.
2	My bf is an ISTJ, and he specifically stated to me he never got crushes either. We talked casually for two months, and only after knowing me pretty well he developed a "crush".
1	I cant really say if it is an ISTJ thing, I frequently have someone I like and I dont spend too much time in between crushes, but, I dont really look for love, [I expect that, if it is going to happen, it will come to me.] (http://screamingmbti.tumblr.com/post/149698418284/istjs-are-waiting-for-love-but-you-know-just)
1	What was the personality type of your current or most recent SO? (strawpoll)	
1	Anybody care to mention how the relationship went with the other types?
1	Interesting that the most common relationship (including my own) is with ENFP, the complete opposite type.
6	Where do you derive happiness from?	What sorts of things do you enjoy doing, and where does that happiness come from?
17	-Clean house (spotless)\n\n-Soft bed\n\n-Laptop to surf web with\n\n-Gaming PC within close proximity\n\n-All work completed (no stress)\n\nThat is what would make a large portion of ISTJ's happy
6	Honestly, I don't even know. The only things I can think of off the top of my head that I truly enjoy are traveling, budgeting, and creating schedules. 
4	The part where I'm almost asleep, but not yet. 
3	For me it's activities with a form of long term progression, advancement or learning curve. Basically to have a goal/motivation, but still enjoy doing it in every moment. \n\n- playing piano \n- certain types of PC games\n- software development (private and professional)\n- home improvement, especially planning and building stuff from scratch\n- building wooden model ships\n\nAlso any non-boring alone time, e.g. mountainbiking, enjoying nature and so on.\n\nI can't really relate to the comments about cleaning the house. That's just tedious and has to be done, but I'm always glad to be done with it.
2	Listening to music, playing guitar. \n\nAlso, cleaning my house on my days off of work, and organizing shit. 
2	Does anybody find happiness through a significant other? Not healthy I accept that, I just know I find myself in a unhappy place after a break up.
2	Basically in order from top to bottom\n\n1) Finishing work before a deadline, and using the spare time to organize the next job very thoroughly\n\n2) Mowing the lawn\n\n3) Writing music/poetry\n\n4) Cooking and meal prepping for the week\n\n5) Settling in and watching an even number of episodes of a series\n\nI guess I enjoy the feeling of completing a task in an efficient and repeatable way, so everything has a rhythm. 
1	Laying in bed and listening to music while you contemplate the past and what you're going to be doing in the future.
1	Jesus
1	Spending time outdoors, doing anything in nature. I feel recharged after doing anything outdoors. \n\nSpending time with my husband. \n\nSpending time with friends. \n\nTrying new food, love going to different restaurants and making different recipes too. \n
14	How do you all feel as leaders?	I have frequently seen ISTJs described as possibly outgoing introverts and capable of taking charge. \nMe personally, I think I have moderately good leadership skills and people tend to look at me for guidance due to my ability or my knowledge, however if I can, I always try to follow and not lead, unless there is no one taking charge (and no one willing to) I go forth and try to create order.
27	I feel like ISTJ's are the vice leaders. We don't want the attention or the publicity of leadership roles however the whole time we work away in the background and when shit hits the fan, if the leader bugs out or is not present we are the ones who people look to because of our stable, logical and able to make decisive and clear decisions that take into account the good of the people. \n\n*He says while maintaining that he is a humble person who doesn't brag* :P
8	I like the temporary leadership that either ends immediately or is passed off to someone else. And this is only if I know exactly what is going on before hand.
7	For me, my confidence as a leader depends on the discrepancy in skill between myself and the people I am leading. For instance, I feel comfortable and confident leading and teaching a classroom in a topic I know well, where they are students with much less information. That way, I know that I am best-suited for the position (among those in the room), and that I am helping them to learn more than they knew in the past. I can be engaging, interactive, humorous, etc. in that kind of situation.\n\nI do not choose to lead when there are more equally-matched peers around, unless the people around me seem hopeless and helpless like they want a leader. Usually, though, there is almost always someone who is Type A and who takes over. Which is fine by me because I am not particularly confident or decisive in things -- I am more methodical and complete than driven and single-minded. So I almost never will have a clear vision that I feel compelled to lead people on. I am more territorial than Type A -- with others, I am not directing and controlling. I have absolute control of my solitary sphere of influence, but outside of that, I am fairly easy-going. I avoid getting emotionally invested in things that I can't have sufficient control over.
7	I am in a leadership position in my workplace. The organizational tasks of being a leader and thinking critically to solve problems and approach situations come easy. Acknowledging people's accomplishments or major happenings in a person's life are also easy to do. When there is something specific to address with someone, that is easy too. The hard part seems to be schmoozing for schmoozing's sake or making small talk. If I don't have a specific reason to talk to someone, I have little to say. Doesn't mean I don't like you, just means I'm busy with something else or need some time to process on my own. 
3	It just takes a bit of time to get used to. I'm the manager of a shop with about 35 staff under me.. I think it took a while for them to understand my style of leadership when I started, but we're all cool now :)
2	Weird.  ISTJs tend to be the ones thrust into leadership, rather than taking it for themselves.  I had a couple of interns this summer, and it was the weirdest experience of my life.  I felt confident that I could show them what to do, and guide their research, but it was surprised that they listened to me.   
2	I don't like thinking in the terms of "leader"; much prefer to be a part of a team. That being said, higher ups at my jobs have always said I have leader-esque qualities (I have no problem politely delegating tasks, helping very one out, making sure a job is done well and correctly.) \n\nBut I have no desire to be in management; too much kissing ass and paperwork, not enough productivity for me. 
2	I work at Walmart as a Support Manager and I really like to lead by example when I take charge. 
1	[deleted]  \n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.8680033355574817 \n > This comment has been overwritten.
1	I can do it,but I'd rather leave it to a Te dom or something.
1	Taking charge and leadership are two different things, I'm only good at telling people that ABC needs to be done by the XYZ) but I don't see myself as a mentor or "Transformative" leader. I would rather work for and by myself, thinking about switching to IT, coding or some kind of consulting role.
1	It depends. I don't really work well in groups at school. Mostly because no one at my school really respects or they think I'm stupid or something. I actually have an above average IQ but..I'll just let them think whatever they want. But I usually just go off to the side and do my own thing unless I really care about what we're doing but I still never take charge

11	Any ISTJ who think the world is boring?	Hey!\n\nI'm posting this thread hoping that this forum is only for people with the ISTJ personality type. \n\nAre there any ISTJ that find the world boring? I am currently in a depression so that might be one of the reasons why I feel this way but I suspect it might have something to do with my personality type aswell.\n\nUsually, I play games on the computer but these days, no games can satisfy me. The only games that have been able to satisfy me when I am like this are Danganronpa and Zero Escape. \n\nAre there any suggestions for any unpredictable games? (Like psychological thrillers or horrors), or how to make my life more unpredictable or fun in general?\n\nThanks in advance!
9	Maybe you find the world boring because you are usually playing video games. If something starts to get boring, and you keep trying it, it will just continue to be boring until you hit a milestone. 
3	I feel the exact same right now. I'm currently watching the Spa Grand Prix (Formula 1) and I'm not getting the same buzz any more even though I love Formula 1.\nAs for gaming, I've lost all interesting with gaming. I would get really excited to purchase a new game, play it for a couple of hours, and then just lose interest entirely.\nThe same can be applied to the TV series that I watch, I really want to watch them but I don't, if that makes sense?
1	Unfortunately yes, most of the time. TV, books, Internet, friends, school, everything is boring. Occasionally I find something interesting to learn but doesn't happen often. :( 
1	I never get bored. I wish I was. How old are you?\n\nIf you are depressed, a good thing to do is keep busy. Get a part time job, volunteer somewhere, get involved in local politics. There are always places that need people.
1	I don't really find it boring, usually. I can usually find something to do. If I get really stressed out and move towards depression, I usually become more unbalanced like a top that's gone wobbly, than more typically depressed. So I'll have periods where I just sit and stare at a wall and think. \n\nBut then, at 3am, I might go out to get food, but after closing myself into my car, I'll become quietly soothed by the light of the street lamps shining in through the dew on my car, giving me this gently lit, private, quiet little place, and I'll lay in there for an hour and just stare at how the light is shining on and illuminating things. In those moments, it is like I'm shoved into the front of my mind, all thoughts drop away, and everything around me is suddenly captivating for no reason that I can describe because I don't have any words or language in mind at all.\n\nIt usually is a combination of stress, sleeplessness, isolation, silence, and high-contrast but still-gentle lighting. (For instance, sunrises and sunsets coming in through a window into a dark room at dawn -- that kind of lighting. Where there is still a lot of contrast, but not harsh contrast.) I don't know what it is about those times that gets me into that place, but they are incredibly soothing and restorative. So if it is safe where you're at and you have the means, I'd suggest going somewhere where the setting is different, and you are completely isolated, not just in space, but in time -- like being up at the middle of the night -- and seeing if that gets your head in a different place. \n\nOf course, you know yourself better than I, and I could see some finding that their thoughts turn dark or more negative if they did this, so you might want to take babysteps in that direction, or have a contingency plan for who to contact, or what kind of cheerful or mood-regulating thing you can commit to doing if you think it might send you into a bad spiral, or if you have any suicidality going on.
1	Yes, I do find the world boring. Then again, I have a personality disorder. So, what do I truly know with my messed up perspective of the world? Or is my messed up perspective the objective truth that others can't accept with their subjective biases? \n\nJust kidding, I'm not that convoluted. But, I seriously believe the world is boring. \n\nI would suggest The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, and Game of Thrones Telltale games. They are interactive. 
1	ISTJs being the most abundant of MBTI types, this is pretty expected, isn't this?
1	Maybe when 4th reich comes it won't be so boring :)
7	Need help describing to my SO (m ENFP) why I don't want to "talk it out"..?	Hi team, My SO (ENFP) and I got into a discussion last night about a disagreement we had about a month ago. It takes me time to process my own emotions and evaluate my actions and so I wanted to ask some clarifying questions as to learn from my mistake/s. Anyhow- long story short- I realised that I stuffed up big time in the previous disagreement and learning the exact details of how much I had upset him on that occasion really upset me.\n\nI ended up crying and he became increasingly frustrated that I wouldn't (in my words, couldn't) talk it through with him. He ended up saying that he feels that everything has to be "on my terms" and he's tired of me not talking about it with him and that I'm "shutting him out".\n\nI like to be left alone when I'm upset. I certainly don't want to talk it through, I don't even think i could talk it through... emotions take me at best a nights sleep to process. How do I explain to the ENFP that when i say "I will be fine" while I'm sobbing, that I actually mean it and I'm not shutting him out?
7	It's ok to be an ISTJ but at the same time you need to learn compromise and it can't always be how you best like things. From now until eternity it wouldn't be fair to always say that you don't want to talk about things and you'll be fine if your SO needs at least some talking. Or sometimes the partner just needs some listening and you don't have to talk much at all. You do owe it to your partner to compromise on this IMO. 
5	I have some general thoughts and some specific suggestions:\n\nI have the same need to process things before I can be sure of my own thoughts and feelings. If I don't have the time to let things percolate, then I can't be certain that I have a proper understanding about my feelings. \n\nF types tend to know how they feel and how a situation has impacted them emotionally, so it's probably going to seem strange to your SO that you're not as in tune with that part of yourself. The first thing I would do is make sure he understands this. Otherwise, he'll never give you the space you require to understand your emotions. \n\nAnother thing I find common to ISTJs (and I see at least bit of it in you) is our need to see things through to the end. This is true in terms of projects/tasks but also in terms of emotions. \n\nFor example, when I'm upset about something (ie feel terrible because I've done something "wrong"), I need to roll with that feeling all the way to it's end. I need to hit rock bottom, realize that I'm overreacting, and only then can I bounce back and start to analyze my feelings, thoughts & reactions and makes some use out of the emotion. \n\nSo that's another thing he needs to understand: that when you're in a dark mood, the only way out is through. As the saying goes, "if you're going through hell, don't stop!"\n\nIf you're in the middle of experiencing inner turmoil, and he's trying to get you to talk about it, then there's a couple of options you should consider in the moment:\n* Let him know that you're not in the place to be able to articulate how you're feeling, but that you'll fill him in when you've got a better understanding (make sure you actually follow up, though)\n* Tell him exactly what you're feeling (recognizing that your words may not be able to accurately capture your thoughts at the moment, but that it's good to at least try to give your partner what they need)\n* Ask him what he needs in that moment and see if you can help him get that. (Likely, in the moment, he needs to see that you'll be okay and that you'll make positive progress, and if that's what he needs, then explain the above points to him about what you need)\n\nHope this helps somewhat. 
2	Show him this post 
2	At some time when neither of you is particularly upset, process the process of your interaction -- that is, what does he need in different stages of the interaction and what of that can you provide? What do you need, and what of that can he provide? And then agree on parameters.\n\nIt is one thing to say, "Give me space until I am ready," which traps them in this space of endless and undefined anticipation. Through a very simple addition of detail you can alleviate a lot of that. For instance, writing up notecards or inventing a signal or using your words if you can speak, and setting an expectation like, "Can you give me two hours and if I haven't checked in with you by that time, please check in with me"?\n\nMake sure that you give yourself enough time in this expectation that you would be able to actively engage and meet his needs in that next moment, versus minimally engage -- that is, you may want to give yourself a little too much time rather than too little, because it sounds like he might want and need you to engage with him more strongly in order to be able to cope with the delay and separation.\n\nBasically, communicate, and set the expectation that you will continue communicating about and troubleshooting the process of how you interact (separate from the contents or issues that come up), setting rules, habits, routines, and expectations that fit for you. For instance, if you don't mind gentle touch but you usually avoid people when upset because they force you to talk... and all he needs is to feel connected with you, which he can get through touch... maybe you can do a trial run of cuddling a bit while you're upset, so that you both maintain that sense of connection in a way that is not invasive to you (he has to agree that talking is off limits until a predetermined time or condition that you've agreed on), and that maintains his need to still feel close to you and like the fight hasn't undermined your connection.\n\nOr maybe, you can agree to a certain period of time that you can delay an argument (making this specific allows him to temporarily offload it from his mind/system to a degree versus subconsciously remaining ready to continue that conversation because he isn't clear on when you might be up to discussing it next), and then hearing that he needs to feel that connection and knowing that his love language is [x], you make sure to provide a lot of that when you finally reunite. So if it is touch, you might rub his shoulders and hug him and then tell him what you've worked out. Or if it is words and praise, you might thank him profusely for giving you the time you need and tell him how much you appreciate him being understanding of your needs and letting him know that you know it was difficult for him too, etc. Basically, doing everything you can to give him what he needs, within your ability -- if he agrees that an attempt to reconnect would help.\n\nAlso, a last thought -- take some time to consider how you might react to someone who is behaving like he sees you behaving, and what might upset or frighten you about that... and then deliberately consider that that might not be at all what is upsetting him, or what he needs reassurance for. For instance, when you are saying, "How do I explain to him that I will be fine" I think of my own sense of discomfort and danger when someone else is an emotional wreck and I feel responsible for making them okay -- and being told that they're going to be fine would actually be soothing. So it made me wonder if that is a reassurance that you're perhaps automatically wanting to provide because that's what you would want to hear in his situation. I think it is *very* natural to provide for others what we'd want provided for ourselves -- and in many ways, that is great. But the problem with the golden rule is that sometimes our needs are different.\n\nOne way you might identify his needs would be to see what he provides for you, what he says to you, what he does for you, how he interacts with you, and trying to mirror those things  (at least some of the style, but modified to be within your personality -- so praising him more if you notice he praises you all the time, for instance, or getting him a little gift of love even if it seems trivial, if you notice he is always thinking of you and getting you gifts) and then seeing how he responds or checking in with him how he responds. Make sure he knows you're just trying to learn how to communicate your feelings for him in a way that he hears -- especially if you think he might feel experimented on, or like your efforts are a signal of manipulation instead of genuineness. I know some people that can be a dicey topic area. But by observing how he tries to communicate with you... it is almost certain that he is either treating you how he wants to be treated (or like previous SOs have told him they want to be treated, if he overgeneralized the rule). Likewise, the way you treat him, in at least some ways, is probably the way you want to be treated... even if it isn't what he needs or wants most from you. So examining it from those lenses can be very productive and helpful.\n\nThis is kind of rambling, but I hope it is of some use!
6	Weekly Thread: What's the most important thing that the world needs to solve ASAP?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: What problem do you think needs to be solved immediately at the global level?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
8	Wealth inequality.
6	Long term sustainability of earth 
5	Ignorance
6	Human rights violations both in privacy and corporate accountability as outlined in Geneva Convention IV act II. And I choose Edward Snowden to be the champion of my cause
4	Probably the wealth gap and the death of the American dream in the long run.
4	Global warning,humans can die all they want,earth is more important.
4	North Korea
2	A lack of personal freedoms/ The Nanny State
6	What type of gifts do you like to receive?	I'm curious if there are any types of gifts in particular that ISTJs like to receive.
10	I like gifts that are either useful or based on an inside joke that i have with the gift giver. 
5	I like things that might be usefull. When a gift is just meaningfull and useless I tend to just stash it away, never to be seen not daring to throw it away because it was a gift. 
4	Personally, I like it when the gift-giver takes me out on an experience. Something like bungee jumping, a nice dinner, or just even takes the time out of their schedule to do silly childish things with me (like go sledding or build a pillow fort). Experiences > physical goods
3	Socks
3	I like thoughtful gifts of things that I need or that I'm really going to use.
3	thoughtful or useful gifts.
3	Something practical that has a purpose. 
3	Money
2	When someone asks me what I want, I usually point them to my Amazon and Steam wishlists and say "the higher it is, the more I want it." Also, I'm still the age where I'm gifted money, which I still gladly accept, since it allows to me get stuff from those wishlists and some extra stuff that I can't get on Amazon and Steam.
2	Movie and concert tickets.
2	Plants, or something that I need but won't buy myself
2	If it's from a SO, a planned date doing something I enjoy\n\nIf it's from family, socks or money\n\nIf it's from friends, basically the same as with a SO except leave the romance at home
2	Cash money.
2	I hate getting gifts.
1	Eh... generally I have mixed feelings about gifts. I have a hard time getting rid of things, so I hate getting something functional but that I don't want. It just ends up being saved because I can't throw it away and haven't found the time to find a place to donate it -- which if it was just that one thing, it wouldn't be a big deal, but there are 5-6 other things in the same category. (I don't have that many things, since I acquire things at a slow rate, but if I acquired them quickly, I'd have a lot of problems.)\n\nOne of my favorite gifts was a 9x13 pan, because I had been planning on getting myself a 9x13 pan (I did not have one at the time), and then I just magically had one! It was fantastic! But not something that can be planned for, because if that holiday had been even 2-3 weeks later, chances are I would have gotten a darn pan.\n\nThat is where functional gifts can be problematic for me. For instance. I got an electric scale as a gift from my parents once, which was sweet... but I also had been living alone for 4 years and by that time, out of a need to weigh something a while back, I had gotten myself an electric scale already. If it is critical enough, I'm not going to just twiddle my thumbs or go without until the next holiday just in case. And if it isn't critical enough, then do I need it at all? Because if it is bigger than a tin of coffee, and it has only one very specific function that I'd rarely use (e.g., a juicer, when the only juice I'd be inclined to drink is also something that interferes with medications I take, meaning I'd almost never use it), then I just resent the space it takes up. Though other things I don't mind -- like I don't have fondue often, but damnit, I love fondue when I have it, so I don't mind having a fondue pot around, just for the perpetual possibility of fondue on a whim.\n\nI tend to like money and gift cards, functionally speaking, because I can get something I want. And I really like the modest level of surprise when opening a gift and not knowing what will be on the inside... that surprise part is fun. But the contents themselves... preferably functional or fitting my taste and desires in a way that I had not already fulfilled myself. Which... is hard. I'm not easy to shop for I don't think, even if I am easy going about receiving gifts. The whole thing is a stressful routine and ritual though, unless the other person asks for some ideas and I happen to have several in mind that are not urgent such that it is a surprise for something that I definitely want but definitely haven't gotten.
1	Plain and simple, if I didn't ask for the gift, don't give it to me. Most people in my life right now don't know me very well and gifted me items that I felt guilty for never using or valuing.\n\nHonestly in this point in my life, investing time, effort, and bonding with me is something I'll cherish more than a gift.
1	hopping on the bandwagon of "something practical / useful," but more specifically, I really like office supplies and stationary. For example, my parents don't really understand how gift-giving works (I think one time I got a box of Cheerios), but one Christmas, I got a three-hole punch and it's valuable to me.
5	I find it hard to read jokes or sarcasm, is this an ISTJ trait?	I usually have friends say "I'm joking, jeez!" when I think they're being serious, then realise how gullible I was.
10	Not really, I excel at sarcasm and love puns. However I sometimes when responding with a joke or sarcasm on occasions it comes off as a serious statement and then I have to explain.
7	Eh, it's learnable. I just hate malicious humor. I think that a lot of unfunny people lean on doing things like lying or sabotage and call it "humor" or claim, like in your example, that the victim can't understand the humor.\n\nI like to call people out. If you need to be cruel, deceitful, or violent, then you're not funny - you're mean.
2	I'm pretty good at recognizing dry humor and sarcasm since I do it so much.
2	I think I am tempted to say yes to this, but I don't know that it is objectively true for me. I was told that I have a very sarcastic sense of humor, and I suppose I do. I often tease or joke by saying the opposite of what I mean. For instance, someone might say, "What if I can't pay you back by Friday?" I might reply with, "Then I charge 2000% interest, though as a friend, I'll knock it down to 1500% as a courtesy," or "Then we can't be friends anymore." -- but while I'll deliver with a straight face, I am usually so out-of-proportion that I think that helps signal that I'm joking, and then I grin almost immediately after, so I don't find I am misunderstood in making these jokes.\n\nOthers... I don't know, I don't think they give me the same framing as I've described -- so it is less clear to me that they are joking. For instance, in some situations, I can be sensitive about feedback about my driving -- from some past experiences, it can lead me to feel like they're just sitting there and seething at me, or feeling indignant and unsafe, and so I get defensive very quickly when people joke along those lines without even meaning to. Thankfully, last time it happened, they could tell that I had taken it too seriously and found some gentle way of letting me know it was just a joke.\n\nIf it has to do with me failing in some way, I guess my first response is to evaluate that possibility seriously -- and that can't be done quickly enough to arrive at "well, I've done nothing wrong, perhaps it was a joke" in time to be socially appropriate. It is so easy to screw up without intending to, that I think of it as lacking the default assumption that I'm doing the right thing because I am not knowingly doing the wrong thing. \n\nAre there certain forms of sarcasm that this usually shows up with? For instance, jokes that imply you've been shitty, or annoying, or bad? Or is it just across the board? \n\nOne way I might cope in your situation, since you can't just voluntarily decide to read sarcasm better, is to make a joke to defuse the tension. Like if it has to do with being upset because you took a joke seriously and got angry/mad/hurt -- do a caricature of being upset that is clearly a joke, like, "You don't have to say that to spare my feelings, I... know when I am not wanted... (*turns head away with a sad grimace, as if to sob*)" and kind of make a joke out of my overreaction, that continues the interaction, while indirectly poking fun at/gently mocking myself in a way that lets them know I get that I overreacted, and that lets us laugh at it together versus feeling all weird about it.\n\nMy thought is it sounds like the friend(s) feel defensive, like they feel like they're being taken to be assholes or be unfunny when they aren't trying to be assholes or unfunny. Thus, if it works well enough with your style, if you can poke fun at yourself, it makes it clear that you're not implying anything bad about them. That means they can loosen up and relax, and instead of leaping to their own defense next time, they can give you a clue by just giving you a flat look or something else -- because they know it is your tendency to overinterpret, not a bad reflection on them.
1	I am a VERY  sarcastic person and people sometimes don't realize that I'm being sarcastic. On the other hand, I don't like puns or jokes in general. A joke will very rarely get a reaction from me other than a look of "really?! That wasn't funny." 
1	In speech, I can easily recognize humor, at least the vast majority of times. Written sarcasm and jokes, on the other hand, do give me some trouble, but only sometimes.
1	I find it hard to do that, and show emotions in general. 
1	I would say no. Don't doubt yourself because a load of fucktards use I was joking as an excuse to get away with bullying/insulting people
1	My supervisor jokes a lot and sometimes when she asks me to do things and I don't understand why, I'll just start doing it and then she'll say she's joking. I'd rather do as she asks than interpret a real order as a joke. She is super nice though.\nI still talk to me ex-boyfriend who has turbulent emotions. Sometime's he'll joke about something, and I apologize because I didn't intend to upset him. Our past relationship was mired in miscommunication and I still value our friendship. The more I feel the relationship is important, the less attune to someones jokes I am.\nOverall I am a very serious person and my mindset tends to lean to "the world is terrible and we should be doing something about it and not laughing about it to cope".
1	It might be. I can dish out sarcasm like nobody's business but when someone is being sarcastic to me, I have trouble detecting it. My OCD doesn't help.
1	Not for me.
1	My girlfriend is an ISTJ, and a non-native speaker of English.  Often when I make jokes and sarcasm, she doesn't get that I'm kidding.  Now, it's not used in Chinese, so she has double difficulty understanding it.\n\nHOWEVER, when she makes her own sarcastic comments, usually referencing something that one of us said earlier, but putting it into a different context, kind of like abusing the word a little bit, it's always EFFING HILARIOUS.  I mean, she reduces me to tears with these jokes sometimes because they have a way of being acutely spot on and revealing some aspect of the situation I hadn't even looked at.\n\nSo, I don't know....  I have read a little hear and there, I don't think it's unheard of, but I find ISTJs to be charming, sweet, and frankly EXTREMELY cute when they want to be.  But, well, it's just my SO (of six years).  But I read the forums and I get a little taste of that vibe sometimes.\n\nJust sayin', don't sell yourself short or anything.  Maybe it's not a constant flow of sarcasm and jokes, but when it feels right, you can probably NAIL it.
26	ISTJ's disappearing	Has anyone noticed that recently there are more people using this forum whose SO is an ISTJ than actual ISTJs. I have no conclusion, just making an observation
28	I just have nothing to say. I hang out in the hope that someone else does.\n\n(Though yes, it is mildly annoying that 3/4 of the topics are about relationships.)
21	"Has anyone noticed that the quiet, not-much-to-say group of people hasn't said much?" No because as an ISTJ I haven't been around much.
15	**ISTJ thought process before posting:**\n\n* Hey, that's an interesting thought; I should post about it on Reddit!\n* How do I word this so that it makes sense to everyone else?\n* Is that the right word for this?\n* Wait, what if this is completely irrelevant to everyone else?\n* I'm probably the only one that thinks this way\n* Even if anyone else felt this way, all they would say is "yep"\n* But does anyone even care about this?\n* they probably wouldn't respond\n* I'll probably just be annoying everyone by posting this\n* It's probably not that interesting of a thought anyway. \n* Forget it; I'll just go read a book\n* [deletes 4 paragraphs of text]\n\n\n**ISTJ SO thought process before posting:**\n\n* What the hell is going on inside that head? I should ask about it on Reddit!\n* Hey ISTJs on Reddit, what the hell is going on inside your heads?
23	I predict that it's because extroverts are more likely to reach out to discuss their SOs. When it comes to population breakdown, ISTJs are the (silent) majority
12	Interesting, but not very surprising. We don't talk much, and I'm kinda happy that other people do stop by, even if it's just relationships talk. It shows that we are not forgotten at least.
7	Well you make a sub about a bunch of quiet people you're not likely to get a very chatty sub. 
8	I read somewhere that ISTJs are the personality type less likely to believe in personality types. So despite there being so many of us, because we are skeptical, we don't seek out these types of forums. \n\nAlso, we are not N's, so we don't feel the need to be all like, "I'm sooo special and need to be understoood, validate meee". 
5	I come here, read and then go to other subreddits. 
2	Intuitives have always been more active on these kind of platforms.\n
2	I think it's a common thing.  I think the other types - especially the NF's are interested in us because we are so different from them, so they're looking for any kind of info they can use in their daily lives, I understand ISTJ's make up a majority of the people out there, it makes sense for them to want to check us out and see what makes us tick :)
1	Yup
1	Make noise! Yay!\n\nI'll be back sometime in the next year maybe.
1	I've done the test a couple times and it's resulted in ISTJ every time.
13	What is one way to instantly get in your bad books?	Name one or a few ways someone can instantly piss you off or make you dislike them whether it be by their traits or actions.
54	Say you'll do a thing. Then not do the thing. AAGH
19	Being dishonest, obnoxious or intrusive. To list some.
13	Fuck up my plans! 
12	Being late without a good explanation or reason
18	I read a description of ISTJ this week that hit the nail on the head for me "fastest way to get on the bad side of an ISTJ is to be lazy or dishonest."
6	Be lazy or emotional i guess 
7	Being indecisive or incapable of committing to a plan.
7	Arrogance and dishonesty. Saying you are good at something when you're not, and having people genuinely believe this.\n(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
5	Make trouble for other people
3	If it's something like a group project and you're being lazy, you better step up your game real fucking soon.
3	I generally don't dislike people for who they are -- any time I try, there is this compulsive need to evaluate their objective worth, and achieve a balanced perspective which usually is some variant of, "In these settings, on these tasks, for these interactions, their traits are uniquely well-matched, even if I find them difficult."\n\nThat aside, there are three things that immediately leap to mind as things that I find immediately distasteful (even if I can step back -- far, far back -- and achieve a fairer, less biased view):\n\n1. People who routinely have strong, negative, emotional reactions *at* people -- particularly accusatory, demeaning, or angry ones -- regardless of whether they apologize about it later on. We all make mistakes, and cognitively, I forgive them. However, being at the receiving end of that is so uncomfortable -- like someone slipped their hands underneath my skin and are dragging their fingernails down my nerves like a chalkboard -- that I can't forget it. Even if I respect them greatly, they're flagged as, "Best to observe at a distance," and "Avoid interaction at all costs."\n\n2. People who -- in fairly specific circumstances -- make a stink about how things have impacted them individually, when the situation is not individual at all. For instance, imagine you're in a group that has been assigned to clean a house, and everyone has to take exactly one room and clean it thoroughly. And someone is going to get the bathroom, that is just the way things are. Now, if you have a unique argument for not wanting to do the bathroom (e.g., a compromised immune system -- something that isn't shared among most of the group members), or if unfair methods are used in assigning rooms, speak up. But if your reason for not wanting to do the bathroom is because it is gross, and then you'll feel less clean but you can't change until you get home tonight, and through fair and impersonal methods you end up getting assigned the bathroom anyways.... I just can't understand insisting that the situation be changed to avoid putting you in that position. (Again this is assuming they don't have a condition -- e.g., OCD -- that might uniquely make the bathroom a bad choice for them.) We should all work it out between us that you don't have to do the bathroom because you -- like everyone else here -- *don't want to*? You are so upset by the discomfort you're about to face that you're insisting we change it so you don't have to go through it, even when by definition that means we're putting it onto another member of the group? So their discomfort matters less than yours, then?\n\n3. People who simultaneously assert that they are correct or that my arguments are inadequate, whilst refusing to provide any more detail or rebuttal. I get not everyone has the time or inclination for an argument -- so be it. "At this juncture, neither of this wants to discuss this further and the truth of the matter -- at least as a shared entity -- remains unknown." Sure, fine. And if my arguments are bad, absolutely tell me about it. I'm not upset for people disagreeing with me. But if you're going to engage in this debate, engage in it. None of this half-assed, "I'm right, and you're wrong, but... I can't be bothered to say why about either of those things." You're entitled to your private feelings, absolutely, but don't pretend you've just contributed. You've done the equivalent of intellectually mooning me -- I know you have those parts, and that's great, but nothing is accomplished when you show them to me. I will even try to help, knowing not everyone is comfortable expressing themselves in words and details. "So... is it that you're seeing this and that and putting them together this way?" That way, you have something to work with -- "No those are not the variables I am attending to," or "Your impression of my argument assumes a sentiment that I don't have." At least we can get somewhere. But instead, you just say nope, that was not what you were trying for... but that's all you have to say on the topic, *and* you don't see that as weakening your argument? Well fuck me.
3	Actually, I don't agree with the posts saying dishonesty or laziness at all.\n\nI think that as long as dishonesty serves a purpose, which it does often, then it's alright. Being boldly honest without thinking it through and possibly hurting others, that ticks me off.\n\nSaying "dishonesty is bad" without considering cases where being dishonest spares you and others trouble is totally not ISTJ for me.
3	Not being organized.
2	People who slack off, and people who lie.  Fuckers.
2	Flake out on a meeting without letting me know.  After you've done this once, you're on my shit list.  After you've done this three times, I refuse to speak to you.
1	Traits don't tend to bother me, since I try and refrain from holding other people to the same standard I hold myself. The same goes for most actions (being lazy, disorganized, emotional, etc), with the exception of being dishonest or abusive. Intentionally misleading anyone for any reason or disrespecting someone's human dignity both tend to get me pretty upset.
1	Volunteer my time for something I didn't volunteer for myself.  Examples:\n\n"Sarah's computer is borked, so I told her you'd fix it.  She said that she'll be home at 6, so you can go over then."\n\n"Arlene didn't have anyone to help her set up the hall for her reception, so I told her you'd help.  It's at the whatever hall, Saturday around 2pm."\n\n"Sasha wants custom wedding invitations, and I know you do calligraphy, so I told her you'd help her.  She can't pay you anything, but she only needs around 100 invitations or so.  You can have them all done by the weekend, right?"\n\nThree examples of many, and they all actually happened to me.  My ex was the worst offender, but my mother and one friend were also notorious for doing this.  It took me a long time, but I finally put my foot down and told everyone that if they volunteer my time without asking me first, my answer (to whether or not I can help) will always be 'no', and if that leaves the other person in a bind, that's on them, not me.\n\nSo, yeah.  That's the ultimate way to royally piss me off.
7	Weekly Thread: What's the last thing you got mad about?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: When's the last time you got really upset about something and what was it?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
5	When trying to solution something complicated for a multi-system integration at work everyone on my team took my first stab at it as good without providing any criticism or further evaluation. This was after me pressing for feedback and stating that I did the logic 3 months ago before I knew some additional options.\n\nI got pissed, which means I sat through the rest of the meeting in silence. Next day I told the team leader it was unacceptable and that I can't solution on my own. Scheduled an hour and a half with my main developer and reassessed the process. 14 additional necessary items were found. I feel better, and the work will be done correctly. The second of those two is more important than the first.
5	I sometimes carry out lengthy monologues when I'm alone in a "safe" place...and recently I kind of got mad/emotional with myself about the fact that as long as the people I love are safe/happy/doing good, then it doesn't matter to me how I feel or how I'm doing.    \nThis sounds nonsensical (when I read this back to myself), but in my mind this made perfect sense. Also, sorry if the wording is off or anything.
3	A coworker interrupted the work flow we had in relabelling some product. He and some others would grab out of a box and label and put it at the other end of the table. I would grab the labeled product and box it. He changed things by dumping his whole box all over the table and throwing the labeled product to my end of the table, now 5+ feet away. \n\nIt sounds like a dumb silly thing now but I got pretty upset. He was surprised by how upset I suddenly was and I regret allowing myself to be visibly upset. Not my finest hour.
3	When I applied and interviewed for a job position that they aren't really hiring for at the moment. 
2	My HOA board holding a secret meeting to raise our  fees.  They just didn't want people bitching that if they had budgeted properly, we wouldn't need an emergency assessment. 
2	It is incredibly rare and hard for me to get mad, and when something bothers me or upsets me, it takes me very little for it to slip away or to be suppressed, so, I don't actually remember the last time I got mad.
2	Applied for a (semi) leadership position on a forum, got accepted... They still haven't re-masked me from citizen to "Executive staff" yet
6	Any ISTJ's struggling in relationships?	I'm an INFP married to an ISTJ and tend to pop up on your thread occasionally, entirely uninvited, with my thoughts on ISTJ related relationship stuff.  So this is my latest thought, borne through our recent marriage developmental stage.  \n\nDo your relationships peter out and and feel unfulfilling?  Are you struggling to hang onto them even if you really like the person?  I hear a lot of ISTJ's complaining about these things, and it may connected in part to this one thing.  Bear in mind I'm possibly over-generalising to all of you here, but hear me out :)\n\nI think ISTJ's may have a natural low capacity for nurturing others.  And every human being thrives on nurture.  This may be the reason you guys seek out nurturing other halves, like us NFPs or NFJs for example. My husband has had to slowly learn nurturance and it's benefited our marriage enormously.  \n\nI found the list of high nuturance vs low nurturance traits (on this page, http://sfhelp.org/gwc/4_grouptraits.htm scroll down to the box) a helpful way to assess if your relationship/family/group etc is healthy in terms of nurturing other members.\n\nApparently nurture is defined as: the action or process of nurturing someone or something.\n"the nurture of children"\nsynonyms: encouragement, promotion, fostering, development, cultivation, boosting, furtherance, advancement\n"the nurture of ideas"\n\nAnd it appears to me to involve not just co-existing alongside someone, but actively looking into their personality, studying what they need to grow or improve, and pushing them towards getting that need fulfilled, or providing for it yourself.  \n\nI wonder if your guys natural sense of independance, and the fact you don't necessarily value/need high levels of nurturance yourself (not sure if I'm right here) might mean you don't see your other half as needing it, but any other type except other STs and possibly SF's would probably need this.\n\nAnyway, my sincere apologies if this is useless or in any way hurtful, it's not intended to be, it's just something my husb has had to work on, and it's strengthened us enormously, and I figured there may be one or two other ISTJ's out there who could benefit from it too.\n\nMuch love to your addictively gorgeous dark silent selves haha!
8	Have you ever taken the love languages test? I think that can tell you more about relationship stuff than mbti can. I'm an ISTJ and my love language is "words of affirmation," so I highly doubt all ISTJs don't appreciate being nurtured. However, "nurturing" others doesn't come very naturally to me, so you might have a point there.
5	Kinda wish I was aware of this nurturing stuff before my ex broke up with me.
6	I dated an INFJ for a little while last year and I do think that this is one of the many pitfalls I may have fallen into. I strongly believe, however, that this is something that can be overcome with experience. For me at least, I feel that I can meet the needs of others if I know them. The hardest thing, therefore, is when needs are unknown or unexpressed but their lack of fulfillment is still felt. I don't ever want to date anyone again who hasn't matured to the point where they can articulate what they need.\n\nI don't think that we are not capable of being nurturing, but I do think that we can be very blind to hidden or unexpressed emotions.\n\nDisappointment was a very big deal in my most recent failed relationship. She was consistently silently disappointed and I'd discover it after the fact because she would be moody and I would investigate. I'd be annoyed because she didn't warn me that she had expectations of me that I failed to meet. Or that there was a subtext I failed to read.\n\nI work in operations management and expectation setting is a very important part of my toolkit, to the point that I try to use it in most aspects of my life. I wholeheartedly feel that I can't hold my employees accountable if I fail to tell them explicitly what I want from them. I find it so fair and effective, I just wish that this is how things could work in the murky dating world.
3	My (INFJ) ISTJ girlfriend is wonderfully nurturing in her interactions with me. It's actually one of the things I appreciate most about her. One of the ways she nurtures me is taking my desires and needs seriously as part of what we do together. Another way is through physical touch. Another is by being there as someone I know I can count on, and speaking with action. And another is by being a truly non-judgemental person whose presence calms me and makes me feel safe and gives me the space I need to find and respect my own perspective.\n\nAnd she lets me take care of her, too. Allows me to be a comforting presence to her in times of stress and allows me to take her desires and needs into account in a real way, which I do knowing that this is something we do for and with each other, mutually and reciprocally.\n\nThis nurturing has been especially good for me because my ex - an INFP, interestingly enough - was/is one of the least nurturing people I've known. She has all sorts of good qualities - she's interesting and we have great discussions about weird stuff. But she lacks the instinctive gentleness, real deep-seated kindness (not just "go with the flow," but real truly *other-focused, action-backed kindness,* and true/deep open non-judgemental-ness of the ISTJ.  I can't even begin to fully articulate how much I appreciate the kind of nurturing I can both receive and give with the ISTJ in my life. \n\nSo in my experience, this:\n\n>I think ISTJ's may have a natural low capacity for nurturing others.\n\nIs not true. While some ISTJs might have a low capacity, some INFPs (and other types) do also. And many do not.\n\n-----------------\n\nSo please ISTJs, don't devalue or think less of the nurturing aspects of your amazing deep capacity for kindness, your steadiness, your speaking-with-action, the space and safety you offer as valuable modes of real nurturing and all the ways that you organically do provide this resource in relationships.  
2	I'm fine with my INTJ boyfriend, but friendships are the hardest for me. No one chats with me, I never go out to hang out with friends... It sucks. Everyone thinks I'm serious about everything even when I write lol
2	Some of what you said applies to me, especially the nurturing part. However, I do nurture a lot more than usual for partners I am completely in love with. Not needing nurture much and then forgetting to nurture the other sounds pretty accurate to me. 
1	No, you have to be in a relationship to struggle with it
7	Are ISTJs drawn more to family tradition or cultural tradition? In what ways to you go against tradition entirely?	
16	The worship of tradition (often linked to conservatism) is something that always put me off in the description for ISTJs. I am an atheist in a deeply Baptist culture and have never associated myself with it. So to elaborate on what tradition means in the context of ISTJs and mbti: it often amounts to us replicating what we have seen work (Si) and making sure it continues to work, to the point of making it better and more efficient (Te). However, it also requires that we feel a certain role to play (Fi).\n\nSo a stereotypical ISTJ who lives in a conservative culture, sees it working (or often is the only thing they see), may often adopt conservative traditions and adopt conservative roles wholeheartedly.\nOn the other hand you could have a non-traditional ISTJ who could see their surrounding culture as not working, search for something that does work, adopt those traditions, and become a very non-traditional ISTJ (like me). \n\nNow, to answer your first question, I see family and culture as the same thing: a social group. As long as Si-Te becomes convinced that certain traditions work, they will adopt it. But it depends on the ISTJ's unique perceptions (Si) to determine if they believe it works and is worth adopting or not (Te).\n\nFor an ISTJ to go against the Si-Te mantra of "if it worked in the past, it will work again" they have to play around with Ne curiosity as well as break or redefine the emotional weight Fi places on the thing the ISTJ refuses to let go of. Te makes us feel that what we are doing is the most efficient way because we often refine and make sure the thing works. Fi then goes on to make us act as the model or figurehead of that thing and often will associate that things success with our own identity. So when Ne comes along and says "maybe there's a better way?" it can make an ISTJ feel like they have to throw out an entire library of knowledge for a single piece of info on a piece of paper. It takes a lot of rethinking and re-evaluating.
8	I can't stand being linked to traditionalism. I'm against nationalism and tribalism as well.\n\nA convention needs to prove its utility to me. I love rules that make sense. Things that work. Effectiveness is my watch word.\n\nThere are so many ignorant and evil things that exist via tradition. We should always look to adopting the best rules we can, not just the ones that were.
3	I feel like acting according to tradition is only worth it when you either want to spare yourself discussions or if it makes friends/family happy. I'm personally not drawn to any tradition.
3	I don't consider myself Religious by any means, but I do consider myself a Christian. Meaning that, yes, I believe in God, and try my best to live as an example of him, but I don't necessarily agree with all the views and beliefs that the Church believes.\n\nMy wife and I currently attend a non-denominational Church in our town, but in my opinion, you don't have to, or shouldn't just attend Church to be a Christian. I've met many people that aren't churchgoers, who carry out the example of Jesus better than those that don't miss a service every Sunday.\n\nI get the feeling like the Church tries to say that everyone who is an Atheist, gay, lesbian, or trans is wrong, and is going to hell, and that kind of thing just disturbs me.\n\nI also feel like a lot of your average churchgoers have this "i'm holier than thou" persona about them that makes them nice and friendly while they are at Church, but the second they step out into the world outside of those doors, they start putting everyone else in the world down because they automatically think they are going to Heaven and that they are better than everyone else. I think this why a lot of people resent Christians and aren't interested in going to Church.
1	If it is logical to do... I'll do it. 
1	I'm pretty patriotic and nationalistic, but I'm not religious (agnostic). I have similar values that other people have like dreaming to have a happy family and a stable job but nothing extremely traditional. 
1	I only care about tradition if it's pragmatic or harmless (holiday dinners, reunions) but not a big fan of religion, group think, or any collective responsibility for anything other than "do no harm / live and let live".
1	Generally I stick to tradition, with the exception that I was raised in an atheist/non-theist agnostic household and became Catholic after I was out on my own, much to the dismay of my family.
32	An ENFP's appreciation post for my ISTJ SO	I am an ENFP, and my whole entire life I've always thought the one I love would be like me, loud and excited. But my love is so wonderful, we are literally as opposite as we can be but I find that so fascinating, that I can learn things and mannerisms from him that I'd never find with anyone else.\n\nI understand ISTJs have trouble expressing their emotions, which sometimes brings out a little insecurity from me because I am constantly expressing my emotions. He's sometimes very reserved, but he always makes sure to appreciate what I do for him. He knows he loves me, he knows I love him, and that is all that matters, no matter how expressive he is. He isn't romantic in the slightest sense, but many months ago he gave me a bracelet and I have not taken it off since, and it's easy to tell he is proud.\n\nHe is also very well mannered and polite, albeit a little old fashioned, but that is one of the things I love so dearly. He opens doors, always helps my parents clean up after dinner, he always uses common curtesy, and he is extremely respectful to the people he cares about. \n\nHe is so shy, so timid sometimes that I'll have to order food or do anything of that nature. But, whenever I am having moments where I do not want to interact with any person other than him, he will step up without hesitation and do the things that make him uncomfortable. Even though he doesn't use them much, he has excellent people skills, because he is a realist and can tell it like it is, and people like that about him. \n\nHe is fiercely protective and extremely competitive. Some people may find these traits undesirable, but he knows my fears and how to protect me from them. When I am feeling insecure, he blocks out the world and allows me to focus on the two of us, which calms me quicker than anything even could. He loves winning, and whenever we okay sports together sometimes he gets a little heated because I simply have no care for competition, but the issue is always resolved.\n\nThe last thing I love about him (and ISTJs in general) is that he is so kind. Genuinely kind, he's the brand of nice that you may only come across once in your life, the kind that only wants others to be happy without worrying about himself or getting something in return. He will drop everything just to make sure I am alright, and he says the sweetest things when I am upset, never blowing it out of proportion or getting upset himself, which makes it easy for me to calm down. He's levelheaded and sweet, always grounding me and reminding me that what we have, what we are, is beautiful.\n\nI never thought I'd love an ISTJ. But turns out in my opinion, ISTJs have the most beautiful minds and hearts, so thank you.

6	As an ISTJ in a relationship with an ENFP, I can relate with some of the things you said.\n\n> turns out in my mind ISTJs have the most beautiful minds\n\nWow. Feels good.\n\nThat said, ENFPs are awesome, too. It was a great read!
5	>he is so kind. Genuinely kind, he's the brand of nice that you may only come across once in your life\n\nINFJ in relationship with an ISTJ and I continue to be amazed by this part, over and over and over. It's truly wonderful to find in someone, and yes quite rare in my experience.\n\n
3	This makes my steel shell melt.\n\nIf only... Oh nevermind.
2	>He is so shy, so timid\n\nShit this is a problem that I have, but it's usually just around strangers. 
1	Your boyfriend has a beautiful mind,and heart,not Istjs.\nIstj is just a personality type(thought process preferences),not a whole person.
8	I often fluctuate between ISTJ and INTJ, is this common?	I tend to go through the test multiple times, maybe once every few months. Since the answers always slightly depend on mood, they tend to fluctuate a bit, giving me roughly 50/50 with ISTJ and INTJ.\n\nHave you people experienced that as well?
3	A "single factor difference" is not actually small. It's pretty easy to find which side of the line aligns most with your personality, because both of those have significantly different functional stacks.\n\nISTJs lead with Introverted Sensing (Si) and INTJs lead with Introverted Intuition (Ni) - each function is not seen in the top four of the other type.\n\nISTJ's stack is Si > Te > Fi > Ne. INTJ's stack is Ni > Te > Fi > Se.\n\nReading about the four functions that differ (Si, Ni, Ne, and Se) should quickly and easily allow you to assign a proper label.\n
2	It happened to me a few times as well. I even got INTP once.\n\nThe thing is, if you have strong intuition, you might have a good balance between S/N but you'll lean more on one type.\n\n[This link can be useful](http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/119355115987/accurate-typing-the-dominant-function)\n\nIt asks you how you'd react when you face a problem. There is a major difference between Si and Ni.\n\n[Look at this other one too](http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/119442161307/accurate-typing-the-inferior-function)\n\nThis one is about inferior functions, how you react under stress. Again, there is a major difference between bad Se (INTJ) and bad Ne (ISTJ)\n\nHope that helps!
2	Hi CommissarRaziel, I have had the same thing multiple times!  I tested ISTJ all through secondary school and into the first few years of University.  Unfortunately I did not complete my degree and stopped it after 2 years.  After that I have had another 4.5 years where I've often swapped between ISTJ and INTJ.  I've always been fairly evenly split S/N (usually around 60/40) so it wasn't too surprising.  Two years ago I met a guy (fellow ISTJ) who works a lot with people and helping them unlock themselves and their potential, often using MBTI types as a basis, and he explained that situation to me like this:\n\nISTJs are very logical people who will tend to follow a train of thought to a conclusion.  This is useful in education as you are constantly learning and exposed to new trains of thought to analyse.\n\nINTJs are more about the process of learning than the result.  Because I had not completed my degree I was 'stuck' in the mindset of the process of learning and unsatisfied by my lack of a result.  As such I flip-flopped between ISTJ and INTJ for about three years.\n\nNow I'm back to good old ISTJ, but with a slight closing of the S/N and J/F scores that he explained is a hang-over from my time at University.\n\nSo maybe there is something in your life (could be something minor) where you feel, even subconsciously, unfulfilled and that is causing these results.  I could be completely off-board for you, but that is what happened with me.
1	Sensing and iNtuition often have the weirdest description in my experience of online tests. Even more so the introverted perceiving functions (Si and Ni). If it weren't for my love hate relationship of Ne and a bit more understanding of Si, I'd think I might be an INTJ. I'm still not sure what exactly Ni is because it tends to be described as "magically knowing everything inherently".\n\nPlus there's always intuitive bias. A lot of the titles and descriptions for INTJs can often be attributed to ISTJs. The only difference ends up being how the IXTJ discerns information.
1	I'm like this too. I like to refer to myself as IXTJ sometimes because I'm so in the middle with S and N. 
1	Funny, I was going to post something about that. I've tested as both. I guess it really depends on how I'm feeling at the moment. I consider myself ISTJ because it fits me best, but I've got INTJ also. 
1	its not uncommon
1	I've done the test a few times and i've always been ISTJ.
0	I'm mainly an INTJ but I have some ISTJ, INTP and even some INFJ in me. From the little I have analyzed about myself, I do more ISTJ stuff than INTJ (if you have a list) but I tend to do the INTJ stuff more often that others. \n\nIt is ok. It is normal. MBTI is not perfect.
10	Big fun Reddit MBTI survey	**Edit: I have closed the survey.** Basic preliminary data is available here: [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWpyBCtgq81S03KJZYVzn5tVVhUgbTcJ6lqUhDFb78EQQEtA/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm)\n\nHi all. I'm interested in seeing what correlations exist between certain types and various random things, so I've created a big survey. Its a little bit long, it will probably take 10-30 min depending how fast you are at filling out surveys. I tried to mix fun questions with serious questions and so topics include pop culture, politics, art, lifestyle, etc.\n\nI also posted this in /r/mbti, but I'd like some more varied responses (INxx types really like filling out surveys) The survey is at [this link to google forms](https://goo.gl/forms/fHSemrg0ey1EYfK63)\n\nIt is completely anonymous, handled by google forms. After you take it it will let you see the raw results, please don't spoil these results for others. Once I have enough responses, I will perform a statistical analysis on the results and share them on /r/mbti.\n\nIf you know anyone else interested in MBTI, feel free to share the survey, but please only fill it out once yourself.\n\n**Please don't spoil** the survey questions for others, particularly the trivia questions, I want to see what types have knowledge/interest of certain things.\n\n*I'd like to know (without spoilers), what you thought of the survey and what additional questions you would have included. So please let me know.*
1	I thought the pictures were an interesting way to compare types. Are you going to put together a list of commonalities which differentiate types?\n\n(I'm trying to be somewhat vague about the questions so let me know if I should clarify.)
1	I couldn't select mint chocolate. 
1	I don't understand the value of some of the questions, but whatev. Random trivia makes me feel stupid.

1	It was... interesting. At a certain point I thought I was getting trolled but I mellowed out.
9	Dating an ISTJ, how do y'all tick?	I guess I don't really know how to phrase things, but it seems like it's hard for her to express her emotions because she's either worried about how I'll perceive them or just that she thinks she's being rude. I'm *very* free with my emotions, and I try to gently get a read on what she's feeling because it's the easiest way to connect for me. How do you guys connect with your SO, or is it too individualized a thing to be attributed to MBTI types?
20	Bad feels: I need time to process my emotions.  I can best articulate what I'm feeling over written communication, as opposed to spoken communication, because I tend to hold back what I really want to say face to face.  When I express my emotions, I am usually dispassionate and emotionally detached from my feelings; I am describing them to you from an analytic standpoint. Something made me feel bad, and that's a problem and I think we need to find a better approach to avoid making me feel that way--that's my mind set.  I don't like emotionally charged conversations.  Anything I say is not a personal attack; it's an observation or what I perceive to be true.  \n\nGood feels: I need to know it's okay to express my feelings.  Is it inappropriate to laugh at a given moment if I find something funny?  If I think so, I'll refrain.  Is it too early to say "I love you" or do I think you might not feel the same? If so, I'll hint at it or say it with my actions.  \n\nIn general, I try to come at my emotions from a "what result do I want out of this" perspective.  I don't like hurting people I care about.  I don't like feeling vulnerable or being hurt.  If neutrality is the safest course of action, then that's what I will express. 
16	Personally, I have a hard time understanding my own emotions.  It's even harder to convey them correctly.  Considering how volatile SOs can be when talking about emotions, I would rather just keep them to myself than risk having to do damage control afterwards.
8	How many "I'm dating an ISTJ" threads do we need on this sub
6	Thank you guys so much, all of you. You've given me some really good insight 
5	My husband learned to just let me be.  I never talk about why I'm sad or upset and he's learned that if I need to talk about it then I'll do it when I'm ready.  It's better for me to able to sit in my hole and not be bothered until I can work through what I need to.  If not I'm usually end up saying something very hurtful to someone if forced to talk about something before I've worked it all out.
5	>How do you guys connect with your SO\n\n\nI don't, honestly.
3	I need time to process how I'm feeling into words. My boyfriend always wants to know right away why I'm upset. Usually I just tell him I'm fine at first, because I need to think about how to word what I'm feeling/thinking without it feeling like I'm attacking him. 
3	I am an ISTJ, and I find it easier to send an email kinda prefacing what I wanted to talk about, before I talk to her in person. Maybe you can suggest that to her, which should allow her to be more open... (and if you do do this, let me know how it goes!)
3	I have a really hard time showing emotions- whether they be excitement, anger, sadness, etc. I just difficulty doing things like congratulating people for stuff, and showing sadness when it comes to stuff like funerals. I keep all my emotions inside honestly. 
2	Expressing emotions is difficult for me. Being an ISTJ, I always think/ponder over my emotions in my head, and if it seems okay, I'll express them with words. Most of the time, I'm not vocal about my emotions. I don't like talking about emotions unless I've analyzed the situations and decided that something positive can come as a result. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't bother. When talking about feelings, I'm usually detached (never sobbing while screaming incoherently during an argument). Personally, it's not because I'm worried about what others think or because I feel like I'm being rude. *It's just hard to express emotions. It's just the way I'm wired.* I basically live in my head, and I feel emotions in my head, and when I have to put them into words for other people to understand, that step takes effort and energy. I felt the emotions already, and often don't feel the need to tell that to other people.
2	When something happens, my thought processes go "what is happening" - "why is it happening/what caused this" - "how do I feel about this?" I get a pretty quick assessment on the situation and spend most of my thinking on the second part and responding based on that. The third part may have an immediate, hidden and suppressed gut reaction, but I can spend days ruminating on what happened to process my feelings. Also being a 6w5, I tend to also ponder if my feelings were valid in the first place and can end up further suppressing my feelings if I feel that I shouldn't have felt that way - though never really reconciling why I still feel that way.\n\nThere's also the fact that somewhere along the way, I became deeply convinced that a lot of the things I like will prompt ridicule and/or is socially unacceptable. I suppose it was due to growing up with a liberal mindset in a conservative christian culture. I am very sensitive to ridicule and so I don't tend to let on how I really feel. So what ends up happening (for example) is that I finally decide I am rightfully upset about something that happened 3 days ago. But the action that upset me was so small that I also feel that I shouldn't actually feel so upset. Nonetheless, I still haven't found closure with the event and it ends up effecting my actions toward the person. This can leak out into spite where usual reliable old me is suddenly unavailable for help. I get so stuck in this loop that this can last forever if it is never mitigated. I continuously run into "that was months ago!" or "you're upset about *that*?" when I do open up about them.\n\nSo, tl;dr I would suggest communicating that you are both interested in hearing her viewpoints and wanting to understand them. That while you may not always agree on what she might express, you will always listen to them firstly and not ridicule her or judge her harshly when she does open up. It maybe be a vulnerable process for her as it is for me, and having an understanding SO can make it so a typical clammed up ISTJ becomes an open book.
2	We don't have emotions so don't expect us to show them
11	I took the test, and found out in an ISTJ. What's next?	Excuse me for being this ignorant. I've started to read about this subject recently, now that I've encountered myself at a certain point in my life where I need to understand myself a lot more. \n\nI know that it's up to me to find more, read and study. But I'd like to be pointed in the right direction.
6	[deleted]
2	I'm surprised. ISTJ aren't generally too concerned with self-discovery (source: S.O. is ISTJ). [This](http://www.celebritytypes.com/blog/2014/10/pierce-presents-istj/) profile by type-enthusiast Michael Pierce is pretty good so you can start with that. He also runs a youtube channel. If you can get your hands on it, I recommend Please Understand Me (2nd Edition) by David Keirsey which I've found to be an invaluable in-depth guide to any type. This one is especially helpful because it also talks about the work patterns and love patterns of each type. Good luck.
2	"I know that it's up to me to find more, read and study. But I'd like to be pointed in the right direction."\n\nLol I take the same approach on that stuff as well.\nAnd it sucks because if I want to know about something, I know there's a quick and on to the point explanation out there, but it's so hard to find without any help. \n\nIf I have no choice but to do research, I end up trying to find a quick fix instead focusing on gathering up info. \nSo in the end, I end up wasting time and getting nowhere :)\n\nIt's really great :)))))
1	Congratulations! You're awesome (source: husb is an ISTJ)
1	Welcome aboard!
1	Any supernatural experiences? Sensing a presence?	I was recently talking to an older, retired ISTJ and she floored me when she suddenly expressed that she has a presence in her home that she can feel--she just knows it's there, some person or persons in her kitchen or hallway when she's laying in bed at night.\n\nI automatically thought this was freaky but she clarified that it's not a scary experience for her but more like a natural thing that's happening and she just happens to recognize it.\n\nAny other ISTJs have experiences that may be of a similar type? I'm really curious now. Thanks!
8	Absolutely not. 
3	[deleted]  \n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.7480 \n > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/03782)
2	This doesn't really have anything to do with MBTI. She just believes in something supernatural. That's dumb, but it isn't a fault of her personality type.
2	I mean ISTJs are supposed to be sensitive to their environment being an Si dom.  \n\nAs far as the supernatural I not only don't believe in any of it but also have a strong emotional negativity to any supernatural or religious stuff.\n\nI do get those chills though when someone says something inspirational. But I don't attribute the sensation to the supernatural and I don't pay them any attention.
1	Closest experience I have was when I was working retail.  One evening I was working alone.  I could feel someone in the store but I was having a hard time finding them.  The store was a smallish HBA store so only like 6 aisles.  I must have spent 20 minutes going around and around and checking back rooms.  I finally found a woman squatting down looking at magazines.  There was a lowboy in front of the rack so I couldn't see her.  Very weird feeling another person but being unable to find them.
1	no.
7	Weekly Thread: You are Prince Paris of Troy. Athena, Hera,and Aphrodite come up to you and ask you to choose which one of them is the most beautiful. Each one attempts to bribe you, offering unlimited wisdom, unlimited wealth, or eternal love, respectively. Who do you pick?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: If you had to pick between unlimited wisdom, unlimited wealth, or eternal love, which one would you go for? \n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!\n\nTrying a new style of question this week, if it doesn't go well I'll return to the previous styles I promise!
6	[deleted]
4	Some bitches have a squabble about who is the prettiest and then think they can bribe me? I denounce them all as Goddesses and tell them that due to the triviality of their question, it deserves no response. \n\nI continue living my life gathering my own wisdom, wealth, and love while leaving my integrity in tact. Or they kill me, but whatever, I die with my integrity.
3	Assuming wisdom is not equal to knowledge/intelligence for this question, I'd choose love. \n\nIf wisdom essentially means I have unlimited knowledge, I'd choose that. \n\nWealth hasn't been a problem for me. Even though I'm only working part time while in college, I'm fairly good at budgeting money, so I have enough to satisfy myself. I believe unlimited wealth would just add a bunch of unnecessary wants to my life that I don't have right now. \n\nThis style of question was actually a nice change. Looking forward to other people's opinion. 
3	Money. \n
3	Eternal wealth. I have no use for love and I would have very little use for wisdom when I'm eternally wealthy.
3	[deleted]  \n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.0229 \n > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/22796)
3	I was once presented with a very similar question during Sunday School once:\n\nIf God gave you one single wish, what would you ask for?\n\nI thought about it and realized: I wanted money but without knowing how to generate wealth I wouldn't be able stay rich. So I kept on thinking that I should ask then for intelligence but realized that intelligence by itself leads nowhere because you need to know HOW to apply your intelligence.\n\nI came to the conclusion that the most important trait I desired (and still desire to this day) is WISDOM. With wisdom I don't need to be intelligent, I can find someone intelligent to use his intelligence for me. With his intelligence, I can gain the wealth I want.\n\nWith wealth + wisdom I can know how to approach anyone and find my eternal love by myself without anyone's help.\n\nMy answer to this day remains the same: I'd choose Wisdom. Also, [I've always liked Athena](http://www.goddess.ws/images/athena-1.jpg) and [find the owl to be pretty darn cool](https://i.imgflip.com/193vcw.jpg)!
2	I discarded wealth immediately. Choosing between wisdom and love is damn hard though. If the wisdom means unlimited knowledge, like /u/bdt13334 pointed out, then it would be it (I like Athena the most anyway), otherwise love all the way.
2	I have love already, I choose wisdom.
2	Wisdom, I think being wise would lead to or help with wealth and love.
2	Athena. Wisdom can gain you monetary gains and lead you to a proper love interest.
2	*picks wisdom because that's the wisest choice*\n\n*lower Fe whimpers silently in the background because it wants eternal love*\n\n*ne decides why dont we complement them all*\n\n*si reminds ne that I might end up dead because of that*\n\n*chooses wisdom*\n\nEdit: I just realized this was the istj thread, don't know how I got here
2	Wisdom is unlimited. You have all your life to collect it. Money is just money, you can always earn more of it. So who cares if they're handing it out? And eternal love can't be taken, it has to be given freely by the person you want to love you or it isn't actually love. And in all honesty, who cares who the most beautiful is? I'd rather be called smart than beautiful. It's arbitrary and petty. And if they need that to solidify a sense of self worth there's not enough wisdom, wealth, or love that could help them feel better about themselves. And if you're a Prince, you have other things that should better consume your time. Like doing your job and making sure your people don't starve to death. 
2	I don't know... There is a 20% chance I would pick love, 30% chance for wisdom and a 50% chance that I would tell the truth

9	What are you like when you are mad?	I know all types differ from person to person, but my SO (ISTJ - m) and I (ESTP - f) got into a bit of an argument and I kept asking if he was mad so we could fix it, because I knew he was mad, and for some reason it made him even angrier.\n\nAlso, sometimes when he's mad instead of resolving an argument, especially if it's late at night, he'd rather just leave it be and not mention it in the morning. This annoys me so much because I hate just letting arguments go unsolved.\n\nAnyways, how do you guys act when you're mad or annoyed?\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for the input and great advice!
13	O I recognize the "leave it be part". Some arguments just are not solveable (mostly because the other person is not bringing any logic into the argument) and will only result into hours of (imo) useless talk.\n\nSo that's when I think the better move is to just stop.
7	He is probably laying there thinking of everything he said/did wrong and attributing too much of the blame to himself. He is recreating the day, week, maybe even month, and cataloging all the moments where his words and actions caused little stress fractures that accumulated until the whole thing shattered. He is so used to being reliable and steady, he fears opening up to you because in that moment he perceives that the world (you included) will react to his moments of error, his falterings, as an ISTJ might - harsh, cold.  Consequently, he feels guilt and embarrassment, and wishes to avoid talking it out because he believes doing so could only reinforce those emotions, and is thus not productive nor efficient. He is wrong, but in this moment he is being emotional, which is uncharacteristic of him. He craves moving on but does not feel able to vocalize it without stoking the fire beneath the argument that just occurred. Do not try to satisfy your own curiosity or understanding in this moment, it will only provoke him (as you mentioned). My advice would be to seek closure by returning to the rational: "We both messed up, tomorrow we will both regret it and wish we hadn't, I love you and I'm sorry and I hope you feel the same." That should work. \n\nSource: I am a male ISTJ and have been an asshole to many people and regretted it. 
5	For myself, I know I don't always think clearly when I'm worked up about something. I might be making something out of nothing, so I often walk away from the issue if conflict arises. I think about it and it could be 10 minutes or it could be a few days later, I decide how I actually feel about it. Often it's just not a big deal and I shouldn't have gotten upset, but if it's. Something I still think isn't right then I'll bring it back up, calmly and without any passion.\n\nIf you're interested in conflict styles (http://sourcesofinsight.com/conflict-management-styles-at-a-glance) I recommend looking into that. I exhibit a strong Avoidant conflict management style, and I can't tell if that's an ISTJ thing or just me. It sounds like you're style is Competing, which is a frustrating situation for both parties when the other person is Avoidant. You pursue the issue in the moment and he withdraws to gather his thoughts. Don't be afraid that he'll run away entirely from the issue unless that's been a problem in the past. If he does, confront him about it in a gentle way and tell him why you think it's important to talk about things immediately. Show that you understand his position and that you need him to at least set a time for you both to revisit the issue. \n\nTL;DR: You guys handle conflict differently and I don't know if it's an ISTJ thing or not, but he needs space. Give it to him and make him come back to the issue when he's ready.
6	He was probably fine. It was until you kept asking him is when he triggered. Personally, when people keep asking me the same question over and over again "Are you ok?" (I hate the word trigger but there is no other word for it) it triggers the fuck out of me. 
5	I'm usually loud, angry, and prone to throwing, slamming, and smacking things,
4	I get really short tempered when i'm mad. 
3	I don't like to let things go unsettled, especially when someone is leaving or going to sleep. Otherwise I can't sleep. However I do typically need a few minutes to cool down and collect my thoughts. I prefer to collect my thoughts for a few minutes and figure out exactly why I am mad without it seeming like I'm attacking the other person. 
3	My xSTJ boyfriend usually needs to have some space alone, which might be a few days, and then he can have a talk about it when both people have calmed down and can communicate sensibly to build a conclusion together, rather than each trying to be "right". 
2	Hell Spawn
1	Cry and go to sleep
1	If I'm really mad I need space alone for a little bit to think of how to handle the situation. To evaluate if I have legitimate reason to be mad or if I could be overreacting. But I usually don't need a ton of time and like to settle the argument before the end of the day. Otherwise I stew and over think everything when I'm trying to sleep. 
8	Weekly Thread: What's your dream job?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: What's your ideal job and why?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
16	To not have to work.  I really hate having a job.
8	I'd love to be a carpenter/furniture maker. There's something satisfying about making something out of a bunch of nothing. \n
6	Open up a restaurant. Love making great food; probably pursue it when I retire in the way distant future. 
6	An architect. I love designing buildings and living spaces. Although my style is a little outdated and isn't anything close to the brutalist architecture that people like nowadays, so I might end up becoming a civil engineer or a mechanical engineer.
5	Being paid to review and be a music critic. 
3	Dream job: Professional writer/artist. (Enjoying this as a hobby.)\nRealistic dream job: Therapist. (Going to school for this.)
3	Car design as a mechanical engineer. At this point it still sounds really cool and a huge challenge with lots to learn.
4	Given the opportunity to do anything I want, I would probably be a shepherd with a couple of working dogs. There's just something incredibly enticing about that life to me. 
5	Astronomer 
3	I used to think it was absolutely disgusting and horrifying, but I think I would love being a medical examiner.  The human body is such an amazing thing and I love solving puzzles.\n\nProblem is that I'm not interested in all of the schooling and working myself to death thing.\n\nRight now my goal is a marginally similar career.  It only requires a master's as opposed to med school, hoping to match into a residency, then multiple fellowships.
3	I like what I do now. Realistically, having to interact with more people would be too draining. I'm a medical coder, and I only go into the office twice a week. I just read medical documentation, code diagnoses and procedures, keep Netflix or podcasts on in the background. It's interesting and not too stressful. It's sedentary and I can dress up/wear makeup/have tattoos, which I enjoy. It's comfortable.
3	being a sucessful novelist would be heaven
3	Military officer. It's very cliché for ISTJ's, but i think that not only is military offiver(specifically navy officer) a very interesting job, but i also think the traditions affixed with it are very aspirational.
2	I'd love to work for music festivals, on the logistical/planning side. I'm already working my way towards it. I often work media, writing event previews and reviews for a few blogs. That gets me into most events for free and has sent me on a couple free trips to events in other countries. That's got my foot in the door and is slowly opening up more opportunities. I just joined the board for a smaller festival in my city, where I'm helping to plan lineup and other aspects of the festival, which has been really cool - to actually have real input on putting together an awesome experience for 8,000 people. Ideally, I'd like to get more involved in that side of it. I'm not about to hop in as a full time thing just yet since it's a pretty volatile industry. I'm also working on my career as a software developer and my part time career as a teacher (I have a lot going on...), but one day hopefully I'll get the opportunity to start working on this full time or in a way that.... y'know, pays real money. At least a few bucks on the side to do what I enjoy would be nice. I'm already thankful that I don't have to pay for most of it. I save thousands of dollars a year on festival tickets by writing reviews.\n\nReason - I go to tons of festivals all over the continent. I devote a lot of time to online communities. I love the planning aspect and putting together trips and experiences, both for myself, and for others. I love being able to help people plan everything. I love the community. I love the freedom. 
11	Which fictional character do you think represents the stereotypical ISTJ best?	
14	Was at Disneyland and they had a questionnaire to align your personality with a Disney character. I got Cogsworth, from Beauty and the Beast.\n\nHe is literally a clock. I felt very satisfied with the results.
18	Definitely Geralt of Rivia from the Witcher series. He aims to protect the innocent from evil, sometimes for a price, and is often cynical about the world.\n\nFrom the Witcher wiki:\n\n"He can be cold and ruthless to people who are wicked and malevolent... Most of the time he can be apathetic, cynical, and threatening. Despite his outwardly cold nature, Dandelion notes that behind his exterior hides a fiercely loyal friend, and a man of good humour and a giver of sound advice... His experience of at least ninety-seven years in the world makes him a world-weary man, often expressing disdain and circuitous insults to those he considers cruel, foolish, etc."\n\nHe's just by far my favourite character from anything. He always makes reasonable and logical choices and he's perceptive of his surroundings. He has a sharp tongue and isn't afraid to insult anyone if it means getting what he needs.
7	I've always heard Hank Hill (King of the Hill) basically embodies ISTJ. 
7	Mr. Spock for sure.
5	Easily Squidward. 
6	Winnie-the-Pooh's Rabbit.\n\nThis thread makes me happy, by the way. The characters mentioned are almost always my favorite characters in the work they're from.
4	Worf and Odo, from Star Trek.
4	Ben from Parks & Rec
3	Hermione Granger. 
3	I always thought Angela from The Office was what people usual think a female ISTJ is like. May or may not be a little bit true for me.
5	Holmes
2	Adaline from the movie Age of Adaline... Pretty accurate depiction of female ISTJ
2	Anybody read Patrick O'Brien? I'm thinking his character Jack Aubrey would be a good fit, but I'm not 100% sure if he'd be an ISTJ or an ESTJ.
2	Some would say Batman.
1	Double D from Ed Edd n Eddy
2	Warren Buffett is an ISTJ personality type.	
4	Warren Buffett is an ISTJ personality type. I have always identified with his style of investing which makes more sense now that I know we share personality traits. :D
2	Clearly I'm doing something wrong. 
1	I always liked the guy. I jokingly call him one of my "heroes". Together with Michael Bloomberg and Jane Goodall. :)
7	Weekly Thread: What's the last book that you read?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: What's the last book you read? What's next on your reading list?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
3	*The Lost Symbol* by Dan Brown, I'm currently reading *The 10x Rule* by Grant Cardone.
3	*A Clash of Kings: Book II of A Song of Ice and Fire*, by George RR Martin
3	[deleted]
2	The Complete Robot by Isaac Asimov.
2	*The Orphanmaster's Son* ~ Adam Johnson. Even though it's fiction, it's still a harrowing picture of life under rule in Modern Korea. \n\nNow I'm trying to read *The Art of Robert Frost* but it's a bit dull.
2	I don't think I've read a book that wasn't a textbook in several years now. Maybe Deathly Hallows?
2	*Blue Like Jazz* by Donald Miller. For the second time. One of my favorite (and also introverted) authors.
2	Fierce Patriot: The Tangled Lives of William Tecumseh Sherman, by Robert O'Connell
2	The last book I read was *And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic* by Randy Shilts.
2	Lord of the Flies.\n\nEnding was quite abrupt but I enjoyed the fact that it could be interpreted in many ways.
2	Last one was A Clockwork Orange. I´m currently reading The Chaplain Wars.
2	The Night Angel Trilogy by Brent Weeks.\n\nRead it twice already, but gotta find something to hold me over until The Blood Mirror comes out.
2	Current-Halo: Glasslands\nNext-Halo: The Thursday War
2	Personal by Lee Child 
2	The Bride by Julie Garwood. And am currently reading Dragonfly in Amber by Diana Gabaldon
1	I don't actually enjoy reading all that much; I rarely read recreationally. The last book I read was Looking for Alaska. I didn't even finish the book, I got to the major plot point and I kinda just stopped reading.
1	Are we just talking for pleasure? Don't have much time to read (yet I somehow sit on the Internet for hours at a time haha), so I think the last book I read was War and Peace back in high school. 
1	I don't remember the last book I read, but I recently started on an old favorite of mine, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle by Haruki Murakami. 
2	HAE had a drastic change in their MBTI test results?	I consistently test ISTJ.  Under times of stress or depression I have tested INTJ and INTP.  That is not what I am asking.  Has anyone ever changed from an ENTP to say ISTJ?  Does time have any effect?  Does environment?\n\nThe reason I ask is because I was extremely extroverted at one time.  I thrived on being in a crowd.  I could speak publicly with no problem.  I was energized by being around people.  I had many friends.  I was highly flexible and didn't stress when plans changed.  Now, I have 2 friends (only one of whom gets "let in" to a point).  I occasionally must speak to groups and it is highly draining.  I can't stand gathering where I'm expected to mingle and interact.  I'm very structured and organized.  If plans change it actually ruins the entire event for me.  Not saying I'm not adaptable.  My job requires me to adapt and overcome.  But, I was trained to do that.  It's not natural to me anymore.  \n\nI don't know if growing older changed me, or if it was my military service.  Maybe both.  I am quite happy and comfortable as an ISTJ.  I look back on the extroverted me and just don't understand how I can be the same person.  I remember how happy and comfortable I was then, too.  People that knew me back then say how I've changed (and they don't mean it in a good way).  With rare exception, all those from my past have disappeared.  Well, I guess I am the one that disappeared into myself.  People I meet now don't believe some of the stories I tell from my past because it is just so out of character to what they see.  \n\nSo, is this common or at least explainable?
3	I've come up ISFJ before and I'm always close on the T/F ratings. I know I should make decisions with my head, but sometimes my feelings get the best of me and will dictate my actions.
3	I consistently test ISTJ, but the line between ISTJ/ISFJ is thinner sometimes.
3	I've tested as both INTJ and ISTJ. They both describe me so well, so its hard to describe me as one specificly. It makes more sense to be an ISTJ though, since it's simply more common, and I guess it's what I've gone by since its the first thing I've received when testing.
2	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_changes#Change_over_a_lifetime\nThese are the 5 Big traits that would influence the 16 types of personality traits grouped by Myers Briggs over a course of time.\nBig 5 Personality traits:\nextraversion, neuroticism, openness to experience, agreeableness and conscientiousness\n\nSo, Personality Traits can often be changed over a course of time due to huge biological, social or life transitions.\nReasons could be your Military Service or your transition from adolescence to adulthood or any other big change that could have happened to you between your ESTP days and ISTJ days.
2	I've taken the tests multiple times, different sites, very spreadout over time and constantly get ISTJ.\n\nThe first time I got INTJ though.
2	I would say that I've definitely transitioned into this personality type over time due to shifting social roles and personal priorities. In the past I've sometimes identified as an INTP but those qualities are muted now by my love of structure.
1	It could be explained from a functional standpoint. \n\nOur primary orientation is introversion (Si), but as we grow out of childhood, we begin to develop our primary extroverted function (Te). This could cause a person to become more extroverted as they learn to better use the function. At this point, we would be more or less balanced between a preference for introversion and extroversion. \n\nThen, as we continue to age into early adulthood, we start to further develop our next introverted function (Fi), which tips the scales back to the introvert side.\n\nI can only assume that as time goes on, and we learn to work with our final extroverted function (Ne), the scales will rebalance again. \n\nYou can find some further information on type development [here.](http://personalityjunkie.com/istj/) \n\n(As a side note, I've experienced a very similar path, so I wonder if it's common to many ISTJs.)
1	Thanks for a great answer.  It's nice to know I'm not the only one.  I've seen people talking about shifting from INTJ to ISTJ, but not much about extreme polar opposites.  I've always wondered if I was just maturing and seeing the world for what it is or if combat changed me.  I mean, after I came home, I couldn't stand large groups.  Would literally get up and leave my wife or friends and walk around alone.  That irrational fear has subsided.  I am able to function.  I still find it exhausting though and need time to myself to "recover".  That's just one aspect of the change I notice.  \n\nAnyway, let me check out your link.  Thanks again.  
1	I remember reading once that most men in the millitary are ISTJ, and that if they are not, they tend to change to being one because of the way it works. I have no source rn because I am on mobile but I'll try to find it later. \n\nEDIT: wording\n\nEDIT: I could not find the source, it was in a (Unknown) forum a long time ago and I dont remember how I got there or the actual main topic of the thread. 
25	Doing almost all things alone is just both heaven and hell	No doubt that I enjoy alone time but some times I can't help but feel lonely. Longing just hits me right on the dot. Am living far from my parents and siblings. Got a friend or two. People that can keep up with my ISTJ topics are like looking for a needle in an haystack. At work I'm the only one on my specific field of expertise. \n\nI feel worse now that I have a dinner for two coupon but I have no one to bring along with.
9	Yep.  I love being alone, but at the same time, can feel lonely.  And like you, it's wicked hard for me to find people that have my interests and are tolerable.  
4	Don't be afraid to reach out and poke around a bit - you might find people have interests they're not letting on to right away
5	I really enjoy being alone. Basically, I think I can do whatever I want by myself. I tend to think that if I have to wait for people to do something, I would never do anything. But these last months, I realised that I came to an extreme: I would just forget to ask around me if someone would be interested in going to a gig/an exhibition/whatever. And then, feeling extremely lonely and thinking "That would have been nice to have someone with me".\n\nSo now, I'm trying to act differently. I still don't wait for people, but if I have something planned, I can still ask after I have my ticket, and they can join me. But I have to say it's quite a hard work, spending so much time alone is not something you can erase easily. But in the same time, I would hate being someone totally dependant on other people.\n\nBut yeah, don't be scared, look around and you should find some people with whom you could share things!\n\n(Sorry for the terrible english - Non-native english speaker with a lack of sleep)
2	We should organize events for introverts to meet up, but we'll be sure to let everyone know to be there an hour before the event starts. That way people have time to build up the courage and energy to say hello to someone, lol.
2	It's a really hit or miss kind of situation. In some circumstances, it's the best thing in the world to be alone, since I can focus on myself rather than others (for whatever that would be). But working completely alone gets boring. I guess that's why work environments are pretty productive for people like us.
17	Introverted Sensing	By Leona Hass & Mark Hunziker\n\n**Dominant for ISTJ and ISFJ**\n\n**Auxiliary for ESTJ and ESFJ**\n\n*We seek to present a picture of the “pure” Introverted Sensing that we would see if we could carefully remove it from its natural state where it is influenced and colored by all the other elements of personality. Though no process actually exists separated from the rest of the personality, the portrait that follows reflects core characteristics that are in play whenever Introverted Sensing is engaged at a conscious level.*\n\n*Introverted Sensing most clearly resembles the descriptions in the following pages when it is in the dominant (first) position. In fact, these descriptions are based on input from people for whom the process is dominant (1STJ and ISFJ). But even with Introverted Sensing in the first position, what you observe will vary noticeably depending on other factors - particularly whether it is paired up with Extraverted Thinking or Extraverted Feeling in the auxiliary (second) position.*\n\n*In order to draw a complete picture of the “essence” of Introverted Sensing, one must use bits and pieces that cannot individually demonstrate “pure” Si. Like the splashes of color in an impressionist painting, however, the bullets in this chapter, when taken all together, reveal a vivid portrait that will enable you to recognize Introverted Sensing when you see it. Knowing what the process would look like if it could be separated from other influences is the foundation of process watching, the practice that will quickly take you as far as you want to go in understanding personality.*\n \nIntroverted Sensing is an information - gathering process. It focuses on the subjective, internal world of past experience by comparing current sensory experiences to similar past experiences through a vivid and detailed internal database of memories. Si wants to relive the past and selectively explore the impact and significance of current events, people, and experiences.\n\n**KEY FEATURES**\n\n**Introverted Sensing** \n\n* Experiences the present world through comparison with previous experiences.\n* Re-experiences the past sequentially, in vivid sensory detail.\n* Focuses on the memories and comparisons that are triggered by current objects, people, and events.\n* Stores sensory references from the past in a subjective internal database.\n* Has a high level of internal body awareness.\n* Subjectively selects what gets noticed in the present and recalled from the past.\n* Seeks to use previous experience as a guide for exploring the current experience.\n\n**WHAT’S GOING ON?**\n\n**Introverted Sensing**\n\n\n* Sees the current world through subjective internal filters.\n* Uses an external stimulus in the present to stimulate an internal experience: the recall of the past.\n* Asks: How does this event in the present compare to similar events in the past? What is different? What is the same? How can it be improved?\n* Resembles a mental Rolodex file, video, or database for sorting through the internal images to find the right reference.\n* Enable accurate recall of all steps or events in the exact order in which they happened.\n* Looks at what happened and how it could be improved. Learns from past mistakes.\n* ls energized through combining vivid past experiences with the present to relive special moments.\n\n**When people are using their preferred Introverted Sensing**\n\n* Their past experience provides the frame of reference for comparison with their present experience. Much attention is paid to the facts and details of personally significant past experiences and how they are similar to or different from the present experience.\n* Their memories are clear and detailed but subjective, so they will not necessarily agree with someone else’s recollection of the same events.\n* Their most vivid memories are those that were most impactful. These memories are replayed over and over again with all the associated details and emotions. It is like actually physically reliving the event and re-experiencing the same emotions.\n* They prefer and trust their subjective recall. They may simply ignore someone else’s conflicting version of events and rigidly defend their own. Accepting a different version would require changing the memory itself. It would be like re-recording the whole event.\n* They are usually closely attuned to the physical condition and energy of their bodies.\n* The current experience that is triggering a recollection may be integrated with the memory, or it may be virtually ignored if found to be not relevant to the memory.\n* They may form associations with people or things in the present, based on someone or something similar from the past.\n* The intensity of a previous experience determines what will be remembered. Watching a sunset does not bring to mind every sunset ever seen, just the significant ones. These could include the best sunset ever or ones associated with significant events like falling in love or the death of a loved one.\n* They are referencing an internal database that is filled with an enormous amount of detail. The detail, however, is not 100 percent reliable as an objective record of the experience or event.\n* Familiarity has a great impact on making a current event more comfortable because the more similar the event is to past ones, the more easily it can be compared to them internally.\n* No one can change the internal references except the individual.\n* The current data and experience are not real until they have been validated by comparison with a similar circumstance or experience.\n* The recollection of a past event is automatically and immediately overlaid on the current experience.\n* They interpret the current situation through association with previous experiences. Sometimes this produces brilliant insights. Often it gives them a surprisingly complete grasp of the current situation. Occasionally it leads to misinterpretation and erroneous assumptions.\n* A smell or sound can trigger a flood of vivid memories, with all of the related emotions.\n* The present stimulus can be disregarded and reliving the past can become the current experience.\n* Their internal experience is about the most memorable one of its kind, whether good or bad, happy or sad.\n* They may appear quiet and composed, while internally they are very active, perhaps even in turmoil.\n* When something happens that is different from anything that they have personally experienced before, they need to find something that is similar in some way so it can be used for comparison.\n* What is important to them is the subjective experience, not the present external event.\n* They tend to do familiar activities well. Their internalized experiences, along with their ability to evaluate and compare them, serve as a reference library of best practices.\n* They cannot be pressured into changing a memory. Creating it was very personal and vivid. Recreating it must be done independently as well.\n* Remembered information is reality to them. Revising a memory is not just a matter of altering a record of an experience. It is like changing the experience itself.\n\n**FROM THE OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN**\n\n**When we experience people who are engaging their preferred Introverted Sensing, they**\n\n* Do not always seem to be with us in the present. Sometimes, when they return from their reverie, they tell a story from their past that seems especially important to them.\n* Seem to recall past events from a unique perspective. The specific details and emphasis are strongly colored by how they personally experienced the event.\n* Tell about an event as a sequential, personal story. It is not like a “report,” in which one seeks to summarize the key objective facts of what happened and may make a point or reach a conclusion. Their reason for telling the story seems to be in the telling itself.\n* Sometimes reject new information that might cause them to change their course of action.\n* Are often predictable in their actions.\n* Usually are well organized and neat.\n* Are clear and confident about knowing what to do in any given setting or situation based on their prior experience.\n* May show emotional behavior even when there is nothing in the current external environment to support or explain that emotion.\n* May approach a task with statements such as “We did something like this before and it was not successful. This part worked but that part didn’t. Here is how we can make it work better this time.”\n* Often describe tangible items by comparison to other objects. They frequently use phrases that start with “looks like,” “seems like,” “feels like,” and “tastes like.”\n* Often compare events and situations to ones from the past. You may hear “I’ve seen this before” or “that reminds me of the time.”\n* Understand concrete descriptions and stories that make a point through comparisons.  \n* Can get side tracked into talking about topics that are related to the subject at hand rather than talking about the subject itself\n* May seem to wander aimlessly through stories of questionable relevance as they search their internal database for the correct one to use for comparison. Sometimes it is difficult for others to listen patiently to them while they sort it out.\n* May recount previous events in great detail. Sometimes only the storytellers themselves can see how those events are relevant to what is going on now.\n* Can bring great insight to a situation through their past experiences.\n* May go back and forth between two extremes of energy during a conversation. They could become animated and energetic if the subject evokes either happy or sad memories. On the other hand, they could show no interest at all if the subject is not something they have personally experienced.\n* May not provide much input or feedback during group decision making unless allowed time to access their internal world.\n* Can usually tell you exactly what you said at a specific time. If you disagree with them about what you said, they may become rigid in defending their recollection or totally shut down and not communicate at all\n* May be difficult to get to know.\n* Often have great confidence and certainty about the right way to do tasks.\n* Tend to be dependable and stable.\n* Have a learning style that is like rolling a carpet forward: linear, with each new learning an extension of the previous one.\n* Usually cannot be convinced that they are not recalling facts accurately. The more they are pressured or coerced, the more resistant they become. They need to be allowed to decide for themselves whether their internal data is incorrect and given space to re-form their memory.\n* Tend to accept change more easily when they can look to a similar transition in the past and find support for making the change in order to correct mistakes or improve a situation.\n\n**CONTRIBUTIONS**\n\n**Specific perspectives and approaches of Introverted Sensing**\n\n* Internal structure and organization for any task, project or group\n* Development of effective solutions based on past experience at lessons learned from previous mistakes\n* Institutional memory and a sense of organizational continuity through a history of past successes and failures\n* An internal template for how familiar tasks are done and how to build from experience to approach new tasks\n* A high level of precise internal body awareness\n* A calm and professional manner\n* Insightfulness, usually without unnecessary assertiveness\n\n**FROM THE INSIDE**\n\n**Paraphrased descriptions of what it is like to gather information through one’s preferred Introverted Sensing**\n\n* Experience is like constant de ja vu. Everyone occasionally has the experience of some sight or smell instantly transporting them to a vivid recollection of a past event, but for me it’s almost constant. It is where I live.\n* My internal data is a lot like having detailed photographic plates that are available to me as a clear series of sequential pictures. It’s like a movie or video in my head that replays all the details over and over. It’s like a slide show or a mental Rolodex. The images always come to me in a certain order. These images are superimposed over what is going on in the present environment, which allows me to see all the similarities and differences.\n* I relive the experience. I feel exactly what I felt before, just as intensely.\n* I never use a camera because my internal pictures are so much more vivid and rich. Photographs are too flat and lifeless. The pictures inside are what really bring me back to a time and place.\n* I know the day’s weather by looking at the sky and comparing it to the pictures of skies in my memory and remembering the weather we had on those days.\n* Once I identify something, there’s usually no need to personally experience it any further. I get only what I need to trigger the relevant Images.\n* I’m hesitant to embark on totally new ventures. I am much more comfortable when I have already experienced something similar.\n* I am the only one who can revise a memory. Changing a memory is like destroying a valued object, like shattering a glass picture. It is done only when new additions to my internal database absolutely require revising the old material. Then I have to rebuild the memory from scratch.\n* I am very good at knowing when something is not right with my body. Without thinking about it I constantly and automatically compare my internal readings, like heart rate, pain, and energy level, with their normal state. I can usually tell if something is wrong with me long before any doctor or medical test can pick it up.\n* I don’t like a lot of change.\n* If you talk to me about something I have not personally experienced, I may just blank out. I do not have a clue what you’re talking about because I don’t have a reference.\n* I can recall in extreme detail the room layouts of places I have been. In department stores, my friends are amazed by how I can go to the exact location where we saw an item several weeks before.\n* I enjoy shocking people by describing what they wore and what they said in a meeting ten years ago.\n* I can describe, in great detail, several scenes and events that happened’ when I was very young. I remember a lot about when I was sick as a child, even the clothes that my parents were wearing. I was nine months old when I was sick, and I can still recall the experience fifty years later.\n* I really hate driving somewhere I’ve never been before. When I do get directions, I prefer to get specific details such as mileage or landmarks to go by. Maps don’t work well for me. Once I’ve been somewhere, I normally stick with the same route that I know.\n* In choosing a career, I needed to reflect upon what had worked and not worked for me before and what I had liked and not liked in previous jobs.\n* Whenever I drink a beer, I’m comparing it to my memory of the best “perfect” beer. Every beer I ever taste is compared to that beer. If I ever taste one that’s better, I’ll know it with certainty, and that will become my new standard of the perfect beer.\n* I can remember every teacher I ever had. I can hear their voices, picture the classrooms, and remember most of my classmates and what we did.\n\n**VIGNETTES**\n\n**Scenes from the world of Introverted Sensing**\n\n* A participant in a four-day workshop was able to describe in exact detail what each of the thirty-four participants had worn each day. She could also cross-reference those internal images and knew which people had worn the same articles twice.\n* I experience a tree by overlaying that tree with memories of significant trees from the past. When I am looking at a tree, it could bring up pleasant childhood memories of a tree with a swing or maybe unpleasant memories of getting stuck in a tree. I’m sure that no one else would experience that same tree in the same way that I do because my past associations with trees are mine alone.\n* If you bump into an old acquaintance with a preference for Introverted Sensing, your acquaintance may well proceed to tell you the details of your last encounter: where you were, what you were wearing, the weather, and what you talked about. He or she may make comparisons between the two meetings, such as noting changes in your hairstyle.\n* In a restaurant, I’ll remember what I ate there before or what I had at a similar restaurant. My menu selection will be based on this previous experience. If the menu choices are so completely strange to me that useful internal comparisons cannot be found, the waiter can be helpful by giving me something familiar to work with: by talking about the spices or the method of preparation or by comparing the menu items to the dishes that I know.\n* In a scene with friends on a boat, I’ll probably be drifting off in my mind to another boat ride. I’ll be reliving what was happening, whom I was with, where we went, and what we saw.\n* In a “type-alike” group exercise that focuses on talking about an object, our group always includes memories triggered by, and usually closely associated with, the object. For example, when a bag of eight markers was provided for the exercise, we remembered working with sets of markers in the past. Of course, we also knew that there should have been ten markers in the set and which colors were missing.\n* While planning with some business associates where to go for dinner, one young man said he wanted to go somewhere that served spareribs. He proceeded to tell us about a place in his hometown that served “the best ribs in the world.” As he was describing them, he came alive. His face became animated and he even began salivating. He said that he could actually taste the ribs. The others in the group were pulled into his experience by his vivid descriptions and his energy. But when he was done reliving the memory of those ribs, he no longer wanted ribs for dinner. He said that he had just experienced the best ribs in the world and any others would be a disappointment.\n* My young nephew walked through the door and immediately wanted to know what happened to the rug in front of the door. Since I had removed the old rug a while ago, I didn’t immediately understand the question, so I asked, “What rug?” Taking my question as my not valuing his memory, he got angry, put his hands on his hips, stomped his foot, and said, “You know, the green rug that was right here!” After I apologized and explained what had happened to it, he felt validated. He proceeded to compare the new rug with the old rug.\n* A woman described her vacation to Cancun. As she talked, her facial expression changed. She was talking about how much she had enjoyed herself. She said she could smell the Cancun air, see the fish in the clear water, feel the breeze on her face, and hear the birds. She said she immediately had the same sense of relaxation she had while in Cancun.\n\n**GIFTS**\n\n**Unique strengths of Introverted Sensing**\n\n* Awareness of when something is out of place, whether it is an object in a room or a step in a process.\n* By comparison to a remembered internal image of the same environment or procedure\n* Learn from past experience, to rarely make the same mistake twice\n* A reliable knowledge of the steps, in sequence, involved in most events or projects\n* Lend substance to the current situation by providing historical context\n* Bring structure to the current task or situation based upon what has or has not worked before\n* Careful attention to detail\n* Detailed, vivid memory\n* Stability
1	Wow! This is Amazing!\nThank you for this
1	Since so much of ISTJ's world is based on comparison to their past, how do they gain more experiences (thus, knowledge) without feeling out of their element?

2	I honestly only have two games I play a lot, which are Rocket League and Melee (i also follow the pro competitive scene of both avidly).\n\nI'm a big fan of most Nintendo games. I have a WiiU and really enjoyed MK8, Smash4, Splatoon, and I loooove the Legend of Zelda series. I'm also a big fan of a lot of classic N64 and GameCube games, we play those a ton when I'm at school.\n\nI'm currently looking forward to No Man's Sky - I bought into the hype and hope the game lives up to it.\n 
2	Board games.\n\nAlthough, I am really looking forward to No Man's Sky.
2	* Stardew Valley\n* CS:GO\n* Mount & Blade Warband\n* Borderlands 2\n
2	I like a lot of Nintendo's stuff. Mario, Zelda, DK, Pikmin, Metroid, etc....\n\nApart from that, I've invested a decent amount of time into runescape and LoL, as well as a handful of other random games like Portal or Bioshock.\n\nCurrently, I'm playing Ori and the Blind Forest, trying and failing to get its "Immortal" achievement.

I love RPGs, and its mostly what I play nowadays (Mass Effect is my all time favorite). \n\nI am also very excited for No Man's Sky. It sounds like our (ISTJ's) type of game.

6	An ISTJ is breaking the Australian Football all-time games record this week. Here are his teammates describing him. Thought you guys might find it interesting.	
9	Nostalgia	I am wonder what other ISTJs' experiences are with nostalgia.\n\nPersonally, nostalgia makes me very depressed.  I get a satisfaction about thinking about past events / happenings that may have been positive. However, if I delve in too deep, I can get hit really hard with emotions.  
9	I keep music folders for specific timeframes of my life. Just listening to these songs makes me recall those moments and the way I felt back then.\n\nThat can strike hard though when I realise those moments can't happen anymore.
7	I don't like old things. I don't visit my old schools. I don't go to class reunions. If I've lost touch with a friend, I really don't think about it too much. I tend not to dwell on the past.
5	Nostalgia is a hard pill to swallow for me too. I find it hard to think about friendships that I have lost over the years and the good times that we used to have together.
3	Nostalgia is a weird one for me. In a way it's comforting(?), I guess. I suppose it's the reflection on something so familiar that it resonates out of the past. At the same time it has a kind of bite though, like it just almost makes your eyes water up. \n\nThe thing is, sometimes that's exactly what I want. I actually have a playlist titled "Nostalgia" if I ever want to have a short, quiet trip down memory lane. Almost like meditation really. \n\nThe other odd thing about it I actually have difficulty putting into words. For me, nostalgia is often invoked by an overall "feeling" or "emotion" that I experienced over a broad period of time. Like if I spent 6 months of 2011 in a specific type of malaise and something makes me feel that same emotion, not even tied to a specific memory, I'll go flying back to that point in my life for a moment. Very odd and arbitrary.
2	Thinking about good times really has no affect on me if its simply a thought that came up in my head. However, I do though feel the same way if its there in my mind for a while. For instance if I think really hard about some past memory that I really enjoyed, I sort of feel sick of how uninteresting life currently is. Like you said, "hit really hard with emotions."
2	I find it very comforting. Occasionally, I'll go through old posts on Facebook, go through some scrapbooks, or do anything just to get that feeling of nostalgia. I grew up going being involved in a local Christian organization for High School aged students, and whenever I go back to that exact church, the smell and feeling of nostalgia gives me a sense of comfort...it's almost like re-living that exact memory. \n\nI don't know what about it is comforting and relaxing, but for whatever reason it is. Especially comparing how much I and my personality in general has changed...even in just a few years. 
2	Yep, too sad, like everything else heh
2	I live for nostalgia. Thinking about the past is a constant for me. One of the first things I do each morning is look at my Facebook memories to relive photos and moments from years ago.
5	ISTJ	ISTJ -Personality \n1) What is your biggest trait? \n2) Are you OCD at all? 
10	I don't want to sound pretentious or whatever but it's a pet peeve of mine when people say things like, "I'm so OCD because I like to keep things organized" or just, "I'm OCD" in general. OCD is an actual disorder; it stands for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. If you say, "Are you OCD?" you're basically asking, "Are you Obsessive Compulsive Disorder?" Regardless, people often confuse OCD with the desire to keep things clean and organized or collect a lot of a certain item, but those are all completely normal behaviors. You would know if you actually had OCD because it can be pretty severe. It just bothers me that the term is misused so often.\n\n\nAs for the first question, that's a bit hard to answer, but I guess my desire to feel secure (for lack of a better word) in my life. I mean, that's not even really a trait, but I can't think of anything else.
3	I am very concrete and literal and have trouble understanding when people don't do what they say they are going to do, can't show up on time, and generally don't follow any pattern of predictable behavior.\n\nThe only "OCD" I exhibit is I will double check that I lock doors, turn off lights, shut off appliances, etc. sometimes I will drive two minutes to work and turn the car around and recheck everything. Otherwise, as I like to say, I'm mentally organized but not physically organized. As we ISTJs are, we don't spend time on things we don't think are important to us, so I see no reason to be meticulously organized and neat with material things. I'm not obsessive on cleanliness by any means, but I am big on food safety, so I measure the internal temperature of everything I prepare in my kitchen.
3	This is wonderful. You are all wonderful people. 
2	I'm a little obsessive and compulsive when it comes to certain facets of organization, but it's not a disorder.
2	I'm OCD and really picky about a ton of things. I always have my clothes out that i'm going to wear tomorrow, I have all my CD's in alphabetical order *and* chronological order, and I'm really picky about my house being clean.
4	Brutal, no holds barred honesty. It's my best and worst trait. People love me and hate me for it.\n\nNo, I do not have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.
9	What are some useful psychology/self-help books for ISTJs?	Have you read any self-help books that you think might be helpful for other ISTJs? Why do you think other ISTJs might find it useful? What was an important insight you gained?\n\nThe books could be for personal development or professional development; they may be philosophical or concrete in nature; they could have a basis in psychology or in systems.
7	I'm about half way through *The Power of Habit* by Charles Duhigg, which talks about the important role habits have in our lives, how they're formed, how they become reinforced in us, and how we can change them.\n\nI thought other ISTJs might find the book useful because of our high preference for Si. For myself, I find that I don't always notice the little patterns and routines that I get into, and sometimes they're not helpful. But because I'm not always aware of the habit, I'm not able to make any changes. This book helped me become more conscious of my own habits.\n\nProbably the most important insight I got from it is the whole idea about the process of a habit: a habit is initiated by some cue, which leads our brain into a kind of autopilot as we perform the habit's routine, and then there's a reward at the end of the action, which reinforces the habit in our minds. As an ISTJ, I find it helpful to understand the process so I can watch for it in action in my own life.\n\nMy only gripe with the book is that it's a bit lacking on follow through and application. I feel like there's a great deal of good theory, but I'm at a bit of a loss as to how to put it into practice.
10	Weekly Thread: What's your ideal birthday?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: What is your ideal birthday? What would you do to celebrate?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
17	April 9th I guess
12	I'd be perfectly happy with a single balloon and a small cake, and my parents. As far as celebration goes, I'd love to just be able to play video games all day with no nagging.
8	A neat, normal day. A few people who would remember my birthday would casually wish me so directly or via text. Someone perhaps would give me a hug. A small happy birthday note would appear somewhere. A small gift would be left in my mailbox with a letter. Letters are nice. Cake? Perhaps I'd bake it myself. Eat it alone. A small acknowledgement of my birthday is all I need. 
8	Spending it with a few close friends and family members, and going to dinner. I don't need a huge celebration or birthday posts on Facebook, or gifts for that matter. I've never really understood why people make such a big deal out of birthdays -- with the exception of milestone birthdays like turning  16, 18, or 21. 
5	My most recent birthday was my favorite:\n\nMy SO took me to a safari park you drive through since I love animals. Then we went out to lunch and later to an escape room...which we escaped!
6	A normal day with money thrown at me with no party. 
3	Constant acknowledgement. Every five minutes someone turning to me and saying "OMG it's your birthday happy birthday!" And we both scream YAY in unison after.  
3	For the last 3 or 4 years, my sister and parents would pay for a 3 day pass for my sister and I to go to Disney World. We would be gone for like 9 to 12 days. Do a park, relax the next day in the comfortable hotel all day. Next day or 2, Park, then repeat. It's nice getting away from home for me. 
3	I usually invite a few friends over to my house to play games or we go out somewhere and do fun, stupid shit like calling everyone on our phone contacts and singing Happy Birthday. \n\nThe thing is, though, that it's always more about having fun with friends than about my birthday, and that's something I like. Birthdays are days like any other.
3	A normal day without birthday acknowledgement (or very few), play videogames and maybe a little get together with some friends (like a casual reunion, not a party reunion)
3	A day like any other pretty much, just with a bit more *me time*. Also, please, no special gifts, some cash is enough.
3	I'd like a day where I play video games and get some greasy food for supper, followed by a few drinks with close friends and SO during the evening.\n\nThe alternative not too crowded brewery is fine for me as well.\n\nMajority of my birthdays since 18 have been that way, cool stuff.\n\nAlso I don't show my birthday on Facebook because I don't like phony "happy birthday"s from people I have no interaction with otherwise.
3	Someone (a friend, SO, or family member) brings me to a cafe, i get a delicious flavored iced coffee with almond milk. Then they drive me to a nice outdoor area with sheltered seating and we eat a strawberry cassata cake, small enough for us both to finish, and also a thoughtful handwritten card. 
2	Hanging out with my wife- doing something simple like going out to eat, movie, or a road trip. 
2	this year i had a very nice one which involved my boyfriend planning a surprise party at our home with just close friends, drinking and playing ultimate werewolf :D simple and at home is perfect.
2	I'd like an ice cream cake and some relaxing alone time. Not in an anti-social kind of way, but rather a break from activities or responsibilities. I'll always feel the need to get stuff done, but on this particular occasion I'd rather take the day off from doing stuff.\n\nI don't need gifts, maybe some cash for a computer I'm saving up for. Acknowledgement is the most I need, nothing special or any kind of special attention.
2	Eat crab legs with my parents, get a new tattoo, eat a plethora of fried appetizers with my boyfriend, get fucked, in that order.
3	How often do you communicate with your SO?	Especially if you're not close by or living together. My ISTJ lives 2.5 hours away and a year into our relationship, his texts have trickled to maybe a handful a day if I initiate. In the beginning of our courting, he used to text me Good morning every day and want to call me almost too much. Now he says he's very busy with work, but I am paranoid that it could be an excuse. \n\nHe seems to be happy with the relationship but I don't have a lot of ways of telling when we're apart since he's not very reachable or communicative. When he is actually with me, I can tell he cares because he's very physically affectionate and attentive. I definitely want more communication from him (like daily), but is that too much for some ISTJs?
3	I'm pretty sure this is typical for a lot of T dom/aux users, I had a LDR and got in touch twice a month while being very much in love.
3	When I was younger and in a LDR I would want to text every chance I got, like you describe. As the relationship progressed I started to not text as much, not because I was less interested but because I felt like it wasn't sustainable to carry on a text based relationship, even if it is supplemented with Skype or calls.\n\nThe relationship eventually ended for unrelated reasons but in retrospect I realize that part of it is becoming comfortable. I know how I feel and I know how they feel and texting is a very casual form to keep in touch in between Skypes and visits. These days I don't use texting as extensively as I did then. \n\nTL;DR: Don't worry too much about it. If it really bothers you not hearing from him, let him know. He may or may not be able to (due to work like you said) but he will make an effort. 
3	Have you considered talking with him about this? He may have no idea the contours of what you desire for that kind of communication, and may currently be communicating in a way he sees as efficient (read: good) for the relationship context. \n\nMy experience with the ISTJ in my life is that it's really useful to have direct and logistically-focused communication about stuff like this. I mean, don't demand things, obviously. But figure out what you *really need* (at the core)  and approach him with a "let's troubleshoot this together to figure out a solution that feels good to us both" approach, if you can. \n\nSo as for what you need: Is it reassurance that he is into the relationship and values you? Something else?\n\nAnd - what specifically might meeting that need look like in terms of communication and interaction? Partly asking this because your OP is a little unclear to me:\n\n>his texts have trickled to maybe a handful a day if I initiate.\n\nbut your needs aren't fulfilled by this even though you put it in daily numerical terms here:\n\n>I definitely want more communication from him (like daily)\n\nSo is *him initiating* the difference between what he does and what you need? If he were to meet your need via texting, how many times do you need that to feel okay? Like, if he initiated a text once a day, would that work for you? Something else?\n\nAnd/or: Are there other ways he could reassure you, if he isn't into initiating texts? Alternative solutions (or an open-ness to finding them together) might be useful.\n\nAnd the thing is - there is *what you need* (so, for example, if it's ongoing reassurance that you're important to him) and then there are *methods for him to meet that need* (which aren't the same thing as the need itself).\n\nRemembering that the need itself isn't the same as the meaning you attach to specific solutions can be useful. So for example, if you associate him initiating texts with "he's into our relationship," but you really need the reassurance more than the texts, then you have clarified the problem to be solved. If texts don't work, then other things might. The thing that you need itself is not the same as what *symbolizes* the thing for you.\n\nThen again, I'm INFJ and how an INFP might experience this whole problem-solving and symbolize-versus-actual might be really different. \n\nIn any case, hopefully this will make some sense/be of some use.
2	I've been dating my bf for uhhh 4 years? We don't live together or want to. He travels for work a lot, I work from home a lot and have to have a spotless house. We text most days. See each other weekly. Never talk on the phone because that sounds terrible haha. I don't know if he's ISTJ, but yeah I am, and there's nothing I like more than someone who leaves me the fuck alone.
1	Consider that it may be less a lack of desire and more a lack of knowing what to say. Personally, I sometimes find myself wanting to have a fulfilling conversation with my SO, but lacking anything meaningful to talk about pop into my head.
50	I don't want much in life	
2	ISTJ's in a nutshell.
1	I'd like enough money to be able to buy the insulin I need.  Maybe a pool and to be left alone.
7	The Introvert's Nine Circles Of Hell	
3	They had me up until Ikea. Who cares about Ikea?
1	Somewhat agree, but as an introvert i love crowed places (caveat: that have seats) so i can people watch. makes shopping with the SO so much more interesting. 
13	Hey ISTJs! I've recently created a questionnaire on personality and music preference, and I'm lacking on ISTJ results so I was hoping you guy could help me out! Thanks!	
2	Done.
2	Cool. Would be interested in the results!
2	As a pedant, the genres were not specific enough for my liking. But that aside, I completed it.
1	Done.
1	Done
1	Done 
1	Done.
1	Done. I would like to see the results!
1	Done.
1	Done.  I wish I could have selected more than 3 types of music, though.
1	Doesn't work.  Keeps saying different questions require an answer when the have been answered.  After 4 rejections I gave up.
6	Weekly Thread: Where would you like to travel to next?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: What's your dream travel destination, assuming no other factors like cost, scheduling etc. If you don't have a place in mind, what was the best place you've travelled to?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
12	I don't like traveling. Traveling means that I have to talk to people. 
3	I really don't like to travel very much. It's usually a wasteful expenditure. I'd rather spend that money investing in learning something new or building something. Traveling feels very indulgent. The best case scenario for traveling is that you see beautiful things....the internet and books greatly solve any such need for me. It just doesn't feel like a problem that needs to be solved anymore.
4	Id love to travel to Japan or Germany, in both cases, visit big cities and travel and stay in nature places. I like both urban and nature. 
4	Falkland islands
3	Oktoberfest i think, as i love food and beer...
2	Been wanting to go somewhere West of where I live for years. Went to California last year and it was ok. In about two weeks I'm flying to Denver to see what it's like there. Be glad to hear any experiences people have had there. \n\nAlso any other places I should visit? Mainly interested in places where it's not as hot as here in Georgia for when I move. 
2	Some place without crowds or a place that sells weed to give me the ability to tolerate people. Alaska, bfe alaska I could totally go back there out side of mosquito season.
2	I went to Bretagne for a week this year, it is the longest that we stayed away from home and it was exhausting because we didn't took enough time for ourselves to unwind.\nBut Bretagne is beautifull, cheap and quiet in the off season and we understand french.\nSo we are going back next year and plan a day in the middle of the vacation to do our own things.\nI feel a bit old that we are going back to the same region for only a week while our Peers can take three week holidays
2	Ekuk
2	Toronto. I'm a big Hockey nerd (obviously...if you couldn't tell) and i'd love to visit the city- go to the Hockey Hall of Fame, attend a Leafs game, and do other cool stuff.\n\nMy wife and I only live about 3 hours from the city itself....2 hours from the Canadian border, so it's definitely doable with a little bit of extra cash.
2	Dream Travel Location: New Zealand, to visit Hobbiton.\n\nHaving a complete itinerary scheduled and booked beforehand is a must. Not only for my sanity, but to make sure upon arrival I'd get to experience everything to my desire. Maybe even make it a solo-person trip to help cut the possibility of planning complications (I've done that before for a smaller trip).\n\n\n\nRealistic "next travel location": Atlanta, GA\n\nTo visit an old friend from school who moved out there for a job. As far as I can tell, my traveling for the next few years will be compromised of staying inside the states unless there's a major change in my financial position. I want to focus on trying weekend destination trips for $400-600 about every 1-2 months.
2	I've been to Iceland but I want to go back. By far my most favorite place I've been to, outside the Seattle area where I grew up. I enjoy traveling quite a bit, so it's strange to see so many other ISTJs who don't.  
2	[deleted]  \n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.1272 \n > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/66443)
2	I would love to travel the world. But my first stop would probably Ireland and Scotland. I think the scenery if is breath taking and there's so much interesting history to learn about there. 
28	Unhealthy crushes/infatuations	Any other ISTJs have obsessive infatuations with crushes? Any tips to avoid them?\n\n\nHow it goes for me:\nEach year I usually find myself having a crush on someone and become infatuated. I stalk their Facebook, learn everything I can about them, fanticize our lives together, and end up barely ever talking to them. They have always been healthy crushes at a safe distance. \n\nthis year though, I liked a guy who I thought liked me back so I allowed myself to fall for him. We became close, I told him things I never tell anyone, I fantasized our lives together, tried to make it obvious I liked him which I never do. He turned out to have a girlfriend. blehh But I stayed his friend, still secretly obsessed with him and it was just so unhealthy and embarrassing. I ended up cutting off contact, which felt like a breakup because I had allowed myself to become so infatuated. Really need to stop crushing on people.
16	I totally get what you're talking about. There is something about romantic type relationships that really grate on us and I think it is an ISTJ thing. Think about it... First, we tend to not really open up to people so when we find someone we do open up with it's a huge deal to us. Second, we over-analyze in an unhealthy way, including our relationships with people. Third, we tend to try to keep emotions out of many interactions, so when they are involved, they tend to be hypersensitive and extreme emotions. Okay some of that may or may not really be ISTJ, but it certainly makes sense to me. \nTips?  So I'm in my late 30s and I think I've come a long way with this, whether intentionally or not. One, you have to protect your heart. When you meet someone that you connect with, don't pour everything into that. It's fine to selectively open up to people, but recognize that it may not mean as much to that person. For example, in college I finally started to notice that some people have tons of friends that they open up with, and I would become jealous of those other people. If I really poured out my heart to that person, it would not be as meaningful or special to them as to me. Doesn't mean you can't get close to that person, but it likely won't have the same significance to them - you're setting yourself up for butthurt. So you just have to be careful. \nTwo, use your analytical side in these situations. Before you let your mind wander into fantasizing about what could be, stop and look at the reality. Is this person a good fit for you? Are they a person of good character?  These things become much more important in your 20s and 30s and help stave the infatuation stuff. \nThree, take that person you're infatuated with off their pedestal. This probably means analyzing them in a more realistic light. Sometimes this means actually getting to know them better so the reality helps combat the false world you've created inside your head about them. Also, recognizing that what you are experiencing is infatuation is good - it shows the problem is in your own head. The other reality of this is recognizing that you've turned this person into some sort of perfect being in your mind. Along with that comes the false idea that you'll never find anyone else like them and you just HAVE to figure out how to be with them. That's bullshit, and you can remind yourself of that.\nIt gets better. You will begin to recognize that these relationships are unhealthy because of the way your mind approaches them. Then you will protect yourself from them. They will also become less emotionally charged as you get older and your priorities evolve. Try to keep that in mind while you're in the depths of the emotional turmoil now!\nHope that helps a bit. 
6	Hmm, this brings up a story that you might find interesting. This story takes a couple of paragraphs to warm up, but it's something I need to get off my chest anyway.\n\nI met a girl once. She initially looked like a girl that I graduated high school with(Very hot blonde). I was at a party so everyone was in the pool while I was hanging out eating. As she walks past me I make a comment "Excuse me, are you, by chance, related to ______________?"\n\n"...No."\n\nShe said this as if she regarded me as weird for asking her this question. I was like, ok, whatever bitch. But, she ended up coming back after like 30 seconds and we talked for like 4 hours together alone. In this time she practically told me her life story (Like some really personal shit such as there being a hit on her family so she has a body guard that follows her around everywhere and how she was suicidal her freshman year) Everyone noticed how we were "clicking" as they put it. I got her number and asked her out.\n\nHowever, she made it clear that she had super strict police parents(literally) and that dating someone 2 years older than her wouldn't fly with them, but she was totally on board with being friends and doing fun shit together. I ended up asking her to go to lunch with me and two other mutual friends.\nWe went and we hung out all day at a local farm/park thing and that was the last time that I saw her. She texted me several times, the last time occurred October of 2014... And ever since I can't get her out of my fucking head.\n\nEvery second of everyday I would think about her. "If she were here, what would I do?" "If I make this decision, what would she think?" "What would SHE do if she was here?" It was nothing short of neurotic. Eventually, and I'm talking after 6 months it went down to about once an hour, and now about once a day. However, it's more than 18 months since she last saw me. Now, I would never hurt her of stalk her. I don't even know where she lives, fuck, I don't want to know where she lives. I have her phone number and could probably text her at any time, but at this point I feel like it would be unhealthy. I do check her out on her instagram and twitter everyone once in a while but... It's just strange.\n\nI don't know why I was this obsessed with her. She was so charismatic that it hurt, no matter where she was, she was the center of attention and she didn't even try. Or maybe she did try, I'm not sure. It was like every single word was plotted so that she would have immediate likability in any group of people that was in the middle of. It was scary. I talked with several of her mutual friends that claim very sociopathic behavior from her when you get to really know her, so maybe that was it?\n\nSo, yes. In my experience it is an ISTJ thing. I wrote this a while ago. I'm over her now. I still check up on her on her instagram/twitter sometimes though.
2	I'm in a vicuous cycle myself too.  -shrug- it sucks and seems it will never really "end". 
2	I really became obsessed with crushes in like 7th and 8th grade. Unfortunately, due to the fact that I was really straight-edge and talked with a lisp, I wasn't exactly popular in school and didn't have many friends.\n\nThis obsession with some crushes, one in particular, prompted me to actually e-mail one of them and express my feelings for them. She was an overly attractive, popular cheerleader, who I had classes with and talked to occasionally, but in all seriousness had no chance of being with romantically. That didn't stop me though, and none of those factors came into play when I expressed my liking for her. \n\nIt didn't work in my favor though. She e-mailed back and told me that she only liked me as a friend. Ever since then, it was pretty awkward between me and her, as well as her group of overly attractive popular friends. 
2	Woah, I didn't realize this was an ISTJ thing. I thought it was more of my cultural upbringing and mentality towards girls. Thanks for posting this!
2	Wow!  I always chalked it up to the sexual abuse I suffered as a child.  My first crush started within months of the assault.
2	I obsessed to know everything that happened in my ex's life long after break up even though I did not really cared. And I as well stalk and try to learn everything about a person that I find interesting. I guess it is an ISTJ thing to be obsessive:/ 
1	# Embrace the stalking lol
1	Never realized this was an ISTJ thing. I feel this way too 
33	I think I need help	I just spent 2.5 hours of leisure time organising music and filling in data fields in iTunes... And I enjoyed it\n\n-ISTJ
10	Been there, done that. The tagging itself wasn't enjoyable, but ending up with a well-organised and tagged library, with everything from album covers to BPM, felt pretty damn good.
3	Ha!  This brings back memories of when I spent hours organizing my Dad's vinyl LPs when I was a teenager.  Hundreds upon hundreds of them were put into alphabetical order by artist name.  He was happy about it :=)
2	Reorganized my rather large pocket notebook collection last weekend and I've felt good about it all week. 
2	Dude, it feels so nice to have every single mp3 sorted in its appropriate band folder with right album title, year and album label \n\nI guess what's the most important is you enjoyed it!\n\n
2	A well organized iTunes library is like crack. My girlfriend syncs her music from my folder because she loves how organized it is. 
2	I spent 5 hours yesterday doing an experiment to see if minimum wage is truly a livable wage. (Rent/health/vision/auto insurance/food/gas/internet/phone) and still managed to have 20% savings. \n\nI also enjoyed it and have another thing to tell stupid people in arguments to prove them wrong.
1	I do that as well, but it was hard to get the naming system right at first because I listen to music from anime, so each album would contain songs from the same series but from different artists.\n\nAnyway, it's got to be one of the many things that sound boring and tedious (and they often are) but that we do anyway for the sake of organisation and categorisation.
1	Half jealous of you, half happy for you. 
1	Did the same thing with my (book) library. Never had more fun alphabetizing things. Actually, might redo it since it's been a while.
1	I do this too. Hunting for Album Art is a nightmare sometimes. 
1	Organizing and categorizing things, specially on more 'complex' platforms such as iTunes or just files in general, is quite a bit tedious and may look like a daunting task, but when I am finished I always end up happy and refreshed with the way things end.  
1	Sounds like me. My 3 shelves of CD's are organized in my basement alphabetically and chronologically by when they came out.
1	That's a summary of what I do in my free time. Bonus points when google sheets come into play or piles of scattered papers in my room.
3	Depressed INTP without hope reporting in.	I'll keep this short because I don't want to be "that" INTP. \n\nI have two ISTJ parents. I spend all of my time right now trying to figure them out but it's like no amount of knowledge helps.\n\nI try to explain to them things I  understand about their temperaments, and they agree and even laugh, but I can never get them to understand how I am afterward in contrast.\n\nNo matter what I say, sitting around thinking is "doing nothing."\n\nNot liking going to work is being "not a operational person."\n\nHaving a room that isn't organized is "inhumane."\n\nIt doesn't hurt my feelings they say things like that. It hurts my feelings they think I'm doing nothing the one time I may actually be doing something lol. Can they not understand thinking is work too?\n\nDoes anyone here have a good relationship with an INTP?\n\nI like my rents, but I'm about to give up on ever seriously talking to them because I never get any recognition. I can't even get proper recognition for why they don't like me lol. They even got that wrong. At least don't appreciate me for who I am that's all I ask.
4	I dunno. It sounds less like a ISTJ problem and more of a parent problem. My husband and I are both ISTJs and parents and we don't do any of that stuff you mentioned. Of course someone might not like going to work (do most people?!). Of course your room will get a bit messy and it's likely it will bug your parents. There's nothing inhumane about that! \n\nI noticed you said you're 29. It's their house, even if they choose to be unreasonable. Suck it up for a couple months and then get out.

2	[deleted]
2	Thinking is a huge part of my life. I pretty much live inside my own mind (This is also part of my personality disorder, but it's also very prevalent of ISTJs because we need to plan every detail of everything.) \n\nNot liking going to work is a fact of life. You will NEVER be in a job that you love every part about. There will always be that asshole boss, that sociopathic coworker, that bullshit bureaucracy, the fucking job itself. So, that is bullshit. Also, you might not like the job, but if you do go to it, by definition, you are operational because you are of use. \n\nHaving a room that isn't organized is "inhumane" WTF? Not organized to whom? Them? For me, I have a messy room to any outsider. However, there is a method to the madness and it is organized to me. I can tell you where everything is without looking. If they're ISTJ they would understand that. \n\nAll of these things that they accuse you of are entirely subjective and/or misguided. I sincerely doubt that they are ISTJ. 
1	This is less to do with Meyers Briggs and more to do with a lack of communication imo. It sounds like you aren't expressing yourself and are instead expexting your parents to know how you feel. This is rediculous. You need to express yourself in order for people to know how you feel. ISTJs in particular are about as intuitive as rocks, so we might need even more direct conversation. Talk to your parents and ask to find common ground. Worst case scenario they find out where you're coming from.
1	Maybe try explaining yourself in more action-oriented phrases. Instead of saying "I'm thinking" you could say "I"m reflecting" or "I'm planning". Thinking is a bit vague and can be misinterpreted as daydreaming but using words like reflecting or planning makes it look like you're actively doing something. 
2	ENTP here, I suspect my SO of being INTJ. How much trouble am I in?	I've been muddling around learning some of the typing, and can safely say i'm solid ENTP.  However, I'm having some trouble figuring out how to type my SO.  ISTJ looks like a pretty solid fit.  What do i need to know?
5	Hey there, just want to confirm, is your SO an INTJ or ISTJ? Because you refer to them as an INTJ in the title and an ISTJ in the description. 
4	http://www.personality-central.com/ISTJ-ENTP.html\n\nThat's a decent run down of the strengths and weaknesses of the pairing. \n\nThat said, at the end of the day, if both of you are willing to try and make it work you shouldn't have anymore issues than any other couple. Don't sweat it. Both sides have to figure out how the other communicates and both will have to make compromises in that area. 
1	It supposedly works out really well. Not for me, as I seem to be the only exception on this sub... But, you should still be fine as long as he is neurotypical.
1	Well, I have read ISTJs and ENTPs cant get along that well. Especially parent child relationship. Its gonna be hard. Very hard. The S vs N trouble. If your SO is openminded then it could work. 
1	You should be okay if you generally don't get into fights with the whole of TJ kind. My best relationship to date was with an ISTJ and I still find him fascinating. He is such a great, curious and quirky person. There are so many good things about them.
1	Be direct and I think finding out her love language would be good. She'll appreciate that a lot.\n\nAlso, I know its not very important for you guys, but keeping to your word when you expressly say that you will, would probably get you some brownie points as well.\n\nGood luck! It should be fun (:
2	Female ISTJ style	I know 4 ISTJ women in real life (including my sister), and I've realised that they all dress extremely feminine.\n\nI instinctually think of T types as more masculine (which is of course completely wrong). Yes, the people I know are all straight forward, analytical thinkers, but they all dress very traditionally femme chic. I thought it would veer to the grungy side, but no. They dress more feminine than me sometimes!\n\nIt makes sense, you being Dom-Si. While they like wearing jewellery, glitter, false nails, frills, and makeup, I would describe their style as still modest, plain, and relatively unexperimental. I notice they tend to opt for matchy-matching (over-doing their one favourite colour rather than mixing it up with a complimentary palette), block colours, simple lines and shapes, popular brands... things I have a tendency to label as "safe" and boring.\n\nNo offence meant. Everyone is entitled to their own style, and I know I am usually opposite to ISTJs. It's just a surprising observation.\n\nDo you think this is an female ISTJ thing, or just something in common with the people I know? \n\nHow would you describe your own style?
4	ISTJ female here, and I recognize the description. I like simple pieces that are more on the modest side. I like block colors and don't wear shirts with an obnoxious design. I wear both high end clothing and cheaper clothing but my style is consistent (classic, modern, polished). I don't mind spending a little more money on pieces I know that I'll love for years, but it's always great to find an affordable piece!  I wear clothes that are tailored and fit well with my body but never too tight, because I feel uncomfortable in tight/revealing clothing. My nails are tidy, on the shorter side and sometimes I like to paint them. I've never gotten those super long acrylic nails because I honestly am not a fan of them (they're not practical!). I always choose neutral colors for my nails (beige, white, etc) but on a rare occasion, will go for another color like red. No designs, just regular painted nails. I wear minimal makeup and am not a fan of bright lip colors. I wouldn't consider my style "super feminine" as I do wear pants a lot and keep it pretty plain, but I do like dresses a lot. As for jewelry, I only wear gold or rose gold. I also like pearls a lot, although I don't wear them every day. Overall, jewelry is a special occasion thing. \n\nHere are some looks that I'd wear. \n[look 1](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/d9/ab/a9/d9aba9e63b6ed04d7647cd0dfa436608.jpg) \n[look 2](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/90/41/89/904189abf1b6f1c958e3e64eefa764a2.jpg)\n[look 3](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/52/15/4a/52154a743dc779916a893d0f5c27eada.jpg)\n[look 4](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/9e/10/e7/9e10e777d95bab24dc605faed9fb3556.jpg)\n[look 5](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/15/bf/c3/15bfc374225a3827cd4c55cf74b99dc5.jpg)\n\n
3	As a man, I dress like you described. Simple plain classically cut clothes, nothing fashionable. I guess because I don't want to stand out at all. But no brands, as they're overpriced.
3	I'm a female ISTJ and I dress quite plainly for the most part. I've always been a t-shirts and jeans type. My nails are unpainted and bitten/torn up, yay bad habits! I've never been comfortable having my clothing attract attention to me, so I try to play it down. I enjoy doing makeup but even on my boldest day it's pretty damn tame.\n\nNow, I often fantasize about being more bold and dressing how I imagine I could look in my head. Usually this ends up with me buying items of clothing that never get worn or only get worn when I know I won't see anyone I know.
2	I guess my style would be called "classic." I'm a frugal person so I don't buy into clothing fads very often. I prefer well made pieces that will last me for years.\nI don't wear makeup unless I have to (formal event, job interview, etc) but I do paint my fingernails because they're weak and break without it.\n\nMy most girly feature is my love of shiny jewelry but I'm fine admiring it in the store or on another person--my jewelry collection is pretty small.
2	I'm a female ISTJ. I like things looking matchy and pretty. I don't talk much so clothes are my way of expressing myself. My personality isn't very girly at all but for some reason I love girly stuff.  I like cute dresses, floral prints, things with animals on them, crossbody bags, cute Japanese style stuff, t shirts with a favorite show or movie or animal on it, etc. I like designer stuff. Modcloth is amazing. I'm sort of materialistic. My stuff makes me happy. lol for example I collect dolls and like to display them neatly, and just admire them. All my clothes are on pink hangers. I like everything neat and pretty. Part of the fun is researching what I want, like what brand makeup is best, or finding a picture of a rare shirt and trying to identify it and hunt it down for sale somewhere like on EBay or Poshmark. I wear nail polish because it's fun and I like my nails all smooth and shiny. lol\nI'm also very concerned about how I look. For the longest time I hated how I was overweight so I lost the weight. I have super impossibly high standards for myself, including looks which stinks.
2	I know this is about ISTJ girls, but I have a guy friend I know, for sure, is an ISTJ. I see him in the same simple clothes all the time. Solid colors, clean lines, always weather appropriate -- the type of clothing that falls somewhere between Boring and I Actually Care About How I Look. \n\nI do recall, quite clearly, at one point he was doing extensive research on what sort of style he wanted to portray. He went into great detail with me about various styles of military jackets (I guess he was exploring an alternative sort of look), and ended up buying one. It was authentic, of course. He told me exactly what it was, but all I remember is it was blue. This was the last I ever heard from him about styling choices that didn't involve his hair. I've only seen him wear the jacket once, maybe twice.
1	[deleted]  \n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9086 \n > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/50529)
1	As a Female ISTJ, I actually have a very fluid style, I dress for the mood I'm in and that can range from [Classic Lolita](http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/lady_enchanter/47064689/11726/original.jpg)  \nTo full on [Vis-kei](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/05/77/67/05776761e749cdc55544778dab7f964e.jpg)  \nI wear anything from Kimono to corsets, bustle skirts and skinny jeans with punk boots!  \nI don't wear jewlery though, other than my piercings and occasionally a collar. I don't bother with my nails and makeup is usually very dark and vis-kei. My hair is always crazy though, either cut wise or colours. It's been every colour of the rainbow (including rainbow!!!)   \nEdit: Oh, and I'm rarely seen without my hat! (which has pokemon gym badges on it currently!)
11	Do you go on Wikipedia/Wikia/TV Tropes for hours	Possible ISTJ here. I was wondering if ISTJ's spend hours opening dozens of tabs and hoarding useless knowledge. Also have you checked what type you are over and over again? 
4	Oh yeah I do that big time. I just open a bunch of tabs as I read texts and information is given.\n\n>Also have you checked what type you are over and over again? \n\nI know for sure I'm an ISTJ but when I see a new quiz I like to try it out just for fun.\n
3	Honestly no, not at all. I've taken the test several times over about 6 years and it never changes. I read about a couple hobbies I have and do my college course work, which is plenty of knowledge for one day. I try to relax when I have time 
3	I don't like too many tabs open at a time.  I do, however, have about 400 bookmarked pages.  LOL\n\nDid 3 or 4 different versions of the test and always get same ISTJ results.
2	What else is there to do besides that?
2	Me every time I'm on reddit: http://i.imgur.com/FIJj9IM.jpg\n\nEdit: And yes, I've checked my type several times already and I've always ended up as an ISTJ. 
2	I try not have loads of tabs open, because I dislike them, but yes, I do tend to horde useless knowledge as you call it jaja. I always want to learn and like to consider myself a small encyclopedia because I will at least know a small bit about almost anything. Also, I have repeated the test multiple times and I am a balance between ISTJ and ISFJ.
2	No, but I like finding entertainment that involves thinking. I find TheWikiGame insanely addictive. I recommend it to any ISTJ.\n\nhttp://thewikigame.com/\n\n
1	[deleted]
1	I kind of do this except I don't have all my tabs on one page, instead I have a chrome page for each topic which I sort my tabs into \neg. 5 tabs on one page specifically about WWII and 2 tabs on one page that are social media
1	I read the "unusual articles" section in Wikipedia at least once or twice a month.
1	Yes, I get lost in Wikipedia all the time.
9	Weekly Thread: Who is your role model?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: Who do you look up to, admire, or try to emulate?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
11	I don't really have any role models, to be honest. 
5	I sort of analyze people and find the best things about them and try to emulate that. I also sometimes look at negative aspects of others and see how I can avoid those traits. I don't really have one role model, lots of people can inspire me though, whether it's the way a musician can express themself through their lyrics, or how the person who made my sandwich at Subway kept a smile on their face the whole time they served me.
4	I build up the person I want to be in my mind and aspire to that.
3	My grandpa. He lived a hard life (like, son of a prostitute and drug-mule hard) and fought in the shit in WWII. He dropped out of school. Stole a car. Landed in jail. Had to stay after the war to clean up. Boxed for money. Just the toughest guy ever and I swear to you, he was the most kind, happiest, fun-loving, hilarious man on the planet. He had a nickname for everyone. I never heard him say an unkind thing, ever. He was fiercely protective of his family and didn't give a single shit about what anyone thought of him. He didn't need to. Everyone loved him. \n\nMy grandma had MS for 30 years. She deteriorated fast - was blind and couldn't walk before I was even born. He couldn't drive - never drove after the stolen car incident. He got his shit together, stayed by her side, raised their 5 kids (my dad was 2nd oldest. He has three brothers and one sister and one half-sister [another crazy story!]). He provided and taught them to "fight for your brothers, not with your brothers." He walked everywhere - cowboy boots, too-tight jeans, sleeveless mesh shirt. He was known for his crew cut and happy smile. \n\nHe died in 2001 and there's not a day that goes by that I don't think of him. \n\nBest dude ever. 
3	Probably my mom. We have alot in common as far as our personality and traits are concerned. 
2	My solid-state professor. Dude has such a passion for science and learning. And he's crazy in a great way.
2	My former boss, who's now a close friend. He's an INTJ. I've always relied on him for career advice. 
2	Chuck Norris.
2	I never had a role model in my life until about two months ago when I sat down and actually thought about it. \n\nMy answer:\n-Elon Musk\n-Edward Snowden\n
2	I don't really look up to anyone at all. I just from time to time get inspired by some to become better at something. For example a very bright(happy) and sporty friend I have inspired me to actually do exercise in a constant manner, but I don't look up to her, I admire that she is so good at sports so I work to cover my sport lacking life. It happens like so in different things but do not follow or look up to a single specific person. 
4	What does your to-do list look like? How is it organized?	
4	I just write lists on my phone's notepad because I always keep my phone with me.\n\nI add stuff as it goes, delete stuff as I'm done.
3	I use Google Keep. I have three sections based on priority and importance. High priority High importance, low priority low priority low importance, and low priority high importance.\n
3	THIS IS SUCH A TYPICALLY ISTJ THREAD!! I LOVE YOU GUYS xD\n\n(mind you, I'm lurking here from the INFP thread, and everything we post would make you want to slap us several times until we stop talking emo)
2	Here is half of my ongoing to-do list. I keep it organized in a google doc.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/F4tgE2u
2	I write it on my window or mirror with a dry erase marker.  I keep the days of the week up there and then just write short little bullets to remind myself what's happening/needs to happen, and then sometimes if things are hectic I'll draw arrows or sub bullets to elaborate order or details. As things are completed, they are erased.
2	I never really have an ongoing list. But I do have many lists all throughout the house. I can't work without a list, but I also can't really focus on an old list, either. My priorities shift a lot, depending on the day. I think I am a little ADD in that way. Sometimes they are very detailed, and other times just quick things that I need to do. \n\n[Here's my short list for today.](https://imgur.com/a/9r1yq). Mostly because mustache.
1	I keep all of that inside my head. 
1	I've grown to only write something on a list if I've forgotten about it more than once. So when I first started going grocery shopping I would make a list, but you get to used to it that you don't have to make a list. Same thing with running errands on the weekend, I always have something on my desk to remind me to complete that task. Such as fixing a friend's car, I'll write down a price on a random sheet of paper and then when the weekend comes I'll clean my desk and take care of everything. The only time that I absolutely make lists is if I'm strapped for time. 
1	I've got a huge-ass whiteboard in my room that I use for thing like household chores, prioritizing homework, and packing suitcases. For reminders at specific times, like remembering to start cooking dinner, I'll set alarms on my phone.
1	I use Evernote and maintain a bunch of checklists on Google Keep, such as: Groceries, Books/Movies to Look Into, Stuff to Download, and Random Stuff to Buy (when I have extra money). 
1	I use the free note app on my phone. Usually when i'm busy, I make a list of stuff to do on there so I don't forget...because I tend to forget stuff alot. 
1	To keep track of work or school (projects, exams, meetings, to-dos, etc), I used a modified [Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com/). I like it because it's simple, versatile and super easy to customize.\n\nThe key to using this system is 1) making it your own (ie use the instructions as a guide but change anything that doesn't work for you), and 2) not adhering to the system to rigidly (ie set some rules to generally follow, but don't let them limit how you use the book). \n\nFor me, the best thing about a paper to-do system like this is that, unlike electronic systems, it can be used for things that it's not "programmed" for.\n\nFor personal to-dos, I write out a sticky note (occasionally, I'll use my phone's reminder app) for day-to-day tasks, and I have a whiteboard for more long-term to-dos.
1	I set reminders in my phone (google planner has a new one in which you can mark something as finished) \nFor big things like a holiday I keep lists in Google keep.\nIn different sections (money, phonecalls, luggage, administration, security)
1	I've been using a bullet journal. I like it much better than Calendar on the iPhone.
4	Trust issues, self sabotage, and gaining an ISTJ's trust - what to do? Opinions? Thoughts? Help!	  
6	The only things that work with an ISTJ is hardcore evidence. Something like trust is pretty much unprovable. Most people blindly trust others. For an ISTJ, we cannot just leave things up to chance or take a leap of faith. It's impossible for us. So, "What words and actions are most effective in swaying you guys?" Nothing... We'll make up our minds on our own times. The more you push it, the more we'll push *you* away. \n\nTo be honest... It sounds like a rocky relationship that is doomed for failure. He sounds very controlling and almost emotionally abusive with how suspicious he is. You don't sound happy with him so...... You should know what to do.\n\nThis is all assuming he is an ISTJ to begin with.
1	I'm having a similiar problem with an ISTJ female.\nI'm an INTJ male, and she's having serious trusting issues and also sure that the relation is not going to work.  I'm known to be intense, but she's just too damn serious sometimes\nMy "If there's a will, there's a way" answer doesn't really work.\nWe both annoy the hell out of each other so soon. I choose to see this is a good omen - a sign that we both care. But I worry, as I don't want to be the fireman in the relationship, having to put out fires all the time. 
1	Good Books for ISTJs in a crummy situation?	Hello fellow ISTJs!  So I and having a rough time at work due to my personality type.  I feel like I am surrounded by people who just don't care and are just going through the motions.  I say this because our departments in is a pretty crummy state, and everyones thoughts on it is that "nothing will ever change, just get used to it" which I obviously cannot live with.  \n\nThe reason I'm posting today is to see if any of you have read any good books about ISTJ or Type A that may help me cope/understand my personality a little better so that I don't constantly get internally upset that no one else cares as much as I do and that they're all willing to just watch the department crumble instead of doing something about it.  \n\nAlso, has anyone else been in a situation like this?  If so, how did you deal with it.  Obviously the easiest solution is to eliminate the stimuli, but I'm starting my MBA program next month, and my employer is paying for it 100% and is also paying for 50% of my wife's (I work for a large University Hospital) so I'm stuck for at least the next 2.5 years.  Any help, advice, kind words appreciated.  Thanks in advance!
1	The last two motivational/work related books I read were 'the life changing magic of tidying up' by Marie Kondo and 'lean in' can't remember the author, but it's a best seller. I highly recommend both. \n\nLean in deals with gender issues in the workplace and society, but hits on a lot of great general communication points as well. I actually think it should be required in all business courses. Kinda rocked my world. \n\nThe book by Marie Kondo might not help in the workplace, but could help you feel better about your life at home. Sometimes controlling your environment at home can at least give you refuge when you aren't working. I've been very excited to KonMari my home and it's introduced a new kind of peace and ease into my non work life. She has two books in the series on tidying up - one has illustrations which is helpful. 
1	I personally like "7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey. By the title, I would have thought it'd be a bunch of buzzword, business advice mumbo jumbo, but it is much more of a process-oriented approach to living. He drew this advice from many sources and does a great job of communicating it.\n\nOne of those things is to always look at what you can control. Don't focus on something outside of you that is outside of your control, because if you define that as your problem, you're chaining yourself to that problem because it is something you don't have the power to change. So what can *you* do? For instance, do you have the time, energy, and desire to create some kind of committee or start some kind of initiative to change things...?\n\nI would suggest reading that book -- it does a great job of outlining a path from personal responsibility and growth, to nurturing interpersonal partnerships and efforts. Very much a process and principle-oriented approach, rather than a technique and strategy-oriented approach.
1	I'm a big fan of The War Of Art by Steven Pressfield. It's mostly revolves around the artists' plight, but it is a wonderful self help book that applies to any venture you're thinking of starting. It's a great motivator and I try to read it at least once a year. \n
9	Any tips to help an ISTJ with social anxiety?	She has mild social anxiety, where she does not like walking near places with people she doesn't know (even in school), typically blends into the surroundings even when she is interacting with a group of friends, she often holds pessimistic opinions about how people would judge her and she dislikes straying from her perception of what is socially acceptable. She hides most of her nervousness with nervous laughter, so I doubt if anyone else knows about this. \n\nNote that she is likely to be adverse to seeking professional help, having other people know about it or even for me to overtly help her overcome her anxiety.\nAny help is greatly appreciated ^_^
3	I'm not certain I can be of any help but out of curiosity how old is she? 
3	If she's not open to professional help like therapy, please have her read the book "The Happiness Trap" by Russ Harris. This book details Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which has been immensely helpful in helping me overcome my social anxiety that escalated to the point of panic disorder and agoraphobia. It's worth checking out and is easy enough to read and understand without going to therapy yourself. That said, I've benefitted immensely from therapy and recommend everyone go at least once in their lives just for a check up, even if they don't have a mental health diagnosis. I hate the stigma around mental healthcare and that it's somehow different than going to an optometrist to get glasses or a physical therapist for an injury. If one of your main organs (your brain) needs some help, it's okay to ask for it. Anyway, suggest the book to her and she if she bites. 
3	She doesn't sound much different from me when I was her age. What helped me a lot was being around someone I trusted who accepted me for who I was yet encouraged me to come out of my shell a little at a time. I'm in my *cough* 50's *cough* now and still prefer to be as far away from social situations as possible but I hardly feel that I need medication for it. Despite still being uncomfortable at social gatherings I manage to get through it with a huge sigh of relief when it's over. Maybe counseling would help, maybe not. Like I said, I'm not much help particularly when I'm not there to see specific behavior patterns. Patience and encouragement is always helpful, though.
2	I'm 25 years old and that describes me perfectly. Only advice I have is finding safe social spaces online until she has the time and money to explore expressing herself in small steps. Finally landing a job last year has helped me a bit, but still living with my father I'm still pretty much stifled as far as learning how to express myself without anxiety.
2	Ehm this sounds counterproductive but I joined a group that organised parties. I discovered that if I'm in a function I can play 'social'. Like I can ask people how they like the party and go away if the conversation is boring our if I get tired. I used my work at the party as a perfect excuse. I trained my 'people' skills during that time.

1	I agree with ENTJragemode, that a friend can help, if a good "fit".  She is quite smart, with a quick mind and decisive - but likely is hard on herself and on others as a result.  What are her goals since she is 18?  In general no matter what style we find ourself with - the sooner we can get on with our goals and gain self-love and acceptance the sooner we obtain reduced anxiety in dealing with others.   
7	Mental "breakdowns"	*For lack of better word, I say breakdown*    \nAnyone else here go through infrequent/occasional *breakdowns* or emotional bouts, due to lack of emotional exchanges?    \nI feel like the fact that I refuse to let on about anything unsatisfactory (99.5% of the time) leads to a giant growing pile of emotions which are stuffed into the farthest chamber of my heart, never to see the light of day. And then occasionally I'll just get angry/melancholic (when no one's around).
11	Yep. I think ISTJs overextend themselves and hold everything in, in an effort to always keep it together, as we're duty fulfillers. I tend to overcommit or overdo it, take it too far, and then just *snap*. This happened to me recently as I over extended myself with work, was working an insane amount of hours, getting no sleep, and feeling like I had to just 'get it done' since I'd already committed to it. I bottled it up for weeks and then just had a freak out because it was too much.\n\nOf course, true to ISTJ, my freakout was witnessed by no one but my husband :)

2	Going through this right now OP. Had a week and a half of constant socializing, coupled with certain additional personal stresses. On Tuesday I ended up having to provide emotional support for my SO, mom, and a coworker. Then my sister started venting to me incessantly about something she was wrong about, till I snapped and yelled STOP and I've been in a bad mood ever since. Just normalizing back again now.
1	Yes, I always stuff thing in the bottom-est, darkest corner of my mind (or heart), everything that affects me: problems, emotions, etc.. This leads to become depressed and melancholic at times when things just bottle up to much; and having no one to talk to about these things (not like I would), I just let it pour as I listen to music and write a poem or two during various nights. \nOne time though, I did had a more intense "breakdown", after stuffing and trying to handle a really stressful situation in which I was the leader, it came a point where it was just to much and began to cry (for the first time in more than 10 years), of course I did not cried until I was alone, lol\n
1	I am an ISFJ, but I have the same feelings you do... If it wasn't for music I honestly would have killed myself by now. Often times I get into a horrific mood, and If I don't get some alone time with my music I become GRUMPY until I get the chance to listen and compose myself. I have noticed that I reach the breaking point faster than ever now-a-days... I know what you are saying that there is a pile of emotions building up... More and more stuff is bothering me and not talking about them is affecting me big time right now... only thing is I don't WANT to talk to anyone about them. Weird feeling. \n\nTo answer your question, yes. I get very angry and melancholic when I am alone, which is quite often now that all my friends seem to be "busy" all the time now.
8	How fast do you find yourself making up your mind about romantic partners?	Just something I noticed that I do a lot is start dating someone and then within a couple of dates (or a couple of weeks or months) find myself deciding that it's not going to work out and consequently break off the relationship. Do others here find themselves making judgments like that so quickly, or do you mostly take longer to make up your minds?
15	I know right away if someone isn't right. \n\nBut constantly analyzing if they ARE right, and once they hit or reveal one of my deal breakers, then I'm done. \n\nI tend to know quite quickly if they have potential or not. I know what I want, and it's easy to move on if they don't have those qualities. 
7	They are or aren't. It's almost instantaneous. If I'm going to be with someone, that someone can't be pushy, attention seeking, drama seeking, manipulative. They have to be comfortable with silence and can't be super petty. \n\nPeople with any of those traits stand out.
3	Yes. I can tell early on if a person is worth my time. I think it's pretty normal for ISTJs to do this sort of thing
3	My ISTJ tells me he knew within 2 weeks that he wanted to marry me-and we married 4 1/2 months later.
1	Instantly when I met them in person. I only do coffee dates or something I like so I can at least bail quickly. 
1	+1 For right away. My SO (INFJ) and I actually spent a lot of time before we dated, due to circumstances, talking about what our relationship would entail. Right down to "what marriage and/or raising kids would look like"
1	My wife knew that she wanted to marry me, and that I wanted to within a month of us dating/seeing each other. To be fair, however, we were good friends before we started dating. 
1	My wife knew by the 4th date that she wanted to marry me.  \n  \nTo be fair she is from India where that's kind of the olde fashioned way of doing things.
5	Hello ISTJ's, so how do we chat you guys up then?	Can you please give us some things that would warm your little [inaccessible, buried under 94 layers of you-ain't-getting-in-here-pal] ISTJ hearts? Just asking for a friend.......:p
21	All my current friends did two things when trying to get to know me:\n\n1. They didn't get tired to talk to me about all kinds of things until they hit a topic which connects us and which we would both enjoy talking about.\n2. They didn't bury me in personal questions or try to push too deep into my personal life.\n\nIn a more manual-like formulation:  \nDon't misinterpret our not so talkative phase as being not interested (usually my biggest problem) and find a (not personal/emotional) topic where we actually join the conversation on. Try technical stuff or ask for actual help on a technical topic/problem.
12	People in general like to talk about their interests, but since ISTJs generally are less-than-stellar at communicating openly, talking to them about an interest that you know they have is an easy way to get them open to open up, as well as make them feel validated (maybe not the best word choice). So if you could casually bring up something that is a big interest to them, I'm sure they would be happy to explain and share their knowledge (you might learn something which is always a plus). If you know they're holding out on how much they want to say, a small amount (think microscopic) of prodding would let them know that they can divulge more knowledge because they might think that you don't care a whole bunch about the initial little bit of this specific topic.\n\nGiving complete attention to when they speak, because to ISTJs, it's pretty important knowing that someone is actually listening to us when we say something. We aren't the biggest talkers, so when we do talk, we think it is worth hearing.\n\ntl;dr take an interest in their interests and be a good listener
8	I think it's due to my social anxiety, but I feel like no one is interested in anything I have to say at my current workplace. When I start talking about something I enjoy people look away and are like 'mmhmm...' and type away at their computers and not talk/look to me. It's really discouraging for me to want to talk about my interests to anyone because I feel like they portray everyone else. \n\nI'm more of a listener. I really have a hard time socializing. 
7	[deleted]
5	Depending on the situation, I think any combination of the following would work:\n\n1. **Initiate:** Whether you're romantically or platonically interested, text us first, or come say hi. We're usually in corners not because we're anti-social, but because we're observing our surroundings and don't want to be the center of attention. But if we're out, chances are we spent the mental and emotional energy to prepare ourselves for socializing, so we're more than open to it, and likely *want* it; we just don't want to/know how to *get* it.\n\n2. **Let us listen:** Yes, you want to get to know us and we appreciate that. But the best way to do that--especially if we're just meeting for the first time--is to talk about yourself. It's not arrogant; we'll engage by asking questions and piping in when we find some common ground we can talk about. THEN an actual conversation will happen.\n\n3. **NO small talk:** Don't be afraid to talk about big stuff. This might be weird to someone who's not an ISTJ (or likely just not an I), but just get in there. You don't have to ask about my deepest fear or the significance of my childhood night terrors, but pick something of substance other than your I-can't-human-properly-what's-the-weather-small-talk. Like, if you find out we majored in Linguistics, ask us why we chose that, or what languages we studied (or what the hell that even is!). \n\nEXAMPLE: I was once at a party where I only knew the host (I *really* like this guy ;)) and I ended up talking with someone in med school. Granted, it started with mild small talk: How do you know the host? Did you go to college? But within five minutes, I discovered he was in med school. BINGO. A topic I knew nothing about. Commence question asking and intense listening. We were able to chat about that for a while. Actually converse, not take turns asking each other questions.\n\nBONUS EXAMPLE: Met a guy at a bar once, and a week later, we went out for drinks. He had just taken a life empowerment class (not the technical term), and we spent the next two hours talking about life and going after what you want and personal growth. BEST date (if you could call it that) I've ever been on with someone I didn't know well. I don't know that we ever exchanged basic bio info other than typical, "My name's Mary; yes I'm from around here." **We didn't want to know things about each other; we just wanted to know each other.**
3	I'd love to meet another ISTJ. The only one I know is my dad :3
3	For me, my silence has been misinterpreted as having no interest in a person. But it was really just me being so interested in listening and learning. There's almost no topic I shy away from so eventually, I do get talking. \n\nIt's also plus points if someone isn't uncomfortable in silence. 
2	There is emotion, but it simply isn't relevant or needed. Ask any ISTJ and you'll get that.\n\nI like to talk about...well, do I even like to talk in the first place? If I get a topic that genuinely interests me, like a video game I play, or something I found interesting in science class, I'd love to talk.

1	I really don't like small talk- you know, talking with someone just to talk. I converse better when I have a common interest with someone.
1	I've never made a friend purely through talking. It's too awkward. I like doing stuff with people like a project or activity and I'll give small bits of info along the way. Sometimes I do stuff with friends, don't say much, but the fact they enjoy my boring company makes them a good friend. If they keep inviting me to do stuff, I feel appreciated and begin to open up more. I rarely initiate anything out of laziness and because it filters out the people that don't care much for me. Maybe it's my insecurity, but I need to know you 100% want to be my friend forever before I open up. The worst thing is to show my true self to someone only for them to ditch me, or undervalue me. Then I'll ignore you forever like the plague and hate you with the fury of a thousand burning suns. I care a lot about my friends and will be there forever for them. So it hurts a ton open up and realize they don't care about you. And if I shared deep thoughts and feelings with that person, I feel embarrassed and exploited. So I rarely do.
2	What are some ways to tell an ISTJ apart from an ESTJ?	Particularly if the person in question is not an extreme extrovert or introvert? I would love to hear some real life examples, rather than guessing or theory :). 
3	Basically an introvert will eventually need to get away and get some alone time to recharge, extroverts will tend to avoid being by themselves if possible. But that being said introverts can be outgoing. I've scored over 90% introverted on the tests I've taken, but I still enjoy going out to bars and socializing. Just need to get some alone time after. 
2	In a group setting, once an ESTJ finds something they like doing they would ask (and even pressure) other people to do it too. So say they joined a softball team and they enjoyed it, they would then tell everyone they know to join the team. If an ISTJ enjoyed something, they would turn they may or may not invite others, and if they did, it would only be their closest friend. 
1	I have a friend who is an ESTJ musician, and an ISTJ friend who's a grad student. Both are Christian. The ESTJ likes to learn to use the knowledge to bring to me to win arguments. In contrast, the ISTJ seems to like being a credible source more than being correct.  
15	ISTJ's guide to keeping your INFP happy	If you're interested ;)\n\nRomance and connection is what you need to create to keep that lil INFP coming back for more :D wait....where are you going? Oh just vomited on yourself....it's ok, I'll wait for you to come back....\n*whistles*\n\n\nHow does one simulate connection?\n\n-it's in the eyes: slightly lingering glances with a slight smile. Try to notice your INFPs eyes when they are flirting with you: notice their eyes are more alive and sparkling (?watery even?!??) when they talk with the person they admire. If you can pick up on this and return it with a slightly shy smile, INFP will feel connected.\n\n-letting them know you're checking them out, but subtly not like 'casualhourglass I stared at her chest ALL NIGHT and she punched me you liar'\n\n-use a softer tone of voice with them than with others - INFP will notice this\n\n-doing little things that show you were thinking about them when they were out of sight\n - a tiny inexpensive thing achieves as much as costly stuff. Eg, you know INFP likes chocolate bar X, so you buy it and leave it in her bag or on his desk.\n\n-this is important: shared private jokes. Make a reference to something in a group that only the two of you fully understand - execute with classic ISTJ dry style and you've got one INFP laughing or staring at you with big round eyes that are sparkling. And do this without giving a crap about including others - the trick is to make your INFP feel special above the other people in the room.\n\n-tell your INFP stuff about yourself, once you trust them of course (BUT DONT FRIKKIN WAIT 1000 YEARS UNTIL THERES JUST A SKELETON REMAINING NEXT TO YOU WHERE THE FRIKKIN INFP ONCE WAS. YOU HAVE TO RISK STUFF TO CONNECT. like, waiting till INFP dies will, to be fair, reduce the chances of your secrets being retold...I admit your logic is strong BUT I DONT LIKE IT). Tell INFP stuff about the inner you that no-one else knows. This is the currency of connection for an INFP, if we're telling you secrets we are extremely close to you, or are trying to become so. Tell stuff that counts, like the times you realised you didn't want to become your dad, or what rejection did to make you who you are, why you stay in your job even though you don't love it, what your first pet meant to you. \n\n\nRomance: \nHaving a connection is the daily bread n butter for a happy INFP - if you can for that stuff every day or at least a few times a week, I expect INFP will tick along without complaints.  Don't leave it more than a week without connecting on some level.\n\nOther things (we're pretty cheap dates ha!)\n\n-take us for a walk somewhere pretty - cool cityscape, beach, forest, or just round the block with you will ,are us happy; why? You're holding our hands for one :p. We get your full attention. We both will chat and connect. There's no other goal for the activity (from your perspective) other than to be with us = INFP HAPPY.\n\n-we love books apparently...soooo (DONT VOMIT AGAIN) you know that scene in Beauty and the Beast....(stay with me here) when he tskes her to the library? Well, kinda like that but a bit less cheesy...*casualhourglass sprints away being pelted with ISTJ slippers and insults* or museums will do instead of libraries, or art galleries. Just take us there and show us a couple of cool bits you think are relevant to us (oh look, it's Kurt Cobains autobiography on this shelf...or here is the ancient Egypt display...)\n\n-take us out one night to a place you can see the stars amazing without too much light pollution, have a couple of blankets packed and a thermos, and just go sit silently with your INFP watching them for a while. In your brain you may be like, that's pretty sweet to look at, but your INFPs mind will be traversing galaxies, imagining other worlds, cresting plot lines and poetry in a world of wonder next to you...and thinking how did she ever deserve this sex-on-legs-man-beast of an ISTJ next to her. Same applies for ISTJ girls with their INFP bloke, just hopefully without the beast part in his head...*date not going so well otherwise*\n\n\nRight, too much writing. Hope this is of interest to someone out there and you don't ban me from your otherwise rational and brief subreddit. Feel free to ask and questions <3 yes, I'll come to your weddings, thanks for asking.....*shucks*

3	Just asked my mate leavingNYCforwhere to weigh in too...
3	Yeah those would all have me. Im not expensive, Id rather have time connecting than for someone to spend hundreds of dollars on jewelry. Someone going through the time of packing blankets and a lunch then driving me out to nowhere. Just to spend time with me...priceless! 
2	Nailed it!! (From, an INFP) 
2	This is so cute and true! :3
2	[deleted]
2	I can't wait to share this with my wife!
1	My sister is INFP and we are so close like best friends so I think some of these might be accurate with her, of course minus the romantic stuff Lol \nMy observations with her, maybe some of it is just sisterly stuff idk:\n-silent communication through eye contact, funny faces, or funny voices\n-references to movies/shows/books, just saying like "voldemorts nose" or "the car scene in titanic" makes us laugh. she also likes Disney movies.\n-inside jokes, reminiscing and dramatically retelling funny weird things that happened, like embarrassing stories and laughing at them.\n-going on adventures. she loves spontaneously going somewhere new. she gets all excited and fun to be around \n-artsy things, she likes museums. I found them boring but learned to appreciate art and point out things about them. or make a joke\n-texting funny pics, gifs, or articles. she's bad at texting but we send eachother a billion weird funny things we find on the Internet\n-her love language is probably touch. she likes hugs and holding hands, and I'm like cringe \n-alone time. she gets very grumpy after too much togetherness lol\n
4	General advice on a relationship with an ISTJ? (ENTP chick asking!)	ENTP chick here!\n\nI'm kinda madly in love with this ISTJ dude.\n\nHaving a mom with neurosis who is also ISTJ used to leave me with a somewhat bad impression of the type (sorry!). I worried the paranoia was a trait.\n\nBut omg this guy is just the best!\n\nI'm incredibly attracted to him, which stuns me. I haven't felt this way about anyone, and honestly never expected to fall in love like this with anybody beyond like, an INFJ.\n\nHowever, we've had some rocky starts due to misunderstandings. Before we were just dating and had fights because I didn't realize he wanted to be intimate on our first date. I was naive and thought he was allowing me to sleep over because it was late.\n\n\nI then had another fight with him when he found out I was speaking to another guy (he told me he spoke to other girls in the past while dating (while unofficial)). Turns out I'm the exception and he wanted me to commit to him only\n\n\nNow we're actually official\n\n\nAnd I intend to be faithful - ENTPs are amazingly loyal to our partners, and I've heard you guys are as well.\n\nHowever, we've already had two big fights due to misunderstandings\n\nI don't think the faithfulness bit will be a trouble at all anymore as we're committed now\n\nBut what else can I expect so I can avoid fighting accidentally?\n\n\nI know being on time is huge to him, and I'm working hard on that\n\n\nThanks in advance for the advice, loves!\n\n\nWe're both incredibly fascinated and attracted to one another.. God, I can't help but gush. You guys are awesome. <3\n\n\n(Also, while everyone has gotta have different prefs, in general what do you find physically attractive about women? He seems to love feminine appearances)
10	The being on time thing resonates with me. My boyfriend (intp) can't stick to a schedule to save his life and it literally sends my world into a tailspin! I have a mental panic if things don't go to plan and especially if plans change last minute!  \nOne other thing I'd say (as a female) is to know when to pick battles. I don't know if it's a common trait of all ISTJ but those I know (myself included) *really* dislike conflict and tend to either clam up or feel the need to walk away, which can come across as an unwillingness to compromise and sort things out when in actual fact, when we feel intense conflict, we'd rather close off entirely because the irrationality and illogical thoughts that occur during arguments just mess with our heads.  \nThis also seems to lead to very short and extreme anger bursts, but it's rarely due to anything that the other person has done, it's mostly because we (I) mentally cannot cope with a lack of understanding.  \n&nbsp;  \nWe also find proof and logic absolute, myself and other ISTJ friends cannot believe things we can't feel and experience, so your feelings and those of others are alien to us, we know that you are saying things because you feel them, but because *we* can't from your perspective, it's difficult to take compliments, or understand why we're being told that we are loved and wanted. Again, it comes off as cold and uncaring, it can seem like we are being flippant and paranoid, always thinking the worst, but because we can only feel things from our perspective, it's difficult to know for certain whether we're being told things just to make us happy or not.  \n&nbsp;  \nThis may not be true of all ISTJs but these are just the things I struggle with the most in a relationship, and similar patterns that friends of mine have stated in the past. 
5	He started a "big fight" due to you not sleeping with him? He sounds like an overly controlling douchebag. Same with the other "big fight". 
4	ISTJ here, romantically involved with an ENTP for ~1.5 years. So, as a blanket statement, it *can* work ;)\n\nA few hopefully helpful suggestions below:\n\n1. **Be explicitly clear with what you expect from us, at all times.** As an ISTJ, I need to exactly know what is expected of me at all times, so I can A) fulfill my duty and B) excel at said duty. This is true for what you expect/want out of the relationship, and even simple things like wanting him to wash dishes after dinner. We are not mind readers, and we will not pick up on subtle, passive, or indirect clues. We’re more than happy to oblige; we just have to know what it is we need to be obliging. \nChances are, your ISTJ was freaked out when you were talking to someone else because he didn't have pre-set **(read: explicit)** guidelines for what you two were. So, he was thinking Does she not like me? Is she still looking for someone else? What are we even doing? It sounds paranoid, but it's more that we freak out when there's no structure; we feel like a fish out of water. I imagine for an ENTP, you'd likely feel like a caged animal in your equivalent situation (i.e. too much structure).\n\n2. **Be nice to us. Even jest can hurt our feelings.**\nThis comes mostly from being an introvert, but ISTJs are sensitive people. We’re not crybabies or overly affectionate, but we take most (all?) criticism to heart. It’s hard for us to hear “Mary, I have some edits to your article” and NOT hear “Mary, you suck at writing” or “Mary, you can’t do your job correctly” And what are we, if we can’t do our tasks correctly? I am not at all saying you shouldn’t be direct and honest with him—please be. But, be gentle. \n\n3. **Don’t bend to meet our needs all the time.**\nI add this last one more as a general relationship advice, and less of an ENTP/ISTJ advice, though it applies to both. Be aware of the differences between you two, but don’t do all the personality bending for him. Make sure he does some for you, too. \n\nEXAMPLE: My ENTP and I, as you can relate, have different approaches when it comes to timeliness. My ENTP has literally told me, “Time is an illusion.” All the clocks in the house say something different, and it doesn’t make ANY sense to me. But we’ve (accidently?) established a system: For certain events—like family cookouts—we arrive on time. And on other days, he has things he kinda wants to maybe do, and I get in his car and he controls our agenda for the afternoon (which means we drive around and I have no idea where we’re going. Which is terrifying because I like to know where we’re going, for how long, am I dressed correctly?, and what if I have to pee?). It’s just give and take. You’ll have to try to be on time sometimes, and he’s going to have to try to be late sometimes. \n\nEdited because I don't understand Reddit formatting.
5	Weekly Thread: Who do you confide in?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: Who do you talk to about your day, your problems, your dreams?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
18	Does myself count? I really don't talk about my day to people. 
10	My problems with truly confiding in someone are the thoughts, "I mean how much do they actually care?" and "What is this going to solve?"\n\nThere's probably a single person out of everyone I know that seems to genuinely listen, or seem to give full attention like I'm the only thing in existence when I'm talking, and I feel that if someone doesn't have that quality they should not be someone to confide in.\n\nI'd probably only confide in someone if they possessed the aforementioned quality, pushed at me hard enough, and we both knew something was wrong that may be solved by vocalizing it.
8	Honestly, nobody. My husband gets the most of what I have to say, which isn't much. (I just realized that this sounded totally bitchy. In practice, it's not. When he knows something is really wrong he brings it up and we talk. I trust him and confide in him. I just mean that I don't have a NEED to confide. I am not cold and evil and wringing my hands and hunched in a corner laughing to myself. I promise. No really.)
6	There is no such person.\n\nI generally don't expect anyone to ever be interested enough, understand me, and possibly help me out with whatever I have on my mind. I just go with dealing with everything myself.
5	My dog... I often tell myself that he is the only one who listens to me (besides myself).
10	No one. Part of being an ISTJ is to be self reliant.
5	my bf (enfp). he understands me, gives me space when i don't feel like talking, and still listens when i do want to talk.
5	Myself. I feel like dealing with issues or anything are easier that way.
4	Only my boyfriend (infj). 
2	A friend (ENTJ) who's married. 
2	My wife for sure. I don't really have alot of other friends that I confide in, or talk to on a regular basis for that matter.
2	No one. 
7	How are you judging your partners?	What is going on with that judging thing, does it make you feel less close to the partner, does it make you feel negatively about them? Does it impact your relationships? Can it be a positive thing?  Is the judging worst at the beginning of a relationship?  We INFP's kinda love our partners via the medium of idealising them - so despite knowing your flaws, we will actively try to keep you on your pedestal (and therefore not judge you) unless you do something deal-breakery and the illusion shatters.  Quite strange. 
16	This is a complex answer for me.\n\nI don't *judge* my partner.  I *evaluate* them.  My partner does not have *flaws*.  They have *weaknesses*.  \n\n*Judging* connotates that I am basing my opinion of/feeling for my partner based on my standards, and *flaws* are aspects about them that are inherently unacceptable.  I prefer to approach it from a more neutral standpoint.  I *evaluate* my partner by taking in all the information about them and keeping it in my head, but forming no strong opinions about it one way or the other in terms of how I view them as a person.  Based on this approach, I can determine in a practical sense what their *weaknesses* are, points that they need help in or can improve upon.  I then take it upon myself to fortify these weaknesses.  \n\nI don't think the judging is worst at the beginning of a relationship.  I think it's worst when the relationship starts to deteriorate.  When I lose respect for someone or start taking them for granted, it is very easy for me to judge them harshly and become super critical, and them not meeting my standards will make me feel negatively about them.  I have to make a conscious effort to remember to judge people based on their effort level rather than the final result, and that's applicable to anyone.  But once that initial respect/admiration is lost, it's very hard for me to keep that up.  \n\nThis may be because I'm an E2, but I also try to idealize my partner.  I do put them on a pedestal, but rather than acknowledge their flaws, I try to brush them off or turn a blind eye (which is why I prefer to call them weaknesses).  I understand no one is perfect, but it is my nature to dwell on the imperfections and try to improve them and be unsatisfied until I have done so.  So in order to make my relationship work, I need to make my partner's flaws as little of a big deal as I possibly can, which means justifying why such failings are acceptable or understandable and also dwelling on their strong points.  I need to *feel* like they are perfect, even if in some place in my head, I am aware they are not.  \n\nI hope that makes sense.  :) 
2	ISFJ dating an ISTJ - Advice Needed	\nHey all. I'm a 6w5 ISFJ dating an 8w9 ISTJ for two months. It's been great so far, but I feel him pull away sometimes if he gets too into emotions... Even if he is the one to bring up emotional stuff. Granted he's drunk when he does it. I'm considering having the define the relationship talk with him. For an ISTJ, is 2 months too soon? Any advice on how to approach this? I think he feels the same but is scared of it.
2	> I'm considering having the define the relationship talk with him.\n\nDon't push this. Bring it up as possibility and not as necessity so he can still say "let's do this later". Pushing an ISTJ in any direction he is not ready for equals pushing him away.\n\n> Even if he is the one to bring up emotional stuff. Granted he's drunk when he does it.\n\nI absolutely can't relate to this. Both aspects of it.
10	I'm fine with doing things alone: watching movies, eating KBBQ... is that an ISTJ thing?	My friends think I'm really weird for doing things like eating Korean BBQ alone (it's typically done in groups), or watching movies alone in the movie theater. I'm not sure if that's unique to just me, or is it more of an ISTJ thing. Do any of you guys share this tendency with being okay with doing typical "group activities," alone?
18	I fly solo all the time. Nothing is more awesome to me than seeing a movie alone on a Saturday or Sunday morning when you're practically the only one there. I've even gone on vacations alone before. Other people in their 20s think its weird, but older people think it's awesome and wish they would have done similar things in their youth. Life is too short to wait around for other people to want to do the things you desire to do. 
9	I'd say it's more of an introversion thing generally. There's always going to be times of exceptions, but typically an introvert wouldn't have many issues doing even 'group activities' alone. \n\nAs an ISTJ, I prefer to do 'new things' with friends, but am quite comfortable doing old and familiar activities by myself, even if they should typically be with other people. 
3	I also will do things alone without much hesitation, and depending on the activity, I prefer it. Like eating -- I want to eat and watch something, not eat and talk! Though I am not quite bold enough to go to a restaurant alone, mostly because I'd want to treat it like a coffee shop and eat with a good book, and restaurants aren't really set up for that.\n\nFor instance, I once drove 2-3 hours to see a comedy show alone, stayed in a hotel, etc -- the downside is the cost of the hotel is a lot more of an inconvenience when you're not splitting it. The positive, though, was that I didn't have to try and find a friend who liked that comic, and/or feel worried about whether the other person was enjoying it. If I knew for sure that someone I liked well enough also liked the comic I wouldn't have *objected* to company, but I definitely didn't need it.
2	It's not an ISTJ thing - it sounds like a wonderful thing! :)
1	I dont have an issue with doing things by myself. With that being said, other events in my life have led me to not really care about the event, but creating memories with the friends involved.\n\nFWIW, I test and generally identify as an ISTP.
1	Definitely. I'm fine with doing things alone with my wife. Usually we spend our time together doing things at home- watching Netflix, going outside, etc. If we do anything *out*, it's going to the movies with each other, or out to eat. Hardly with anyone else, unless it's someone we really know.
8	Weekly Thread: If you had to give a 5 minute speech on any subject, what would you talk about?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: You've been asked to give a 5 minute speech on the topic of your choice. What do you choose?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
8	I'd probably give a speech about timing. Life is all about timing, being lucky enough for a particular job opening to just getting to the bus on time. It's not scientific or glorious, but we, as people, sometimes need to accept timing as a major, uncontrollable thing in our lives. 
4	Baby gear. Just had my second and for some reason the baby gear industry is a big interest of mine. Car seat safety, strollers, carriers, play mats, swings, highchairs...
2	Personal responsibility, financial and otherwise. I spend too much time every day seeing people complain about how *taxes are too high to get by/Housing prices are too high/I can't afford daycare for my four children/etc*. I wish people would learn to use a bit of brain power and weigh their financial obligations against their means and make choices that fit within that context rather than the current popular entitled method of doing whatever it is one chooses and then complaining after the fact if it proves to be a difficult time. If the housing market is too expensive, move elsewhere. If you can't afford to support four kids on a single income with one stay-at-home parent, don't have four kids. Really simple stuff but it seems to be beyond the grasp of so many people around me despite living in a first world developed nation.
2	How the term Ego should not have the negative connotations it currently has, and the meaning of egoism in its true form.
2	Music for sure. It's such a big part of my life.
2	maybe social anxiety since I know all about it haha
5	Leadership?	I was reading a webpage about ISTJ's that claimed ISTJ's enjoy being in positions of authority. How true is this for all of you?
17	Depends on the type of authority.\n\nI don't like having to lead a group of people (I prefer decentralized leadership styles), but I like it even less when shit goes off the rails. So I shy away from leadership unless I see that no one else is going to take charge or I see that there's an impending crisis. However, I love when I can be the "go-to" guy for information, which is a kind of authority.\n\nBasically, I like when people see me as a trustworthy authority on subjects not tasks.
2	Personally, I love being in a position of authority. I like being the "go-to" person, but I also enjoy leading a team. Seeing a successful finished project, especially one I had a lot of say in, is just really satisfying.
1	Definitely. I'm a Support Manager at Walmart (been there 9 years this month) and I love it. However, even though I love the position, and the authority that comes with it, I have a *hard* time delegating tasks to others. I like to just do things, and i'm extremely hands-on. It's something I struggle with as a manager, but I think i'm getting better at it.
1	I've always been a scaredy cat when it comes to responsibility (I don't want to fail or disappoint the team, plus stress) but I seem to end up leading things these days and do well. I actually don't mind it if it's for something I'm good at, and if there's not much socializing needed. I hate getting stuck with a bunch of slackers or people chatting all the time not working. I'm all business and make sure everything gets done.
9	What are your sleep habits?	Just a little survey!\n\n1. How many hours do you sleep per day?\n2. What time do you sleep?
9	I go to sleep between 11:30pm and 0:30am. I get up between 7:15am and 8am.\n\nAlways. \n\nThat's more time than I usually need, so I'm awake like half an hour before I actually get up. I like the feeling to have some time to close my eyes again for a while.\n\nI never sleep during the day. 
5	Theoretically I sleep from 10:00pm to 5:30am. In practice I lie in bed from 11pm to about 8:00am and get maybe four or five hours of sleep throughout that time.
3	I try to keep a regular 7~8 hour sleep schedule. Preferably from 21:30/9:30PM to 05:30/5:30AM. Sometimes I take a ~1 hour nap during the day if I need it. Happens often on weekends.\n\nWhat I miss is the ability to sleep deeply over the whole duration.
2	Anywhere between 30 mins and 4/5 hours usually in short 30-45 min bursts.  \nIf I wake up and have to move, like going to the bathroom etc, then it'll be hours before I get back to sleep.
2	in my old bedroom I could go to sleep at 11.30pm and sleep all night. I have a new bedroom in the basement and if i go to sleep at 11.30, i always wake up at 01.30. My new bedroom is a lot darker than my old bedroom.
2	Any
2	8-10 hours of sleep between 4:30 am and 3 pm
2	1. Usually 6-7.\n1-1. But if it's weekend, I can sleep about 8-9.\n--\n2. I usually go to bed 11pm.\n2-1. But I have a different "time zone" in summer. I go to bed at about 3am.
2	I go to bed between 12-2 on weekdays  (ok, being honest it's rarely close to the 12 end of that) and my alarm starts going off at 7. I'm usually out of bed by 7:30. On weekends I stay up later, typically 3-4 unless I'm out with friends and then I may not come home until after sunrise. I used to sleep 12-14 hours per night on weekends but then I got a cpap machine and cannot, no matter how hard I try, sleep more than 7 or 8 hours anymore.
2	I tend to wake up at sunrise 7/8am and get sleepy around 10, but end up staying up till 2am. I usually get between 6 to 7 hours of sleep with an occasional mid day nap on my days off.
2	[These](https://imgur.com/a/70Q3z) are my most recent stats. Except that June 26th through the 28th I lost my FitBit charger and it was dead until my new one came in the mail, hence the lost data. And the 25th... Don't ask me what happened there early in the morning (actually... I remember what happened... And it's none of your business heh heh!). And tonight I'm up and it's 3am which is rare for me... I just can't sleep and I'm mentally busy. Otherwise I'm normally getting 6-8 hours average. (I would also like to note that my schedule is normally more like the week prior to this one, with the odd late night but still waking up early. This week has been weird and frustrating and I hope to get back on my usual schedule next week.)
2	I typically go to sleep around 2300 and wake up around 0630. It's always within a few minutes everyday. \n\nIf I get woken up, I cannot fall back asleep. I also cannot take naps or sleep during the day. Just doesn't happen.
1	I typically go to sleep between 10-11. I wake up at 6:15ish and sometimes am able to sleep in on the weekends until 7-8ish. \n\nI take stuff to help me sleep after suffering insomnia for years. I have never slept better. 
1	I typically go to bed around 1:30 AM and wake up around 7-8 AM to take my wife to work. Sometimes (I work Noon-11pm 4 days out of the week) I will take a small nap before I go into work.
3	Weekly Thread: What's the funniest thing you've said or heard?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what's the funniest thing you've said or heard? Give us context! \n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
5	Like most people, I think, I find things that are absurd funny. 
3	Agreeing with what /u/Aocast said, I find absurdity really funny. \n\nTo give an example, [this scene](https://youtu.be/OR4zefzP7d0) from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia has probably made me laugh the hardest in recent years. Really that whole show is a gold mine for me. However, when I show this to others that haven't seen it, they think of it as weird and not that funny (especially the "rape" scene). 
3	"A magician is driving down the street. He turns into his garage."\nI was the only one who found it funny in my circle, which is probably why I laughed as hard as I did.
2	I like simple dad jokes and riddles. 
12	ENFP with an ISTJ best friend.	Hello all you wonderful ISTJs! I may be on the complete opposite side of the MBTI from ya'll, but I gotta say: You guys are awesome! My best friend is an ISTJ and we clash/mesh/exist together in the best/oddest way possible. Anyway, just popped over to say, keep being awesome!
4	My bestie is an ENFP, too!\n\nYou keep being awesome yourself!
3	I'm an ENFP married to an ISTJ. We definitely have our differences and occasionally clashing styles, but I feel like he grounds me and helps me think through things a little more instead of just doing them. I get him to express his emotions a little more and actually make some decisions instead of just weighing them carefully forever. Interestingly enough, his two closest friends are also ENFPs. 
5	i love you guys too! (my bf is ENFP.) you guys help remind me that not everything in life has to be taken seriously. i love your weirdness and your persistence to keep asking us to do things (even though most of the time we'll say no). keep at it :)
2	I'm also an ISTJ with an ENFP best friend. I think our types actually end up being close friends quite often, which is funny considering we're opposites.
2	ISTJ with a best friend who is an ENFP,I think our personality really complete each other.
1	Yay! I came here for the exact same thing. I kept reading everywhere that ENFPs and ISTJs couldn't get along. Of course I didn't take it literally, but my best friend is, I highly suspect, an ISTJ, and couldn't find one theory to defend it. Just out of sheer curiosity, there's no way I changed even a bit my relationship with him. But I wondered if it was common or not
7	Social media for ISTJ's?	Which social media sites/image sharing sites does r/ISTJ frequent? Eg. Facebook, Twitter, imgur, tumblr.\n\nNOTE: reddit doesn't count
34	Don't know about the rest of r/ISTJ, but for me it's actually none.\nI do have a Facebook account but it doesn't hold any public info and is only used for "login with facebook" pages.\n\nI don't feel the need for collecting virtual "friends" who don't even care about anything I would share on these sites. I prefer to interact directly with all the people I care about.\n\nEven on reddit it's 99% reading for me. I rarely post anything, and if I do it is an actual contribution or helping someone, not just meaningless jibber jabber.
4	Other than reddit, I use Facebook the most. I lurk on Twitter, following breaking news and politicians. I also use Tumblr casually, posting a few times a week.
3	I regularly use Twitter, semi-regularly snapchat. I have accounts on Facebook and Instagram, but very rarely use them. 
3	I use Facebook mainly to connect with my friends (make plans, share jokes, catch up with busy people) and secondly to fight with ignorant strangers.\n\nLately, I've been trying to up my Instagram game, so I'm using that more and more. \n\nI have a personal Twitter account, but I almost never use it. However, I do manage my business' Twitter account. If it's not for work, the only time I'm on Twitter is to follow hashtags if there's something major happening.\n\nI also have LinkedIn, but only because everyone in business has one. I don't use it for anything worthwhile. \n\nAnd Tumblr, I use exclusively for porn. 
3	I have a Facebook page which I rarely use. It's pretty much scrubbed clean of any personal information and I have the privacy settings to the highest. I keep the page (instead of just deleting it) because it's useful to find and chat with classmates when working on group projects for school. I have a Twitter page, and I have not posted on it. My Instagram is on the private mode (people can only see your stuff when you approve) but that doesn't really matter because I have no posts. Other than that, I use Pintrest and Tumblr occasionally. I don't post things but I do reblog/re-pin stuff onto my page. \n\nThe idea of being well known or "famous" on social media doesn't excite me, rather, it makes me anxious and uncomfortable. I keep my life private and don't want people I don't know in real life to see my personal stuff. 
2	I use Facebook. Partially for the reasons posted above and partially to attempt to influence people I know to make better choices. Occasionally I use it to bitch about things and rant.
2	For me, it's Twitter and Tumblr. I use Twitter mainly for news and weather updates, but I post there occasionally. The character limit appeals to me and my unfortunate, short attention span. Most of my college friends are on Tumblr so I can see what they're up to when they're not around. Also, I've found Tumblr to be more of an artistic community than other sites, which is good since I'm hoping to go into that field of work.\n\nI'm not a fan of Facebook. I think it does too much, I've always felt a sense of obligation when dealing with groups or event invites, and the surprisingly large amount of older people on the site makes me kinda uncomfortable at times. I removed my Facebook account a few months ago and haven't looked back.
2	I use Twitter and Facebook. I don't ever post anything on FB, but I will retweet stuff on Twitter and respond to friends and my mom. I have the privacy on everything set as high as it will go. \n\nI am really private and hate the "hey look at me" posts, so I rarely put anything of my own out there. \n\nI quit Instagram, but upload my photos to Flickr. I don't use Flickr as social media, though - only my dad and husband have access to my photos. \n\nI use Pinterest to save recipes and craft ideas. 
2	I use Facebook, Snapchat, and only newly Instagram. I like using social media for advocacy and awareness for issues I'm passionate about and as a place to post my artwork and pictures of my cat. 
2	Use snapchat to channel all the puns I think about during the day.\nI check FB more often than I would like to. \nInstagram more because I get pics of people/things I'm actually interested in. When I post, I try to space it out at a min. of 3 days/post.  \nDon't have a twitter because I consider it like the TMZ of social media.\nReddit....if that counts as social media.\n
1	Used to be mostly facebook. Then it became tumblr. Then it became tumblr and instagram. Now it's twitter and instagram. I check tumblr and facebook periodically now. I check snapchat maybe once a week, maybe more, maybe less. All these changes happened over a 6 year period. 
1	I am a tumblr junkie. The echo chamber I have created helps me when I feel isolated and alone. Not the best of things to create, but boy I can't get enough of it.
1	I like Facebook, but I sure as hell don't use it as much as I did when I was younger. Usually just to share memes and occasionally wish some friends happy birthday.
10	Female ISTJs: How do Relationships Typically Begin?	I'm not too creative (edit: I realised that the original post did not have a capitalised begin. How unfortunate.)\nEssentially how it is/was like, who initiated, your thoughts on it, etc.
7	Joined a dating app to really just meet new people as I moved to a new city. We liked each other, he messaged me first and had a date in a museum. He also thought I wasn't interested in him and told me later when we were together that I wasn't giving him any hints that I was interested in something more. But he pursued and we became a couple. :)
7	Weirdly in both cases. Once when I was in high school, I developed a crush on a guy who had a crush on another girl at the same school. She didn't reciprocate, but somehow he and I ended up dating. (I don't recall how but I think we were talking via instant messenger when it happened, so it wasn't particularly hormonal or intense.) He asked me not to tell his crush before he had a chance to speak with her. See again: In high school, hence missing that red flag.\n\nPretty soon after, I realized that relationships don't just fix/fill whatever needs your parents dropped the ball with, and I wasn't really interested in what felt like a friendship plus weird awkward stuff. I wasn't at a point where my sexual drive really involved other people either, so I had no idea how to handle that. It was just odd all around, so I ended the relationship.\n\nThen, later, in college, a close friend and I would often write fiction stories together. Our fiction stories also sometimes developed into... well, not-suitable-for-children kind of stories. In any event, she eventually initiated us messing around a bit, and that continued for a few months until we agreed we were basically in a relationship. That was a long, satisfying relationship, but eventually she and I broke up just on account of a lot of messy stuff. I wasn't the most mature person, contrary to ISTJ stereotypes -- my parents didn't impose a lot of structure on me, and I had other stuff going on. Meanwhile, she had to pay her own way through college, so she grew up much faster than I, and she was already something like 3 years older. So that eventually got in the way.\n\nAs for now...? I am not sure what it would take. I am generally not inclined to show my interest in someone unless I am in a strikingly confident mood, maybe a little tipsy, and certainly one-on-one. At least, I *imagine* that those things would make me more likely. In reality, that hasn't materialized yet. \n\nAt this point, I predict that I will eventually decide I want to be in a relationship and will engage in some kind of structured dating activity (online dating, speed dating, singles events, etc). Unless someone I am reasonably attracted to signals interest in me first. (Like wearing a "I like ExplicitInformant" T-shirt, saying "I like you" at my face, etc. If it is not blatant, I am likely to miss it. :|) I'm not in a hurry though -- relationships mean working towards meeting the emotional needs of another person, and right now, I'm having enough of a time getting myself in order! In other words, I wouldn't date just to date right now, though if I was in a very stable and secure place, I could see dating casually, for the physical intimacy.
5	He initiated. Bit of an awkward story but he sent me a message via Facebook and it went into that "other" folder... I didn't see it for months and when I finally did I felt so bad! We went out for drinks and it was nice. I mucked it up a bit in the beginning few dates because he constantly misinterpreted my messages as me not wanting to see him, and i was having to go back and repeat myself a lot in fully explained sentences to ensure we were on the same page... We like this one, he's a good egg, but apparently I'm the emotional idiot in the beginning and had to learn a lot and adapt my wording so we were speaking the same language and on the same page.
2	We were best friends for 2 years first. As we both developed feelings the way we interacted changed and I could sense that there was something deeper there. Before we entered into a relationship however, I definitely had to  be convinced that exploring a relationship was worth the risk of ruining the platonic friendship that we originally developed. As an ISTJ I am very slow to trust and be vulnerable so I was concerned that I was going to lose one of the few people I could be myself with. Him being an INFJ allowed him understand my thought process and communicate the depths of his feelings to me in a way that made me realize that not trying would be the worst logical move for both my head and my heart.
2	I've been in 3 serious relationships, married to the third for 10 years. The first one I fell for so instantaneously that if someone else was describing it to me I would think they were exaggerating or flat out lying. It took a little over a year, and a significant event, for us to tell each other. We're still good friends.\n\n\nThe second was lackluster in comparison. We kept hooking up after getting drunk and the club and eventually he let me know he didn't want me going home with anyone else anymore. It ended badly and not soon enough.\n\n\nThe third one was quite a surprise. We met by chance and it wasnt long before he was demonstrating all the subtle ways #2 was not a good match for me and told me how it would be with him instead. I had not realized how miserable I had become and he reminded me that joy and giddiness and affection existed, because my depression had swallowed me so deeply that I forgot. And he has largely followed through on his promises. Like someone else kinda mentioned, having an INTJ partner is a relief because they can communicate things that don't make sense in a way that makes sense. He's more emotionally intelligent than I and often can figure out what I'm feeling and why before I do, which is a relief for me. In fact, I've learned somewhat recently that a good percentage of the people I've felt/feel the most for are INTJs. Dunno if that's relevant but it was interesting to make that connection.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, I need *very* clear statements that someone is interested before I'll admit to myself how I feel (if I am headed that way); I'm very emotionally guarded.
2	The two relationships I had, I initiated both times. We had been friends for a bit and i was interested in seeing if we could work together. Didn't work out of course. I'm a hard woman to please with zero apologies.
2	they don't. Lol
6	Do you use Emoticons?	I know I don't.Curious to see if ISTJ's use them,and on what frequence if they do.
12	Yes, I use them a lot. Nearly every sentence when I'm playing a game online. That's because I know that my inflections are hard enough to pick up on when I'm speaking, so they are impossible get when typing/texting. Emoticons give context to what I'm saying and let people know when I'm being sarcastic (usually).
9	I rarely ever use emoticons or emoji's. Just not something that I feel should be in a message.  \nAlso, grammatically correct messages, specifically using full stops at the end of sentences is somehow indicating you're 'mad', or something like that. Anyone experience that?
7	I use them a lot. They add meaning, and make communication less ambiguous and more efficient. 
4	I don't use emojis much. Only if I'm feeling particularly happy, which isn't that often. Either way, I don't use them very much unless I'm talking to someone I don't know and am trying to be polite. I feel like an exclamation point gets the point across!
3	I do use them, but mostly the ones you can easily type with your keyboard, not the colourful ones you have to hunt for; mostly :) =)) -_- and :v
2	I use them to convey my emotions a little better, and I often only use specific ones in specific situations. Like I only use ;) if I'm flirting with someone I like.
2	I use them so that I can express myself more easily/accurately. 
1	No. I stopped using them about a year after I've joined the net. They didn't fit well with my style. That's been almost a decade ago by now.
1	Not often. When i do i use very basic ones
1	I am also an emoticon-user. So much of casual, interpersonal communication is nonverbal that I think it makes sense that internet users have found ways of conveying the same kinds of information (e.g., mood, tone) through text.\n\nIt is one thing if the post is just informational -- then I find I typically don't use them, or even other emotional signifiers (e.g., exclamation points of excitement and peppy affect!) However, when affect becomes a piece of it, I'll usually throw them in, to show that I was amused, that I'm being cocky or playful, that I am uncertain or miffed, or to soften feedback that might otherwise be blunt, and/or communicate a friendly and unassuming tone when communicating information. \n\nSo, for example, "This is what is. That said, it is understandable if you haven't been exposed to this before, so I'm not trying to make you feel like an ignorant shithead." becomes, "This is what is. That said, it is understandable if you haven't been exposed to this before! :)" Much easier.
1	No. Not because I hate them like some people seem to, but because they seem primarily like a means of conveying emotion, which I have little use for in text/email conversations. 
1	Never
1	I perhaps use them a little too often, but I think that can be attributed to the fact that when I type or text someone, I prefer to do so in a correct and proper manner.  \nI always use full words and never *ever* use text speak or abbreviations so people have commented saying that my responses sound too clinical and "up-myself". So now I add a :) or \^_^ to my messages so people know I'm not being a jerk!
1	I use a lot of emoticons! I find tone difficult to convey online, so emoticons really help expressing myself. 
1	I use emoticons when I'm chatting with friends, but if I chatting someone else I don't know, I don't or rarely use.
1	I use them. I think it adds some fun to conversations.
2	Male ISTJs: How do Relationships Typically begin?	Seeing as the majority of ISTJs are women, I'm curious how relationships begin for male ISTJs. \n\nTo elaborate, I mean who was the one that initiated (i.e. who asked whom out)
3	This isn't an answer to your question, but I'm pretty sure the majority of ISTJs are men, not women (according to these sources, at least):\n\n\nhttp://www.truity.com/personality-type/istj\n\n\nhttp://www.slayerment.com/mbti-gender
3	I met my current girlfriend online (ESFJ). We met each other a few times, and the third time I politely (also drunkenly) asked if she wanted a kiss, she found it charming and said yes hehe.\n\nI also asked her if she officially wanted to be my girlfriend after 5 weeks.
2	My last girlfriend asked me out when we were in middle school. We would go outside and eat lunch together a bunch of times (as friends), we'd go to the baseball huts and add to the graffiti there with a sharpie.\n\nOne lunch she found a piece of styrofoam in the hut and wrote "do you want to go out with me? :)" on it.\n\nI kinda miss all of that right now.\n\nEdit: More recently,\n\n1.  \nAt my work, one of the service girls had her friend ask me to ask her out... I did, it was super awkward, talking with her after that didn't last long either.\n\n2.  \nAnother girl I work with I would small talk with on breaks once in a while. She's super pretty. One day we were complaining about orders in the back and when I was about to leave she gave me her number to keep in touch with each other outside of work. We've been on a few church dates now. Not quite my speed but it's nice.
2	They tent to begin with me being too nervous to make a move and... Oh wait, it never started!
1	Met my last girlfriend (ISFJ iirc) online, Skyped the first night talking. Decided to meet the next week. On our way home we were waiting for the bus in the cold and we were hugging. She looked up at me and I kissed her. Sealed the deal, for the next six months anyway.
1	I met my girlfriend through the dating website/app Coffee Meets Bagel. I asked her out on a date, and we kept going out. A few months later, I asked her to be my girlfriend, and she eventually said yes!
1	I messaged my ISTJ on an online dating site. 
1	I met my wife at a local Christian retreat for High School-aged students. We were friends for the longest time, and talked often. After some bad breakups and life changes, we started talking more frequently again, and I asked her out. \n\nOur first date wasn't a typical first date though- she invited me over to her house (at the time, she lived with her sister, brother-in-law and two nieces) for dinner. It was the perfect "date" for us, because we're both fairly introverted and don't like doing things that involve going out (most of the time...not always)....or other people for that matter. 
3	Any ISTJs in relationships with INFPs here? How is it working out?	Asking because I'm an INFP female who's been dating an ISTJ guy for almost a year. He makes my heart feel warm and fuzzy. My respect for him as a good and honorable person just keeps growing! :)
4	[deleted]
3	[deleted]
3	Hi I'm weighing in a bit late on your thread, I'm an INFP married 8yrs to ISTJ husb.  I know exactly what you mean about the instant comfortableness; not fireworks mind you, but I didn't trust the guys who gave me fireworks, as they are able to give any woman fireworks whereas an ISTJ bonds uniquely with you. ISTJs are seriously hot though ha. I have endless respect for their integrity, conscientiousness, powerful minds, generally hardcore exterior with soft interior (once they let you in, a million years into dating them. @!$&???) ha! His quietness and mystery was what attracted me, I just wanted to crack him open and discover what was inside, and we also get on like best friends and our shared sense of humour is possibly one of the best things in my life - it was about number one on things I was looking for in a man when I was single :)\nBad sides? At some points in your relationship you will crave NF connection as ST is not always enough. If you can get filled up by friends and family in this way, and get your emotional needs met, you will do fine.  That way, you get your need for constancy, security, reliability and trustworthiness met in your beloved ISTJ, and you get the emotional support of NFs without having to live with them (and deal constantly with their emotions). You will instantly connect to NFs and this can make your ISTJ feel jealous and unloved as they are intelligent enough to sense they don't have that same emotional-level mind reading thing going on. You just have to be careful if your NF supply is a parent the same sex as your partner, or a friend the same sex as them and reassure them that you aren't closer to the NF than you are to them.\nAnother point: apparently we're an activation relationship (socionics) and that can mean you subconsciously wear each other out and need breaks from each other in order to keep things stable and fresh. None of this is consciously a feature of my marriage, but I can report having a weird emotional lost feeling about every two months where I don't know if the relationship will make it thru, not sure he loves me or I connect with him then I have an introverted meltdown in my head, then read up too much online, then it passes and it's the best relationship in the world and I feel I would die if I couldn't see him and talk to him and hold him every day. So maybe that's the out working of that 'activation' socionics in my marriage, I dunno.  Sorry this is so long, I think I'll do a thread on this at some point but feel free to pm or whatever if you want more questions answered!\n\nTL:DR best relationship ever for what I really need in life, but sometimes you'll need emotional level NF interaction to feel sane.
2	Update: We just had a long phone chat. I always feel nervous wondering what I'd even talk about with him beforehand, and then when we talk, everything is so comfortable and I learn so much from him. Not like in an effortless N to N way or F to F way, but he surprises me with his knowledge and skills, and I'm always amazed by how much I agree with his opinions and observations! He's just such a good man...
4	Heya, guys. If you dated an ENTP, would you see it working out/lasting?	I'm the said ENTP girl in question: unorthodox, absurd, dominant, competitive, eccentric... Yeah. I'm a rather accurate representation of the stereotype of my type\n\nYet.. The feeling between myself and another ISTJ is new and mutual, and while I find him very sweet, I don't want to risk losing his friendship if things are likely to go south.\n\nI get that the unconventional can cause you guys quite a bit of exasperation - my mom is an ISTJ and she finds it horrifying that I stand out as honestly.. Pretty damn eccentric. I'd like to think it's in a nice way, but traditional I am not.\n\nI'm just a biiit concerned that this guy I'd like to try dating may not be as tolerant of my constant antics (antics define my life) after a while. Would you? \n\nCould you guys be happy being with someone who enjoys the absurd and allows the world to know it? Someone who would never listen to convention but actively act against it.. But would love you to death no matter what, of course.\n\nI get this post is such a generalization, but Im looking for generalized opinions ;)\n\nSo... please satisfy my curiosity and answer! Thank youuu. ;)
3	I'm really attracted to ENTPs, personally. I could see it lasting, but it would depend on a lot of specifics of course.\n\nI personally would be really uncomfortable with the absurd being showcased in public, but if I liked the person well enough, and they didn't require me to participate or be exposed in their public behaviors (i.e., it wasn't sharing stuff about my private issues, or asking me to dance on a table with them, etc), I think I could be okay with it?\n\nI enjoy the bizarre and absurd as much as the next person. But yeah, not a very attention-seeking or attention-wanting type. I tend to fly under the radar, and any partner -- ENTP or otherwise -- would have to be ready for me to take time to warm up to new people and new situations. I might get to have a real good sense of humor around you, but it is going to take an adjustment period all over again to be able to show that sense of humor around your friends, etc. Being a sounding board for social concerns without blowing them off would be helpful too -- that is, being able to give honest feedback on whether I came off as standoffish, or weird, or whatever else. I wouldn't want reassurance, I would want the truth -- and a partner that could give me their true opinion and could be a safe sounding board for those concerns (which I am more likely to suppress and keep to myself because I don't want to sound pathetic) would be a great ally.\n\nWhile ISTJs are not necessarily attention-seeking, I think they may be less traditional than they're described. For instance, I could see an ISTJ being into various sexual kinks, or being a member of a number of off-the-beaten-path social groups. It's just that they're not going to wear those out into public for everyone to see and comment on. Doesn't mean they won't endorse them in the secure privacy of their own home, or with a close partner.\n\nI would be very upfront with him about what your expectations would be, and allow him to state what his expectations would be. If he would need you to assure him that you would be home at night by 10pm with rare exceptions, and you know that isn't possible, that would be important to know. Or if you are looking for a partner in crime and would need to be able to have him show the same enthusiasm with you at home as on the streets and in public, and he knew he would not be able to promise that, that would also be good to know. But hopefully this general response is helpful to you as well.
2	My partner is ENFP with pretty balanced F/T. Thus far, it's been awesome for both of us. As an introvert, I feel that it was a little hard to explain why being an introvert isn't unhealthy or abnormal or depressing for me. Once that was understood, it was great! We have debates pretty frequently, and because we are so different, we can share points of view that the other never considered. We learn a lot from one another. 
2	I think ISTJ/ENTP is a very wonderful combo, and with all the bias of someone in love with an ENTP, I can totally say that.  \n\nMy dynamic *may* vary slightly since our genders are reversed from yours, but some of the things I like about my ENTP are:\n\n* I like that he brings me out of my shell.  Things I wouldn't dream of doing are suddenly viable options.  And there's no pressure from him, but his enthusiasm makes me feel more inclined to try something new.  \n\n* He's so experienced/knowledgeable about so much.  Name it, and he's done it or wants to do it.  I probably haven't.  I love hearing his stories and when I want to try for myself, I am immensely reassured by knowing "Okay, he's done this. He knows what he's doing." \n\n* He's so brilliant.  I love how he sees things so differently from how I do.  Even if we come to the same conclusion, his thought process mystifies me.  I aim for objectivity, so I really value being able to see multiple sides of a situation, something he can do rather well in most cases.\n\n* He inadvertently pushes me to grow.  Since I've known him, my limits have been pushed and redefined and I'm a stronger, better person for it.  On my own, I'm content to sit around in mediocrity.  He gives me that extra push to demand more of myself.\n\n* I value his social skills.  He can talk to just about anyone about anything and I think that's really cool.  It also takes some of the pressure off me to be "on" when we're together because I can just follow his lead. \n\nHowever, our non-dating relationship is really rocky and complicated, too:\n* He's an emotional dunce.  Maaaybe this won't be an issue, since your ISTJ is a man (and therefore less emotional than a woman or expected to behave so), but for me, I've had my feelings hurt a lot by his insensitivity.  \n\n* We're both very stubborn.  \n\n* This one is more of a reflection of what I think rather than what is, I suppose, but I think he's worried I'll stifle his freedom or maybe he's even bored with me.  I know he values me as a friend and cares about me in a semi romantic way, but there's always been something holding him back.  Maybe it's some personal issues he has, I dunno, but I assume he gets bored easily and/or is afraid I'll crush his freedom.  \n\nI dunno, if you have any specific questions, I'll be happy to answer them, but I personally favor this match.  :)  But ENTPs and ISTJs all vary by person, so take that with a grain of salt, as always.
1	Im an extrmemely introverted guy who constantly catches feelings for outgoing extroverts. All the man wants from you is honesty
1	The biggest risk I can see, not so much from the implications on the existing friendship but rather I/E related. Introverts prefer to avoid other people right, so lets say you two were to attend a party the worst thing you could do is to socialize with other people too much making him feel like an outsider. \n\nI doubt he would get restless of your antics but you would have to monitor his mood. When I'm in a bad mood I can't tolerate the tiniest bit of silliness and I become an angry dictator. Messing around while I'm in that mood will only make it worse for everybody
7	Weekly Thread: If you were given $10,000, what would you do with it?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what would you do if you were given $10,000 to spend however you wished?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!\n\nP.S. I'm going to try questions that aren't necessarily ISTJ related for a couple weeks. If it isn't well received I'll switch back :) 
10	Most ISTJs will probably say that they will save. I'd probably spend anything equal or less to $1,000 (road trip/short vacation, clothes, or something practical) and save the rest.
8	Pay off my car and put the rest in savings.
7	Take $100-$200 of it to go shopping and put the rest in the bank to save. 
5	Purchase a mobile home that I could comfortably live in. The ones I'm currently looking at range $12k-14k. I'd never have to pay a mortgage or rent, I'd never have to worry about whether or not my landlord will allow me to keep my pets, cleaning the house would take 10 minutes tops. 
3	Spend a little on a trip, and save the rest or apply to my mortgage. 
5	Max out my IRA for the year 
3	I would probably put it all in my savings account and make myself believe that I don't have it. I don't like spending money, and I always try to forget how much I have in my account.
3	1. Buy beater second car so I can have transportation while my SO is at work.\n\n2. Buy a better lawnmower (one that can handle my 1/4 acre of grass without it taking all day long.)
3	Invest in term deposits
3	Since I'm still a student, keep $500 to myself and keep the rest for uni or other future needs.
2	I would put it in the bank and make a trip to 2-3 big music festivals over a couple years. 
2	Pay off car... That would save me 380$ a month 
2	I would put $1,800 in an emergency savings (because it would make me feel happier). $8,000 I would put towards student loans that are wonderfully accruing interest as I grad school life away. \n\nAnd I would use $200 to treat myself to something I want / need. At the moment, that would be nice prescription sunglasses. \n\nIf I was at a point where I had student loans paid off and a good emergency fund and all that, I would probably pursue some project or something. Like, making my house perfect and going on a trip or something. 
2	Just a year away from a big move (over half of what we need saved up for it already) but that much extra oft accelerate our schedule. The remainder would be put in savings. Or I might trade in my two shitty cars for a newer one I like and save the rest.
2	Go to school.  Be accountant.  Save extra money in bank as 401k.
2	Go shopping with $500-600 and put the rest into the bank for college.
2	Probably pay some bills, buy a new (not brand new, however) working vehicle, and then save money of course.
2	1200$ for PC rest for saving.
3	ISTJ song (and others) -- songs written specifically from the POV of each type	Apparently this musician wrote a song for each MBTI type, that is intended to come from that type's perspective. I saw the INTP one posted over at /r/INTP and gave them all a look; I thought I'd post the ISTJ one over here and see what people thought.\n\n[This is a link to the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwEbMQFTNsI), and the full album is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8OHzYoQJYo&list=PLdqMgyiAzNsFknuP0Cm5N4uYip5CJXBFh)\n\nThe lyrics aren't bad. The ISTJ lyrics I liked the most are:\n\n>I'm not bad with goodbyes    \nI'm bad with whys     \nThat don't get answered\n\nand \n\n>It was all in my head    \nYou never shared it     \nAnd now I'm less mad     \nThan I'm embarassed     
2	Can't say I'm a fan but I see what he was trying to do
1	haikus would be cool
3	Better way to not be a smartass	So last week I had to point out something to my supervisor. A lot of times I feel as if I'm walking on egg shells to prove something wrong, because I just started this job just two months ago. Such as why are we using a 15ftlbs torque wrench to verify a torque rating of 65ftlbs on a sterring wheel. What us a better way to prove  a logical point  besides starting with "I'm not trying to be a smart ass...BUT"
8	I work in communications and marketing, so I have some experience in change management. \n\nThree ideas:\n\n1. When making your suggestions, focus more on the result than the actual change. (People usually need a "why" more than they need a "what" or "how")\n\n2. Always be objective, specific and evidence-based: explain why, specifically, the change is a good one, how it will impact the people involved, and what the benefit is (also mention any risks associated and how those can be mitigated). Show your work. \n\n3. Start by identifying a problem with the current method, then asking them to help you find a solution. Then just subtly lead them to the solution that you already know is right. \n\n[edit: also, avoid using the word "but" at all because it sets up a competitive, this-or-that, environment. \n\nIf someone says "I don't want to be *x*, but...", then it's almost a guarantee that they're about to be *x* but feel they should get a pass.]
10	How many of you guys are parents? What do you think are the pros and cons of having an ISTJ parent?	
4	*Waves*  \nISTJ mother here.  \nPros:  \n> * sticking to a routine and things like timings/schedules for school runs, meetings etc are easy as pie.\n* Helping with the homework, while seeming tedious and never-ending, is actually good because I can help them understand HOW to solve a problem methodically rather than rely on the "teacher said so" method\n* Sticking to a routine means the children know what to expect and are calmer.\n\n&nbsp;  \nCons:  \n> * Days out are a nightmare. I will have everything planned and kids are just too damn unpredictable. I end up in a fluster when things don't go to plan\n* Behaviour is a huge issue, I can't seem to be as flexible in my behaviour management. Sometimes children need firm parenting, others need the gentle approach and needing to change this on the spot is hard.\n* Communicating with them is frustrating. Children do not think logically and I spend 90% of my time correcting things and suggesting ways that they can do things better - which is often smothering.\n\n&nbsp;  \nI had a very angry and turmoiled upbringing and it's something I've tried to avoid giving my children, but it doesn't work that way. Children are constantly changing and will often change their minds at the drop of a hat and in my personal experience, it leads to me getting frustrated very very easily, at which point I tend to retreat and need to cool-off. Not something that's easy with children running around! 
3	My mother tested as an ISTJ several years ago, which surprised me. She has always been overbearing, and even after moving out six years ago I still find it difficult to spend any significant amount of time around her. She used to have an uncontrollable temper which my sister saw the brunt of (as she's aged she's gotten milder). My dad is awesome, not sure what his MB is. He almost left my mom twice and she pulled him back.\n\nAll of my mother's traits might have to do with things outside her MB personality, but she is ISTJ and that's what it's like being her son... Frustrating more than anything else.
3	Not a parent, but my dad is a textbook istj. I personally think that he has a very controlling aspect to him that is very unbearable. He doesn't understand feelings and wants his children a certain way. Since my sister and I are not what he envisioned, he is constantly upset and reminding us that we're terrible children (we can't speak mandarin, have white boyfriends, my sisters boyfriend is an art major and just not what Asian parents want). My sister is engaged and he wants to stop the marriage from happening. He tells her repeatedly that he doesn't like her bf.\n\nI know that not all istj parents are like this. There will be some more well rounded than others. My dad isn't very understanding. He constantly stresses himself out because we're not his perfect children. He complains about us to his family and friends right in front of us. We don't have a good relationship with him. 
3	I'm a parent to cats and I've done a lot of babysitting. I notice that I come off as emotionally cold, observant, but also caring and genuinely interested in their learning. I'll do whatever it takes to help a child reach their goals. My dad is also an ISTJ, and this is how he's been as a father. He's not very emotionally invested (at least not in a visible manner), but he does support me and does help me where he can. We're not super good at communicating with one another, for obvious reasons. 
2	It really is strange to me that an ISTJ would even choose to become a parent in the first place. It must have been an "oops" 
21	Are you competitive?	I'm strikingly uncompetitive.  If I feel like I've done my best, and everyone has had a decently good time, then I'm generally happy, even if I lose.  I've noticed that this applies to board games, sports, whatever.  In fact, I'll often help out opponents (say, in a board game) if I feel like it would make the game more fun or interesting.\n\nIn fact, I actively dislike playing with people who are super-competitive, the people who get angry or downcast when things are going badly for them, or seem thrilled with victory.\n\nDunno, am I a typical ISTJ or not?
8	I'm IxTJ, but I'm highly competitive. I'm not a bad sport and won't compete with someone who doesn't feel it's a competition, but I've always found a lot of gratification in being recognized for strong performance. 
3	I find I am most competitive with myself. If I'm cycling, I want to beat my time, not necessarily the guy in front of me. That being said, I don't tolerate being center of the pack either. I'm not a type A, super competitive, highest gpa person...but C's aren't acceptable. 
3	In general, I'm competitive about things I care about: being good at my job, the sports I play, etc.  I didn't realize this until I was essentially competing with another person over a girl we both liked - she said we were both 'so competitive' which was something new to me.  But like you, most "games" don't spark that competitive drive in me.  \n\nI live with a semi-pro CS:GO player, and I don't know how he can play that game so heavily in such a serious/competitive manner.  When I play, I like to just dick around and make my teammates laugh.
2	I'm mildly competitive. I'll do my best and love recognition for my successes, but I'm pretty realistic and know I'll probably not be number one. I'll still get down if I underperform compared to others, but I've mellowed out over the years.
2	Yes - my experience 100%. I love just playing a game. I can't stand braggarts who crow about winning, nor do I have the desire to lord over anyone else. Golf, Monopoly, poker - you name it.\n\nIs this a lack of coping skills? A sincere desire to just enjoy time with other people? Interesting thought.
1	If I enjoy the sport I am pretty competitive but if I don't enjoy it I tend to be awful at it and not care .\n\nEdit: However I dont care if I win or loose... Sounds weird,right? Competitive to me is just I personally want to be the best player not I want my team to be better than their team. Make sense? Also I enjoy teaching people and helping them get better.
1	I'm an ISTJ, I am extremely competitive, though over the years I've become less competitive. I believe my competitiveness has come from my Asian background (parents always pushed me to be the #1 student), also I enjoy winning. ;) I'm not really a team player, and would rather do 1-on-1 sports, rather than team sports where I'd have the opportunity to disappoint.
1	I am the exact same way! Also IxTJ. Mostly S but sometimes N..
1	I'm not competitive at all. This makes board games and video games with me very interesting, actually. I'm not in it for myself, I like to totally fuck it up for everyone else though, or just make it weird. It's funny and slightly obnoxious, but to me it's more fun than actually playing the board game or video game with the intent to win. \n\nMost physical sports I've done were non-competitive. Gymnastics, martial arts, archery, dance. I did try playing roller derby, but that didn't interest me, so I'm a referee and an announcer. 
1	I am completely noncompetitive. I hate the jeers, constantly having to prove your competence, and how males act when they are in a competitive environment. I just want to play the damn game without having it be a goddamn contest.
1	Extremely. Though i'm not vocal about it. I like to be the best at everything- especially when it comes to my job.
1	Competition involves attention - either good or bad - and I tend to avoid any attention whatsoever.
1	I'm this way as well. I don't even like commission sales work for this reason. But I don't know if there's a basis in MBTI to explain it. \n\nMaybe Si makes us more inclined toward stability, which is hard to maintain in a competitive environment. Te and Fi might realize that cooperation is more effective and appeases more people, so competitive sports might now "do" it for us. \n\nIn my case, I always attributed my lack of competitiveness to the fact that my dad would never let me win at things when I was younger. (Example: He, a 35 year old man, would play his best game of basketball against me, an 8 year old boy.) \n\nI reacted by not caring any more. Interestingly, my ISTP older brother became super competitive instead.\n\n[Edit: I added that example because I intended to ask: do you have any similar experiences with competition or success/failure that might be informing your perspective?]
1	OP, you sound exactly like me. I'm not the slightest bit competitive. I've been trying to get my family into playing co-op board games (instead of traditional) in the hopes of negating most of the hyper-competitiveness that several members of my family have. Nothing ruins a fun evening faster than bickering over who won some arbitrary thing or another. It's just a game, people!
11	How well/poorly do ISTJs accept compliments?	I've been dating my ISTJ boyfriend for over 5 years now (I'm an ISFJ). He's generally less willing to outwardly express his emotions, so he's always a solid rock when I get overwhelmed. \n\nHowever, he's never been able to "graciously" accept a compliment from me. Even if I say I like the way he styled his hair, or if a shirt/pair of jeans looks good on him, he only says "sorry," or "okay." I have to remind him that he can just say "thanks" and that his responses make him sound a little ungrateful, or like he doesn't appreciate the compliment. \n\nIs this a common ISTJ trait? Is there some other, better way for me to compliment him?
29	Deep down inside I really want to bask in the positive attention but I repress it for fear of coming off as a douche or arrogant.  It's gotten better over the years where I can just smile, nod and say thanks! And if I'm really comfortable I'll just play it off with a self deprecating joke of some sort.  Internal thoughts of coming off having a big ego are still there though.
10	I CANNOT take a compliment. It's so uncomfortable! Especially if it's a family member commenting on my looks. Sometimes my grandmother will look me straight in the eyes and say something like "you're so beautiful." It makes my insides curl up in horror!\n\nThat being said, I love giving really sincere compliments to anyone and everyone--family, friends, stranger on the store who has cute scarf, whoever. But this is definitely learned behavior and not a natural thing for me.
6	I don't know if most ISTJ are like that,but compliments in general make me feel uncomfortable,and they always come off as unnatural.
5	I have no problems being complimented, but if I'm being bragged about then I hate that. \nExample: "hey! You look nice :)" - totally fine\n\nMy grandmother saying "she's so smart, she's doing..... Blah blah blah..." - super uncomfortable
6	I like to give ISTJs private compliments because I know they don't take it well but still enjoy them. I love that Fi glow with the awkward, omg how do I react to this praise shuffle, before the, "I was just doing what I was supposed to do." And then back to normalcy.\n\nActually, it's one of my favorite things about you guys. Even if you get awards and amazing compliment. It's like, thank you, I'm glad you recognized my work. Now, let's get back on track, what's next on the to-do list. Very humble and practical. \n\nEdit: two autocorrects. Ooops
5	Very poorly.  I think my low self-esteem and being very hard on myself also contributes to not accepting compliments. Like someone else mentioned,  it makes my inside curl a bit. I physically shrink when I get compliments- even from my husband. They feel so insincere.  Like they are only being said to be polite.\nI don't know of another way to give compliments so they will be better received.  I always thought it came across as humble.
3	I can graciously accept compliments via text, though there's at least a 28% chance that I went and quickly googled how to accept compliments first. :)  I just try to remember that the other person wants me to accept their compliment, and that I'm just adding their discomfort to my own if I refuse it. [Edit to add: And in the event that they complimented me to test whether I would insult myself or deflect the compliment in order to prove something to them about my humility then they're odd and probably not a great judge of me anyways.]\n\nIn person... it really depends on the compliment. Most of the times I am complimented on things I don't really feel particularly invested in or proud about. \n\nFor instance, I get told that I am bright. Sometimes in a hostile context (e.g., "You're so bright, so it is especially shitty and confusing why you don't deliver what we expect you to deliver"), sometimes just in general. I don't see it though. I wonder if being quiet, furrowing my eyebrows, and only speaking when I am confident of my answer gives them some false impression. And even if it is true, it is nothing I've done for myself, and it *certainly* is not the sole (or even primary) ingredient for success.\n\nThe only thing I feel proud of is my ability to come up with analogies, and when I get complimented on them, I can take those well. Otherwise, I am prone to thanking the other person, but probably come off awkward, stilted, etc. It just throws me off.\n\nWhy does he say sorry when you compliment him? Do you literally mean he apologizes for looking nice?\n\nWhat are you complimenting him on? It might be that the things you are complimenting are not things that he identifies as important, as personally relevant, as matters of pride or accomplishment, etc.
2	I dont know about everyone else but I am a lot like this, I think part of it is the fact that I never really get compliments because I tend to not draw any attention to myself.
2	I simply say thanks
1	Badly, even the sincere ones sound condescending and mocking to my ears
1	I'm not too great at taking compliments, especially in person! It just makes me so awkward since I don't really know how to react. I'm better at reacting to them if they're in text, if they're something I really care about or I've worked on, or if I feel like it's really sincere.
1	Compliments always put me on the spot and make me feel uncomfortable. I feel like any way I could respond is rude, so I normally just change the subject. :/
1	You totally described me. I get caught off guard when people give me compliments that my mom has had to tell me multiple times "um, say 'thank you' for giving you a compliment!" even when I was a teenager. It's a lot harder for me to take a compliment about my appearance than one about my actions (how good of a job I did, great effort, etc.). I know I'm not unattractive, but I don't expect compliments and they make me awkward when I'm not trying to dress up. Even when my husband tells me that a pair of jeans look good, I look at him like he's grown a second head.\n\nAnd I'll give compliments, but only when I actually like something. A girl in high school chopped her hair really short and it looked terrible, so I didn't say anything to her. If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all. People around me genuinely appreciate the compliments I give because they're honest. It's really unnatural for me to give fake compliments.
1	Oh Jeez, if I would be rich if I had a £ every time my boyfriend paid me a compliment and I just shrugged it off! He tries to be sweet and I just make "I'm going to puke" noises because I just can't take a compliment, I don't know how! The best I've ever managed is an "uhhhh, thanks I guess?"
1	I'm terrible at accepting compliments, and showing any type of emotion for that matter. 
1	Compliments make me squirm but I do like to hear validation, so it's a catch-22 of sorts. I usually just say thank you and then try to change the subject.
1	indifferently. I don't live for people's praise, nor do I want it.
13	What are weird things you do when home alone?	What are weird things you do when home alone?\n\nI'll start... When I sit down to play games at home (on my PC) I turn on the TV next to me and put something bearable on TV (despite the fact I play with headphones on) 
12	I talk to myself. It's a bad habit.
4	I play games on my phone ,watch tv (with subtitles on) while listening to music.
3	i check same sites on both mobile and desktop
3	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
2	I do this too!! First thing I do when I come home is turn on the tv in the living room even though I'm gonna go upstairs and get ready for bed first. As much as I don't mind being alone, I still like the background noise.\n\nI will usually then come down to the living room but proceed to watch videos on my phone before I actually turn my attention to what's on TV
2	I play piano and slowly shed clothes the longer I play. 
1	Play guitar really loud. I live with my wife, and currently my Father-In-Law (he's had house/financial issues) who works third shift and sleeps during the day. I use the alone time to my advantage to crank up the tunes and jam on my guitars.
7	I saw this chart on 4chan and didn't quite get the ISTJ reference. Anyone mind explaining the joke to me?	
18	We are emotionless robots.
3	I don't get it... 
3	[deleted]
3	ISTJ are by the book so the art style is realistic. Something like ISTJ people being conservative. 
2	well, at least we have the best pecs and we're not ... green?
1	[deleted]
4	Is this strange for an ISTJ?	So I'm an ISTJ (who's S-N is very balanced), but I have some traits that are a bit unusual for what I've heard for most ISTJs. ISTJs are very hard-working, and while I can work hard, I can feel pretty lazy at times. I've also been told I'm very imaginative for an ISTJ, which is atypical from what I've heard about ISTJs. Thoughts?
13	>ISTJs are very hard-working, and while I can work hard, I can feel pretty lazy at times.\n\nI consider myself hard-working in a way that I won't botch when I actually work. I don't like volunteering for stuff though because I know that if I accept a task, I'll feel the need to complete it at 110% and I'll feel bad if I don't. On that note I can end up being lazy and just stick to my own stuff.\n\nI can also spend a full day doing nothing but I don't call that being lazy, I call that "introvert recharging his battery"-type of day. The next day I'm super productive.\n\n>I've also been told I'm very imaginative for an ISTJ, which is atypical from what I've heard about ISTJs. Thoughts?\n\nWhat do you mean by imaginative? I myself have been working for a while on comic strips. I play bass guitar and I made up some riffs. People also told me that I can be imaginative, but I know for sure I am a Si-dom.\n
3	ISTJ here, i just quit my accounting-related job to work for the film industry. i realized that office work is slowly killing me mentally and emotionally so i started taking an interest in film. i can also say that during those times at my old office job, i've also had my share of days being lazy, but maybe it's because i never really liked it.
2	I think people kind of have this idea that ISTJs are some kind of automatons. We can be creative and imaginative. I've written plays and even been published on a few occasions. 
2	Most people think I'm lazy, but I'm actually just slow, meticulous, and kind of a perfectionist when it comes to my work. I definitely consider myself hard-working, just not fast-working. If I do try to work hard and fast, I get burnt out and I'm forced to lower my workload for a while. \n\nI'm imaginative, I paint and write, but most of my work is pretty... linear, analytical, symmetrical, patterned. Rarely is it random. I can only achieve that with copious amounts of THC. 
1	Hey there.\n\nI work at Walmart as a Support Manager. It's the highest paid manager position in the store that is not hourly. I've been with the company for 9 years, and started as an overnight stocker and worked my way up.\n\nI'm constantly being told that I need to delegate more with this job. I do delegate, but sometimes not enough- I like to keep busy and do *work*. Delegating and telling others what to do is something I struggle with because I like the demands and hustle of physical labor, but i'm learning how to manage better as I do this job. 
5	Weekly Thread: What frustrates you about your family?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what are some things that your family members do that really irk you? \n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!\n\nP.S. Apologies for the delay in posting this - my family's in town, and they may or may not be the source of inspiration for this week's topic. 
6	They're needy. They call/text every week or two complaining that they haven't seen me "lately".\n\nAlso, they tell the same boring stories or tidbits of information Over and over. I'm constantly saying "I know. You told me last week". \n\nAnd they go on wild tangents with their stupid stories/anecdotes instead of just getting the point of their story.\n\nAnd my mom always wants to hug me. DON'T TOUCH ME!
7	Father *(ESTJ)* - It's always his way or the highway\n\nMother *(ISTJ who oscillates between Ne grip & Si-Fi loops)* - she never wants to "be a bother" to anyone (i.e. have any kind of impact on another human being)\n\nOlder Brother *(ISTP)* - He just wants to watch the world burn (aka shit-disturber extraordinaire)\n\nHusband *(ENTJ)* - Thinks he needs to constantly direct my thoughts and actions\n\nDog - Just effing adorable.
6	They take my want of "personal space" or "alone time" personally, but then again, a lot of people do.
5	Over half of the people in my immediate family are extroverts, so they can be draining at times.
4	I still live at home and I can't stand leaving my room, it is messy and cluttered out there and they refuse to clean it. \nMy sister is an a**hole and can't follow basic rules while constantly arguing her silly Fe against my strong Te and her arguments are illogical and stupid and it hurts
5	My mother constantly asks for clarification on every single subject to the point where it's almost difficult to communicate.
3	My grandmother (and her sister) are both hardcore Conservatives and take everything they hear on Fox News or from Glenn Beck and other similar sources at the Gospel truth. Even when I provide them with actual researched information, they scoff and say that not everything on the Internet is true. Okay sure, but not everything on the news is true either--especially when you're only viewing one side of the issue.\n\nCase in point--I live in North Carolina and as anyone who follows US news knows, our state recently passed a so-called "Bathroom Bill" requiring people to use the bathroom that matches the sex listed on their birth certificate. I actually read the entire bill and turns out the bathroom part is a scam to pass other legislation that screws over NC residents. I tried explaining the potential damage and their response was "it doesn't effect you so why do you care?" ugh.
3	we don't get along, so we hang out only really during holidays and bdays (as tradition says) but it always ends up with my sister storming out and my mother going on about her spiritual beliefs.. 
3	Sometimes trying too hard to please me. Other times being a tad too talkative.\n\nI still keep a good relationship with my family anyway.
2	I love my family, but the fact that we *all* live super close gets really annoying. And when I say all, I mean all- Aunts, Uncles, cousins, etc. \n\nBasically, my wife and I feel obligated to go to every single family gathering/picnic/holiday, you name it. It's just what i've done since I was a kid, so now that my wife and I kinda have our *own* agenda, and like to do our *own* thing on my days off, the rest of my family thinks that I just hate everyone. 
6	random survey! all types needed especially Es and Js	
6	That was indeed random haha. Wish I could see the results though. 
4	Yes, will be interested in the results. Please keep us posted!
5	How do you add value in your personal relationships?	When it comes to friends or significant others, what qualities do you bring to the relationship? \n\nHow do you complement the skills, abilities and personalities of others in your life?
4	I'm a good listener. I like to listen to others and think about what they have to say. I ponder over things pretty thoroughly before commenting on them or offering suggestions. \n\nAnd while I'm an introvert, I do like to go out and experience things, so I invite one or two friends along. I'm always inviting a friend or two to go do things with me. They appreciate that. Especially the extroverts in my life. 
1	People know they can count on me to be real. 
1	I'm a really good listener. I might not be the best at giving advice, but I will listen to any rant/problem/life struggle, etc. 
2	Trouble figuring out if an ISTJ co-worker is interested in me?	Hi all. Male INTP here. I have a female ISTJ co-worker who I've been working with for the past month, and I have trouble figuring out if she's interested in me romantically. \n\nWhen its just the two of us speaking alone, we get along great. We joke around and have great conversations where we'll both actively contribute to the discussion. If she passes me in the hall she'll make an effort to say hi. But whenever we are in a group, she almost seems to ignore me. For example, if a group of co-workers are going to eat lunch together, it almost seems like she deliberately sits a few spaces away from me, or that sort of thing. \nI'm thinking of asking her out, but I do not want to make things weird as we will be working together for the rest of the summer.\nSo essentially what I'm asking is, is this typical ISTJ behavior when they are interested in someone, or is there just not information to really know? 
4	I'm guessing she doesn't want to appear committed to you in front of others unless you are willing to as well.  Relationships in the workplace can sometimes be big no-nos and she probably doesn't want others at work to get the impression that you two are an item.  Therefor she is limiting interactions with you to 1 on 1 times.\n\n\nAsk her to meet you somewhere after work, but keep it somewhere you probably won't run into other colleagues.  Just be honest.
2	I agree with the notion of just asking her in a straightforward fashion -- but away from others. If she's an ISTJ, my guess would be that she will appreciate not having to guess at things, and will give you an honest response.\n\nAs for why she might act that way if she *did* like you... I can't speak for her of course. But personally, it takes either personal intimacy or a *lot* of time for me to get comfortable enough to relax, open up, and be myself around others. Unless the setting has around 60-65%+ of people who I'm relaxed with, I tend to close up. It's almost involuntary.\n\nOf course, it is hard to be half-relaxed and half-tensed, so the result is that when I'm with a small number of people I know well, in a larger group setting where people aren't just distracted and doing their own thing, I tend to be relatively more stilted and formal. And I know it is weird with the people I usually am relaxed with, and yet it still happens. This might partly be Enneatype 5 stuff though. I am not sure that all ISTJs compartmentalize relationships as a matter of course.
2	From my observation of more introverted ISTJs, they tend to "retreat" from a group conversation and only join in when they need to. Also, they might sit with other people because they might feel obligated to (e.g. her close friends, etc ).\n\nDefinitely be upfront about it. They might not treat you very gently, but they'll usually be appreciative for the honesty.
16	How I deal with any regrets I have	
5	I always try to convince myself that I would have made those same/similar mistakes somehow someway. Life is meant to have its lessons, even if they're painful. All you can do is try your best in the present and look forward.
3	Man, I would love it if I could just not think about it. Instead anytime my brain is not focused on something I have to do, it normally just plays a loop of the most embarrassing moments of my life.
6	What are your biggest pet peeves?	It drives me nuts when people chew with their mouths open and also when people question authority. 
9	* I easily lose my patience with people who lose their patience easily.\n* Hypocrites. \n* People who don't learn from their own mistakes.
12	When people act entitled. \n\nLiars. \n\nWhen people judge or assume. \n\nWhatever the opposite of straight-forward is. 
5	People that don't understand that they share the world equally with other people.
6	Well, here goes;\n\n* People who are loud, boisterous and lack modesty.\n* People who are not frugal and are too brand loyal.\n* People who don't respect facts and lead with their emotions and feelings.\n* People who don't respect schedules.\n* People who depend on substances like weed, alcohol or drugs generally.\n* Gossips and curious people.\n* People who rely heavily on social networks for validation and attention.\n
4	Grammatical, punctuation, and spelling errors.\n\n\n\nPeople chewing with mouths open as well (and sometimes when they're really loud eaters).\n\n\n\nWhen you're having a conversation with someone and they stare at their phone (also when they don't give eye contact). Similarly, when people don't listen.\n\n\n\nlol there are soooo many others but these are biggies
5	People who constantly judge and criticize others who, for some reason, can't find any weaknesses or flaws in themselves. 
3	People who love to gossip or share personal problems/details about your life to another person. I spoke directly to you and wanted to share that info with YOU. Not for someone else to know. \n\nPeople who put half effort into tasks. \n\nAlso, people who have no self respect or a bit of pride. \n\nLastly, people who bite their nails (especially when I know I will have to shake your hand soon).
2	When people stop songs in the middle, especially when they consistently only listen to ~40% of a song. Do you even remember what the end of a song sounds like?
2	People who can't see a job to be done and do it.\n\nThings just piled around.\n\nPeople who pretend to know what something is when they clearly don't.\n\nPeople who cry over everything.
1	Snoring. 
1	My mind is racing.  Too many to list.  I'll have to think about it and get it down to a concise list.  
1	When my flatmates load the dishwasher, they literally just put things in a pile. About half the bowls we started with have shattered because of this.\n\nWhen people have loud, angry phone conversations on public transport.\n\nPeople who don't understand the concept of personal space and literally press up against you when they're talking to you (or maybe it's a deliberate intimidation tactic, but personally it just makes me likely to refuse to accommodate them out of spite).\n\nI get a lot of customers who refuse to deal with me because they think that being young means I'm not qualified, and insist to speak to my older co-workers... Who then refuse to do the job they've been trained to do because they're afraid of right-clicking, and pass the buck back to me.
1	People who go get a job, and then don't show up and are completely lazy. Also, those that don't respect authority.
5	Weekly Thread: What are your hobbies?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: tell us about your hobbies! How do you spend your free time?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
6	I knit, crochet, and lift weights. All stuff I can do solo. 
3	Ooh! My hobbies are mostly playing video games (pokemon, Fallout, gta, racing games, etc) and browsing reddit and tumblr. When I have money, I like messing around with legos. Come to think of it, I don't really lead an interesting life...
4	Strength training and watching netflix :)
3	unsurprisingly it's programming :D really enjoy that :)\n\n
3	Bubble baths, Netflix, podcasts, cleaning and organizing the house, random car rides alone to get out of the house, Reddit 
3	Video games mostly(League of Legends, SSBM, Pokemon, Fallout or puzzle games on my phone), if not that then im watching videos on how to fix up my Civic, or looking on reddit/netflix for anything to catch my eye and interest. 
2	CSGO and Igress is all I do.
2	In descending order of time spent:\n\n* Video games  \n* Mountainbiking  \n* Playing piano  \n* Archery  
2	Most of the stuff I do, I prefer to do alone. Here comes the list:\n\n1. Gaming - I'm a long time gamer and still going, even though it has become rather stale for me over the last few years.\n\n2. Web browsing - Often seemingly random. The "from dank memes to nuclear physics" kind of random.\n\n3. Working out - To keep myself in some normal shape. I also want to find out how long I will be able to do it.\n\n4. Programming - Concepts mostly. I do like to tinker around with stuff like Unity3D to see what I can do.
2	Working out, fingerstyle guitar, cooking everything from scratch, high performance aircraft aka fighter jets, I play Dota 2 to keep in touch with an old roommate, used to be really into fantasy football, traveling/hiking/photography (landscape and Astro), doing new crazy things to prove to myself that I can.
2	I play guitar, watch hockey (who would've guessed? ha), hang out/do fun stuff with my wife, do stuff outside, karate, and occasionally I pretend that I know a little bit about computers and cars. 
1	Video games, mostly JRPGs, Mario stuff, Mega Man, retro stuff (Si coming right in).\n\nI play bass guitar.\n\nI read webcomics, comic books, general knowledge books, MBTI stuff.\n\nI watch comedy TV shows.\n\nReddit of course.
11	DAE goes to bed with a notepad ready to make note of all the thoughts/ideas that they get only and only at night time?	
12	I don't but I really should. I get the best ideas for memes but I can never remember them in the morning no matter how hard I try. And I'm convinced (objectively speaking of course) that they're all front page worthy
4	Sort of - I keep all my notes on my phone but will turn it on several times before nodding off to make sure I *forget nothing*!
2	No
2	No, but I have one that lives in my car. And satchel. 
2	I get a lot of good ideas on a pretty frequent basis, but not really on any kind of regular schedule. I put them into workflowy usually when I can, but I have pages and pages of brainstorming that I've collected over the years, from before I had a good place to put them!
2	Does everyone faces introvert/extrovert problems in gym?	The in charge of the gym I go to asks me to be more outgoing and interact with others a lot. He doesn't understands the concept of introversion and how it's different from shyness. I have a feeling that I have read someone else complain about this very thing before. Is this a common problem?
4	People don't really talk to each other at my gym, nod and smile but we don't interrupt each other so this seems a little unusual. I've been to a lot of gyms and never been told to be more outgoing
4	Yeah. Been to plenty of gyms and have never had ANYONE ask me to be more outgoing. Some places are friendlier than others, but that's always been up to the clientele, not any of the employees, and even then you never have to talk if you don't want to.
3	My gym is in my house.  Not weird for me.
2	That's odd. Is this a specific class or something? One of the best things about going to the gym is alone time. 
2	Have to agree with everyone else. I generally great the front desk person with a "how are you?" or whatever, and that's usually the only talking I do. Generally just nodding and/or smiling at others. 
2	weird.  i work out alone, don't go there to socialize and take up the bench for 10 more minutes than i need it for.   is this a group class or what?
2	Are you supposed to be soliciting memberships or class sign-ups? \n\nJust simply saying 'hello' to gym goers is enough interaction for most. I don't know many people who like interacting at the gym. 
4	Weekly Thread: What are you currently trying to improve about yourself?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: what are you trying to improve about yourself? What steps are you taking to accomplish this?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
3	Wife and I made a chore chart for every day - just something small. Our home is MUCH cleaner now
5	Studying a language, and being disciplined enough to work at it every day for 15-30 minutes.
3	[deleted]
2	I'm trying to improve my sleep sched. I was binge-watching Z Nation the other day and ended up sleeping at 7am. So far, I tried staying up from whenever I wake up until nighttime just so I get tired enough to fall asleep and reset my sleep sched. It is difficult though because I have nothing much to do at home other than read, play games and sleep
2	I'm really working on taking all me meds and testing my blood sugar every day.  I'm a diabetic with other issues including depression.  When the depression is winning I stop taking my meds which naturally makes me worse.  \n\nIn the last 7 weeks I've missed 2 entire days and about 7 nights.  I sleep a weird schedule so don't have a set bedtime to coincide with night meds.  I've also been testing at least twice a day.  That's a huge improvement.\n\nI tested more in the last 6 months than the last 3 years.  LOL  Making a solid effort to keep my pill case loaded so extra work is not a deterrent. \n\n
9	Unconventional Wisdom	My fellow ~NT~ friend and I are throwing around an idea for a podcast. People write in and we dispense rational, scientific based advice, divorced of feeling or sympathy, a la Data / Spock from Star Trek.\n\nIt would require research on our part for some questions. For example, if someone writes in about a contentious relationship, we'd have to look up the different styles of amygdala  hijack (fight or flight response to stress) and how to deescalate the situation. \n\nThere would be NO "tell the person how you feel" or "just be yourself" or "love yourself at your size", feeler advice. \n\nJust cold hard, science based, advice and an action plan attached to it. And of course some ~NT~ snark. \n\nSo I'm taking a survey. \n\nHow many of you think this could make an entertaining podcast? \n\nAdditionally....\n\nWe are currently taking advice requests from people 18+ to make a dummy run of the podcast (to gauge how long it should be, editing, style etc)\n\nOur test run will not be put out to the general public, but if your letter is selected we will send you the audio file of our test run. \n\nOf course, your identity would remain anonymous. \n\nYou can send a letter here.\n\nunconventionalwisdompodcast@gmail.com\n\nIf you have any suggestions or comments, I would love to hear them. We are in the planning stages now, and any ideas are appreciated. 
5	> There would be NO "tell the person how you feel" or "just be yourself" or "love yourself at your size", feeler advice.\n\nSounds perfect - make it happen please.
3	We aren't discounting feelings. Basically I agree with everything you said. We are just discounting feelings as the best information to make a decision. Feelings are tools to be used or reigned in effectively. There is plenty of research, as you have said, about this.\n\nBasically everything you said in the second half of your post as well. We are not dispensing feel good advice with no meaning. We are dispensing effective advice based on the best info we can find. 
1	I'm not sure that it would be interesting to listen to, maybe you could find a way to make it interesting with execution however I think that it would benefit a lot of people
1	I don't think that it would be interesting to listen to. In order to make accurate science based advice on the topics you suggested, you would realistically have to have a degree and experience in the field of psychology or neuroscience. 
1	What makes you think science and sympathy are incompatible? What about research demonstrating ideal ratios of positive to negative comments when it comes to building a positive relationship, or articles showing the value of gratitude for building relationships? I guarantee I can find articles that support feelings and sympathy for situations where those are appropriate and important variables to consider.\n\nWhat I *like* in your suggestion is the implication that the advice would be *specific* and research-based. The biggest crime of the "feelery" advice you cite is that it is so vague and  meaningless except to people who don't need the advice in the first place. "Be yourself"? How about examining the role of shame in producing counterproductive relationship behaviors, such as self-consciousness, which undermines relationship quality because the individual is less attentive to social cues, whilst also experiencing dysphoric affect and anxiety,  likely leading to future avoidance? Hence, don't "be yourself," but specifically attend to other people more, and more broadly work to address shame.\n\nIf anything, now I'd be curious to see a series that "translates" vague feelery advice into science-backed recommendations!
5	Opinions on dating an ENTP girl?	An ISTJ (we're really close) has been trying to court me, in a sense. \nI wanted to know what you guys think about the combo/ any downsides/upsides to the relationship?\n\nI'm actually considering dating him but I'm just a little worried about my freedom, and idk this is my stereotype on ISTJs but you guys really love security in a relationship, so I see the Si and Ne clashing...a  lot.
3	As an ISTJ, I'd be affraid myself to lose my freedom by dating an ENTP. This guy's gonna need his alone time, I gurantee it (that's just who we are).\n\nBut if you make it clear that you'll be loyal, honest and not cheat on him he should definitely trust you and let you free.\n\nAnyway a lot of people agree than most of typings (if not all) combos can get along in a relationship. The key here is communication.\n\nJust make it clear what both of you want and what's your definition of freedom. And no bullshit or secret meanings in your sentences, we hate that! :p\n\nEdit for one word.
2	USUALLY if you have an opinion and remain firm with it an ISTJ will not interfere (unless it's dumb) so I don't think your freedom will be too infringed. Not sure about the pair up but make sure to be decisive to avoid being pushed around
2	ISTJs value independence (because of Fi). We want to be able to control our own world, so we often understand when others want to express their individuality. It's only when ISTJs are being unhealthy that they demand others conform to their will (ie not balancing Fi with Te). \n\nI think the Ne/Si thing will work in your favour because you have a common perspective to start from. He'll also be able to ground your more realistic ideas while you can bring him out into the many amazing possibilities of the world. \n\nTheoretically, you're both working toward each other's dominant function. So he can help you gain better access to Si and you can help him with Ne. I think that's one of the big benefits of this pairing. \n\nIn my mind, the biggest challenge is going to be that you'll have very different motivations for your decisions (Ti-Fe vs Te-Fi). You'll both need to be sure to communicate the reasons behind your actions and decisions. I think that will probably be the source of most misunderstandings. 
2	As someone who is madly in love with an ENTP, I think I can say with all bias... OMG YES.\n\nHaha, in all seriousness, yeah, my ENTP and I clash a bit.  Mostly because his scattered disorganization makes me nutty when we try to make plans.  I feel compelled to nag, but I hate nagging and he hates being nagged... eck.  The closest we ever had to a real fight was over him forgetting he made plans with me and standing me cuz he slept in while I tried to text him.  We also clash because I'm pretty bad at expressing my emotions and I feel like he struggles to understand the depth of my feelings sometimes.  It's a Fe vs. Fi thing, I think.  But overall, I think we would make an amazing duo.\n\nI think it hasn't happened yet for the same reason you've mentioned: He's worried I'll stifle his freedom.  But I dunno.  I'm not an adventurer, I'm not wild or crazy.  He is, and I love that about him.  I love hearing his eye-opening experiences and even being taken along on some adventures.  I love how he pushes me to step out of my comfort zone and challenge myself.  Granted, that's going to be something that varies with you and your individual ISTJ, but I think it's a great dynamic.  I can only give you my account of it, but in exchange for all the excitement and challenges, I like to think that I have a stabilizing influence on my ENTP.  When shit goes down, he comes to me for help and support.  He knows I'm resourceful and that he can trust me, and he knows that I'm entirely loyal.  \n\n: ) Meh.  My two cents is that it's a great pairing.  I also have another friend who is dating an ENTP and they work really well (almost 3 years strong now)--though they're also female ISTJ and male ENTP, if that makes a difference.  I think as long as you respect his need for stability and he respects your need for freedom, it would work out brilliantly. 
16	Hi my opposites! :)	How are you all doing today? I was just curious what you peoples were like, and how you guys felt about ENFPs. Just wondering. \n\nUmm a little about me. I'm a 31 year old male, and been living in Belgium with my girlfriend for the last six years. Currently I'm working at an amusement park behind one of those games where you can win a stuffed animal. The pay is crap, but I love the job. If I had a job where I could just make people happy all day, that'd be amazing. Mostly using the job to better my dutch, french, and german til the end of the summer. I like to watch anime and play video games(actually how I met my girlfriend), along with like 40 different hobbies. I'm not afraid to sing and dance in public. And that's it for now.\n\nHave a wonderful day! *hugs*
20	> How are you all doing today?  \n\nSince nobody is ever truly interested in the answer to that question, I might as well skip it.\n\n> I was just curious what you peoples were like, and how you guys felt about ENFPs. Just wondering.  \n\nWe hate talking about our feelings and we're usually bad at it. Ask for facts or let us solve analytic problems and you'll get some great answers.\n\n> *hugs*\n\nNo offense, but please.. don't.
3	Just from my own curiosity, what kind of job to you makes people happy all day? Is it things like Café/Restaurant/Bar? \n\nGenuinely curious :) 
3	Hi! I actually enjoy most outgoing-type folks as an ISTJ. As long as they don't try to force me out of my shell, but rather just act generally pleasant and fun. I also don't have a lot to say, so it's nice that someone else can keep the convo going so that I don't feel uncomfortable. I like to just go along with the flow without having to be 'on'. More of an observer. So thanks for being the life of the party! That way I don't have to be ;-)
2	I love ENFPs, One of my closest friends and my girlfriend are both ENFPs
2	One of my closest friends is an enfp. I think it's one of the few combinations of opposites that work really well because we both try to avoid conflict in most situations. It's also very fulfilling because we have so much to learn from each other. 
1	[deleted]
1	Hey another ISTJ here. In contrast to my peers, I am glad you stopped by! As you might have discovered...this group has a bit of 'prickly' demeanor. But I do hope this hasn't rubbed you the wrong way. \n\nI can agree that, in general, my response to an overly enthusiastic person is with a bit of suspicion. I wouldn't say we hate interaction, however it is "over-bearing" enthusiasm that I/we personally don't like. It's like, how can a person be that so upbeat without a real impetus/motive? \n\nTo that end about ENFPs in general, the 'feels' you guys get mystifies us. You guys are the joy and bane of our lives, exciting us and frustrating us. You bring us to social events when we want to get out, but at the same time can blow the littlest things out of proportions with feely "drama", for lack of a better term. Most of my friends are ENFPs, and I tend to be the one they come to when they need to vent. This is problematic because (from what i've read), people just want to be heard, not necessarily given an answer to the problem. For us ISTJs, driven by duty and passionate about finding solutions, this "venting" seems like a practice of insanity because, for us, addressing the problem and removing it seems like the fastest way to overcome your stress/negative emotion. \n\nSpeaking to your job, I'd liken our type to a star athlete or military personnel. We find reward in achievement of tasks, even more so if the challenge seems insurmountable. This call of duty gets us going, often driving us to plan out the objective and really lock in our schedules to achieve it. This discipline and regimentedness can appear martial and at times, cold.  Arbitrary things like...art...seem like a fool's gambit (similar to the whole discussion about feelings). We strive in areas where there are rules and structure, often in management positions. If you're an anime guy, think Mikasa from Attack on Titan. \n\nBut you seem genuinely like a nice person which I can respect and welcome you to ask any other questions that cross your mind. 
1	I'm doing pretty good. Attended a three-hour yoga class today, so I'm a little worn out. My significant other is either an ENFP or ESFP. I love them to death and we get along 99% of the time, but some days I just need a break, usually in the form of going for a walk, listening to music, or playing with my dogs. \n\nI'm not really a hugger, and I have trouble talking about my feelings much like any other ISTJ, but otherwise I'm fairly affectionate. 
-1	I hate them. They are overly emotional, too easily stressed, and over think things. 
12	ISTJs' thought processes when asked to try something new	I am curious to know what goes on in your minds when you are asked to try something new. Very often, I find ISTJs being unable to justify why they don't want to try something new (they like to say that they don't feel like it/they just don't want it), even when there's absolutely nothing to lose.
17	For me, trying something new is a two step process: \n\n1) Decide if I want to try the new thing.  Just because someone wants me to try something new is not a sufficient reason for me to try it.  I decide if the new thing would benefit me if it turned out that I liked it and then I may move to step two...\n\n2) Try the new thing in the environment of my choosing.  I hate trying something new with an audience waiting to see my reaction.  I would much rather try something new in private and then discuss with people later.
12	I want all the details before I start. Every single detail - is there a process already? Does that process work? Am I supposed to be creative or just get it done? What, exactly, do you want me to accomplish with this? Tell me everything you know. \n\nThen, I need time to look it over and ask any follow-up questions I have. \n\nThen, I want some time alone to figure out how to do it and get it done. 
5	1. Am I in a mood for exploring new things\n2. Is it dangerous or in any way taboo\n3. Is it something I will find pleasurable or profit from.\n4. I now proceed to justify a minimum of two reasons why I should do it and two why I shouldn't.\n5. Decide (if the answers aren't - 1. Yes, 2. No, 3. Yes - then I probably won't do it)
2	First thought is "no", second is rationalizing why not. Then when challenged, defend your answer just because you're stubborn. Oh life
2	Depending on what I'm deciding on, the reason is different. If it's a food, I rationalize that I like what I like, and I made it this far, so why change? If it is an act, like Skateboarding, I generally think that it will result in great bodily harm or death and decide its 100% not worth it, and not do it. I know it's stupid, but better safe than sorry.
2	On my phone, so this will be a short/incomplete reply, but:\n\n>they don't feel like it/they just don't want it\n\n...This is not good enough justification for not doing it? They don't have to justify themselves to you and your criteria, only to their own.\n\nFor myself, it might start out with not wanting to, but if the other person makes it into a battle by insisting I either set forth indisputable reasons for not trying it, or surrender to trying it, I'll refuse to do it on the principle of independence and self-determination alone.\n\nThere are always arguments for and against doing something, and my most unassailable reason for not doing a thing is my not *wanting* to do it. Allowing that to be invalidated in favor of arguing within the realm of all the *other* subjective reasons for/against something seems silly  and doomed to failure if you ask me.\n\nOr a simpler way of saying it, "I didn't want to in the first place, and now I also don't want to give you the expectation of control over me."
2	For me, it looks like this:\n\n1. Why should I? \nIs there an advantage for doing so? \na) if yes: proceed to 2.\nb) if no: *No.*\n\n\n2. What are the disadvantages?\nDo the disadvantages outweigh the advantage(s)?\na) if yes: *No.*\nb) if no: proceed to 3.\n\n\n3. What do I stand to lose?\na) my dignity: *No.*\nb) money: *No.*\nc) nothing: proceed to 4.\n\n\n4. Will I regret doing this? \na) if yes: *No.* \nb) if no: ... Okay... *maybe*.\n\n\n:) 
2	Often times I'm afraid to find something new because I don't want to fail. It's hard to get past failure. I'm sure this isn't exclusive to ISTJs, no one likes to fail. But I think we might internalize it as a personal failure more than others. 
1	Haha. \n\nFor me, it's "OMG I'M GOING TO DIE!"
1	1. Have I tried this thing or something like it before?\n1. Have I thought about trying/wanted to try this thing or something like it before?\n1. Is there anything wrong with the current thing I am doing/have I been looking for a change?\n1. Do I have any explicit reason not to try this thing?\n1. What will happen if I try this thing?\n1. Can I make up (aka bullshit) a good enough reason not to try this thing?\n1. Why is this person trying to get me to try this thing? What do they get out of it?\n\nAlternate thought process, only if attractive person/person I'm crushing on asks me to try something new:\n\n1. Sure!\n\nEdited a word
1	Inner thoughts when asked to try new thing.\n\n1. Fuck.\n2. Ugh, what if I don't like the thing?\n3. Did they even analyse the potential risk of trying this thing?\n4. I don't know anything about this thing, I wish I knew more about the thing. I would feel much better if I knew all the basic information about the thing.\n5. Why are they pushing me so hard to try the thing? Why do they even care about me and the thing, they should keep the thing to themselves, I didn't ask about the thing.\n6. What if I'm bad at the thing? Then I'll look like a fool.\n7. Oh god everyone is going to watch me try the thing.\n8. Just tell them, nah, I don't wanna try the thing\n9. I should research the thing later in depth and determine for sure whether or not trying it is important to me and in what environment I am comfortable trying it.\n\nIn the meantime, I have been judged as boring and/or unjust in saying no. 'There isn't anything to lose.' Yes. Yes there is. The comfort of my process is lost when I abandon it to just randomly try things. Also, I would argue, depending on the thing, there very well might not be anything to gain either.
39	What Each Myers-Briggs Personality Type Means When They Say ‘I Love You’	
3	I haven't checked directly with the ISTJ in my life, but the ISTJ one seems really accurate to what I know of her so far, including our connection and what she's told me about her past relationships.\n\nThank you for posting this! I've been vaguely background-ruminating on possible differences in respective meaning for "I love you" in our case (INFJ/ISTJ). I think this article accurately pinpoints something very important for my own clarity.\n\nAlso: I stole this and posted it at r/mbti. 
2	We've also found out that Ash Ketchum is an ESFP
2	Yep. It's a feeling but also a...duty? I mean, if I don't feel it, I'm not going to say it. Cut and dry. But if I do feel it/say it, I'll do whatever it takes to commit to it. And have been married for a looooong time so I guess I'm proof!
1	I've never been in love, but when it happens that the periodical wave of feelings comes along and reminds me about it, I do get the impression that if I did fall in love, it would be close to how it's described in the article - *Till the very end*.
6	ISTJs "the most abundant"? Really?	According to the 16Personalities breakdown of the ISTJ personality, we're supposed to be the most common, making up maybe 13% of the population. Does the community at large actually agree with this? I can only think of a handful of people I've known who I could say with some degree of certainty were ISTJs. It seems to be a good real less common than they postulate. Thoughts?
9	What I'm thinking is since we're quiet introverts and we try to avoid small talk and all, we just don't manifest ourselves at large.\n\nI can believe we're a bunch for real, we just don't yell it out loud for no reason.
4	A lot of those statistics are based on the original Myer-Briggs test, by my understanding. One of the major critiques of that test is that there is poor test-retest reliability -- people who are sorted into one type the first time they take the test are likely to be sorted into another type the second time. That makes sense, since it measures people on letter dichotomies, and splits the distribution down the middle. Someone who is balanced on what they measure as thinking or feeling could easily flip-flop between ISFJ and ISTJ, for instance.\n\nAll a long way of saying that there is no way that that test is accurate enough for those statistics to be particularly trustworthy.\n\nThat said, if I want to play devil's advocate, I'd ask whether you also knew a handful of INTPs, ENFPs, ISFPs, ESTPs, etc. -- if 13% of people are ISTJs, and your environment introduced no bias into the people you met, then out of 25 people you know, only 3 (and a quarter) would be ISTJ. So knowing a handful could actually be evidence in favor of us being the most plentiful, unless you know (and can type) a *lot* of people. :)
2	If those old statistics are true, I think culture has a big influence on how we perceive cognitive functions and correctly typing other ISTJs. Especially since ISTJs tend to become their role in their social group. \n\nOnline it won't seem like we're very common because everyone and their mother is an INXX.
1	There was a similar thread a while ago. From what I remember, there was no direct answer. The thing is, while there are no actual data aside from statistics, the 13% may still be fairly close to reality when we consider that ISTJs aren't exactly the most visible kind of people.\n\nI personally can think of only a few people who may be ISTJs, but I can't verify it.
1	There are tons of them on the internet. Most of the self proclaimed INTJs on r/INTJ and INTJ forums on the web are actually ISTJs. So you need to take into account that plenty of ISTJs are mistyped. In real life, they would be harder to spot since they are introverts and keep to themselves. 
1	My old class had a morals and work ethics module (weird system in my country) and one day our teacher made us try out the MBTI to learn about how different people worked. Out of 25 people, 6 were ISTJs, 8 were ISFJs, the rest of them were either SPs or SJs, only two of us ended up as iNtuitives. Me, an ENTP and my friend, an INFP. So yes, you guys are pretty common (not that it's a bad thing)
1	If that's true. WHERE ARE YOU GUYS!? 
5	Weekly Thread: What personality trait are you proud of?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: which personality trait(s) of yours are you proud of? What traits do people admire you for? \n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
11	Reliability and loyalty.
6	I'm personally proud of being punctual, to the point where I'll actually message people if I am to be late. I just think that sticking to a timing is important. I argued with an ENFP friend once because he could be 2 hours late without warning.\n\nI had a bunch of student jobs. All my bosses told me I did a great job, whatever it is, from delivery driver to worker in a wood mill.
3	ISTJ. Well, my intelligence is far above normal. And my time management skills are better than most. Pomodoro!
3	Adaptability to situations and persons around me
3	My honesty. This being said, it's also my worst trait.
4	ISTJs - What are your enneagram types?	As an ISTJ myself, I consider myself as a 5 on the enneagram, wing 6. However, I've often gotten a result of enneagram type 1 lately, and I've read that the 1 type is the most common among ISTJs. I've noticed that when I'm social, I'm more like a 1. But when I'm in my inner world, I'm more like a 5. And now I'm not sure what my enneagram type is. Is it 5 or 1? I don't know anymore... I also identify with 9's to some extent; I hate anger so much.\n\nSo... what's your enneagram type?\n\nEDIT: I tested as 5w6, and my tritype is apparently 538.
3	I'm Enneagram 5 -- used to think I was 5w4, but less sure as I've aged out of adolescence/young adulthood.\n\nEnneagram is characterized by your most basic and compulsive fears. If you had to ruin every part of your life except one, what would be that last thing you clung to? If you had to pick one terror you could avoid, but you have to experience all the rest, what would the *one and only terror* that you choose not to suffer? (Isolation and a loss of support? Excruciating and vivid suffering? Moral bankruptcy and failure? Chronic conflict and disturbance? Complete incompetence? Total submission to the control of others? Not a complete/rigorously developed list -- just to illustrate the point.)\n\nWould you lash away at yourself and others with puritanical fervor, and set yourself up as the judge of rightness and moral truth even if it drove everyone away from you, so that you could feel like you were morally correct and righteous person?\n\nWould you limit your life to a tiny sphere of activities that you are 100% sure of mastering, giving up everything that exposes you to risk or dependence on the outside world (e.g., joy, food, leisure, connection, creation, and the basic ability to function in life), just to make sure that you feel like you can master and control your small, stunted universe?\n\nWould you disconnect from your passions and drives, turn a blind eye to your problems, and avoid conflict until your life, identity, feelings, and passions were so fuzzy and out of focus that you became wandering, vague, dull, and blind, just to make sure that you can feel undisturbed and ensure that you never risk disturbing your relationships with others?\n\nIt is easiest to identify your Enneagram by looking at what you would be at in your filthiest, most despairing, most pathetic state. Think about what others would see you doing from outside, what they would say about you at your worst. The Enneagram takes a kind of pathology model when it comes to personality. It is all about the things that you fear so much that you would ruin other parts of your life just to avoid having that fear come true.
3	I just finished the test and I got 6w5. I'd be surprised if this one isn't the most common for ISTJs.
2	Definitely a Type 9. Holy shit, do I enjoy peace.\n\nMore specifically, 9w1. Definitely like to avoid conflict.
1	where to take this test?
1	1w9. I am very chill and mellow pretty much all the time
1	Hi fellow 5w6! I took the test half a year ago and just took it again, still 5w6. I sort of identify with both of them though, so I might as well be a 6w5.\n\nEdit: Well, I took the second test on this site: https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test.php and the result is 6w5.
1	I'm a phobic 6w5. My tritype is 6w5 - 3w4 - 1w2.\n\nFrom what I remember, Introverted Sensing dominants (ISTJs and ISFJs) have a strong correlation with enneagram type 6 because of the need for security.
1	Did a test last year. It gave me 5w6.\nI took it again today and got the same.
1	I took the classical version of the test and got 5w6.
1	I'm pretty sure I'm a 2w1.  \n\nEdit: I retook the test linked below and got the following: \nBased on your responses, your likely Enneagram tritype is: 2-6-1\nand your likely Enneagram tritype with wings is: 2w1-6w5-1w2\nYour overall type preference is:\ntype 2 (2w1) first, \ntype 6 (6w5) second, \nand type 1 (1w2) third.\n\nYour dominant body-based type is type 1 (1w2)\nYour dominant heart-based type is type 2 (2w1)\nYour dominant head-based type is type 6 (6w5)
17	Grammarly.com suggests introvert = narcissist?	
9	Whut the f**k??
5	savage.
4	It depends. My mother IS an introvert because she finds other people boring, stupid, incompetent, etc. and thinks she is so much better. She brags about it often. I truly think she would be extroverted if she wasn't so narcissistic. \n\nI am an introvert because I enjoy the quiet. I enjoy people too, but they drain me. Also social anxiety has been a constant for most of my life. 
2	Uh wow, no? 
8	How did you become interested in your chosen occupation (or field of interest)?	I'd like to learn about everyone's career paths:\n\nWhat's your occupation? How did you know you wanted to do it? What was the path that led you there? Where do you hope to go with your career?
6	I'm a programmer. Code just makes sense, it's logical and does exactly what you ask it to do.\n\nI'd like to get in the more systems engineering side which would be cool. 
3	I'm a student, finishing my master's degree in geography come autumn, so I can't really call it a career. I always plan ahead, trying to know what I will be doing years ahead. Not having a plan makes me really uncomfortable, it feels like walking into nothingness. In contrast, my change of plans are often very quick. Sometimes they were purely coincidental.\nFor example, a year ago, I applied for a job which I got. Unfortunately I had to back out again, because I changed some other plans, which meant that I wouldn't be available for the period of time that they needed me. I discussed the matter with them and they offered me another job on the spot, which I am now doing and which I absolutely love. \nI have learned that it is not only important to find the right job (as in tasks) to do, but to find the right people, too. So, when I find people that I really like working with, I try to stay close to them and continue working with them, because whatever we are going to do, it’s going to be good. I want to stay in science after I graduate and do a PhD. Sure, I thought about applying to universities in other countries (to get a different kind of experience) but why go away if I already know that I will like it here? \n\nOP, that is you occupation?\n
3	I was in college, majoring in television on, honestly, a whim. Had to take a seminar on video editing, and managed to solve several issues on the fly the instructor was having. He turned to me and said "why aren't you working for me?" and thus began my careen in video post production.
5	I liked guns and wanted to be a cop. \n\nGot a job at a gun range. Since I'm so good at remembering specs. I was the number 1 sales guy. \n\nAlso since I'm so good at remembering things I learned in gun classes, I started teaching. \n\nI got really good at shooting, and took more and more classes. \n\nEventually became Director of Training where I wrote and taught all advanced gun classes. \n\nGot hearing damage so cop thing got put on hold. \n\nThen left and started working for a private contracting company, and taught really cool gun stuff. \n\nThen got into knives. Similarly story. Teach edged weapons now too. \n\n\nAnd\n\nGot divorced and read the book THE GAME. Started working on my social and dating skills. Got really good. Met Neil Strauss and he offered me a job. \n\nAfter a few years I started my own company. \n\nSo I teach guys how to be cool, awesome, confident and how to attract women. \n\nAnd also how to protect themselves and their loved ones. \n\nBest job(s) in the world IMO!
2	I'm currently working in operations management and going back to school to pursue an education in industrial engineering. I really like everything I've learned in my experiences with the factory environment, but I want to acquire more skills in order to have influence on a greater scale. Furthermore, I want a job that is less oriented toward manipulating others psychologically (I don't find the motivation part of supervision to come naturally to me) and more oriented toward manipulating plans and processes. I have found that in my current work, doing "IE" sorts of mini-projects is always very fulfilling to me. I'm almost always better at saving costs by interacting with non-human elements.
2	* Emergency Medical Services: Wanted to help people, but was never sure how. Always thought being an EMT would be a good way to accomplish my mission. A good friend asked me to take the course with her, and I ended up loving it even more than I thought possible. I don't really hope to go anywhere with my EMS job, as I enjoy just being where I'm at (working part time, mostly on weekends). I was an officer for a while, but that nonsense is way too much work. \n\n* Firefighting: Got forced into the field when I moved to a new station. Ended up loving everything about it but the carcinogens (which there are a lot of). I'm happy being a simple run of the mill firefighter, and have no desire to climb the ladder (I'll show myself out)... \n\n* Medical Technologist: Eh, sounded like a good major to get into medical school with. Got burned out on school, and now I just work in a hospital lab. It pays the bills, and most days it's alright. Like my other two jobs, I just kind of want to keep doing what I'm doing. 
2	I work at Walmart as a Support Manager.\n\nI didn't really become interested in working in retail, per se. When I graduated High School, my mom told me that I wasn't sitting on my ass all summer, and to find a job. I found myself applying at Walmart, and got a position as an overnight stocker.\n\n9 years later, and i'm still there. Same store. It wasn't the way I planned it of course, but to be honest, i'm so comfortable working there that anything else would be just plain weird. I really don't know anything different. I've been fortunate enough to receive good benefits and was promoted to a Department Manager and now, my current position, as a Support Manager.\n\nWhere do I hope to go with my career? Well, i'm looking into applying for Assistant Managers positions in the company. Yeah, it's stressful and there are long hours, but it's what i'm used to. I actually took 2 years of Criminal Justice between 2007-2009, and unfortunately lost interest in the field. 
1	I am training to be a psychologist, and I've just always been interested in it. I got into the Enneagram around maybe 10th grade? I devoured a book on Borderline Personality Disorder around the same time. I impatiently waited for when I was in 11th grade so I could take AP Psychology.\n\nI was lucky in that sense, that I've always known what I want to study. Though actually applying psychology is another beast, and something I didn't consider until late college. I ended up going down a path that lets me choose between practice, research, and teaching -- I am leaning towards the latter two, now that I've found topics that interest me, and now that I've seen that I can enjoy teaching. \n\nI am a little less interested in practice -- the readings are fascinating, but I am not sure it would be a good fit for me. At least as a full-time profession, I feel like it would be a lot of responsibility to take in others' lives, and would not give me the kind of freedom to set my schedule that I desire. (For instance, when you have clients who see you for mental health concerns, you can't plan a 2 week trip to somewhere else without significant planning and consideration for how they'll be cared for.)
1	Happenstance.
1	Going into asset management hopefully to become a large portfolio manager down the road. Preference has always been to the big name firms because of reputation and guarantee of quality as opposed to starting off in a boutique AM firm. \n\nI knew I wanted it because finance is pure numbers and strategy (i also love military history). Although I know that there is the office politics game that needs to be played, I have learned that beyond all, performance is what you can hang your hat on at the end of the day. \n\nThere are of course many schools and applications of finance. The ones that appeal to me are the tried and true 'fundamentals' based approach used by great investors like Warren Buffet or Ken Fisher. In short, don't chase sexy stocks. Buy only fundamentally good stocks (healthy balance sheets and products) when cheap. Invest for the long run (completely opposite of day trading).
1	I'm currently in school studying psychology and statistics. Psychology is super interesting, but I think I could actually make a career out of stats because I'm not as good with the whole emotional support thing. Maybe I'll get into research. I'm not sure what I'll end up doing, but I just want a job with a regular schedule and a livable pay that I don't hate going to.
9	Weekly Thread: How do you recharge?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: How do you recharge after lengthy social interactions? What tips would you give to ISTJ'ers who get exhausted quickly by social interactions?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
5	After social events, especially if I'm going to be around new people, I need me time. Whether it's reading, running or playing a video game... I just need to maintain minimal human contact for a little while until I have the energy to be around new people again.
6	When I have time to myself to recharge, I have two go-to activities: \n\nI usually need some intense focus on something that's not too stimulating. Most often, reading on my phone or playing some resource management game. \n\nMy mood is often affected by music, so if I'm just in need of a quick pick-me-up, then singing and dancing around to a song that I love is helpful.\n\nAt social events, when there's less time/opportunity to recharge, I have a number of tactics:\n\nI try to research some conversation point on my phone (gives me a reason to tune out without being a complete jerk).\n\nI ask for a job to do, so I can focus on that instead of the social aspect. \n\nI try to find one person with whom I can really easily talk about stuff that we both find stimulating (I find this less draining).\n\nBarring all that, I go hide in the bathroom for a few minutes or seek a couple of moments outside. 
3	I like to go driving with no particular destination in mind or to areas in my region where I haven't been before or are not familiar with. I love to explore and for me it helps to clear my head and makes me feel relaxed as I tend to get tense and stressed during lengthy social interactions.\n\nIts even better when its in the middle of the night where there's no traffic or if im on a non-busy open highway.\n\n
3	I recharge by going home, taking a hot shower (regardless of the time of day), and either playing Terraria, Fallout, or GTA. If I'm not in a video gamey mood, I'll just browse reddit and tumblr, or listen to music. Notice, I will tend to be in a separate room from the rest of my family. \n\nOn a side note, I love these weekly threads!
3	I listen to music or to white noise, go to the spa, watch a movie, nap.  That is a perfect day :)
3	I sit at home with my wife watching Netflix, listen to music, play guitar, or browse Reddit. 
3	I need alone time too. That means playing video games, bass guitar, listening to music, watching TV shows, avoiding conversations. After one day of alone time I am productive as fuck.\n\nMy girlfriend's an ENFJ and she understands I need alone time and she's cool with that, as she likes to read and watch her own shows on Netflix and stuff like that (plus ENFJs like to make sure their loved ones are okay)
3	I like to go walking or running. Doesn't matter where, and sometimes it's fun to just go someplace random and walk or run and see a part of the towns around you that you never knew existed. Same with driving and singing along to the radio and just forgetting other things exist. And sleeping - sleeping always helps.
2	When I've been around friends/acquaintances for too long, i'll either just take it easy and program something trivial, not work or school related, with my dog at my feet, or go to one of the local secluded lakes and relax/read a book.
2	Video games, or a book if I can find one that is engaging enough
2	I like to browse YouTube videos and watch interesting, "how it's works / how it's made" type videos. If I'm in the mood (usually I'm) I'm listening to music. Reading books also a good time killing activity for me.
7	Weekly Thread: How do you feel about team settings?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: how do you find yourself interacting in team settings? What role do you play in group dynamics?\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like!
6	[deleted]
4	I'm happy to be part of a team, but my preference is for my work to be solitary. Meaning, I love contributing to a group and helping us all achieve our goals, but I need time alone to make that happen. \n\nI only take lead when I see that it won't happen otherwise. I can't stand a rudderless ship. But even then, I try to lead by asking others what they would do.
3	The role I usually play in a group dynamic is a vanguard...\n\nAll jokes aside I tend to avoid them wherever possible however I often find myself dividing the task up into segments and delegating to group members while foolishly trying to do the majority myself to avoid having to communicate my ideas. The benefit of this is that I am free to chose the better tasks.\n\nAfter the (usually) useless group members return with their stuff I compile it and format it which the most fun part before going through all of their work and fixing grammar errors, checking facts and making edits while making sure I understand what they have said so that I know if I am ever asked questions about it or required to present it.
3	Not a fan of team settings.  I manage, but would prefer to work alone.  \nI surprised myself however, when I was part of a "sharing circle" and I enjoyed that.  That was more personal though, I liked that everyone took turns speaking and no one monopolized the conversation.
2	Almost all of my work in college was done in "teams" as the university believe that business majors would be best prepared for the working world where teamwork and synergy were the norm. This made sense in theory but was devastating in procedure because it never worked as intended.\n\nIn my job, I worked on different teams based on locations: a local office team, a regional team, and a global team. Much better experience than college, but still cumbersome for someone who would rather work alone.
2	I'm at the point in my schooling where my classes are all AP, so everyone is smart. Usually, when we do a group project, I will let the other members of my group come up with ideas while I jot down my own and then offer them to the group. I'm usually the one to throw in easily forgettable facts and individual events, while they focus on main ideas.
2	Even though I don't look forward to working in teams, I find myself to be a "good" teammember. I think ahead, adapt to the task, the other teammates, and I try to make things go as smoothly as possible. (People who disturb this harmony are why I dislike teamwork.) I don't take the lead unless noone else takes it or unless I have the best knowledge needed for that particular task. Or, to put it in sports terms, I prefer giving the assists rather than scoring myself. I'm always afraid that I'm too controlling as a group leader. 
2	I used to do a lot of teamwork at university.\n\nMy friends were mostly extroverts, so they would delegate stuff and I always thought it made sense.\n\nBasically I was just waiting to get my part to go work on it by myself, making sure it's the best part of the project. I considered my teammates to be reliable enough so I trusted them in what they were doing.\n\nI usually was the one in charge of putting stuff together too, like Word formatting, Power Point, etc.\n\nI was the only one always showing up to class, and I've been tagged as the "student most useful to his peers" because I'd get extra info for exams and projects just by showing up to class.
15	How do you approach Religion?	Is it hard to have faith in something collectively seen around the world as true vs. there's no evidence of any of it. Grew up Catholic, gone on and off to Evangelical Free church, now wife started going to Church of Christ... not sure how I feel. \n\n
15	I'm one that only believes something that there is objective proof of. I know there is no proof one way or another, but I'd still say I'm an Agnostic Athiest. \n\nIf there ever is actual proof of a God, of course I'll believe it. However, someone's testimony of it (e.g. family/friend's personal story of experiencing God, or those movies about a person's story) is not objective proof. \n\nI'm also not a complete Athiest, as I can't find any definite proof that there is no higher power. It seems more likely with the technology we have that we evolved, but like /u/TweaktheReaper said, that could change. We might have proof one way or the other in the future, or maybe not, who knows. 
14	Evidence in something that is currently immeasurable is subjective. There was a time when no one could measure electricity, but that didn't mean it didn't exist. And I'm positive there are things which we cannot measure today but will be able to in the next 10, 20, 50 years, which will revolutionize science. We likely still have several thousand lifetimes of research and science left before we'll truly unlock the secrets of the universe, so until then, there is just as much proof for God as there is against Him, because literally nothing can be proven. From there it's a matter of perspective. Was that job promotion that came just in time for your car to break down so you could actually afford to fix it a coincidence, or someone looking out for you? What about that time you lost your wallet and someone who wasn't an asshole actually returned it to you, cash and all, when they could have stolen everything you had? Or that time when you hit your brakes just in time to avoid an accident? \n\n\nCoincidence, or helper? Perspective is what matters here, faith, not proof.
7	I don't approach. I rather run away whilst laughing. 
5	There're still things that can't be explained by current scientific knowledge, so I think being agnostic is the most reasonable position to take.
5	I've always been attracted to the idea, but I haven't been able to be convinced, and just having faith never quite worked. It makes me think of the following quote by Alan Watts, in the [Wisdom of Insecurity](http://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Insecurity-Alan-W-Watts-ebook/dp/B005YNPBH0/).\n\n>For man seems to be unable to live without myth, without the belief that the routine and drudgery, the pain and fear of this life have some meaning and goal in the future. [...] Once there is the suspicion that a religion is a myth, its power has gone. It may be necessary for man to have a myth, but he cannot self-consciously prescribe one as he can mix a pill for a headache. A myth can only "work" when it is thought to be truth, and man cannot for long knowingly and intentionally "kid" himself.\n\nI tend to view religious practices/concepts as ways of communicating and working with the irrational, emotional, symbol-driven parts of the psyche. So I tend to adopt them when I want to, understanding them as psychological tools rather than descriptions of an objective truth. Plus, I've always had a taste for good atmosphere.\n\nTake the example of drawing a Tarot card each day. Of course, the card is almost certainly random. At the same time, each card represents a set of rich ideas, concepts, and archetypes. There are far worse things to do as a way of fostering mindfulness, self-examination, and balance than to contemplate a random, complex symbol each day, week, or whatever. I don't have to believe it is inherently meaningful to *make* it meaningful. And to the extent it then impacts my life, it is "real" in the sense that matters to me.\n\nBasically, I view specific religious practices as tools and prompts for self-development. I can't believe in something I am not sure about. But I can appreciate the positive impacts that can come from having faith. For instance -- if believing you are cared about and worthy gives you the energy to do something positive for yourself or your environment, awesome! If speaking to an idealized internal image of all the traits you aspire to helps you maintain your integrity and keep in touch with your higher goals, great! There are parts of the brain that are easily tricked, and that will respond to a deeply-imagined idea as if it were reality. Why not capitalize on that?
4	I believe in God but I think organized religion is for the weak-minded.
5	> How do you approach religion?\n\nWith caution
7	The logician in me believes there is no such thing as gods.  I have  little respect for something that has caused man to kill each other because my god is more loving that your god.\n\nThat said, if you want to believe something that gives you peace of mind and are NOT hurting someone or judging them, have at it.  Just don't preach to me.  Respect my wishes and I'll respect yours.\n\nI was raised in a Protestant Democratic household and ended up a Republican Atheist with a Libritarian Wiccan sister.  Go figure.\n\nI have friends that are Wiccan, Christian, Catholic, Buddhist, Lutheran, and Church of England.  And the funniest thing, whenever my friends have moral issues, they all come to the Atheist.
3	I'm a pentecostal Christian and thoroughly enjoy my faith. I believe that I've experienced God and church gives me an excuse to get out of the house. 
3	Was born into Christianity but don't practice any more. What led to me "straying" was the fact that other religions also have their own beliefs which fascinated me as they seemed so committed.\n\nEvery religion claims to be the way and true practice. They all claim that their own religion is superior to others. I find it ridiculous because since every religion claims this then no religion is valid.\n\nAs regards to gods, I won't say they do or don't exist as there's no proof to support either theory. This has made me stay neutral on religion as I only believe in what I can see or what has been proven to exist (fact).\n\n**TL;DR: I don't believe in religion and I'm indifferent to the existence of gods.**\n\nPS: English isn't my first language so bear with me.   
3	Religion is such a big thing in the African American community that at this point as an ex-Christian Baptist, now Atheist, just thinking about religion and how it keeps people timid and ignorant makes me very angry. Whenever my father tries to help me, he tells me to have faith and just assumes everything will turn out fine. I've had to figure things out the hard way because of this, because I get no guidance at all.\n\nI believe that there are no gods. No gods that religions talk about. There is no god that looks, acts, and thinks like a human. No male deities obsessed with foreskins and female submission. No deities with soap operas of mythologies. If there is a "god" it is an unfeeling source of energy that can't be personified.
2	I think it's natural for humans to want to find out where they came from, what the origins of life are, and if there is anything "greater" out there. I think it's natural in the absence of evidence to attribute the ways things are to a god. The "T" in our personality profile is "Thinking;" I can't logically think that there is a deity running the universe without evidence. When you add the awful things that people do or say in the name of their god or religion, I am completely turned off
2	Because there aren't any facts pointing towards the existence of a deity/deities, I am an atheist. But because there aren't any facts pointing towards the nonexistence of any deity/deities, I am agnostic. However, I would say that belief in God is somewhat separate from religion. R\n\neligion is more a set of rules that results from the belief. Of course, lacking said belief I have little reason to assign value to the rules that result from it, but even if one believes in God the idea of worshipping such an entity seems odd to me. Sure, thankfulness for creation is in order, but certainly there are issues the need correcting that a deity could correct but has not.
1	I don't mind religion, I support those who are religious, but I don't partake myself. 
1	Even though I'm a Christian (or at least try to be) I think the world would be better without organized religion or a set of "requirements" that you have to fulfill in order to be a part of said religion....i'll tell ya why...\n\nOkay..I was raised Catholic. I was baptized, made my first Holy Communion, and was confirmed. I grew up very, very involved in the Church and Youth Group. I actually met my wife at a retreat (known as a "fourth day" retreat or movement) for High School aged students. She was raised Methodist.\n\nAs I got older and married my wife (we got married at her Church) we started attending a local non-denominational Church in our area. She was interested in going to a Catholic Church, and to be honest, I found myself disagreeing with alot of the Catholic Churches practices- for example, only actual Catholics are supposed to receive the communion. I also don't really thing confession is necessary, and I don't really believe in the consecration of the wine and bread.\n\nAs of late, we've been slacking on our Church-going. We haven't gone since last year. I work as a manager, and sometimes have to work on Sundays- it's also my wife and I's only day off together when I don't work, and we just like to do things together, by ourselves.\n\nTo be honest, there are a lot of things that I find myself not aligning with the view of "Christianity" in general. My wife and I fully support LGBT people, and would have no problem with them getting married in a Church. I also have no problem hanging around people who just aren't Christian at all. We also believe that the Bible, while still relevant, needs to be interpreted, you can't take everything in it seriously. It has come to the point where I think alot of Christians claim to be one every Sunday, but the rest of the week, they are far from it. I see alot of "Christians" who make it seem like they are better than everyone else. That really annoys me.\n\nSo, I guess what i'm saying is that you don't always have to go to Church every Sunday, or read the Bible front to back to be a "Christian". My wife and I still believe in God, and try our best to live out his lifestyle, but yes, we listen to bad music, watch Game of Thrones, rated "R" movies, and hang around LGBT people.
1	Skeptical. I distance myself from it and don't trust organized religion. I do believe people have the right believe what they want as long as they're not harming others, though, and I think a lot of spirituality can be helpful...so I have no problem with other people practicing their own religion.  \n\nPersonally, though, I'm an atheist.
3	Which type are most compatible with?	I know there are plenty of relationship posts on this subreddit, but there haven't been any new ones for a while. I find it easier for myself to interact with IxTJ types. It's interesting to hear some stories and feedbacks about ISTJ-ISTJ and ISTJ-INTJ relationship. What difficulties arise and of course positive parts?
5	Never been in an actual relationship, but the closest friend I have is an INTJ.\n\nUsing the same kind of thinking with different ways of fueling it gives us the ability to stay on the same wavelength while providing different points of view. We both evaluate them and try to come to an agreement. Yes, it does lead to arguments sometimes, but those are rare and they are never heated. I'm pretty sure it's because of other parts of our personalities. Those which MBTI does not describe. If it wasn't for that, our friendship would probably have ended a long time ago.\n\nAll in all, we supplement each other rather well. I gain access to new ideas and novelty while he gains another analytic view and support when trying to make those ideas real. It's like a symbiosis.
3	I was in a long-term relationship with an INTJ. We made excellent friends when I was growing up: Both women who were not really into traditionally feminine activities, and who were more inclined towards harsh logic over squishy feelings. (Of course, we both still had squishy feelings, and neither of us dealt with them particularly well; but that became another point of connection.)\n\nAt first, the Si-Ne versus Ni-Se seemed to work well. I was the lighter, goofier, friendlier one between us, and it seemed to relax her and get her to play and have fun. However, she was more mature than I was (due to age and life experiences), and we eventually began to clash because of that. The worst of the conflict could fit into Si-Ne versus Ni-Se. I wanted to discuss what we both understood and wanted, and I tried to prepare how I thought she might be feeling so we could discuss. She wanted to fight, struggle, and clash. It was unsatisfying for her that I would close off when she'd try to fight, and it was frustrating for me that she wanted me to try to verbally spar with her, seemingly so she'd have an excuse to unleash on me?\n\nThat said, I don't think that would have become an issue as much if we had not gotten so out of sync on the other stuff. Though now that I've lived alone for a while, I can't imagine we'd share a life as easily. I have caught up a good deal in terms of maturity, but I also have my own ways of doing things, and I think that there could be some Te-on-Te clash.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for ISTJ-ISTJ, I suspect my advisor is an ISTJ. If so, he is definitely of the more concise and disciplined variety (at least over text -- he can go on with the best of them in person!). Very supportive when I was struggling. The difficulty I run into is that he is very hands-off and not interested in micromanaging (understandably), and I am really really terrible at knowing how or when to ask for help. That puts distance between us. \n\nAlso, both of us are emotionally reserved and tend towards being polite and tactful -- and I think both of us loosen up and relax much more when around someone else who is more outgoing, uninhibited, etc. So sometimes things can be really formal -- though there seems to be an understanding still. I also sometimes get the sense that my neurotic habits might rub him the wrong way. Sometimes because they're against his ways (e.g., procrastination), and sometimes because they're a younger, less experienced, more ridiculous version of some of his own neuroticisms (e.g., excessive attention to detail, over-completion of tasks). Overall, though, he's one of my primary role models and someone I admire a great deal.
3	INTP who loves ISTJs, I could listen to any ISTJ talk for hours. unfortunately ISTJs (STJs) tend to avoid me :(
3	My husband, best friend, and last person I fell in love with are all INTJs. I just get along with them really well and I love how they think and play. Clever people are funny people.
1	I think that ESTJ+ISTJ could potentially work
1	I'm drawn to extraverted feelers. They counterbalance my tendencies well and they seem to have this more human element that's so attractive to me. My most significant and compatible romantic relationship was with an ESFJ, and my second most was with an INFJ. What made the second one ultimately fail was a lack of a strong initiator in the relationship, so I'm looking in the future to someone who can balance my introversion.
3	ISTJ here - According to a website, ISTJs are the most compatible with ESTPs and ESFPs. Is this true? If so, can this be a good way to know what to look for in a partner?	
7	There are other sites that will say we clash horribly with ESTPs, on account of having the same function order with opposite orientations (Si-Te versus Se-Ti), and will say that ENFPs are our ideal match (same functions, but we're each strong and able to cover the areas where the other person is weaker).\n\nMBTI describes one of *many* ways you can conflict or be compatible with someone else. For instance, as an introvert, an ISTJ may prefer another introvert versus an extrovert who wants to get involved with/experience the external world. Another ISTJ may actually want someone to push them outside of their comfort zone by dragging them on adventures or getting them involved in social circles or other projects. Another example: As a type that leads with a perceiving function, one ISTJ may prefer another perceiving lead, who demonstrates similar openness to information (internal or external), instead of being led by a more judging approach. Whereas another ISTJ may appreciate a partner who has a more structured, judging-oriented lead function, to provide direction and structure to their environment and dealings.\n\nThat is all aside from the other ways you can conflict or be compatible -- worldview, physical attraction, sexual compatibility, desired lifestyle (e.g., kids or not, monogamous or not), and so on. (Most of which can be dealt with if there is enough motivation and commitment to work together/communicate on both sides.)
5	I don't think that's very true, from what I see, ISTJs tend to be pretty neutral towards Se types and vice-verse, on the extreme side, Si types are disdainful towards Se actions, and Se types find Si types boring.\n\nThe people that say this are basing it off of David Keirsey's opinion, which was *originally* that opposite types get along, but he decided that Ns go with Ns. I think that last bit is rubbish though, his first line of reasoning makes far more sense and seems to hold true in my experience and is supported by socionics compatibility, which suggests that ISTJs and ENFPs get along best. I generally see that the ENFPs want to be with a person that is loyal, dependable, witty, grounded and stoic (they think these people are INTJs though - they follow that Keirsey idea, they don't seem to think S types are as *interesting* as Ns... yeah. edit: Oh, and I have heard it said before that a lot of /r/ENFP might be ESFPs too, so it's probably not the best source :P). \n\nI don't think it is a thoroughly entrenched correlation though, there are a lot of other factors, and you can easily get along superfluously with all sorts of types, hell you might hate certain NFPs.
3	Honestly, what makes "compatibility" is merely if you are able to appreciate the similarities and differences of the other person. \n\nWhat is described up there is a duality relationship (complete opposite types, would *theoretically* push each other to maximum personal growth), but that isn't as perfect as Socionics would describe. Duality relationships are hard to start and often hard to maintain - opposites may attract, but they would also clash violently. Certainly, they can also be very fulfilling relationships if effort is put in. \n\nMBTI should be used as a means to better understand and work with people, not as a means of judging people and relationships.
4	People are too varied to be able to say that. I'm not sure what website said that, but it's bullshit.
2	My partner is definitely ESFP. We get along almost all of the time, except I have noticed that when there is a disconnect between us, it's because I'm more logical whereas they're more emotional and creative. 
10	Weekly Thread: What frustrates you about being an ISTJ?	Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's topic is: What frustrates you about being an ISTJ, either in terms of how you're perceived by others, or any shortcomings you may have struggled with? \n\n\nPlease remember to keep discourse civil and respectful, but other than that, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like! 
31	The whole overthinking everything to the brink of anxiety is starting to get really old 
30	An inability to effectively express emotions/put them in to words.
23	Everyone thinks that you are organised. And the general stereotype that ISTJs are boring people. 
7	I'm most frustrated by my inability to see broad interconnections between things. I can see connections, but they're weak Ne-style connections. \n\nI do communications work, and it often requires big-picture thinking that sees trends coming and understands how two (or more) seemingly dissimilar things affect one another. Basically, I wish I had more access to Ni. \n\nI find that with inferior Ne, the future is just too much of a blank space for me. I feel like anything could happen, so I just default back to what I know, and I miss out on strategic opportunities.\n\nIt's especially frustrating for me because my husband is an ENTJ, and seeing those patterns just comes so naturally to him. It's like watching someone do my job accidentally and having them do it better than me. 
9	That I'm *present in reality* only when my knowledge and/or skills can be put into good use. For the rest of the time, I'm *phased out* and live in my own domain.
6	My problem is everyone assuming I'm a "know-it-all"  or saying something to someone immediately when they try and change something that's currently going on, that I have planned. When in reality I'm not a "know-it-all" I just remember a lot and enjoy learning.
5	[deleted]
4	Having less type-specific ISTJ stuff (in terms of quantity, complexity, depth) to read and consume. Which goes hand-in-hand with frustration at the more reductive stereotypes that are out there. Especially the negative ones, but even the positive ones can be frustrating. I wouldn't be surprised if a well-raised ISTJ grew up to fit many of the more positive stereotypes, but I certainly don't. :/ \n\nAlso the background that underlies those stereotypes: That structured (or structure-seeking) individuals are less intelligent or thoughtful, whereas being scattered and procrastinatory means you just have so much potential that the system can't hold you down, man! ISTJs are never really described as struggling with anything except being kind of cold, pedantic assholes who are sometimes too hard on themselves and others. Surely we have more range than that.\n\nOne thing I struggle with is the sense that I turn what could be a pleasant, casual encounter, where someone shares some tidbit with me, into an interrogation/nitpicking of what they shared. I will get interested and want to understand it -- which usually means examining/turning my skepticism on it. I have the strong sense that it probably comes off as either critical/rejecting of the tidbit, or -- if I get excited and ask a question they can't answer -- as dismissive of the tidbit, or of them for not having more information about it.\n\nI am still not great at catching myself in the moment -- though even when I do, I struggle between expressing interest in a non-superficial way (i.e., more than "oh, cool"), and yet without going quite as far as I sometimes do.
3	I cannot understand any of the emotional themes I have to write about for various English assessments. I am a good student but unless somebody tells me I can never pick themes because in my mind they are all just separate events.
3	My curiosity will often lead to debating. My questioning of reasoning in these conversations often makes me look like a smart-ass. And then of course others take it personally and loose reality in their mess of feelings.\n\n*I just want to understand your point of view... I never said you were wrong!* (Unless you were wrong, then you were wrong.) 😑
3	Because I'm fairly quiet and feel okay calling people out when their facts are incorrect, because I like when people do that for me, people see me as stuck-up, an asshole, even "that /edgy/ kid" which makes me laugh my ass off. I knit, bake brownies and drink tea ffs. 
2	People saying that they want honesty and consistency. But yet when you try to socialize or make an acquaintance with someone they blow you off like they never wanted to talk to you to begin with. Even if you have good intentions from the beginning. Or just socializing in general, I hate people. 
10	How important is harmony to you, and why?	I know a desire for harmony is typically seen as something characteristic of Fe, but I feel like it can sometimes be even more of a desire in certain types with Fi. Thoughts? Even if you don't care about the cognitive functions, I'd still be interested in hearing your opinions.
14	For me it's a matter of practicality. I'm pretty uncaring, truth be told, but happy people are often more effective people. This matters in both the workplace and the home. Plus, making things more "harmonious" is the most morally upright of all manipulation tactics, so I approve of it.
15	As an ISTJ, I can relate to Ash	
14	Favorite Youtube channels?	Just wondering what channels we watch on youtube. Maybe we'll find a new channel to enjoy from sharing.\n\nI like Filthy Frank.
8	theneedledrop\n\nh3h3productions
7	Papa Franku is a classic. I really enjoy SeaNanners. Been watching a lot of Sky Williams and Anklespankin lately.
3	h3h3, idubbzzz, YourMovieSucks, Vice, casually explained, BroScienceLife, Jon Lajoie, VGDunkey
3	Roadkill, backyard scientist, red hot nickel ball
3	I really dislike Youtube. I think it must appeal to some people, but it's most often sloppy or tacky.
3	I watch an awful lot of Jacksfilms. The wacky and abrupt jokes that he makes are really well-written. [Here's one of my favourite clips.](https://youtu.be/x8DtojIWZC4t=0m43s)

13	ISTJs and Money	How do you all approach money? Budgeting? Fun stuff? Saving?\n\nI would categorize myself as a control freak with money - I manage it quite well, but obsess over it too, down to the last penny. And I'm not one to spend frivolously, because I would feel guilty and over-analyze it later. \n\nHow about you? 
25	Save it. Always analyze it. Money is freedom.
14	Huh, I must be a terrible ISTJ. I spend an excessive amount of money. Compared to my friends, not so much, but I'm constantly self conscious and guilty by how much I spend on tech and food budget
6	The four spreadsheets in my "Finance" Google Drive folder tell enough of the story; a budget, credit card expenditure, home loan repayments and a stock market portfolio.
4	Spend once in a while. Save some for upcoming plans. Enjoy my toys, but budget still basically.
3	Always budgeted judiciously, saved as much as possible, lucky now in retirement to have way more than needed. Time now to give it away...judiciously, of course!
4	Save save save. Spend little. I don't use my checkbook but I should... I rely on looking at my transactions online.
3	probably the one thing that makes me least like an ISTJ.  I DGAF about money.  There's no budget, and I don't worry.  I'm diligent about paying my bills on time at least.
2	I must be a terrible ISTJ in this department. I kind of don't even really know what's going on with my finances most of the time. I do a monthly "what I spent" spreadsheet, but no budgeting whatsoever. I think it might be because I share finances with my spouse. I can't control a joint effort. I also don't have a predictable income. Most of the time I'm flying by the seat of my pants in the finance department. I feel bad about it :( 
2	i give myself a 1 week rule (normally a 3 day rule). If i still want it after 1 week I'll buy it....but usually that prolongs itself to 1 month. \n\n
1	Save up until spending slowly or in one burst.
1	I save my money. Sure, I do spend money on unnecessary things, but there is always a safety buffer in case I need it later or for emergencies. I'm not sure if this is stemming from my personality or if I learned this "hoarding" strategy from playing video games :) 
1	I'm pretty cheap with most things. But I tend to save it. 
5	Do ISTJs not get along with other ISTJs?	As an ISTJ student who has a (I'm guessing based on his personality) ISTJ teacher, we just don't get along. Discussions between us often lead to "I don't care" or just getting onto me. And I'm normally a good student. I just feel that this teacher has an anger management problem (normal for ISTJs?). Is this experience normal?
6	Personalities cannot really be accurately reduced to four dimensions.  There are all sorts of reasons why two personalities might conflict that have little or nothing to do with Myers-Briggs.  \n\n
5	I'm an ISTJ and though I haven't met any other ISTJs explicitly (I mean, some people in my life might be, but it's not like I ask them, because not a lot of people know about this personality categorization thing) I pretty much get along with everyone. I'm pretty quiet anyway which tends to help with that.\n\nYour teacher can be an ISTJ and still be a jerk, so I would assume it's something like that.
2	In my social circle, I think I have only 1 or 2 ISTJ friends that I know of.  If there are others, they're more distant friends, likely.  I dunno, I appreciate the SJ structure and reliability, but I tend to have very many FP type friends.  They tend to help me relax and process my emotions better.  So I wouldn't say I don't get along with ISTJs... I just prefer to be around more relaxed people.  Being in an environment with too many up tight folk makes me feel stiff and formal.
2	I live with another ISTJ and we clash with each other more than anyone else does. We both have fairly clear ideas about the right thing to do or the right way of going about doing something, but quite often they're different.
1	Most of my good friends are istj, we can relate to each other well 
1	I actually am an ISTJ student with someone I believe to be an ISTJ advisor; we get along well. I am still behind on some self-management techniques that are usually better-developed in ISTJs my age. But he is encouraging, patient, and objective.\n\nWhat makes you type your teacher as ISTJ? Is there any chance you are seeing an ineffective/blunt use of inferior functions as a result of high stress? For instance, I've heard that stressed INFPs can use inferior Te in an illogical, angry, self-serving way. They feel like all the facts line up and support the objective truth of their Fi-based values, but they aren't actually being logical at all. Could it be anything like that?\n\nOf course, like /u/mrs__whatsit pointed out -- he could just be an ISTJ who is also a jerk. It doesn't seem to me like it would be a necessary thing that ISTJs would not get along with other ISTJs (though differences when it comes to how situations are viewed, or Te-motivated struggles for control could be a source of conflict).
1	I've found I get along with ISTJs when we agree or are working towards a similar goal - it's very no-nonsense and things get accomplished quickly. However, when viewpoints differ, the clash can be quite intense and difficult to work around.
13	Introducing Weekly Threads!	In an effort to get more constructive discussion going, we're introducing weekly threads, every Sunday starting April 24th! We're aiming to have a new topic every week, although we'll definitely re-use popular topics so that the conversation keeps flowing. We'll try to cover areas such as relationships, education, careers, hobbies, and travelling, to name a few. \n\nIf you have any specific topics that you'd like to see discussed, or rules that you'd like to see implemented, please message the mods and we'll try to implement it! We look forward to hearing from you next Sunday, during our first weekly thread! \n\n\n\n
9	LOL.  This is so perfectly ISTJ.  :)
2	Sounds great! Marking the date.
2	I like this idea! This is definitely one of my favorite subs. 
1	Great idea!
9	How do you experience your functions?	Given that (statistically) there are so many of us ISTJs, I think it would be interesting to explore some of the similarities/differences in the ways we use and experience our functions (Si>Te>Fi>Ne).\n\nFor example: what does Introverted Sensing mean for you? How do two or more functions work together? What does it mean for you to be in the grip of inf NE or stuck in a loop of Si-Fi?
2	Since I'm most fascinated by perceiving functions, I'll get the ball rolling (hopefully) with my Si-Ne.\n\nHow Si works for me:\nOne thing I've noticed is that I have a really hard time accessing my memories of something unless someone/something jogs my memory. It could be a quick image, a phrase, a conversation, and then I can sort of turn on a movie projector in my mind and re-watch much (if not all) of the memory. \n\nIf I tried to sit down and remember stories from my childhood, then I would only remember one or two, but if you say me down with a few old mementos, then the stories would flow (even if not related to the objects).\n\nI notice that I use my Ne to help activate my Si. When I'm trying to maintain a conversation and don't know what to talk about, then I look around me, and a leaf that I see might remind me about an article I read about tree frogs, and then Si/Te take over and I turn into a walking academic lecture. \n\n
1	My Te and Fi are at constant war, particularly in personal romantic relationships.  The struggle is real.\n\nI will *think* something is socially correct and that it's what I *should* do in the situation based on social norms and common sense (Te at work).  But I will *feel* that something else is morally correct and that's what I *want* to do based on my morals (Fi at work).  Usually, I'll try to do the socially correct thing, then end up back tracking and doing the morally correct then, then trying to do the socially correct thing and the morally correct thing... and I come off as an indecisive nut.  :D \n\nEdit: Clarification
14	Susan Cain's "Quiet"	How many here have read her book on introverts?
4	Great book - my extrovert friend read it too (required reading for our english class), and she felt thoroughly attacked though :/\n\nEdit: I said though twice and it bugged me.
2	I haven't read this one, but I've read "The Introvert Advantage" by Marti Olsen Laney. \n\n[Edit for atrocious grammar] Could anyone that's read both books compare/contrast them? Is the content very different? Writing styles?
1	I have, although it's been a few years. I loved it -- I read it at a time when I was really frustrated by being an introvert, and it helped me see the benefits. Probably worth re-reading for me!
1	Currently reading it for the first time and I am really enjoying it.
1	I finished it 2 months back. It has really helped me understand myself. A lot of things about my life suddenly made much more sense. It's also how I got more into MBTI. 
1	Going to go against the grain a bit here. It's been a while since I've read it and I only made it about halfway, so I apologize if I'm off a bit.  \nI remember feeling like the majority of the content was cherry-picked to fit her message. It also felt exaggerated; I can see why u/EosEnthusiast's friend felt attacked. I went in hoping for some positive feels but to me it lacked authenticity. Maybe it could have cited more science (perhaps it did in the parts I missed). Just my opinion.  \nEdit: Just realized I'm super late to the party. Oops, new to the sub :) 
11	ISTJ political leanings	Since finding this sub, I feel almost as if I have found my clan. I have found so many similarities between myself and the rest of you that sometimes it's eerie. Thanks for being here!\n\nNow, I'm not trying to open some crazy political debate, (as much as we would all probably enjoy it,) I'm just curious in which direction do you guys tend to lean. \nI know for me, I am liberal on social issues because I feel people should be treated fairly and be able to make their own choices as long as they don't harm others, but I am fiscally conservative and don't agree with over-spending. I also tend to be respectful of others people's rights to have their own views and ideas. I guess that makes me relatively Libertarian.\n\n I just wondered where the rest of you fall on our (USA) political spectrum?
13	I am extremely liberal on social issues and tend to be more libertarian on economic issues. 
9	Much more fiscally conservative, very socially liberal. What someone does in their own back yard is none of my business. We all have the right to pursue happiness as we see it, provided it does not harm another individual. 
7	I'm so far to the left I don't know that I can go any further (though I'm IxTJ), but you should take into account that Reddit in general is fairly liberal.\n\n
4	Here in Canada, we have three major players ordered in increasing liberalness: the conservatives, the liberals, and the new democratic party (NDP).  Each of our parties are more liberal than the American conservatives.  I think our conservatives are closer to the American democrats than the Republicans.\n\nI usually lean towards the liberals, since I find the conservatives too corrupt and against Canadian values, but I think the NDP want to spend too irresponsibly.  In the American system, I'm a fan of Ralph Nader.\n\nEdit: One could argue that the Green party is also a major player since they participated in several debates during the last election.  They would be even more liberal than the NDP.
4	Right-leaning libertarian.\n\nMy views in order of importance:\n\n1. Economic: Very conservative. Believe in small businesses and believe government involvement with big corporate lobbying is what's wrong with our economy. Believe downsizing government and reducing taxes is key to an economically bright future.\n\n2. Foreign: I'm generally towards less involvement globally. We should fix our own problems before trying to police others.\n\n3. Politics: Less government involvement in everyday issues preferably. They should be there to enforce and protect our constitutional rights, not create legislature to tighten control over its people.\n\n4. Social: Pretty much as long as it doesn't affect me or the future of the country too much, do as you wish. Marry same sex partners, abort, smoke weed. Don't allow special allowance or privileges based off race or gender, white or non-white, male or female. This is probably the main reason I'm starting to despise civil-rights-focused liberals these days as I see too many kids in my college go past asking for equality and start asking for superiority because the identity they were born as was oppressed decades ago.
3	Agh, probably gonna get downvoted all to hell, but so be it.\n\nI voted for Trump and I have no regrets.\n\nNow hear me out, I'm registered as unaffiliated because I have extreme views on both sides. I'm for marijuana legalization but slightly against gay marriage (I treat everyone with respect, and I have gay friends). I believe in securing our border but I am EXTREMELY anti-gun. In fact, I believe the 2nd amendment should be abolished.\n\nOverall, I'm socially moderate with a slight lean to the left. Fiscally, I'm conservative. I like Bernie's ideas of free public college tuition, but I don't believe in welfare to the extend that it is used today. As /u/hanj82 said above, "Foreign: I'm generally towards less involvement globally. We should fix our own problems before trying to police others." If it doesn't involve us or our safety, it's not our problem.\n\nLet the downvotes ensue...\n\nEDIT: below -> above
3	I'm mostly libertarian, like most of the people who have commented so far seem to be.
3	I am a young adult, African American, female who currently works part time. I have been so far a democrat since choosing a political affiliation, but am hoping for the day the US breaks from the two party system. I identify as a liberal.\n\nI strongly dislike the idea of giving states the option of deciding on social issues and am for government involvement in enforcing them.  E.g armed law enforcement escorting black children to end segregation. FDR working to rebuild the economy with enormous spending on social programs. This is the biggest reason I am against libertarianism.\n\nI think current american conservatism is completely out of touch with reality and is a soundboard for racists and sexists.I do not buy the arguments that business owners cannot afford to pay proper wages to their employees. I also believe that large companies need heavy oversight and must be federally regulated. US Corporations are too prone in using corrupt capitalist practices not only domestically but internationally, and I believe this stirs the pot for terrorism against us. \n\nAt the heart of it, I believe that positive social change is the foundation for the economy and politics and that it is highly advantageous for the government to jumpstart programs encouraging equality, diversity, and integration.
5	Being from Europe, all elected politicians are more left-leaning than the counterpart in the US, probably. I think that's a good thing, so if I had the choice between conservative or liberal, I'd most definitely go with liberal. \n\nI'm active in a national political party here in Denmark called Socialist People's Party, so that probably tells some for itself. \n\nI'm a huge supporter of tuition-free, accessable-for-all education and healthcare, and I'm proud of the system we have in place in our country. The system we have in Denmark, referring to free eductaion, makes sure the vast majority of people get a fair shot at moving up the economic ladder. I think social mobility is huge as a tool to help even out the society, and in turn having less people forced on the street or with barely enough money to make it.  \n\n
2	Your views pretty much mirror mine.  Socially liberal, fiscally conservative, generally libertarian.  
2	I'm Anti-Trump. But also Anti-Hillary........ I decided to not vote.
2	Thanks everyone for your responses! I've read them all, but decided not to comment individually because the purpose wasn't for debate and I find that being my natural inclination! I really appreciate you guys taking the time to spell out your personal beliefs! 
2	I'm a democratic socialist. Centre-left. I am below median age and make nearly the median wage.\n\nI believe in caring for your fellow (wo)man, abolishing as much income inequality as feasible and encouraging those at the bottom to go somewhere in life. I recycle and do what I can for conservation, not because I believe in saving the planet (the planet will be here long after we're dead) but because I believe in saving ourselves by not encouraging things that can kill our species.\n\nBeing half Chinese, I've had grandparents and great grandparents who hardly spoke a word of English because they never integrated. Because of this, I am wary of the changing face of society and prefer gradual social integration of immigrants rather than allowing large amounts of people to immigrate all at once and never having them integrate and then cause trouble like I'm led to believe happens in England.\n\nI feel that utilities that are part of our human rights should be maintained not-for-profit and should be managed by the government, no company should profit over the delivery of things we have rights to (that is to say things like power, water, public transport, general healthcare). Healthcare should be universal; accidents should not be something that can bankrupt you. Higher taxes are a small price to pay for these things.
1	ISTJ is basically liberal all around, especially with social issues.
1	Centrist
1	More economically than socially conservative. In America I think I'd count as broadly centrist, perhaps very slightly Left of centre. Probably a One Nationer or classical liberal.
1	Slightly left leaning centre 
1	I am a Democrat.
1	Fiscal conservative, social libertarian.  
1	Socially liberal in most ways, libertarian in others. Not even sure where to begin with the financial aspect of politics, it's just so fucked up. 
1	Democrat here, but I do have some conservative traits. 
11	We're Not Boring!	I'm an ISTJ andI hate the stereotype that we're boring! Why did we get a reputation for being that way? I mean I get that we're introverts, but even other introverts think we're boring!
21	I'm pretty boring. My wife (esfp) has nicknamed me the fun police. It's not to say that I'm not good company and can have an enjoyable time with things. I just live a routine, planned and scheduled life. 
13	I'm boring, but I don't really care. I'm very into some hobbies and interests, and don't mind talking about the things I enjoy, but I understand that most people don't care, and that talking about obscure stuff can be alienating. I have some good friends who are interested in similar things, and don't mind putting up with my social awkwardness, but mostly I just enjoy my alone time.
15	As an ISTJ I can confirm, we ARE extremely boring as a group. We do nothing interesting or exciting ever
7	I'm not boring just into my own things and have no problem doing the alone.  \nIn the past I went to Seattle to see "Lord of the Dance" at Key Arena, a Prince concert at the Paramount Theatre and a weekend trip to Portland to the OryCon to meet my favorite artist (Real Musgrave, creator of Pocket Dragons).  Not once did I even consider inviting friends.  Not boring, just alone.  No one else to mess up my plans and schedule.  Or to quote Sheldon, "They were having fun wrong."  Can't happen if I'm alone.\n\nYears ago I was working in England with a coworker.  I planned to go to Edinburgh for the day, I told my coworker he was welcome along, as long as he understood MY plans included the bus tour and the castle. He came and we had a great day, but I would have gone without him and still had a great time.
6	I'm not boring.  I don't have a great need to socialize, but when I do, I have a blast.  Don't let four letters define you.  If you're boring, you're boring.  If you're not you're not.  If you want to change it, change it.
6	I'm pretty boring unless it's something I want to do. Otherwise I don't really put on an act and perceive like I'm having a grand old time.\n\nIf something makes me smile, I'm gonna smile but don't tell me to smile just to smile. I need some purpose.
6	I like you guys because you're "boring". No surprises, every thing is consistent. Never a surprise social event.\n\nI mean, ISTJ I know loves jeopardy and gardening and I think that makes him a pretty amazing human being. \n\nI wouldn't want to go to a club with you guys, but I wouldn't want to go to one anyways, sooooo. 
4	I'm definitely not boring.  I'm just reserved.  Once I'm comfortable around you, ooooooh lawdy.  
5	Boring. Hmm. \n\nI don't see myself as boring. Though, perhaps others would. \n\nI mountain bike regularly. Love windsurfing. And two weeks from now I'm going to be trying my hand at ziplining. So there's that. \n\nBut I *plan* for those things. And I don't use social media to capitalize on my experiences. I don't take a lot of selfies. So what I do isn't publicized the same way. Perhaps I seem boring. \n\nMost weeknights I stay in. I read a lot. I enjoy my life. 
4	I lead a pretty awesome life as an ISTJ, but what people don't realize is that what they perceive to be adventurous and spontaneous is actually meticulously planned spontaneity if that makes any sense.
3	I do firefighting and EMS, which I like to think is not boring; however, I'm bad about sharing my experiences and stories with others. I get to do a lot of exciting things, I'm just bad at telling anyone other than the internet. 
3	I'm boring as hell. I work and I sleep and I play some vidya games sometimes.\n\nI don't really speak much unless it's about work or social or philosophical values.\n\nI feel that people only hang around me because I'm consistent, relatively good looking and dress well. For some I am their moral compass and others, their anchor to reality. However this does not make me interesting in the slightest, in this extroverted, excitement and media driven world we live in.
3	We probably take a long ass time to get to know. I'm fake friendly when I need to be and in other times I'm all business. I rarely share my opinions and sharing common ground is the only way to really get to know me. So rarely does anyone really get to know me.
2	As someone else pointed out, I wouldn't use the word boring specifically - I'd say reserved. This might appear to others as boring because it makes me slow to open up and really show my personality. If we have a common interest or knowledge base, or have shared similar experiences, I could probably talk for hours (which might also be boring). Just like a house may seem like every other house from the outside, you have to open the doors and walk in before you realize there's a party going on.
2	I'm not boring, just quieter than most.  My family and friends don't think I'm boring either.  Showing feelings though, that's another story.  I think once people get us to open up (after earning our trust) they are surprised to learn we have a wickedly sarcastic sense of humor.  I can be spontaneous and fun; it's just impossible for me to agree to do something I don't want to do.  Stereotyping any group is just plain wrong.

1	Boring is such a negative word, but it's not wrong. No one loves Aesop's turtle.
1	Yeah, even I think ISTJ are boring, when I read the personality type descriptions.  :)\nI don't find myself particularly boring, just less exiting than others. What makes me seem boring on other people's eyes, though, is probably that I don't share much about myself. I just don't see the need for randomly telling others how I spent my holidays or weekends. So even though I know a lot about other people's private lives, noone really knows me. It's hard to connect with someone whom you know nothing about. I don't blame them for thinking I'm boring. (That makes making jokes even funnier, because it takes them a second to process that they have just been burned seemingly out of nowhere. Hehe.)
1	I'm not boring once I get to know people, or if I find a common interest. 
1	We're not boring, we're just less erratic than everyone else.
1	It's because you don't eat booty like it's grocery.
9	Exhausted making calls at work. Any advice?	This week and probably all of next week  I am making calls all day. At the end of the day I've been extremely exhausted.  \n\nAnyone have advice for dealing with  this and not getting frazzled during the day? Yesterday I had one bad call and I felt like it sucked out all my energy.  \n\nI work in insurance and I'm calling hospitals all day if that relevant. \n\nAlso this is happening because of a flaw in the way our work is pulled and when everything is updated it will change how I do my work from now on. Part of me is annoyed that what I've been doing for months and thought was right wasn't. 
6	[deleted]
1	I worked in an inbound call center for exactly 2 weeks before I got suicidal and quit. The first week was training. I Don't think my personality type fits that type of job. But if anyone has solutions, I want to hear too!
1	I used to work in insurance and I now work as a recruiter, so I know your phone issues. I'm not an ISTJ (I'm INFJ), but I can definitely offer some helpful advice in relation to dealing with energy sucking phone calls.\n\nBreak up your phone calls! I used to make 20-15 calls (it depended on my mood for that day) and then take a short break. That break is usually around 10 minutes, which is enough time for me to stretch my legs, use the restroom, and maybe read an article online. Break up the amount of phone calls however you want, but keep it consistent and keep taking breaks. Even if you're thinking, "I can just power through this next set of calls," don't do it. You'll wear yourself out more.\n\nIf you don't need to be 100% focused while you're on the phone, then doodle while you're talking to people. Doing something like doodling tends to calm me down, so maybe that might help you?\n\nAt the end of the day, try to do something else that's calming to you. Since you're only making a large volume of calls for a few weeks, make sure that you're paying closer attention than usual to yourself. Self care is always important, but in times of stress I think it's the time to really hone in on it.\n\nHopefully this helps!
1	If you're able, try breaking up the phone calls with other work-related tasks that you enjoy. \n\nIs there something you need to research? Do you have industry-related reading you need to catch up on? Maybe get a few emails written. \n\nWhenever I find a particular task tedious or draining, I always try to mix it up with other tasks that work better with my strengths. 
1	Is there an option to email anything? Do you work with a set of specific people and maintain them as your sole contacts? Whenever I call a new vendor, I try to get an email address of the ONE person I'll be dealing with. That way I can just email them next time instead of calling. \n\nI prefer email communication (also I like to have everything in writing to reference) to phone calls. But sometimes I have to use the phone or my tone might be mistaken for aggressive when it's just inquisitive. It's easier to express inquisitiveness over the phone. \n\nWhen I do have to make calls, I like to do them first thing in the morning. I tend to have more energy then. I also have an end goal - like, 5 calls and then I can recuperate!- seeing the end in site helps me power through. Understandably, you have many more to make than would take up a morning. 
1	That kind of job really doesn't fit our personality. Find a new job ASAP. 
16	Why is it so many subscribers to INTJ but not many ISTJ subscribers ?	
16	Because ISTJ descriptions often suck, and many of our best qualities are attributed to INTJs. [Michael Pierce](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmDcT_Pujk8vOcxk_IcnxtQ) discusses this a bit in both his [video on INTJs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRxw2YJ9K7I) and his [video on ISTJs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_SB6AbFyb4) (I recommend both). ISTJs were his first and shortest video, but he [revisited ISTJs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go-4DZHKJdI) more recently.\n\nNi, for instance, is more of a visionary function. This does mean that it can come up with grand, almost prophetic seeming theories. However, it also means that it can be unreliable, completely overlook important information and details, and can be sloppier in its actual execution of theories. Michael Pierce argues that it is ISTJs that are the detail-oriented scientists, that thoroughly examine and test the evidence.\n\nOther places on the internet describe INTJs as both visionary *and* detailed/meticulous in their theorizing... and ISTJs are just stodgy assholes who think the rulebook is the highest law and moral code, or sycophants who can't think for themselves and need an organization or leader to feed off of and tell them what to do. The actual theory of the MBTI is much more balanced than that. We're all similarly gifted and disadvantaged. \n\nIt isn't that INTJs come up with startling and brilliant ideas that they then *also* rigorously test and bring into reality... but we also need ISTJs to answer the phone, and collate and proof edit the papers that the INTJ publishes. No. The INTJ may be the one coming up with ideas out of the clear blue sky, but it is going to be as much (if not more) the ISTJs that test and examine the idea in a thorough, rigorous, intelligent way so that it can be brought into reality as a respectable theory.
1	iNtuitive Bias
13	Flair choices now available!	Hey guys, as part of /u/rawtoast24 and myself's effort to make /r/ISTJ great again (or ya know, for the first time) we're working on the sidebar, header, flair, etc. \n\nFlair is here! You can choose from the 16 MBTI choices, or for you borderline folks, there's an editable one where you can pick your own! \n\nI know I haven't been too active here, but we've been looking at your suggestions and will be discussing any ideas you guys have for us. \nDrop me a line or message the mods to get a hold of us. \n\n\nThanks!
6	Glad to see the mods are taking initiative. I've been worried.\n\nEDIT: You should sticky this as well.
3	I am also pleased to hear that there is an initiative in the works to get our subreddit going stronger! I tried to help out by creating a subreddit banner/snoo thread for people to contribute what things like looking at (to see if we can converge on a theme/appearance for the reddit).\n\nI also like the cleanliness of the /r/Spare design that /u/JNDA88 suggested, below. I think I'd want the colors to be different, but it isn't a bad look.\n\nInspired me to look into other subreddit themes, some of which [can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/themes). From there, I also like the [ClearShift theme](https://www.reddit.com/r/themes/comments/45xfda/clearshift_minimalistic_modern_subreddit_theme/), and I like the design (and header) of the [SimplePlus theme](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimplePlus) too.
2	Hello, I don't know what flair is or how to get it.  Can someone please provide instructions?  I'm not the most computer literate person.  Thanks in advance!
2	Aww yiss thank you! I look forward to this subreddit being greater than ever before
1	Awesome man - keep up the good work
1	Sweet! Just added my flair!
7	Subreddit banner/snoo?	Hey all -- with a couple of posts looking at how we can spiff up the subreddit, I thought I'd make a post specifically soliciting ideas for banner/color scheme/snoo designs, etc. Certainly, I don't think any of us want anything too froo-froo and overdone. \n\nSo whether the vote is, "Keep it plain!" or specific pictures, colors, schemes that you find appealing and interesting (either for the actual banner or as a seed for inspiration)... Leave 'em in the comments!\n\nI'm going to try to track down a couple of ideas myself and will leave them here once I've found them.\n\nEdit to add: There are subreddit themes you can check out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/themes) if you want to see if there are there that you like and want to suggest.
5	For my contribution, I like more neutral color schemes (primarily greys, but earth tones like brown/blue/green are nice, too). \n\nI found some images I like on google images, such as [this kind of smokey/stars pictures](http://nativesinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/celestial.png), another [space inspired picture](http://mymonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/celestial-body.jpg) (I'd be looking at the middle-third horizontal bar, without the bright star, and incorporating some of the swirls but not the brightest chunks), or a [picture of the milky way](http://www.blastr.com/sites/blastr/files/milkwaynasa.jpg).\n\nOr I'd be thinking some sort of other abstract kind of design, greys/blues/teals/tans with a sharp, geometric, decent-contrast kind of pattern. I can't find anything on google images that quite matches what I am thinking of, but I'll post if I find anything.\n\nEdit to add: The header for the [SimplePlus theme] (https://www.reddit.com/r/SimplePlus) is very much along the lines of what I meant by geometric but still generally neutral pattern for the banner. I would want to change the color scheme slightly (though the one they have there is not at all offensive), but I like the pattern a lot.\n\nEdit to add again: The [Lament theme](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lament) is kind of slick too, aside from the too-large icons for individual posts. I like the background, though.
0	Keep it plain. I didn't use an exclamation point as you proposed, but that's because it seemed odd to exclaim such a thing.\n\nI hope we keep it plain, but I respect the democratic process.
12	Hey ISTJs, where can I find you?	ENFP here, all of my closest relationships have been with ISTJs, best friends, hardest crushes :) But I'm moving across the country for work and I'm really depressed because I have to leave all my friends. In the new town I'm going to have to make new friends, but IDK I'm selfish and really want to find specifically ISTJs to hang out with because it's such a huge pattern in my life. 
33	[deleted]
14	I think I've left the house 6 times this year.
12	At home or at work. Then there is the brief period of time when they can be found outside. Going home, or to work. They are usually very silent and the least outgoing, so keep an eye on such people.
11	We're probably at home
10	So what I've determined is go to the quietest place, find the quiet person and ask them if they like stegosauruses?
17	Work, home, gym, shopping. Your best bet is to engage at work one on one, develop the relationship slowly until you find something in common, an activity or interest, and then invite is out into the wild. \n\nEdit: I'm actually pretty out going when I'm one on one with someone. And I like to know exactly what's going to happen when we go out. Time, activity, cost, etc, so including those details helps me relax about going out with a new person. Never spring anything on us unexpectedly, like a detour, extra stop or meeting up with another friend we've never met; it makes us withdraw and feel like a third wheel. 
4	We're only ever places that we need to be. So, home, gym, work, or shopping. That's really interesting that your closest relationships are with ISTJs. I can't stand ENFPs.
3	In ten bathtub, on the deck tanning, or Laying on the couch reading or watching a show. \n\nI can't be found. \n\n
2	enfp istj...opposties attract I guess
2	I sometimes like to hang out at the museum or gallery. I also take classes for things that I'm interested in, like photography or language classes. I have an ENFP, and we get along really well, so I understand where you're coming from. Good luck!
2	When I'm out and about, most of the time I do not want to talk to strangers. I'd probably suggest meeting some other people first and then get them to introduce you to their friends who might be ISTJ?
2	We don't really get out much. I really only go to places I see practical reasons for being. I get the ISTJ ENFP thing though. I dated one for 3 years, we complimented each other pretty for the most part. I helped her be more responsible, she encouraged me to get out of the house lol 
2	I only know where to find me, which won't really help you unless you're traveling to the midwest USA... But yeah, generally home or work. Sometimes at a local food or coffee place, quietly on my laptop or reading.
2	There's a lot of us on the Facebook group! haha so maybe there.
1	ISTJs are everywhere, as in they're a common type. However, they're good at being invisible. They also don't go to social things they don't want to (so jealous of that Fi) and therefore escape home as soon as possible.\n\nToo bad, they're fun once they begin to open up. 
1	Online. Or probably your boss. Or working at a library. Any job that focuses on a non-people task.\n\nYou might find some at a hobby club.
1	Home, school (not for long, I get there right as class starts and leave as soon as it ends), a coffee shop maybe 5 times per year. 
1	Typically at work, online, or at home or the movie theater with my wife. I don't do much else. 
11	Friendly neighbourhood mod here. We'd like to hear your thoughts on this sub!	Do you frequent another sub that does something that you would like us to implement as well? Any complaints that you'd like us to look into? Share your thoughts! Or not, we can sit here in respectful silence and that's cool too :) 
6	I'm new to reddit and ISTJ sub, I like it here - no complaints :)  I have topics I'd like to read about/discuss but maybe they've already been done, plus I have to admit I'm not really sure how to do it on here yet.  I'd like to see topics on workplace bullying-how to deal, why there is so much SJ hate online, and managing NF/NT family members relationships successfully.  
5	[deleted]
5	I like it. I would like to see more posts and more activity in general... But there is no way to force that.
2	I would like to see more topics and more posts as well.
2	For my part, I often feel that I'm not going to add anything of value to a post because I have very similar thoughts as other responses, which is why I don't participate in discussions as much as I could.\n\nThis is probably the wrong way to think because we each have new insights to add, even if they seem similar to what's been said.\n\nI have to stop being afraid to engage just because I have similar thoughts or worry that no one will feel the same way.
1	New to MBTI...Newly dating an ISTJ	I am an ENFP 27 y.o. (recently found out) and I thought that the guy I am seeing now is very, very interesting but hard to get through to very confusing. Recently I found out that he is ISTJ 37 y.o. (or an ambi-STJ) and that we are polar opposites. This explains a lot as he kept saying 'you are too abstract', whenever I spoke about anything that interested me, which really made me wonder what he meant, and what I am doing wrong. I love being with him, as he notices things I don't and sees the world in such a different way, I LOVE it. And also, I really value the honesty he brings to table. Such a gem!\n\nI have a few questions:\n\n1) He is very reliable at texting back when I send him chatty texts (at least once a day so far). He doesn't play games, but I wonder if he is just being polite. He has never yet initiated a conversation but is so enthusiastic in his replies. He is also quite a busy person.\n\n2) Last night I texted him about meeting up when his current work project was done, and although he read the message he hasn't got back to me. Finding this very confusing! He has been very enthusiastic about planning things so far. (We even have a date fixed ten days from now, but I just wanted to see him before that too as it's a while away).\n\n3) Our chemistry is crazy, and he is very physical! But I find it hard to know how to connect with him in bed. I mean...I don't even know him and we haven't even talked about it, etc. He thinks that I should just observe his reactions and KNOW. I think he treats it like a science project, which he agrees is sort of true. I love that we can laugh about our differences.\n\n4) He said that I shouldn't 'fill up space' by talking, and that silence is communicative. So when I stay silent he thinks that I am just withdrawing into myself. I am so confused. What can I do with silence? It's...silence! Especially since we haven't known each other long, how can it be anything else?\n\nAnyway, advice please. This has just been a week and a half going, and I just want to know what is going on in his head and how I can communicate with him better.\n\n 
6	It's only been a week and a half? Slow down there, tiger, you just met. \n\nThe only thing I can comment on from your post is point #2, where he hasn't gotten back to you about a future engagement. Because ISTJs are very reliable, when we commit to something, we follow through. He may be making certain that he can commit to a future engagement without a possibility of not being able to follow through at the last minute. It would be distressing for his personality type to tell you he can and then have to cancel. 
5	ENFP and ISTJ in a relationship... That's very interesting considering I can't stand ENFPs. \n\nConsidering from "questions" 1-4 the only two questions are in number 4, I'll answer those. \n\nYou have to understand that the more you talk, the less important it makes your talking seem. It's the same concept as "If everyone has money, then what is the value of money? Not that valuable if everyone has it." He'll tune you out because if you're always talking, what you're talking about must not be special. If there is anything that we hate, it's doing something for the sake of doing it... It needs to have a practical purpose. And silence can't be anything else, it's just as you said... It's silence, and you should learn to shut up and enjoy it.
2	My thoughts on your questions/situations, to give you another perspective. Note: This is just my happens-to-be-ISTJ perspective, so it may have no bearing on your boyfriend at all. So while I hope it helps (and gives you some reassurance and ideas for interacting), be careful in applying anything you get from my reply!\n\n**1)** If he seems enthusiastic in his replies, I would trust that sense. I don't think I'd be read as enthusiastic if I was just replying to be polite. Chances are, I might accidentally come off as very dismissive and bland. If you're ever worried it is getting to be too much, you can probably just ask (in an open, friendly, nonthreatening, relaxed way), and he'd probably find a tactful way to tell you if it was.\n\n**2)** Were you texting him about meeting up the next day once his work project is over? I often (not always!) dislike making plans that are too near in the future. Or, too frequent. (Too near and too frequent are not fixed numbers either; it depends on a lot of variables to do with the person/relationship, but also my day/week/stress levels, etc.) I might be looking forward to just vegetating, and to the simple relaxation, predictability, and freedom that comes with being alone. Especially if I have had a stressful day. \n\nIn terms of invitations, I've noticed in myself that it helps if people provide explicit reassurances that there is no pressure to say yes to a given invitation. The freedom to say no (without social penalty) makes me *much* more likely to say yes. (I will say no sometimes, still, of course!) It provides me a relationship that I know can be strong, despite my needing a lot of personal time. Those are rare, in my experience. Having that will make me more inclined to find times to hang out with that person when I *do* feel like I want to (or don't strongly *not* want to -- to be clear, I almost always enjoy myself, even if I wasn't excited going in). \n\nIn the absence of those kinds of reassurances, I am more likely to feel like saying no is actively doing damage to the relationship. That can make me feel like (1) I can't possibly satisfy the other person and it is better to distance from the relationship, and (2) like I am caged/trapped. However, if there is some reassurance that you are totally fine if I say no, then I feel much safer investing in that relationship. I feel free to make an honest decision based on how I feel, which makes me feel like hanging out more often, because I know I'm never being coerced by social pressures. (Usually, those pressures are there to some degree, given that I am usually the one who wants to hang out less than the other person does -- but I still genuinely don't want to hurt their feelings or come off as rude.)\n\n**3)** This is even more likely to have personal preferences playing a role than the other two questions... but I will give it a shot. :) I don't think of myself as someone who would not want to talk about sexual preferences, but at the same time, I haven't had a new relationship in a long time, so I haven't had the chance to see how I would be. But if he approaches things like a science project, and you're game for being playful, you might turn the tables on him. \n\nFor instance, make him lay still, or heck, use restraints if you're into them -- checking in that they're okay of course. This can almost certainly be done non-verbally by pulling them out and giving him a smirky, "hey hey, look what I have" kind of grin, and then approaching him slowly and deliberately. I'm sure he'd stop you if he was totally against the idea, or you'd see him frown in a disapproving fashion, which you could then nod in response to, and throw them away from both of you (so he knows you're not going to sneak them on him, and have accepted his nonverbal refusal). Then have him lie still (restrained or not), and tell him you want to experiment on *him* -- and do as he essentially is saying you can. Play around with touching him, and see how he responds. I'm trusting you'd have some sense if he is enjoying things (facial expression, movements, sounds). Treat it like some prolonged foreplay, instead of getting into a heated sexual encoutner where it is much harder to be observant of minute reactions. That would be my advice. Of course, he might prefer something else (e.g., for you to take a less dominant role, or for more action). But it is something to try, at least.\n\nAt the same time, don't be afraid to ask for what you need, especially as your relationship warms and becomes more intimate. For instance, if he responds really well to the scenario above, you might then ask what he liked about it, or whether he liked specific elements (in a teasing, light-hearted, smirking/smiling way, so he knows it isn't some Serious Business Talk). "So... were the restraints something you liked in particular...?" If you need a discussion around it too, then tell him that. "I know talking about it can be weird, but there are some things that I think we need to talk about in advance... For instance, I would not want you to try anal sex with me and just 'read my reaction'... I would want you to ask me beforehand. You know what I mean?" (It might help if you have a specific act or area you want to ask about -- I would feel uncomfortable with an open ended, "Let's talk about sex -- what do you like?" question. It asks so much with so few boundaries on/guidance for how to answer. But if someone asked if I like X, I could much more comfortably discuss it with them.) Likewise, you might put together a trend if he really digs the restraints, and becomes very excited every time they are used in sex over the next 2-3 weeks; at some point, though (especially if they're not exactly your major thing), you'd probably want to check in whether he wants them to be a major part of your sex life. In other words, you can ask him for words/discussion, just like he can ask you to rely on them less. It's all compromise. :)\n\n**4)** I don't identify with this as much, I don't think. At least I don't picture myself asking someone to be silent more. Especially not then following up with:\n\n>So when I stay silent he thinks that I am just withdrawing into myself.\n\nSo he asked you not to fill up space with talking (as if he thought you were talking too much), but then tells you that he feels like you're withdrawing when you are silent?\n\nI am not sure what he means here, but I guess I would think of ways to communicate without language. Pretend you were in a long-term relationship with someone you loved and were still very attracted to, but you just got complete laryngitis and can't speak (not even a whisper). How would you communicate your affection to them, or your interest in things, or your desire to do something (platonic or sexual)? Treat it like a game.\n\nYou might also tell him, "I don't know what you mean, honestly. Can you tell me more -- or show me? I'll be quiet, and you can show me what you mean by communicating with silence?" or "Can I try something and you can tell me if that is what you mean by communicative silence?" (followed by the pretending game I described above). Or clarify, "Do you mean being able to have a comfortable silence with each other?" I know personally, I sometimes like to be in a room with someone engaging in solitary activities (e.g., reading, watching something, drawing, half-watching a movie, doing a puzzle), where we are not talking, but we're sharing a comfortable space together.\n\n**Important disclaimer**: I am not him of course -- this is *possibly* along the lines of what would go through his head or how he would think. But I am a female (so will have a different perspective in that sense), and more importantly, I am *not him*, so I can only help so much! The only way you can know what is going on in his head is by asking. :) Or just getting to know him better with time! I do hope these help broaden your idea of what he *might* be thinking though, or give you some ideas for communicating differently with him (that you can then evaluate the success of by checking in with him, or just being observant of his reactions). But make sure to continue to be yourself -- it's you he is attracted to, not me, and not a clone of himself!
1	I think werkwerkwerkwerkit's (that took forever to type) comment's are spot on.  For # 3, I don't understand the issue.  Great chemistry, he's very physical, so what's the problem?  As far as # 4 goes - when you're silent are you pouting?  90% of communication is non verbal.  You don't always need to be talking.  Just BE together.  Good luck :)
1	INFJ in a new (several months) relationship with an ISTJ here. This is such an interesting post and discussion. In case any of the following might be of use, here's my thinking based on my admittedly limited experience with my own specific ISTJ (who, yes, is quite a gem in my view).\n\n>1) He is very reliable at texting back when I send him chatty texts (at least once a day so far). He doesn't play games, but I wonder if he is just being polite. He has never yet initiated a conversation but is so enthusiastic in his replies. He is also quite a busy person.\n\nI've found it useful to directly ask for clarification if there's something I want to know. In this case, you could ask him what are his his preferences for everyday communication when you're not in the same place - for example, if he prefers texting like you two have been doing? And/or if he would prefer a different kind or pace of communication? You know about the honesty, and directly asking an ISTJ for more information can be really useful, in my experience at least.\n\n>2) Last night I texted him about meeting up when his current work project was done, and although he read the message he hasn't got back to me. Finding this very confusing! He has been very enthusiastic about planning things so far. (We even have a date fixed ten days from now, but I just wanted to see him before that too as it's a while away).\n\nHmm. This could be anything. The ISTJ in my life tends to be good at getting back to me quickly on logistical/planning things. Are you in touch otherwise? If so, you could just ask again as part of another communication, something like:  *"Also, do you have any sense of whether you'd be up for getting together when your work project is done? It will be totally okay if you can't, I would completely understand, I just asked because I really enjoy spending time with you."*\n\n>3) Our chemistry is crazy, and he is very physical! But I find it hard to know how to connect with him in bed. I mean...I don't even know him and we haven't even talked about it, etc. He thinks that I should just observe his reactions and KNOW. I think he treats it like a science project, which he agrees is sort of true. I love that we can laugh about our differences.\n\nMy ISTJ also wonderfully physical and we have fantastic chemistry. But she is pretty damn great at communicating her needs in bed. Way better than I am. She doesn't expect me to just observe her reactions and basically read her mind like you describe.\n\n>4) He said that I shouldn't 'fill up space' by talking, and that silence is communicative. So when I stay silent he thinks that I am just withdrawing into myself. I am so confused. What can I do with silence? It's...silence! Especially since we haven't known each other long, how can it be anything else?\n\nMy ISTJ cannot stand talking for talking's sake. She and I do talk. But not all the time and there are long stretches of silence when we're together. She really can't stand it when people talk just to fill up silence. That works for me - on my end, I find it incredibly restful. \n\nAnd: in those silences, I *do* withdraw into myself at in some ways. I mean, INFJ processing and all. So I'll be internally processing at one level in the silence, whole staying connected through touch at the other level. \n\nSo maybe you could see silence as part of an overall spectrum of communication that includes varying levels of verbal and non-verbal connection? \n\n------------\n\nAlso, I want to say that it might be that something's up here that's unrelated to your respective MBTI types. I would just keep an eye out for how he responds to direct communication from you about things you need clarification on. I feel like maybe, just maybe, there might be some sort of control dynamic going on from his end that has nothing to do with ISTJ functions. I'm not saying that is the case here, only that it popped into my mind as a possibility when reading through your post. \n\n\n
11	Most Likely RPG Class	I'm new to this sub and am also a huge nerd, so I was wondering what RPG class an ISTJ would most likely be? I play a lot of WoW and have constantly wondered this. I'm pretty into categorizing, so it's always peaked my interest to know what shoe fits best.\n\nI know that types may not perfectly fit a class, but which one would an ISTJ most likely be?
7	Back in my WoW days, I played Holy Pally & Arcane Mage. YMMV
5	I mained resto shaman all the way up to the talent tree changes. I don't play much anymore. I tend to choose healing when I can.
5	Healer. Most MMO's, they're usually very good solo because they're self sufficient and can be independent.\n\nWith others, you're like a guardian of sorts. Always watching over people and making sure they're at their max efficiency. Topped off hp and debuffs cleansed, type of thing.\n\nAlthough I also like mages because magic is cool.\n\nI'd be surprised if anyone here played a single target dps. Looks like most answers are tank, healer, aoe dps.
3	As with others in here I also played pally. Guess that's a theme haha
4	I like support/healer classes myself. 
4	In hindsight of finding out I was an ISTJ it makes sense that I love video games because most of them have some sort of to do list in the form of quests or missions. When it comes to MMOS however... yep, no surprise here. Currently playing FFXIV where I'm a healer and occasionally a tank. ;)
4	Rogue. I always go for fast attacking stealth based classes.
3	I always play some kind of defender class. Looking back at my gaming history, paladins are always my top choice.
3	I always thought the most appropriate class for me would be a Githzerai monk or swordmage.\n\nHonour. Aspiration towards order and understanding one's plane and, therefore, oneself. Typically sombre and private. Does not impose one's beliefs on others.\n\nAs for video games, I'm usually a priest or medic. Good support work usually is the key to changing the tide of battle, provided you've got at least a couple extra teamplayers on your team.
3	D&D bro here. I find myself really enjoying the new 5e Bard. They can do all the things and it's great. \n\nI've also always really enjoyed the concepts of Pally's and Clerics. Not the shining figures of justice mind you, I'm talking the sneaky types that smite evil from the shadows.\n\n\nAs for what I would actually be if I were spawned into a world based upon my mentality? I have no idea. I'd like to think I would be a Paladin, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nEDIT: Grammer mistakes.
3	I was a top 10 world hunter back when I played. I retired due to life, but that is what I was.\n\nEDIT: My go to class in D&D is paladin. There is something about people with faith that I admire.
3	I almost always pick some kind of healing/support class. I don't know what it is about it that makes it fun, because it can often times be extremely stressful. However, I've just never found DPS to be that appealing. YMMV
3	I usually play as a mage or thief
3	I usually play as a rogue or a mage (if the world contains magic). Sometimes a mix of both. 
3	A fucking NPC. Muahahahah\n\nJoke aside, a Druide or Paladin, a support.
3	Paladin
2	In my WoW days I pretty much exclusively played a druid... I haven't played since BC so everything is probably completely different now but I really enjoyed the ability to basically do everything from nuking (Boomkin!), Heals (Tree), or Feral as rogue/tank. I also dabbled with Priests and Shamans. \n\nFrom a more broad RPG perspective I tend to get the biggest kick out of maximizing the unpopular classes. For example, I was a huge SWTOR fan back at launch and helped break the Power Tech (supposed to be a tank) by turning it into ridiculous damage dealer. \n\nMy least favorite classes tend to be rogues or tanks, mostly because I'm bad at playing them. Plus a good support player is pretty hard to come by.
2	I'm such an old nerd.  I still think of the RPG computer language I learned in college on 1981 when I see those initials.  LOL.
47	New to this sub; my reaction to every post.	
1	Nice :)
5	I did some analysis with all Meyers-Briggs types' subreddits' subscriber counts. It looks like much more redditors are introverted and intuitive.	
4	More redditors *want to think of themselves as* introverted and intuitive.
3	Don't you think it might be more  that INxx types tend to be more into myers briggs and typology than other  types, not that more of reddit are INxx?
2	Thanks for doing this. It's interesting.
2	Too bad I subscribe to multiple mbti type subs, and I'm surely not the only one.
2	You need to consider the confounding variable of people mistyping. There are so many fake INTJs that I take everything in that subreddit with a grain of salt. 
2	I'm quite sure than a *lot* of "INTJs" are actually mistyped ISTJs...
1	this is funny for me because i subscribe to both r/ISTJ as well as the other subs that are E-dominant and while we might have the numbers, the E's definitely generate the most submissions
1	No ENFJs?
11	What do you not forgive?	
25	A break in loyalty.
13	As others have said, betraying trust or doing anything to show that I can't count on them as a loyal person/friend. If I tell you something and ask you not to tell anyone, and I found out you told someone, I will NEVER tell you anything important to me again.
11	Lateness and/or not keeping commitments. 
8	Betrayal of trust, lateness, dirtiness and incompetence. 
6	Lies 
6	Willful dishonesty or deception. 
3	Passive aggressive behavior.  I want honesty.  When people lie to me about their feelings I can't stand it.  It's hard enough for me to navigate my own, let alone someone else's.  Just tell me the truth so we can move forward!  I usually end a friendship if someone is passive aggressive with me.  There's other things too, but that's what came to mind just now.
4	Pre-meditated attacks against me.  \n\nI can forgive heat of the moment insults or absentminded forgetfulness, even if they upset me deeply.  But if I know you said or did something with the intent of hurting me, I will _cut_ you and I will show no mercy.
3	Breaking your word, which most frequently means not doing something you say you're going to do.
1	Agree with everyone.  Breaking trust or loyalty.
1	Someone breaking my trust or someone who is not loyal
18	Does anyone else have a sarcastic streak?	I'm an MBTI practitioner and have met a large amount of fellow ISTJ's in my work. A relatively common theme is a wicked sense of sarcastic humour (which often surprises others as we're seen as quite serious at first). Anyone else find this?
32	I'm so sarcastic, that people don't know when I'm being sarcastic. \n\nDoes that answer your question?
7	My sarcasm is so dry that when I'm being serious, everyone thinks I'm just being sarcastic. I can't win. 
7	Oh, God no.
3	Very dry, very sarcastic. It helps though. I know if people get my sense of humor then it's worth investing the time. 
2	"wicked" as in dark? cause throw some Jim Jefferies/Bill Burr my way and I'll be in stitches. \n\n
2	Streak or way of speaking at all times to everyone?
2	I am the complete opposite. I am rarely sarcastic, and when I try it comes off as rude. I do want to mention that I am a Chinese American, with parents who immigrated here. I think part of my lack of sarcasm is due to my upbringing.
1	I can be sarcastic. Sometimes even totally *spot on*.\nIt just doesn't happen too often, I need a good opportunity to do so.
1	Definitely, big time!
1	It's lasted about my whole life so far...
1	I have to keep mine in check.  \n Sometimes I journey to the Land Where Nothing Is Funny.  \nI don't like being mean. 
1	I'm so sarcastic I have trouble telling when other people are sarcastic.
1	It's really hard for me NOT to be sarcastic/make a sarcastic quip about things. :L
1	My humor is a mix of sarcastic and dirty/gross. No one expects half the stuff that comes outta my mouth to come from me.
10	How clean is your house?	my husband is an ISTJ and it seems that it is never tidy enough for him.  Is this a common ISTJ thing?  A common source of conflict??
17	Yup.\n\nWe need organization. No clutter. I have 6 pets so I can only do so much....but yea...pick your shit up. Put stuff away. The peanut butter goes HERE so stopping putting it THERE.
14	 Eh, from an outsiders perspective it may look disorganized and cluttered. But, there is always a method to the madness.
8	I must be the minority here. My place is a complete mess (clothes on the floor, things not put in the right place, but no dirty plates or anything like that) and I'm always scrambling around because I'm so unorganized. 
5	I don't live by myself, but my room is always clean. Not like spotless, but I don't leave clothes on the floor or anything. \n\nThe worst for me is the kitchen. Every time I go in there, there is always something that's dirty or not picked up. Usually the trash can is overstuffed  and the sink is full of dishes etc. 
4	My definition of "dirty" is cleaner than the average person's "clean".  My parents owned a motel when I was a young kid, and my ISFJ mom had very high standards of cleanliness that she indoctrinated me with.  Some of my earliest memories as a child were helping her clean rooms.
3	It's organized for me, and I always try to make it look orderly but sometimes that doesn't work. My desk is always spotless when I finish my work though.\n\nI live in a dorm so that helps with keeping it clean because there isn't a lot of place for mess to go before it starts to get unbearable (for me - my roommate, not so much).
3	Yep! I have a fairly regular weekly cleaning routine. I mean, I'm human and I live in a real house, so it looks like it, but usually things are pretty clean and orderly. I can feel a pretty significant mood change when the house is disorganized or 'dirty'. It causes me much anxiety. \n\nI pick up before I leave for work and before I go to bed. The only things I leave out are things that can't be taken care of right away, like a hot curling iron or drying dishes, etc. \n\nMy office is also this way. Which is significant considering I work in a field that requires me to move offices several times a year. \n\nIt is a constant source of contention with my spouse who is very much not ISTJ. \n\n
2	I hate cleaning, there is no joy in it for me.  I will put it off as much as possible.  If it's an ISTJ thing, then I'm an anomaly.  
1	depends. Somethings I make sure to keep tidy, others I don't really care. \nFor example: my desk is just books stacked a mile high everywhere. But my bed is done every morning, the corners tucked in, and the sheets tight. \n\nSo guess it really depends on what it is.
13	Do you get confused for an extrovert?	We have a lot of social functions at my job. I tend to get around and talk to a lot of different people, but only because it's convenient; lots of people from different organizations are all in the same place. I tend to try to get around and see as many people as possible, and because of this, people lose their minds when I identify as an introvert. \n\nI can see how it looks like extroversion, but it's really all about business. I say what I need to say, get the info I need and as soon as it starts getting to the small talk, I'm out. On to the next person I need to see. \n\nDoes anyone else get this?
7	I'm an introvert with passable social skills
6	Yes at work because I'm "outgoing" or not afraid to speak my blunt mind at times. 
3	my girlfriends did initially because most of my initial 'game' was puns from reddit 
3	My family actually views me as an extrovert. But I think this is because I get so frustrated on vacation with them when things aren't being planned and scheduled and no one knows the details. Where normally I'd sit back and enjoy myself, I feel that someone has to do something with this unorganized mess! So I put myself out there and ask all the questions to all the people and plan and execute the activities. It's exhausting, but it's not small talk so it's not totally draining. But they see the talking to strangers and making all the phone calls and think of it as extroversion. But it's not like I talk to people in line at the grocery store for kicks, I just want to know where the best Mexican place is in town and I've got no Yelp. There's always a goal to accomplish. 
3	I mistook my ISTJ friend for an extravert when I first met her too (She took the test recently and scored 100% on the introvert category). I think part of this is because according to the cognitive functions theory, your extroverted function is Extroverted thinking (Te). To sum this function up bluntly, you tell people what to do and organize the thingys in front of you. This would suit anyone well in a work setting where you have to take charge and lead others. Also, you have to be loud in order to tell people what to do! I guess the loudness of the function makes you guys mistaken for extraverts...
2	Always. People usually mistype me as some combination of E, N, and F ...but they always get the J right :) I don't think anyone has ever called me a P.\n\nWhen I tell people I'm an ISTJ, the one's who say "I can totally see that now!" are usually people who have ISTJs in their family.\n\nThis is why I always say the stereotypes get it so wrong and people likely know a lot more ISTJs than they think...
1	Sometimes.
1	Short of having too much cocaine, no. \n\nI can talk as much as is necessary and talk about business as much as is needed. But I'm not the sort of person who will go out of my way to start conversations.
1	Yeah, sometimes, though not at work.  We don't have social functions at my job so I'm usually secluded to my office.  I think I'm pretty clearly an introvert, but I have fair social skills and my introverted friends who don't have social skills say I seem extroverted sometimes. 
1	Yes, everyone at work thinks I'm an extravert because I push myself out of my comfort zone and try talking more and being more social than I normally would.\n
1	I once said something about how I was introverted, and a coworker told me I hid it really well.  I think it comes from a misunderstanding of introvert=quiet and shy.
9	Do you think out loud?	I have been thinking about this lately: does Te cause you to (sometimes) think out loud?\nMy boss(ESTJ) and my mother(INFP) both do it a lot and I sometimes do it as well.\n\nDo any of you tend to think out loud?\n\nEdit: mother is INFP not J
3	Yes. All the time. A lot of people think that I'm crazy because my facial expression and body language can get so animated as they correspond to my thoughts.  I usually keep the verbal part of it to when there aren't people around. This all might have to do with the fact that I have schizoid personality disorder though. 
3	I talk to myself a lot. I enjoy speaking with soneone intelligent every once in a while.
1	On occasion yes. 
1	Yes. My co-workers learned to ignore me. One found an attic that said it's a sign of genius so I just run with that.
1	Yep. But I don't church it up and call it "thinking out loud".  I straight up talk to myself. Hand gestures and everything. 
1	I talk to myself too. No one knows you better than you.
1	Frequently.
1	> does Te cause you to (sometimes) think out loud?\n\nWhat leads you to think it's attributed to Te? INFJ's have Ti in their stack, not Te... but that kinda makes sense because "thinking out loud" has been universal in my experience. What coloration are you seeing?
1	LOL!  I thought that was normal.  \n\nI once did a psychological test that said I heard voices.  The only "voices" I hear are my own.
1	It's the only way I can remember things. People think I talk to myself, but it's not like I'm having a conversation with myself... I'm just trying to remember things!
1	I think out loud when I'm working through a problem, especially at work.  At home I talk to myself all the time.  When I'm caught (at home), I start singing to cover it up.  Sometimes I worry I'll start singing at work like I do at home, because I'm concentrating so hard I forget where I am.  Hasn't happened yet, thank god.
29	ISTJs and puns?	I've always had a real love for wordplay (I think it's one of the most clever forms of wit out there, and I also just think it's stupidly funny), and I've seen a few places associate ISTJ humour with puns. So I'm interested in how other ISTJs view puns. Do you love them? Hate them? Don't really care? \n\nIf you don't like wordplay, what is your sense of humour?
16	Puns are almost always guaranteed to make me laugh. I am not sure whether I think they are a superior, or more clever form of wit? They just appeal to me -- I have no choice in the matter. :)
6	My fingers are in favor but my thumbs oppose.
4	I love puns, they give me a warm fuzzy feeling.
4	I love when other people make puns but I don't tend to do so myself. The type of humor I probably exhibit most often would be sarcasm or dry deadpan references to things. I especially like to reference inside jokes or past events to which I can play off what's happening. 
3	most of go to jokes when trying to make others laugh come from puns.
3	I've always laughed far too hard at puns. Never understood why other people disliked them or thought they weren't very funny. 
3	Ugh, I hate puns. Most of my humor is dark.
2	I'm pretty much indifferent. I might appreciate a good pun, but I don't consciously try to make them myself.
2	I do not even think you are ISTJ if you do not laugh at puns... I am an 18 y/o ISTJ(M) and I have the most dry sense of humor. I love the puns and the one-liners. 
2	My family consists of an INFJ, ESTP, INTJ, INFP, ESFP (I know right!) and they get so annoyed with me because of how much I love puns.  None of them see the humor in it like I do.  I actually got excited when I saw this post.  YAY for puns!  I'm starting to think as I'm typing this, that maybe I need professional help.
2	ISTP here.....Unfortunately I can confirm that my ISTJ friends go nuts over puns. They make the worst puns at the worst times and take any negative reaction as fuel to the fire. It makes me want to succeed at getting away with murder. 
1	I both love and hate them. They're clever to be sure, but they're almost always groan-inducing.
1	INTJ here—my ISTJ best friend has a very nasty, gross, disgusting sense of humor. Like "what did the cannibal do after he dumped his girlfriend?" "flushed the toilet" :/\n\nThat is like his favorite joke, and he told that joke around another ISTJ (and a group of other types), and the ISTJ went nuts over that joke. Nobody else laughed.\n\nI have never seen my ISTJ friend make a pun, though.\n\nOne time, I made a pun that he really liked and took the time to comment on—it was over text and he actually went out of his way to give me kudos for the pun.
1	I loooove puns! They're great
1	I love puns. Too bad I'm not clever enough to make them myself.
22	Lack of emotion, excitement and expression of feelings?	Not sure if the above are ISTJ traits but I usually experience those traits a lot and I will explain further.\n\nWhen it comes to being emotional, I just can't fake it. In situations where one is supposed express emotions, I usually come off as neutral or disinterested which isn't always the case deep down.\n\nThis leads to lack of excitement for other people or stuff. When I set goals for a specific time frame and accomplish them, I feel excited but when someone tells me about their own accomplishments, I struggle to feel excited for them. I'm not jealous or anything but its just natural for me not to feel so hyped for them.\n\nFinally when it comes to expressing feelings, I usually have no clue. I'm just like "ok" and that's it. Inside, I get these feelings but can't transfer them outside or to body language which can seem awkward sometimes.\n\nI'm not a sadist or anything along that line but I just wanna know if it's normal for ISTJs to feel this way.  \n
12	This is my normal state. All of the mentioned.\n\nI may smile or laugh a bit here and there, but that's about it.
5	Definitely. I'm reading "Quiet" by Susan Cain right now. She talks a lot about how extroverts get more excited about different things. Introverts are just wired differently - we're emotionally stable. (which is a huge advantage in my opinion)
3	Yes, you just described me to a T. Female istj here and I feign interest in my co-workers lives on the regular. Internally I feel guilt but I just cannot get myself to care.
3	[deleted]
3	I'm the same way.  My family lovingly refers to me as a robot.  I rarely cry, but when I do, it's at the strangest times, like when we watch E.T.  I get made fun of so much.  I think alot about the meaning of life, death, spirituality, the human condition, I just don't share my feelings unless asked and I trust the person.  I think ISTJ's are typecast as bores when it's really a special kind of someone who can get us to open up.  
2	Personally, yes and no.  I've always been emotional inwardly, though how I've expressed it has varied.  \n\nI *used* to be how you describe when I was a kid.  Most of the time, I was fairly calm and mild, and my family would think it was super hard to get me excited about anything.  And when I was angry or upset, they wouldn't know it until my emotions became too much and I lashed out in a furious tantrum (I got quite a rep for having "light-switch" moods).  \n\nNow, I've learned to be very expressive, to the point where I'm almost dramatic or flamboyant about it. Most of the time, I just try to mirror my group/the other person's energy levels and mood.  Other times, I'll have my own genuine bubbling-over rush that people need to tell me to calm da F down, or I might be entirely enthusiastic and warm but still dead inside!  However, I am still fairly good at maintaining a calm/indifferent face when I'm emotionally distressed, at least, when I have an audience.  \n\nEdit: typo
2	Yup. Although I sometimes wish that i was the center and life of the party, I've come to realize that i am not and can never be. Therefore the people who are willing to invite me out I value because they obviously already know what they're getting. So there isn't any real 'i'm supposed to show emotions', I just do what I do. \n\nIn terms of getting 'hyped' for other people, I think really boils down to an ISTJ need of action. Like you said, 'set goals', you want to be involved in the process. But if you're hearing about something after the fact, it's already happened, so whats the point? \n\nSo my suggestion would be: try to play it like a game. What's the next step? How can you be a part of helping someone become better? Ask questions and be involved in the process. If there isn't much they need you for, then be satisfied that you tried and switch topics to what you want to get done. 
3	I have a theory that all ISTJs are some where on the spectrum of having schizoid personality disorder. There are few of us (ISTJ and SPD) that the statistics back up the number.
1	Sounds like me to me.
1	I am pretty sure that it is an IST* thing. It is the default state for ISTPs, which is why they are typically characterized by lack of empathy. This could be a result of these shared traits between us. 
3	Is pessimism associated with ISTJs?	
16	More like realism. And reality tends to be... not so nice. So, yea.
10	Or we just like looking at things the way they really are 
7	It's not about being pessimistic... its' about being realistic.
3	If you consider our perceiving functions (introverted sensing dominant & extraverted intuition inferior), then it seems we're wired to be more comfortable with present, known things than we are with the future and the unknown.\n\nThat isn't to say we're pessimistic. But we're cautious about the future or the unknown due to our preference for prior experience over novel ideas and concepts. I like to term it as being prepared for the worst but hoping for the best. \n\nWhen in the grip of inferior extraverted intuition, however, it's very likely that others may see you as pessimistic. This is because we tend to "catastrophize" about the future during times of high stress. 
3	I am deeeeefinitely an optimist.  Who sometimes might struggle with negative thoughts.  BUT ALWAYS BELIEVING IN THE BEST.  :) Just sometimes bracing myself for the worst.  
4	I always say I am a realist, but people fire back that I only see the negative.  so yeah 
2	Not sure overall, but I can tell you that I'm definitely a pessimist, so maybe. I think that might be more of a turbulent/assertive thing though. 
2	I think I recovered from 15 years of moderate depression and while I don't think I changed a my preferences or how I think even a little bit, my reactions to stuff improved tremendously.  Being happy does not come without effort though, do not attribute it to "the way things are".  Yeah, world is full of shit, but life can be really good.\n\nHere you go:\n\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlBiLNN1NhQ\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-diB65scQU
1	I'm too neutral to call myself pessimistic (whenever I see a bad outcome, I'm just being real), and since I push myself to have a positive outlook, I identify as more of an Optimistic Realist.
1	I remember when I was in my late teens someone told me, "You're too young to be such a pessimist!"  I responded with, "Yeah? Well you're too old to be such an optimist!"
13	Is laziness ISTJ's trait?	
23	I prefer the term efficient. I'll efficiently do my work to spend the least amount of time and effort on it ;)
8	Yes.
7	I'm not lazy!\n\nNow just isn't the right time for me to work on that. \n\n\nWhen I DO get to it, I'll work on it till its done. \n\nOr until I have to stop. Then I'll get to it again when the time is right!
6	I feel extremely guilty when I feel I am being lazy. If I am not being proactive by scheduling, goal setting, etc. then it's easy for me to do nothing. In fact, my favorite thing to do is nothing. Though I despise laziness, it's an easy trap to fall into.
7	Yes.
6	no, it's not one of my traits.  but the motivation has to be right.
4	I am as far from lazy as they come.  Odd man out?
4	I don't know about lazy. I would say that I definitely need to feel a sense of personal control and agency in order to be motivated. I would guess that a lot of my obstinacy against homework as a child was about asserting my control over my behavior.\n\nIt isn't that I had no aspirations, it was that I was not going to do what someone else told me to do *just* because they told me to, if I didn't see the value. \n\nEdit to add: At least for me, one of the most valuable things that *could* have been done for me as a child was to show me a path to meeting my own goals. Sure, we all have to do things we don't want to do. But when, from a young age, you learn that working hard is always in service of other people, (and you reject that as a priority,) you can miss out on learning to work hard for yourself. It is skill that is harder to learn when you're older.
1	Everybody is lazy.
1	"laziness" can also be the "leisurely" personality style (<http://ptypes.com/leisurely.html>) and the passive-aggressive personality disorder.\n\nIn my experience, ISTJs tend to be vigilant (paranoid), conscientious (obsessional) and leisurely (passive-aggressive). The parentheses are the disorders but I am of the belief that all disorders are simply the far end of a spectrum that runs the gamut from personality style to disorder. This idea is from Theodore Millon I believe, although I have encountered it elsewhere.\n\nSo, as an INTJ, I have self-confident (narcissistic), idiosyncratic (schizotypal), and perhaps some other ones common to my type. I have met INTJs who seem conscientious (obsessional) and solitary (schizoid) as well.\n\nPossibly any type can have any personality style/structure/disorder though that is far from certain for me. It seems more likely that each personality type has a few possible personality styles/disorders that it can exhibit, or all of them even in some cases.
1	I thought it was a human trait.

7	10 Reasons Why Being An Introvert Is The Best Thing That’s Ever Happened To You	
20	Best ISTJ description?	What is the best ISTJ description you've found? 
23	ISTJ\n\n* **Honest and Direct** – Integrity is the heart of the ISTJ personality type. Emotional manipulation, mind games and reassuring lies all run counter to ISTJs' preference for managing the reality of the situations they encounter with plain and simple honesty.\n\n* **Strong-willed and Dutiful** – ISTJs embody that integrity in their actions too, working hard and staying focused on their goals. Patient and determined, people with the ISTJ personality type meet their obligations, period.\n\n* **Very Responsible** – ISTJs' word is a promise, and a promise means everything. ISTJs would rather run themselves into the ground with extra days and lost sleep than fail to deliver the results they said they would. Loyalty is a strong sentiment for ISTJ personalities, and they fulfill their duties to the people and organizations they've committed themselves to.\n\n* **Calm and Practical** – None of their promises would mean much if ISTJs lost their tempers and broke down at every sign of hardship – they keep their feet on the ground and make clear, rational decisions. Peoples' preferences are a factor to consider in this process, and ISTJs work to make the best use of individual qualities, but these decisions are made with effectiveness in mind more so than empathy. The same applies to criticisms, for others and themselves.\n\n* **Create and Enforce Order** – The primary goal of any ISTJ is to be effective in what they've chosen to do, and they believe that this is accomplished best when everyone involved knows exactly what is going on and why. Unclear guidelines and people who break established rules undermine this effort, and are rarely tolerated by ISTJs. Structure and rules foster dependability; chaos creates unforeseen setbacks and missed deadlines.\n\n* **Jacks-of-all-trades** – Much like Analysts (NT), ISTJs are proud repositories of knowledge, though the emphasis is more on facts and statistics than concepts and underlying principles. This allows ISTJs to apply themselves to a variety of situations, picking up and applying new data and grasping the details of challenging situations as a matter of course.\n\nThese are all good too, but no one is perfect. Just like everyone, they have their disadvantages.\n\n* **Stubborn** – The facts are the facts, and ISTJs tend to resist any new idea that isn't supported by them. This factual decision-making process also makes it difficult for people with the ISTJ personality type to accept that they were wrong about something – but anyone can miss a detail, even them.\n\n* **Insensitive** – While not intentionally harsh, ISTJs are often hurt more sensitive types' feelings by the simple mantra that honesty is the best policy. ISTJ personalities may take emotions into consideration, but really only so far as to determine the most effective way to say what needs to be said.\n\n* **Always by the Book** – ISTJs believe that things work best with clearly defined rules, but this makes them reluctant to bend those rules or try new things, even when the downside is minimal. Truly unstructured environments leave ISTJs all but paralyzed.\nJudgmental – Opinions are opinions and facts are facts, and ISTJs are unlikely to respect people who disagree with those facts, or especially those who remain willfully ignorant of them.\n\n* **Often Unreasonably Blame Themselves** – All this can combine to make ISTJs believe they are the only ones who can see projects through reliably. As they load themselves with extra work and responsibilities, turning away good intentions and helpful ideas, ISTJs sooner or later hit a tipping point where they simply can't deliver. Since they've heaped the responsibility on themselves, ISTJs then believe the responsibility for failure is theirs alone to bear.
11	Struggle of social events	I frequently turn down invites to social events because I feel like being alone and reading or cleaning or something. Even though I enjoy my evening in, I feel overly regretful/upset when I see everyone post photos of the event or talk about how much fun it was. Even if someone talks about something completely unrelated to the event I was invited to, I feel like a loser for staying in on a Friday night while everyone else is out doing things. However, when I do attend events, I feel outspoken and out of place and wished I was at home. I can't win. It's a constant cycle of wishing I did something else. It has really been getting to me, and I feel lame. Can anyone relate/give advice?  
4	I absolutely can relate. I found that I am happiest if I stay home most of the time and go out to large events a few times a year. I also don't look at Facebook or other social media as much as I used to because it makes it seem like everyone is always out having a great time when in reality these gatherings are often just a bunch of people taking selfies so they can make their lives look super fun on social media. 
4	Huh, I kind of understand where you are coming from. I guess the decision comes down to this- Choose to exclude yourself or try to include yourself but get excluded anyway. I would be much comfortable personally with choosing how I feel.
3	Have you ever thought about tracking your energy expenditure? \n\nIt might sound strange, but track how much you do over a month or two in terms of social interaction, mental activity and physical activity. You might see patterns that could explain why you're feeling restless staying home and anxious going out. \n\nFor me, if I've had a busy work week with lots of socializing or big-picture strategy work, and I'm too tired to go out. So I've stopped. But other weeks are light, and then I know it's time to make plans.
2	Been there in my early college life. It was was so bad I became depressed and had to see a shrink. Mainly because I have my work and i know where I want to be, but also wanted the glamorous social life. When I saw friends who were just horrible people (did drugs, partying every weekend, and cheated on their SO's) have the best time of their lives and more successful in school, I started questioning my own values and being. \n\nThat all said, what i've learned from my own self-examination is that this isn't a race. Who am i trying to impress? because maybe i wanted to have those photos on fb to have me so others would know i was cool and popular.\n Furthermore, because I don't have to impress anybody, I can choose my friends. These folks whom know I don't need to be the loudest in the room and love me for it. But that means i can count my best friends with my hand. Be comfortable with that.  \n\nIf you still like to rave, party, flirt, etc. know that every dude in the room is trying to be the loudest and foolish, polarize yourself. Chill on that couch and just enjoy that drink. Don't be the most talkative. Observe other people and be happy that they're happy. Where ISTJs own is the personal and intimate conversation. At some point someone is going to notice you're not talking and will siddle on up to you and start talking. That's when you take charge and show that you're having a great time and at the same time comfortable being who you are. If you don't know anyone at the party, here is your chance to say, "hey i don't know anyone here, can you introduce me to XYZ". Through this method i've been told that I come off as a lot more mature and i dare say it, attractive. \n\nGood luck! 
1	You should try hanging out with a small group of people. I've always found that when I am with 2-5 people, I can (usually) be around them for a while without "using up" the little extrovertedness I have. Maybe you can avoid regret, but also avoid disappointment this way.\nBest of luck!
1	I can relate as well.  There is a lot of stimulation and interaction whereas I prefer less in social events.
1	I find that I'm best in small groups. I don't mind going out with small groups frequently. The big social events give me a lot of anxiety and I actually don't feel like I'm missing out when I see postings about them on social media. I guess I'm just really comfortable with my comfort level! My good friends are pretty accepting of this, so I never get any flack. 
1	ISTJ here - This is a very good post, I like it because it's so honest.  I have felt that way, but I decided not to let myself be pressured to where and when I should go out, and I need be true to myself and not apologize for it.  I'm also finding alot more people are staying in and watching Netflix! I recently (and finally) agreed to attend a "catch up" gathering, and my old high school friends were taking selfies the entire time, there was no meaningful conversation.  It was such a bizarre experience.  Never again!

2	You know nothing, Jun Snuu.
1	Did they just show a clip of GOT meant to highlight Kit, where Kit says zero lines? I think they could have found something better. 
1	Managerial positions	Anyone think that ISTJ are not really well suited for managerial positions?
4	I always saw myself as being the Vice President rather than the President if that makes sense.
5	I dunno, I've always avoided leadership roles, but I think I would be well-suited for one.  Granted, I've been told that I'm a little bit different from most other ISTJs.  :)  \n\nPeople, in my circles at least, tend to look at me as a competent individual who can both get things done efficiently and be motivational and understand people.  Additionally, I get along (or at least pretend to) with just about anyone--the exception to that rule being leaders/superiors I've judged as incompetent or less competent than I am.  I have the worst tolerance for that, and I can fake it, but only to maintain civility.  I personally think I'm very good at recognizing people's strengths and weaknesses, and playing them to those strengths.  \n\nHowever, I do admit that I'm pretty stubborn and have high standards that some people feel pressured by, though I am very sensitive about giving out criticisms and wording things in a positive way so I don't upset people.  I like to think I'm open minded to at least hearing out new ideas, but in practice, I admit I'm not so good at implementing them unless there's a very obvious gain over the current method.  \n\nI think my biggest weaknesses, however, are really just my aversion to being the center of attention and my performance anxiety (I F things up more when I know I'm being watched, even if I know what I'm doing when I'm alone).  But tiz nothing I can't grow out of!  So yes, I think I would make a pretty great manager!
3	I like to be the leader; it's stressful though, some people just don't know...they won't follow orders I give even when they seem logical.\n\nSometimes they just slack off. Sometimes I can't think of orders to give based on analysis of said person.\n\nLike INTJs, we have that hard Te shell outside but that soft Fi nougat inside. I don't like to be criticized by my higher-ups so I try to do things how they like it.

1	You can do anything you desire.  The world is mostly moronic and conceptualization is beyond them.......  Do you want to is the question....
1	I'm a ISTJ and a firm believer that ISTJs make for great managers. \nFrom my own experience, I can surmise it by the saying, "If you want it done right, do it yourself". \n\nI've been a leader at all levels of many different organizations, both professional and social (fraternity). All required a lot of work and planning but the personal reward of 'fulfilling duty', which i guess is common to ISTJs, is what got me through the rough bits. I believe that in the storm we tend to be more level headed and which allows us to be more objective in our decisions. We don't get involved in petty drama and gossip which is common for other MBTI types and can hurt organization morale. Coupled with our preference for order and structure, we can lay out a clear strategy that others can see and rally behind, even if they might be miffed by your 'cold' character. \n\nExamples of famous ISTJ leaders include: \n-george washington, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Warren Buffet, Woodrow Wilson, Jeff Bezos (http://www.celebritytypes.com/istj.php) \n\n
32	My type description for ISTJs!	Here it is!  This one was really really hard for me because I wanted to make sure I did you guys justice and got Si right, since I know it gets flubbed so much.  Please let me know what you think!\n\n***\n\nISTJ\n\nISTJs at their best are dedicated and pragmatic individuals who understand what it takes to get the job done and always put their best effort into the tasks they choose to undertake.  They are extremely knowledgeable about the inner workings of all the systems and physical relationships in the world, in large part because they have spent the time to learn how to do things right and observed how everything works and fits together.  They seem to others to have an amazing memory and are often skilled at making connections between present and past experiences or events that others miss.  That said, they often find themselves uncomfortable with change and new situations where they’re unable to draw on past experiences for clues as to how to act or interpret the situation.  Their primary interest is in developing a mental “owner’s manual” for the world, cataloging every necessary piece of information in order to become as efficient and effective as possible.\n\nISTJs believe that the best way to understand the world is to observe the collection of objective facts and analyses that humanity has accumulated over the millennia, trusting that ages of experience have whittled down methods and understanding into only the most valuable and trustworthy pieces of information.  They do not trust first impressions or subjective logic, and prefer instead to find out what works and what’s true based on the body of scientific and practical knowledge in the world.  It is important, however, for ISTJs to reflect on their own desires and beliefs about themselves and the values they hold dear, as the information you get from the outside world is not sufficient to answer every question.  ISTJs who allow themselves to explore their own feelings and values without rejecting them too quickly for being unverifiable objectively will discover, with pleasure, that doing so allows them to focus their energy and effort on ventures that bring them personal fulfillment and allow them to find meaning in their work.\n\nA young or immature ISTJ will not seek out new opportunities or adapt easily to change, and will often feel as though life is changing too fast, or the world has moved on without them.  They do not take kindly to any suggestion that the way they’re used to doing things may not be the best way, or that the perspective they’ve come to accept as fact is actually merely an erroneous opinion based on misinterpreted or inadequate evidence.\n\nHowever, as the ISTJ grows and matures, they will begin to find a balance between understanding the implications of all the experience they have accumulated in the past, and being able to see the wealth of opportunities and new perspectives that open up before them in the future.  They will become more flexible in considering their options, understanding the world not merely as a fixed object with a rigid set of rules, but also as a manipulable entity that can be shifted and adjusted at will.  They will find themselves seeking out opportunities to experience new perspectives, and will become more comfortable at listening or watching with an open mind to see if they can learn something new.  That said, ISTJs will always be more reliable and effective than most other types, making sure that things get done the right way and that they and other people are making judgments and decisions based on the best information possible, rarely allowing passing whims to sidetrack them from the essential task at hand.\n\nMature ISTJs are very good at taking objectively accepted facts and analyzing or evaluating them to judge whether they are logically consistent and accurate - whether they actually ‘make sense’ to them - given the other propositions that they hold to be true, but they often do not find much pleasure or gratification in engaging with this ability unless it’s in service of some larger goal or in order to help someone they care about.  Because they are so focused on noticing patterns and forming conclusions based on how things have worked in the past for them, they resist efforts to interpret each individual situation anew, drinking in the details of the world around them and watching for changes or novel stimuli without immediately comparing them to similar situations from their past.  However, when they are sufficiently motivated, they are very skilled at performing this kind of observation, and those who allow themselves to practice this skill will find it to be very useful when they are faced with new situations or required to act quickly and reflexively.\n\nISTJs do not enjoy navigating the complex world of human interaction, and will often find themselves confused or annoyed with other people’s emotional expression and social expectations.  They often prefer to ask for advice or information from someone whose skills in these areas they trust to help them process and solve these sorts of issues.  That said, they are capable of doing it - begrudgingly - when no help is available.  ISTJs find it very difficult to make predictions about which possible outcome of a situation is most *likely* and which perspective is most *correct* when they do not have relevant experience or objective information to refer to.  Although they may, with much determination, be capable of developing a grand, ambitious vision for an unknown future endeavor, it is not where they thrive.  They prefer to work hard at improving and developing concrete goals where success or failure are measurable and predictable.\n\nTo summarize, ISTJs are grounded and effective individuals who seek to understand the inner workings of the world in order to achieve their goals and keep their lives and the lives of those they care about running smoothly.  They do so by observing the consequences of their past actions and activities as well as by seeking out and absorbing the wealth of knowledge available to them from the outside world.  When they balance these skills with a nod toward their own personal values and desires as well as an awareness of the new possibilities and perspectives that can be discovered, they can be extraordinarily successful and effective individuals, performing great feats of accomplishment through hard work and sheer determination that leave the rest of the world marveling in awe.
5	I actually ended up being typed as an ISTJ through a video-chat (still chewing on it). This is one of the few descriptions on the internet that does not make me feel slightly ill, and that leaves room to feel any kind of proud or dignified ownership of the label! So thank you!
3	Nice!
2	Love it - thanks so much for doing this :)
6	ISTJs/enneagram 2 - thoughts?	INFJ here, very casually internally speculating on the enneagram type of an ISTJ in my life (who I think is quite wonderful, BTW). Got to wondering how someone might differentiate between the "doing things as a way to show care" ISTJ approach on one hand, and the service orientation of an enneagram 2 on the other. If that makes any sense.\n\nThoughts, anyone?\n\n*PS Based on my experience so far, I really really like how ISTJs do things from that Si-Te-Fi-Ne stack of yours. I don't want to overgeneralize, but just so you know, I have tons of respect for ISTJs at this point.*
3	I'm an ISTJ who is a 1w9. 
3	I think there are a lot of traits of E2 that conflict with suppressed Fi; Sentimental, Flattering, Empathetic - For an E type based on showing love, friendliness, I think it would conflict with the nature of ISTJ.
2	[deleted]
2	I've heard the term "enneagram" tossed around the forums before, but I'm not at all familiar with it.  I just took a test I found on Google and scored my highest on Type 1 and 4 (tie at 7 points) and got second place for Type 2 (6 points).  Seeing as I'm entirely ignorant about enneagram tests, I can't really put forth many thoughts on your ISTJs results, but I wouldn't say it's impossible to have someone with both Type 2 and ISTJ.  :) Like you said in another comment, the human mind has many layers.

6	It's like they're inside my mind.
4	This would require me to talk to women first. I don't think I can do that. 
3	Awww. Don't worry, ISTJs are good people, it'll work out. I think you guys do best friending someone first and then progressing into a relationship. I think you have to find someone with similar interests, goals, and that you feel you can be yourself around.
3	Not a bad list, but all of those are coming from a negative reference point. \n\nSo anyone reading this needs and feeling like it hits close to home, needs to do deeper work. \n\nSource- ISTJ PUA life/dating coach for 10+ years

14	The ISTJ (MBTI) "Get to know each other" survey RESULTS!	Hi ISTJ's. Hopefully you took/saw the survey I posted a few days ago with the same title. Now that over 1400 people have responded, and as requested by many, I have created a Type-by-Type breakdown from the survey. There are some interesting data points in there! Here's the link:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6QOC_Qv3MTnNGdtbTJidXRpWmM/view?usp=sharing
2	thank you for the recap.  that was awesome.
2	ENTJ's are all over the place
9	ISTJ, what is your experience with ESFPs?	A curious ESFP female here, who is interested in an ISTJ male.
6	They are very opposite in a lot of ways. They can talk BS for hours. They can be very nontraditionalists. They are quick witted. They are easily bored and constantly seeking stimulation. I know that I can feel overwhelmed by their personality. 
3	My sister is an ESFP. We can butt heads at times (mostly when she becomes too overwhelming for me), but we generally get along very well. She has an amazing sense of humor and can always make me laugh. Sometimes I just wish she would just try to be punctual.
3	Married to one. We are a pretty good pair. Our extreme differences in personality cause issues at times, but over all we have a perfect balance.
3	My dad is one! We've always gotten along real well.  Definitely always had a strong mutual respect and understanding.  He's a bit sloppy and disorganized for my tastes, but he's super caring and hard working and lots of fun so I love him dearly anyway!  I would be pleased as punch if I married someone like him.\nETA: Also, he reaaaaaallly sucks at handling his money.  That annoys me, but then again, his wallet isn't mine so... 
2	Annoying and dumb as hell. They can talk shit for days and don't even stop. Sometimes when they start talking it feels like every brain cell in my head dies one after another.
1	Most of my best friends are E class. I like that when I can't keep up with the somewhat BS banter they still enjoy having me there. But this is a small group that I've gotten to know really well over many years. Given that I'm the more quiet of the group I can empathize with new people at parties who don't know anybody either. Given that ISTJ's love to ask questions, this helps involve more people theres at parties. Where it's an issue is when there are more people i dont know than i do know. Uphill challenge to schmooze the room. ALong those lines I'd appreciate if someone else were curious about me and asked me questions. In terms of relationships I'm still figuring out how to appeal to E-types like yourself. Often I feel like I'm competing with all fo th other E-types for attention. So ultimately if you want to win big with ISTJ's, you have to commit and invest. We notice and will return the kindness 5 fold

19	The ISTJ (MBTI) "Get to know each other" survey!	Hello! Your local INTP created a survey a couple of days ago, and now with over 1000 responses, ISTJ only has 5!\n\nI'm hoping some more of you are willing to take this 5 to 10 minute survey. It's a fun survey ranging from Love to Politics to Music. You will get instant results that compare you against all other types, and a type by type breakdown will be posted in the next few days.\n\nHere's the link! \nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/12gqhsqGBfu8BbRKYBg0TcMww9tUWMS-gTPY2gNTn7jA/viewform\n\nEdit: SURVEY WILL CLOSE AT 3PM CENTRAL USA TIME MARCH 1ST, 2016
3	That was fun. My wisdom was "Everybody's lives are just as complicated as your's.
2	....reading the answers to some of the questions afterwards is... unique.  Yes, unique.\n\n.\n\n[SPOILER]I love how some of the answers to "Unfortunately, for a reason not relevant to this question, half the world population has to be exterminated and you are the one to choose. How do you make your decision?" say 'I'm not an ISTJ'.[/SPOILER]\n\n.
2	I was confused with the Friends/Career/Family/Hobbies/Education question... I have friends that are like family, and family that I'm estranged with. Does career mean financial security, or just how much I value my career path, ie being a workaholic? Does education mean intelligence in general or formal education, and if it's the latter is it up to a certain level of education?\n\n(I'm sure if I thought long enough about it I'd find a way to be confused about hobbies as well :D)
6	When will an ISTJ guy finally admit he likes a girl?	We are both ISTJ and I'm pretty sure he likes me. We have a bunch of classes together and I'm the only person he ever talks to or looks happy around. He's always trying to make me laugh, helping me out, complementing my art, remembers details I've said before, makes eye contact, listens intently to me, sometimes awkward and blushes, etc.\nBut after class he says see ya and leaves immediately. I'd like to do stuff out of class or eat lunch with him or something. We've worked on homework together outside of class but that's it. I tried giving him my number but continued only messaging through school email. (we're in college btw)\n\nWhen does an ISTJ guy finally ask out a girl or admit he likes her? or will he wait for me to make a move?
30	In about thirty years from now.
13	If you want to make it easy on yourself, just say you really enjoy his company and ask directly if he thinks dating is something he is interested in. 
12	Well, if you are truly an ISTJ like you said you were, then you should know that he will never admit that he likes you unless he knows that you like him. \n\nThat's why ISTJ only relationships are super rare. We are too passive to pursue eachother. 
10	An ISTJ needs a definite sign that the other person is interested.  This sign generally requires a literal "Hey do you want to do a date night at [restaurant]?".  \n\nMost ISTJs don't go randomly asking people out hoping for one to stick.  They have to get to know the person and get a concrete idea that the other person has the same feelings. 
6	I'm an ISTJ, and in a normal scenario I will never announce if I like someone unless it is entirely clear to me without the shadow of a doubt that the other person likes me.\n\nThat being said, when provoked, (IE: Someone being aware that I like someone and stating that they will tell them and/or not knowing whether someone who found out will tell them), I will always take action and tell the person myself. I would much rather someone find something out about me from me than from someone else.\n\nThis is essentially what happened with my now husband. Someone asked me if I liked him, I didn't trust them or their friends not to tell him... so I did. It went something like this.\n\n"This came up between friends and I didn't want you to hear it from anyone else. I'm into you. If you're into me, awesome, if not, at least you know this isn't a rumor. "
5	I'm an istj that is married to an intp who I think is an even shyer mbti. I asked him out because I knew he liked me because we hung out a lot alone and I knew he'd never had the balls to ask me out. We've been together 9 years and very happy. I like to tease him and say we probably would have never ended up together had I not made the first move. It was worth the awkward start of our relationship.
3	I'm an ISTJ and in a relationship of almost 2 years. The way that my current girlfriend got me to ask her out was giving lots of hints because if not, I would have waited forever until she took the first move. I liked her but I knew I wouldn't ask her out unless I was pretty sure she had liked me back. So, I would pick up on these hints from things she would do or say until I finally had enough proof for myself that she liked me and asked her out. \n\nSo basically, an ISTJ guy will wait for her to make a move or until he is sure the girl likes him from enough evidence.
3	It took me a long time to grow out of that stage, in college I only went out with girls who obviously liked me and snubbed a few shy girls only to find out months later that they were much more into me than the party girls. I don't mind making the first move in a casual situation (bars, party) but still probably won't be overtly infatuated. If we get along and enjoy each other's company one-on-one then it's safe to say I like her.
3	As an ISTJ guy, probably never. I have had a massive crush on a girl now for 3 years. We get along really we, talk all the time, and I've literally talked to people about asking her out. I've had her freinds tell me she likes me too, but whenever I actually think about saying something to her, I just can't do it.
2	I (ESFP) just started talking to an ISTJ guy and after reading this post and the comments, I just realised I do most of the initiating. But I don't mind though. On our first date he said I have a way of bringing out stuff in him as he doesn't open up easily. \n\nWe were talking for a while before I said 'hey we should do this.. text me on..' I don't think he would have said anything otherwise. 
2	He is interested but if he likes you I doubt he is brave enough to make the first move. Although it would go faster if you made the first move it might not be suitable in your circumstances. On another topic... you say you are ISTJ but I've never heard of an artist ISTJ, thats weird.
7	Is it common for us ISTJs to rub each other up the wrong way? Or would that come from something else?	
3	Could be where we ISTJ's like to control and plan everything, we can get upset with someone else wanting to take those roles.
2	Not really good examples, but my mother tested as an ISTJ and I don't have a good relationship with her. I have a somewhat ambivert ESTJ coworker and our stubbornness occasionally gets in the way of getting along. I don't really have an answer so I'd be interested to hear if anybody else has an explanation or any ideas on this. 
2	Definitely possible to butt heads with another ISTJ because one of our hallmark characteristics is our stubbornness, which is to say how we perceive our reality is how things "should be" and anything that deviates from what we expect our reality to be, aka someone challenging our perception (say...from another stubborn ISTJ,) will cause us to feel all sorts of flustered.  Though, I think ISTJ's can appreciate each other and where we are coming from (since everything is usually laid out very logically, and unemotionally,) but in terms of attraction, as an ISTJ guy, ISTJ (maybe SJ's in general) girls kind of bore me.  \n\nIt's off topic and all but, it's not to say they aren't great people, and we can definitely appreciate (especially if we have shared values,) but I tend to be attracted to a girl that helps develop my shortcomings (Fi, for example,) and vice versa.  I have a soft spot for INFPs (our processes are identical except in the reverse, Fi, Ne, Si, Te vs Si, Te, Fi, Ne).  Feels like their strengths are my weaknesses and vice versa, and the ones I've met have been wonderful at getting me to be less stubborn, more receptive to other possibilities.
1	I do think it's pretty common for ISTJs (or any SJ types in general) to rub each other the wrong way. Si is sort of like having a mental map of the way things are "supposed to be" which is subjective to the specific individual's preference. You have two ISTJs (or an ISTJ and an ESTJ, ISTJ and ISFJ, etc.) which different Si maps and there is going to be a lot of friction in terms of the way things are "supposed" to be done or the way things are "supposed" to look. 
7	Differences between ISTP and ISTJ?	Like I said. What are some of the main differences between ISTPs and ISTJs? How does that single letter change affect a personality?
7	I hate spontaneity. When a friend asks me "Hey, do you wanna go out with a bunch of friends?", the first thing I do is ask:\n\nWhat time? What place? Doing what?\n\nThe "P" means the person is more likely to accept the unknown and deal with change as it comes. As an ISTJ, I feel very uneasy when I don't have things meticulously planned out. \n\nSame thing with group projects. If I'm working together with someone else, it eases me when we actually plan things out, rather than procrastinate.
5	If someone told an ISTJ and an ISTP that they were both going to learn how to ride a motorcycle the next day, they would react differently. The ISTJ would be in a panic, trying to find all he could on the internet about riding, advice for beginners, tips and tricks, safety laws, etc. There is nothing worse for an ISTJ than going into an unfamiliar situation completely blind. The ISTP, on the other hand, would just say "cool" and go back to whatever it was he was doing and wing it the next day. New experiences are not a big deal for the ISTP. 
5	Can someone explain what inf Ne is like?	I highly doubt that I'm any sort of IxxJ type, but to further my understanding I'd like to know what inferior Ne is like. I have a satisfactory (for now) amount of info on Si, so I want to see the other side of the coin.\n\nI know an ISFJ who actually panicked and asked a random person to save her seat after I said I wouldn't (as a joke). This seems like it could be over the top inferior Ne.
11	A good word for the manifestation of inferior Ne is "catastrophizing". ISTJ's will tend to worry about the future and see endless possibilities as to what could go wrong when caught in the grip of Ne. Ne's ability to think of random events can be intimidating to the ISTJ (how can we plan for future events in we don't know what's coming?) and can ultimately cause ISTJ's to lash out in an attempt to regain control of their lives.\n\nHere's an example of what an Ne episode is like from a personal standpoint:\n\nLet's say I'm planning on going out to dinner with a friend. We're meeting at the restaurant at 6:30 and going to see a 9:00 movie afterwards. I arrive at the restaurant at 6:30 sharp (typical ISTJ) and notice that my friend is not there yet. *Heh, late as usual* I say to myself to keep the negative thoughts out of my head.\n\n5 minutes pass. Then 10. I send my friend a "You on your way?" text for comfort.\n\nIt's 7:00pm and my friend has yet to arrive or respond to my text. Inferior Ne kicks in. *Why isn't he here yet? We're gonna miss the movie! Did he get in a car accident? Did he try to check his phone while driving after I texted him? Or maybe he's blowing me off? He did have a lame excuse for not going to the game last week...he definitely doesn't want to be friends anymore, etc*\n\nYou can see how ridiculous and irrational these thoughts can become, when in reality my friend was just stuck in traffic and his phone had died. The reason these thoughts cause such a strong effect (in my opinion) is that ISTJ's inner monologue takes everything literally and thus can't distinguish Ne's random suggestions from reality. Then the terrible situation that you've created in your head *becomes* reality and you try so hard to fix the problem and make the "unknown" known that you end up making reckless decisions.\n\nThis ended up way longer than I meant for it to haha but as you can see I've had my fair share of "in the grip" moments.\n\nTL;DR: Inferior Ne causes ISXJ's to think of all the bad things that could happen and then tries to prepare for/fix these future catastrophes by making reckless decisions.
2	My Ne generally takes the form of anxiety. It gives me a bunch of "what if" scenarios, all negative. On the plus side it helps feed my imagination.
3	Do you play Dota2? Looking for someone to play with.	Yeah.. I know it's weird to ask. But yeah.. I'm looking for someone to play Dota 2 with, as a ENFP. 
2	I'm an ISTJ who plays Dota 2. I'm a very casual player and played exclusively Riki for a long time, took a long break, and am having fun with Legion in the jungle. My team MMR is around 2400, and I don't play solo queue ranked. You're welcome to play with me but I'm definitely a one-hero type of player who doesn't take the game too seriously. PM me for my steam name if you're interested. I love ENFPs, we'd probably get along great. 
1	Sorry, I haven't played DOTA :/
11	Functions	**Dominant Si (ISXJ)**: I know how this works, how it was last week, and how I want it to be in the future. If knitting in that way helped the other person to create that scarf, I feel sure that I can do the same thing by learning the same stitch. I feel happiest when I hold tight to the things that are truly important and lasting in life, such as family, friends, and often, my faith. I find that interesting, but it doesn’t match my memories of what happened. Can you give me more details, so I can decide whether or not to accept it? I know if something or someone is different from how they used to be, and can tell you exactly what has altered. I highly value my past experiences, and find it hard to forget or move past things. I really love participating in local events, family traditions, and cultural things, because it makes me feel like I am part of a living past. I enjoy routine and like things to be predictable.\n\n**Auxiliary Te (IXTJ)**: This isn’t working right, so let’s talk about how to fix it, and I’ll correct it. I know how long this task will take; I am currently on step four and will be finished in another hour, if you want to come get it. I am following the plan, from Point A to Point B. These are the steps you need to take to accomplish your goals. I am totally comfortable with word counts, hour limits, and deadlines, and have no problem meeting them. I can organize my time to accomplish everything I want to accomplish in a day. Here’s your shopping list. Give me the information and come back in an hour; I will categorize it into an easy to follow format so that everyone knows where we are in the project and what is expected of them. I have no problem controlling my impulses and putting aside my emotions to get things done.\n\n**Tertiary Fi (IXTJ)**: I put a lot of time and energy into activities that are important to me. I want those activities to be meaningful in some way—I want to volunteer, learn to teach others, apply my knowledge, or write on important social issues. I have a strong sense of what is good or bad. I want things to come out right, and will work toward that end. I am loyal to a few causes and people, because my time is valuable so I prioritize. I choose what beliefs feel the most authentic to me. I compare all my decisions against my strong beliefs of right and wrong.\n\n**Inferior Ne (ISXJ)**: I know that these two things are connected, but I’m not sure how. I’m sorry, but that idea is completely unrealistic. Can we stick to one idea, please? Hmm, the last time I thought something might happen, it happened; so maybe I can trust my intuition this time, too.\n\nSource: http://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/cognitivefunctions

5	ENTJxISTJ relationship advice/tips/experiences/opinions?	I am an ENTJ guy and I have been friends with an ISTJ girl for almost a year now. \n\nIn the beginning, I didn't really notice her that much, because other extroverts are typically more attention grabbing than shyer introverts. However, I did notice small things about her that I really desire and she did eventually manage to melt my stone cold heart, which makes things problematic for me. I generally dislike giving anyone that I don't (almost completely) trust any leverage on me, but I trusted her enough to reveal my feelings to her.\n\nAs per the advice on ISTJs, she just withdrew for days from me, ignoring any communication from me. However, she eventually told me that she only saw me as a friend (which I didn't really expect, considering some of the things that she did), but she was willing to pursue more after our major exams were over (at which I asked her out for a date after the exams and she agreed).\n\nWe agreed to keep things "platonic" at least until we can both successfully complete our examinations. I am perfectly capable of holding myself back, but this just seems like we are in a limbo between platonic and romantic, and I keep getting the urge to grow and strengthen the relationship. Both of us are quite inexperienced in terms of romantic relationships and we spend ~20 minutes every weekday morning together in school (usually alone).\n\nPlease, please, please do share your advice or past experiences or opinions on ISTJ relationship dynamics. I'm at wits' end as I have practically zero prior experience (in both the romantic department, as well as with ISTJs) and all I'm running on is charisma. I really need the advice or experiences of any veterans out there.\n\nTL;DR: Complicated relationship between ENTJ male and ISTJ female. Help needed by ENTJ male in order to remain in the good books of ISTJ female and other options to build on the current relationship.\n\nThanks  ^.^ 
6	[deleted]
2	I'm an ISTJ male married to an ENTJ male.\n\nMy main piece of advice is "don't rush it." \n\nMy ENTJ likes to push me into new things, and while that's good when it comes to cuisine and travel, it's bad when it comes to my feelings. \n\nBecause of tertiary Fi, ISTJs will tend to keep their feelings hidden. We're aware of them and (often) understand them, but we usually don't want people to see them, and we don't always want to deal with them. \n\nIf I was in your ISTJs place, that would be the explanation for my tactic of asking to reassess the relationship after exams. A relationship would require a major commitment of time and attention, which is a distraction from that critical time. I'd prefer to put off the discussion, too. \n\nI think your flirty jokes are a good way of letting her know that you're still interested. Sensors tend to find these kinds of reminders helpful. \n\nOtherwise, just wait for her to let you know. Many ISTJs don't like people prying into their lives (no matter who it is) but will gladly open up once they've had enough experiences with a person (Si).
2	ENTJ male, be yourself, it takes or annoys imo.  I'd like to meet an ISTJ someday but presently, I'm knee deep in strippers :)
11	ISTJs and Depression	I just got off the phone with my mother who has told me my brother is suffering from suicidal thoughts.  He's just getting started with therapy and medication.  I have struggled with depression since I was 13, and have been on and off medication for years now.  Currently "depression free" at the moment.  My mother told my brother to contact me, as I have been there and can relate.  The thing is, I'm honestly not sure that I can.  I'm an INFP, and I'm really not at all sure how similar depression looks for these types.  If he decides to reach out to me, though, I want to be prepared.  \n\n**A little background on my brother:** \n\nHe's not great at showing his feelings and usually resorts to sarcasm if he has to express anything remotely emotional, even gratitude.  Honestly, every other word out of his mouth is sarcastic, and if you're not sure, it's better to err on the side of sarcasm.  On the rare occurrences that he does shoot straight about his emotions, he tends to be very matter-of-fact and downplay the significance of whatever he's saying.  Again, he'll usually end his emotional opening-up with a joke or more sarcasm.\n\n**I think he may have anxiety issues** (anxiety is not something I have ever suffered from and cannot relate here).  Reasons:\n\n* When we were kids (around 9 and 10), he did something that made me mad so I ransacked his room.  He told my parents that he thought robbers had torn his room apart.  After that, he started sleeping on the floor of our little brother's bedroom.  He did this for months before returning back to his room.  \n\n* In high school, he got my mother to write him out of any public speaking assignments.  In college, he chose a failing grade on public speaking assignments rather than face the discomfort.  Our little brother wanted him to be the best man at his wedding, but he refused because he didn't want to have to give the best man's speech.\n\n* The longest he has lived away from home was a semester in college.  He decided he didn't like it and moved back home (he never elaborated as to why, except saying he didn't get along with his roommate).  \n\n* He has never had a girlfriend.  He goes to the gym everyday and is a reasonably attractive guy, and has made an effort to ask girls out.  But I've noticed that he has a tendency to use sardonic sarcasm with women, which I believe is a defense mechanism to lessen the blow should he get rejected.  This seems to eliminate him from ever getting a chance in the first place, though.  That, and he is also just naturally shy.  \n\n* He has also never had a job.  This may be in part due to the fact that he is the primary caretaker of our mother, who has MS.  However, although our mother is ill, she is still mobile and can do many basic things for herself (bathing, eating, dressing, walking).  He mainly does the stuff that is too labor intensive for her, such as cooking, cleaning, and driving her to her many doctors appointments.  He could very well get a job and our mother could hire caretaker without it being invasive for her.  \n\n**In Summary (not really a TL;DR)**\nI think the depression may now be catching up with him since he is the only child still living at home.  Our little brother moved out of the house last year after he got married.  His best friend got married a few months ago.  I am soon to be engaged.  I think he sees the loved ones around growing up and reaching traditional "adulthood" milestones while he isn't.  Being a traditionalist himself, I think this is weighing on him.  But he is so encumbered by these issues that I think are anxiety related, that he can't seem reach the adulthood he desires for himself.  It's strange, too, because if you hadn't grown up with him, he would seem perfectly well adjusted to you.\n\nMy heart breaks for him because he is an amazing person and doesn't deserve to feel this way.  During my own struggles with depression he is the person who helped me the most.  I have to be there for him because he was there for me.  I just don't know how.
9	While I would agree with a lot of this, I strongly disagree on two points. The idea that we don't have emotions is ridiculous. We do have very strong emotions but we process them logically. We quantify them instead of expressing them. Any self expression is usually a conscious effort. \n\nIt's also ridiculous to assume that we don't need help and support. It's true that we tend to be independent and value self-reliance, but everyone needs friends. Depressed people especially. \n\nOP, if I had to guess, I'd say your brother feels disconnected with the world. Taking care of your mother almost certainly is fulfilling for him (ISTJs like to fill roles like that), but he probably feels stagnant and behind his peers in those adulthood milestones you mentioned. As someone who dealt with depression I'm sure you know: he just needs a friend. He's sarcastic, sure, but it's a defense mechanism. He has anxiety issues and probably trust issues as well. He feels vulnerable when he opens up, and so he masks it or deflects it. The only thing you can do is be there for him. It's up to him to learn to trust people and gain confidence.  
4	Looking at your description of your brother- Yeah, no doubt he is an ISTJ.\n\nWe do have anxiety issues. We're some of the most extreme of the introverts. Like you said, "traditionalist," is a trait of ISTJ's. He came back home, doesn't get a job, and stays at home, because of this attitude. Dragging us ANYWHERE out of what we are used to gives us tremors of anxiety. I, personally, have to rehearse every possible conversation before I have it. Like you said, we are practical as well, very hyper logic based. If you think about it logically, he is making the logical step staying at home because he doesn't have to pay 1.) rent(maybe) 2.) food 3.) any bills. As well as showing our feelings- we don't really have any. As soon as anything emotional rises up, we once again think logically. Why are we feeling this way and what can we do about it to not feel this way? That's the thing, we don't need support because of our independence. We supply our own. You want to know how you can help your ISTJ brother? You don't. \n\nAs well as your theory on how he's seeing his loved ones growing up and reaching adulthood and that this is weighing on him? He doesn't care.
12	10 ISTJs Explain Exactly How To Win Over Their Type	
7	Really? doesn't like swearing?! I feel uncomfortable if I can't swear around someone. 
5	>I don’t appreciate phoney grand gestures or disingenuous small talk.\n\nThey had me at #1 :)
2	True story
2	8 is a lie. I may not swear or be crass, but it's hysterical. I forget the second half of the point. 
1	On point.
9	"Solitude isn't being alone, it's being unable to express what matters the most to you" ... what haven't you been able to express of late?	For me, it's a profound (platonic) love and a tide of good wishes for my students. Especially the ones that graduate and leave.
4	How grateful I am for all the people in my life. It's really difficult to put those feelings into words sometimes.
3	Solitude *does not* mean "being unable to express what matters the most to you"\n\nI suspect you're not an ISTJ, otherwise you'd understand the meaning of such a precious word.
2	Nothing, I personally disagree with the quote. 
1	Feelings in general
1	False. I would argue the complete opposite. Solitude is comfort to freely express yourself.
5	[Master Personality Typology Survey] I'm conducting a survey to analyze correlations between popular personality typologies, and I need a lot more ISTJs in it!	
1	RemindMe! 6 hours
1	The list of acronyms for the Big 5 in the survey doesn't match my result at all:\n\nExtroversion |||| 20% \nOrderliness |||||||||||||||||||| 86% \nEmotional Stability |||||||||||||| 54% \nAccommodation |||||||||| 32% \nInquisitiveness |||||||||||||| 60% \n\n 
12	ISTJ males, how long does a crush last for you?	I'm an ISTJ girl and my crushes can last up to months and I never talk to them. lol\n\nBut now, there's an ISTJ guy who has a crush on me but I'm slow at getting courage to talk to him more. I'm worried he will give up and lose interest if I don't act quickly enough. \n\nDo you usually move on from crushes quickly or does it last a while?
38	Years. Painful years. 
11	I don't often find anyone really truly attractive. But when I do finally find someone, usually after many months/years of getting to know them, it takes a long time to shake. I estimate it lasts about twice as long as I've known them to shake it.\n\nThis can be a problem when sometimes I know we very probably wouldn't work out as a couple.\n\nCurrently I'm attracted to my best friend who moved to Germany over a year ago and of which I've known for 9 years. How fucking pointless.
10	Pretty much what these other guys are saying. Once we like someone, it lasts for a LONG time.
3	Four years sounds about right.   I don't ever want to have crush again, ain't nobody got time for that.
3	[deleted]
2	I still have a crush on the same girl I knew from preschool through high school.  We graduated 12 years ago.
2	[deleted]
1	What is this thing you talk about... This *crush*¿
1	Fell in love with a girl when i was 11. Waited until I was 13 to ask her out. Waited until we were 20 to propose. We're still together and she was my first. She's INFJ, so we both enjoy some stability and traditionalism. It's a pretty good situation, and I can reasonably say my infatuation lasted for... a while.
1	it lasts a while
1	~2 Years
1	I've had a crush on one girl for 3 years now. I do actually talk to her, but I have trouble telling her I like her. I always end up friendzoning myself because we become friends and then it is too award to tell a girl you like her. The problem is I don't really get a crush on a girl that I don't know anything about, so I have to get to know them. It's a vicious cycle.
1	Hmm, this brings up a story that you might find interesting. This story takes a couple of paragraphs to warm up, but it's something I need to get off my chest anyway.\n\nI met a girl *once*. She initially looked like a girl that I graduated high school with(Very hot blonde). I was at a party so everyone was in the pool while I was hanging out eating. As she walks past me I make a comment "Excuse me, are you, by chance, related to ______________?" \n\n"...No."\n\nShe said this as if she regarded me as weird for asking her this question. I was like, ok, whatever bitch. But, she ended up coming back after like 30 seconds and we talked for like 4 hours together alone. In this time she practically told me her life story (Like some really personal shit such as there being a hit on her family so she has a body guard that follows her around everywhere and how she was suicidal her freshman year) Everyone noticed how we were "clicking" as they put it. I got her number and asked her out. \n\nHowever, she made it clear that she had super strict police parents(literally) and that dating someone 2 years older than her wouldn't fly with them, but she was totally on board with being friends and doing fun shit together. I ended up asking her to go to lunch with me and two other mutual friends. \n\nWe went and we hung out all day at a local farm/park thing and that was the last time that I saw her. She texted me several times, the last time occurred October of 2014... And ever since I can't get her out of my fucking head. \n\nEvery second of everyday I would think about her. "If she were here, what would I do?" "If I make this decision, what would she think?" "What would SHE do if she was here?" It was nothing short of neurotic. Eventually, and I'm talking after 6 months it went down to about once an hour, and now about once a day. However, it's more than 18 months since she last saw me. Now, I would never hurt her of stalk her. I don't even know where she lives, fuck, I don't *want* to know where she lives. I have her phone number and could probably text her at any time, but at this point I feel like it would be unhealthy. I do check her out on her instagram and twitter everyone once in a while but... It's just strange. \n\nI don't know why I was this obsessed with her. She was so charismatic that it hurt, no matter where she was, she was the center of attention *and she didn't even try*. Or maybe she did try, I'm not sure. It was like every *single* *word* was plotted so that she would have immediate likability in any group of people that was in the middle of. It was *scary*. I talked with several of her mutual friends that claim very sociopathic behavior from her when you get to really know her, so maybe that was it? \n\nI know that this is a text wall, but I feel like if I tell people about it to get their opinions it would help me get over her. \n\nAlso, to see if ISTJ's have ever been secretively obsessed like this. Because who knows, this might (fingers crossed) be an ISTJ thing. 
2	Why the Myers-Briggs test is totally meaningless	
8	The whole article contradicts itself.\n\nThe Myer Briggs test is based off of Jung's work. Which is based off of the idea that every person falls into catagories *most of the time*. The article even says this. Therefore, Myer Briggs isnt "meaningless" because it does what it intends, to put everyone into categories that their personalities fall under *most of the time*.
4	I would like to say that regardless of whether it is meaningless or not, it still put's you in a category that will fit you the most. And the things that you can learn from the type descriptions etc. can be a huge deal to some people who want to try and understand themselves more. At least to me it was, it's a lot of things that confirm how you are and they give you a lot to then think about. They truly open your mind up to thinking about yourself a lot. So to me, it's definitely meaningful.
11	Master Personality Typology Survey	eilamona over on Tumblr has created an MBTI survey. Her goal is to get at least 100 responses for each type so she can analyze correlations, and of course some types are more prevalent than others. Please participate if you can.\n\nYou can read her post here: http://eilamona.com/post/138933926938/master-personality-typology-survey\n\nSurvey itself is here: http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2577790/Master-Personality-Typology-Survey
0	T-shirt "Sorry I can't right now I'm busy introverting"	
7	My favorite introvert shirt says, ["Sorry I'm late. I didn't want to come."](http://www.thuglifeshirts.com/products/sorry-im-late) 
4	I'd wear it all the time. No one would ever see it.
8	Extroverts too have problems in an introvert dominated environment	I am sorry if this sounds beyond obvious, but I just came to the realization that extroverts too have problems in enviroments dominated by introverts.\n\nFor example, my home environment is introvert dominated, in which my mom is the only extrovert - and just yesterday I noted that how much bad time she gets just because she wants to hangout/talk more with us and other friends in comparison to us.\n\nJust sharing - can't imagine what kind of replies I am going to get for this one :-P\n
6	The extroverts in my life can get so uncomfortable and awkward when left alone with my quiet anxiety. They truly struggle with my struggle to be as talkative and social as they're used to.
3	Huh, never considered it. I wonder if they feel the same way when we're at a party. But... When they are in a quiet environment.
3	Totally agree. My house is three introverts and a four year old extrovert. I try so hard to be understanding of her personality and to let her shine, but OH MY GOD, sometimes I just want to die when she WON'T STOP TALKING. And then I snap at her and feel like shit. And she just keeps on talking. 
2	I understand that and have a first hand experience.  But what am I supposed to do about that?  I am entitled to have a quiet and peaceful life and not to have to go out of my way just to entertain anybody.
2	I'm an infj and I'm an ambivert, my house is full of introverts. Sometimes I just want to hang out/talk/goof off but everyone's too busy being alone. :P But it's better than being overwhelmed by a group of loud extroverts.
